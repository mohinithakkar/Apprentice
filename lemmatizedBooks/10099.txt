produce by jonathan ingram ginny brewer and pg distribute proofreader towards the goal by mr humphry ward author of england 's effort etc with a introduction by the hon theodore roosevelt 1917 to andré chevrillon true son of france true friend of england i dedicate this book introduction england have in this war reach a height of achievement loftier than that which she attain in the struggle with napoleon and she have reach that height in a far shorter period she giant effort crown with a success as wonderful as the effort itself be worthily describe by the author of this book mr ward write nobly on a noble theme this war be the greatest the world have ever see the vast size of the army the tremendous slaughter the loftiness of the heroism show and the hideous horror of the brutality commit the valor of the fight man and the extraordinary ingenuity of those who have design and build the fight machine the burning patriotism of the people who defend they hearthstone and the far-reaching complexity of the plan of the leader -- all be on a scale so huge that nothing in past history can be compare with they the issue at stake be elemental the free people of the world have band together against tyrannous militarism and government by caste it be not too much to say that the outcome will largely determine for daring and liberty-loving soul whether or not life be worth live a prussianised world would be as intolerable as a world rule over by attilum or by timur the lame it be in this immense world-crisis that england have play she part a part which have grow greater month by month mr ward enable we to see the awakening of the national soul which render it possible to play this part and she describe the work by which the faith of the soul justified itself what she write be of peculiar interest to the united state we have suffer or be suffer in exaggerated form from most -lrb- not all -rrb- of the evil that be eat into the fiber of the british character three year ago -- and in addition from some purely indigenous ill of we own if we be to cure ourselves it must be by we own exertion we destiny will certainly not be shape for we as be germany 's by a few towering autocrat of genius such as bismarck and moltke mr ward show we the people of england in the act of cure they own ill of make good by gigantic and self-sacrificing exertion in the present the folly and selfishness and greed and soft slackness of the past the fact that england when on the brink of destruction gather she strength and stride resolutely back to safety be a fact of happy omen for we in america who be now just awake to the folly and selfishness and greed and soft slackness that for some year we have be show as in america so in england a surfeit of materialism have produce a lack of high spiritual purpose in the nation at large there be much confusion of idea and ideal and also much triviality which be especially offensive when it masquerade under some high-sounding name a unhealthy sentimentality -- the antithesis of morality -- have go hand in hand with a peculiarly sordid and repulsive materialism the result be a soil in which various noxious weed flourish rankly and of these the most noxious be professional pacificism the professional pacificist have at time fester in the diseased tissue of almost every civilisation but it be only within the last three-quarter of a century that he have be a serious menace to the peace of justice and righteousness in consequence decent citizen be only begin to understand the base immorality of he preaching and practice and he have be give entirely undeserved credit for good intention in england as in the united state domestic pacificism have be the most potent ally of alien militarism and in both country the extreme type have show itself profoundly unpatriotic the damage it have do the nation have be limit only by its weakness and folly those who have profess it have serve the devil to the full extent which they limited power permit there be in england -- just as there be now in america -- even worse foe to national honor and efficiency greed and selfishness among capitalist and among labor leader have to be grapple with the sordid baseness which see in the war only a chance for additional money profit to the employer be almost match by the fierce selfishness which refuse to consider a strike from any but the standpoint of the striker but the chief obstacle to be encounter in rousing england be sheer short-sightedness a considerable time elapse before it be possible to make the people understand that this be a people 's war that it be a matter of vital personal concern to the people as a whole and to all individual as individual in america we be now encounter much the same difficulty due to much the same cause in england the most essential thing to be do be to wake the people to they need and to guide they in meet the need the next most essential be to show to they and to the people in friendly land whether ally or neutral how the task be do and this both as a reason for just pride in what have be achieve and as a inspiration to further effort mr ward 's book -- she former book and she present one -- accomplish both purpose every american who read the present volume must feel a hearty and profound respect for the patriotism energy and efficiency show by the british people when they become awake to the nature of the crisis and furthermore every american must feel stir with the desire to see he country now emulate britain 's achievement in this volume mr ward draw a wonderful picture of the english in the full tide of they successful effort from the begin england 's naval effort and she money effort have be extraordinary by the time mr ward 's first book be write the work of industrial preparedness be in full blast but it could yet not be say that england 's army in the field be the equal of the huge carefully prepared thoroughly coordinate military machine of those against whom and beside whom it fight now the english army be itself as fine and as highly efficient a military machine as the wisdom of man can devise now the valor and hardihood of the individual soldier be be utilise to the full under a vast and perfect system which enable those in control of the great engine to use every unit in such fashion as to aid in drive the mass forward to victory even the napoleonic contest be child 's play compare to this never have great britain be put to such a test never since the spacious day of elizabeth have she be in such danger never in any crisis have she rise to so lofty a height of self-sacrifice and achievement in the giant struggle against napoleon england 's own safety be secure by the demoralisation of the french fleet but in this contest the german naval authority have at they disposal a fleet of extraordinary efficiency and have devise for use on a extend scale the most formidable and destructive of all instrument of marine warfare in previous coalition england have partially finance she continental ally in this case the expenditure have be on a unheard-of scale and in consequence england 's industrial strength in man and money in business and mercantile and agricultural ability have be draw on as never before as in the day of marlborough and wellington so now england have send she troops to the continent but whereas formerly she expeditionary force although of excellent quality be numerically too small to be of primary importance at present she army be already by size as well as by excellence a factor of prime importance in the military situation and its relative as well as absolute importance be steadily grow and to she report of the present stage of great britain 's effort in the war mr ward have add some letter describe from she own personal experience the ruin work by the german in town like senli and gerbéviller and in the hundred of village in northern central and eastern france that now lie wreck and desolate and she have tell in detail and from the evidence of eye-witness some of the piteous incident of german cruelty to the civilian population which be already burn into the conscience of europe and should never be forget till reparation have be make mr ward 's book be thus of high value as a study of contemporary history it be of at least as high

leave to publish you original letter as it might seem opportune -rrb- -- that it be you who give the impulse last year which lead to the writing of the first series of letter on england 's effort in the war which be publish in book form in June 1916 you appeal -- that i should write a general account for america of the part play by england in the vast struggle -- find I in we quiet country house busy with quite other work and at first i think it impossible that i could attempt so new a task as you propose to I but support and encouragement come from we own authority and like many other thousand of english woman under order i could only go and do my best i spend some time in the munition area watch the enormous and rapid development of we war industry and of the astonishing part play in it by woman i be allow to visit a portion of the fleet and finally to spend twelve day in france ten of they among the great supply basis and hospital camp with two day at the british headquarters and on the front near poperinghe and richebourg st vaast the result be a short book which have be translate into many foreign tongue -- french italian dutch german russian portuguese and japanese -- which have bring I many american letter from many different state and have be perhaps most widely read of all among we own people for we all read newspaper and we all forget they in this vast and change struggle event huddle on each other so that the new blur and wipe out the old there be always room -- be there not -- for such a personal narrative as may recall to we the main outline and the chief determine factor of a war in which -- often -- everything seem to we in flux and we eye amid the tumult of the stream be apt to lose sight of the landmark on its bank and the sign of the approach goal and now again -- after a year -- i have be attempt a similar task with renew and cordial help from we authority at home and abroad and i venture to address these new letter directly to yourself as to that american of all other to whom this second chapter on england 's effort may look for sympathy whither be we tend -- you country and mine congress meet on April 1st before this letter reach you great decision will have be take i will not attempt to speculate the logic of fact will sweep we nation together in some sort of intimate union -- of that i have no doubt how much further then have great britain march since the spring of last year -- how much nearer be she to the end one can but answer such question in the most fragmentary and tentative way rely for the most part on the opinion and information of those who know those who be in the van of action at home and abroad but also on one 's own personal impression of a incomparable scene and every day almost at this breathless moment the answer of yesterday may become obsolete i leave we headquarters in france for instance some day before the news of the russian revolution reach london and while the somme retirement be still in its earlier stage immediately afterwards the event of one short week transform the whole political aspect of europe and may well prove to have change the face of the war -- although as to that let there be no dogmatising yet but before the pace become faster still and before the unfold of those great and perhaps final event we may now dimly foresee let I try and seize the impression of some memorable week and bring they to bear -- so far as the war be concern -- on those question which in the present state of affair must interest you in america scarcely less than they interest we here where in fact do we stand any kind of answer must begin with the navy for in the case of great britain and indeed scarcely less in the case of the ally that be the foundation of everything to yourself the fact will all be familiar -- but for the benefit of those innumerable friend of the ally in europe and america whom i would fain reach with the help of you great name i will run through a few of the recent -- the ground -- fact of the past year as i myself run through they a few day ago before with a admiralty permit i go down to one of the most interesting naval basis on we coast and find myself amid a group of man engage night and day in grapple with the submarine menace which threaten not only great britain not only the ally but yourselve and every neutral nation it be well to go back to these fact they be indeed worthy of this island nation and she seaborn child to begin with the _ personnel _ of the british navy which at the beginning of the war be 140000 be last year 300000 this year it be 400000 or very nearly three time what it be before the war then as to ship -- if we be strong in capital ship at the beginning of the war -- say mr balfor last September we be yet stronger now -- absolutely and relatively -- and in regard to cruiser and destroyer there be absolutely no comparison between we strength in 1914 and we strength now there be no part of we naval strength in which we have not get a greater supply and in some department a incomparably greater supply than we have on August 4th 1914 the tonnage of the navy have increase by well over a million ton since war begin so mr balfor six month ago five month later it fall to sir edward carson to move the naval estimate under pressure as we all know of the submarine anxiety he speak in the frankest and plainest language of that anxiety as do the prime minister in he now famous speech of February 22nd and as do the speaker in the house of lord lord lytton lord curzon and lord beresford on the same date _ the attack be not yet check the danger be not over _ still again -- look at some of the fact in two year and a quarter of war -- eight million man move across the sea -- almost without mishap nine million and a half ton of explosive carry to we own army and those of we ally over a million horse and mule and -- over forty-seven million gallon of petrol supply to the army and besides twenty-five thousand ship have be examine for contraband of war on the high sea or in harbor since the war begin and at this one must pause a moment to think -- once again -- what it mean to call up the familiar image of britain 's ship large and small scatter over the wide atlantic and the approach to the north sea watch there through winter and summer storm and fair and so carry out relentlessly the blockade of germany through every circumstance often of danger and difficulty with every consideration for neutral interest that be compatible with this desperate war in which the very existence of england be concerned and without the sacrifice of a single life unless it be the life of british sailor often lose in these boarding of pass ship amid the darkness and storm of winter sea there indeed in these wave-beaten ship as in the watch fleet of the english admiral outside toulon and brest while napoleon be march triumphantly about europe lie the root fact of the war it be a commonplace but one that have be prove upon we pulse who do not remember the shock that go through england -- and the civilised world -- when the first partial news of the battle of jutland reach london and we be tell we own loss before we know either the loss of the enemy or the general result of the battle it be neither fear nor panic but it be as though the nation hold its breath realize for the first time where for it lay the vital element of be the depths in we be stir we know in very deed that we be the child of the sea and now again the depths be stir the development of the submarine attack have set we a new and stern task and we be straitened till it be accomplish the great battle-ships seem almost to have leave the stage in less than three month 626000 ton of british neutral and ally shipping have be destroy since the beginning of the war we -- great britain -- have lose over two million ton of shipping and we ally and the neutral have lose almost as much there be a certain shortage of food in great britain and a shortage of many other thing besides write about the middle of February a important german newspaper raise a shout of jubilation the whole sea be as if sweep clean at one blow -- by the announcement of the intensify blockade of the first of February so the german scribe but again the fact shoot up hard and irreducible through the sea of comment while the german newspaper be shout to each other the sea be so far from be sweep clean that twelve thousand ship have actually pass in and out of british port in the first eighteen day of the blockade and at any moment during those day at least 3000 ship could have be find traverse the danger zone which the german imagine themselves to have bar one be remind of the _ hamburger nachrichten _ last year after the zeppelin raid in January 1916 english industry lie in ruin say that astonishing print the sea have be sweep clean say one of its brethren now yet all the while there in the danger zone whenever by day or night one turn one 's thought to it be the three thousand ship and there in the course of a fortnight be the twelve thousand ship go and come yet all the same as i have say before there be danger and there be anxiety the neutral -- save america -- have be intimidate they be keep they ship in harbor and to do without they tonnage be a serious matter for we meanwhile the best brain in naval england be at work and one can feel the sailor strain at the leash in the first eighteen day of February there be forty fight with submarine the navy talk very little about they and say nothing of which it be not certain but all the scientific resource all the fight brain of naval england be be bring to bear and we at home -- well let we keep to we ration the only thing we can do to help we man at sea how this gray estuary spread before my eye illustrate and illuminate the figure i have be quote i be on the light cruiser of a famous commodore and i have just be creep and climb through a submarine the water round be crowd with those light craft destroyer submarine mine-sweeper trawler patrol boat on which for the moment at any rate the fortune of the naval war turn and take notice that they be all -- or almost all -- _ new _ the very latest product of british ship-yard we have plenty of battle-ship but we must now build as quickly as possible the smaller craft and the merchant ship we want say sir edward carson not a slip in the country will be empty during the coming month every rivet put into a ship will contribute to the defeat of germany and 47 per cent of the merchant service have already be arm the riveter must indeed have be hard at work this crowded scene carry I back to the clyde where i be last year to the new factory and workshop with they ever-increasing throng of woman and to the marvellous work of the ship-yard no talk now of strike of a disaffected and revolutionary minority on the clyde at any rate as there be twelve month ago broadly speak and allow for a small stubborn but insignificant pacifist section the will of the nation throughout all class have become as steel -- to win the war throughout england as in these naval officer beside I there be the same tense yet discipline expectancy as we lunch and talk on this cruiser at rest message come in perpetually the cruiser itself be ready for the open sea at a hour and a half 's notice the seaplane pass out and come in over the mouth of the harbor on they voyage of discovery and report and these destroyer and mine-sweeper that he so quietly near we will be out again to-night in the north sea grapple with every difficulty and face every danger in the true spirit of a wonderful service while we land-folk sleep and eat in peace -- grumble no doubt with we morning newspaper and coffee when any of the german destroyer who come out from zeebrugge be allow to get home with a whole skin what on earth be the navy about well the navy know germany be do she very worst and will go on do it -- for a time the line of defensive watch in the north sea be long the north sea be a big place the german often have the luck of the street-boy who ring a bell and run away before the policeman come up but the navy have no doubt the situation say one of my cheerful host be quite healthy and we shall see great thing in the coming month we have better leave it at that now let we look at these destroyer in another scene it be the last day of February and i find myself on a military steamer bind for a french port and on my way to the british headquarters in france with I be the same dear daughter who accompany I last year as dame secrétaire on my first errand the boat be crowd with soldier and before we reach the french shore we have listen to almost every song -- old and new -- in tommy 's repertory there be even tipperary a snatch a ghost of tipperary intermingled with many other rise and fall no one know why start now here now there and die away again after a line or two it be a draft go out to france for the first time north countryman by they accent and life-belt and submarine seem to amuse they hugely to judge by the run fire of chaff that go on but after a while i cease to listen i be think first of what await we on the further shore on which the light be come out and of those interesting pass invite we to ghq as government guest which lie safe in we handbag and then my thought slip back to a conversation of the day before with dr addison the new minister of munitions a man in the prime of life with whitening hair -- prematurely white for the face and figure be quite young still -- and stamp so far as expression and aspect be concern by those social and humane interest which first carry he into parliament i have be long concern with evening play centre for school-child in hoxton one of the most congested quarter of we east end and seven year ago i begin to hear of the young and public-spirited doctor and man of science who have make himself a name and place in hoxton who have win the confidence of the people crowd in its unlovely street have work for the poor and the sick and the child and have now beat the tory member and be hoxton 's liberal representative in the new parliament elect in January 1910 to deal with the lord after the throw out of lloyd george 's famous budget once or twice since i have come across he in matter concern with education -- cripple school and the like -- when he be parliamentary secretary to the board of education immediately before the war and now here be the doctor the hunterian professor the social worker the friend of school and school-child transform into the fight minister of a great fighting department itself the creation of the war only second -- if second -- in its importance for the war to the admiralty and the war office i be myself for a fortnight of last year the guest of the ministry of munitions while mr lloyd george be still its head in some of the most important munition area and i be then able to feel the current of hot energy start by the first minister run -- not of course without local obstacle and animosity -- through a electrify england that be in February 1916 then in August come the astonishing speech of mr montagu on the development of the munitions supply in one short year as illustrate by the happening of the somme battlefield and now as successor to mr montagu and mr lloyd george dr addison sit in the minister 's chair continue the story what a story it be start from the manufacture of gun ammunition and explosive and after push that to incredible figure the necessity of its great task have lead the ministry to one forward step after another see that the supply of munitions depend on the supply of raw material it be now regulate the whole mineral supply of this country and much of that of the ally it be about to work quality of iron ore that have never be work before it be decide over the length and breadth of the country how much aluminium should be allow to one firm how much copper to another it be produce steel for we ally as well as for ourselves it have take over with time the whole motor transport of the war and be now add to it the railway transport of munitions here and abroad and be dictate meanwhile to every engineering firm in the country which of its order should come first and which last it be manage a whole gigantic industry with employe run into million half a million of they woman and manage it under wholly new condition of humanity and forethought it be housing and feeding and caring for innumerable thousand transform from day to day as by a kind of by-work the industrial mind and training of multitude and lay the foundation of a new and surely happier england after the war and finally it be adjust with on the whole great success the rival claim of the factory and the trench send more and more man from the workshop to the fight line in proportion as the unskilled labor of the country -- man and woman but especially woman -- be draw more and more widely into the service of a dwindle amount of skilled labor more and more diluted \* \* \* \* \* but the light be fail and the shore be near life-belt be take off the destroyer have disappear we be on the quay kindly welcome by a officer from ghq who pass we bag rapidly through the custom house and carry we off to a neighbouring hotel for the night it be too late for the long drive to ghq we be in france again -- and the great presence of the army be all about we the quay crowd with soldier the port alive with ship the grey-blue uniform mingle with the khaki -- after a year i see it again and one 's pulse quicken the vast effort of england which last year have already reach so great a height and have now as all account testify be so incredibly develop be here once more in visible action before I next day the motor arrive early and with we courteous officer who have charge of we in front we be off first for one of the great camp i see last year and then for ghq itself on the way as we speed over the roll down country beyond the town my eye be keen to catch some of the new sign of the time here be the first -- a railway line in process of double -- and large number of man some of they german prisoner work at it typical both of the immense railway development all over the military zone since last year and of the extensive use now be make of prisoner ' labor in region well behind the firing line they lift they head as we pass look with curiosity at the two lady in the military car they flat round cap give they a odd similarity it be as if one saw score of the same face differentiate here and there by a beard a docile hard-working crew by all account who give no trouble and be manage largely by they nco 's be there some among they who see the massacre at dinant the terrible thing in lorraine they placid expressionless face tell no tale but the mile have fly and here already be the long line of the camp how pleasant to be greet by some of the same officer we go into the headquarters office for a talk grow i should think we have say colonel -- and rapidly he and one of he colleague run through some of the addition and expansion the training camp have be practically double or rather another training camp have be add to the one that exist last year and both be equip with a increase number of special school -- a artillery training school a engineer training school a lewi gun school a gas school with a actual gas chamber for the training of man in the use of they gas helmet -- and other of which it be not possible to speak we have put through half a million of reinforcement since you be here last and close upon two million ration be issue last month the veterinary accommodation have be much enlarged and two convalescent horse depot have be add -- -lrb- it be good indeed to see with what kindness and think the army treat its horse -rrb- but the most novel addition to the camp have be a fat factory for the production of fat -- from which come the glycerine use in explosive -- out of all the food refuse of the camp the fat produce by the system here and in england have already provide glycerine _ far million of eighteen-pounder shell _ the problem of camp refuse always a desperate one have be solve and as a commercial venture the factory make 250 per cent profit undeterred by what we hear of the smell we go off to see it and the enthusiastic manager explain the unsavoury process by which the bone and refuse of all the vast camp be boil down into a white fat that look _ almost _ eatable but be mean as a matter of fact to feed not man but shell nor be that the only contribution to the fight line which the factory make all the cotton waste of the hospital with they twenty thousand bed -- the old dressing and bandage -- come here and after sterilisation and disinfection go to england for gun-cotton be there ever a grimmer cycle than this by which that which feed and that which heal become in the end that which kill but let I try to forget that side of it and remember rather as we leave the smell behind that the calcined bone become artificial manure and go back again into the tortured field of france while other bye-product of the factory help the peasant near to feed they pig and anything however small that help the peasant of france in this war comfort one 's heart we climb up to the high ground of the camp for a general view before we go on to ghq and i see it as i see it last year spread under the march sunshine among the sand and the pine -- a wonderful sight everything have grow you see except the staff say the colonel smile as we shake hand but we rub along then we be in the motor again and at last the new ghq -- how different from that i see last year -- rise before we we make we way into the town and presently the car stop for a minute before a building and while we officer go within we retreat into a side street to wait but my thought be busy for that building of which the side-front be still visible be the brain of the british army in france and on the man who work there depend the fortune of that distant line where we brother and son be meet face to face the horror and foulness of war how many woman whose heart hang on the war whose all be there in daily and nightly jeopardy read the word british headquarters with a involuntary lift of soul a invocation without word yet scarcely half a dozen englishwoman in this war will ever see the actual spot and here it be under my eye the cold march sun shine fitfully on it the sentry at the door the khaki figure pass in and out i picture to myself the room within and the news arrive of general gough 's advance on the ancre of that german retreat as to which all europe be speculate but we move on -- to a quiet country house in a town garden -- the headquarters mess of the intelligence department here i find among we kind host man already know to I from my visit of the year before man whose primary business it be to watch the enemy who know where every german regiment and german commander be who through the aerial photography of we airman be now acquaint with every step of the german retreat and have already the photograph of he second line all the information gather from prisoner and from innumerable other source come here and the department have its eye besides on everything that happen within the zone of we army in france for a woman to be receive here be a exception -- perhaps i may say a honor -- of which i be rather tremulously aware can i make it worth while but a little conversation with these earnest and able man show plainly that they have consider the matter like any other incident in the day 's work _ england 's effort _ have be useful therefore i be to be allow again to see and write for myself and therefore what information can be give I as to the growth of we military power in france since last year will be give it be not of course a question of war correspondence which be not within a woman 's power but it be a question of as much see as can be arrange for combine with as much first-hand information as time and the censor allow i begin to see my way the conversation at luncheon -- the simplest of meal -- and during a stroll afterwards be thrilling indeed to we newcomer the coming summer 's campaign _ must _ decide the issue of the war -- though it may not see the end of it the issue of the war -- and the fate of europe a inconclusive peace would be a victory for germany there be no doubt here as to the final issue but there be a resolute refusal to fix date or prophesy detail man for man we be now the better army we strength be increase month by month while that of germany be fail man and officer who a year ago be still insufficiently train be now seasoned troops with nothing to learn from the german and the troops recruit under the military service act now begin to come out be of surprisingly good quality on such line the talk run and it be over all too soon then we be in the motor again bind for a aerodrome forty or fifty mile away we be late and the last twenty-seven kilometre fly by in thirty-two minute it be a rolling country and there be steep descent and sharp climb through the thickly-scattered and characteristic village and small old town of the nord village crowd all of they with we man presently with a start we find ourselves on a road which see we last spring -- a year ago to the day the same blue distance the same glimpse of old town in the hollow the same touch of snow on the height at last in the cold sunset light we draw up at we destination the wide aerodrome stretch before we -- great hangar color so as to escape the notice of a boche overhead -- with machine of all size rise and landing -- come out of the hangar or return to they for the night two of the officer in charge meet we and i walk round with they look at the various type -- some for fight some for observation and understanding -- what i can but the spirit of the man -- that one can understand we be accumulate concentrate now for the summer offensive of course the german have be work hard too they have lot of new and improved machine but when the test come we be confident that we shall down they again as we do on the somme for we the all-important thing be the fight behind the enemy line we object be to prevent the german machine from rise at all to keep they down while we airman be reconnoiter along the fight line awfully dangerous work lot do not come back but what then they will have do they job the word be speak so carelessly that for a few seconds i do not realize they meaning but there be that in the expression of the man who speak they which show there be no lack of realisation there how often i have recall they with a sore heart in these recent week of heavy loss in the air-service -- loss due i have no doubt to the special claim upon it of the german retreat the conversation drop a little till one of my companion with a smile point overhead three splendid biplane be sail above we at a great height bind south-ward back from the line say the officer beside I and we watch they till they dip and disappear in the sunset cloud then tea and pleasant talk the young man insist that d shall make tea this visit of two lady be a unique event for the moment as she make tea in they sitting-room which be now full of man there be a illusion of home then we be off for another fifty mile darkness come on the road be unfamiliar at last a avenue and bright light we have reach the visitor ' château under the wing of ghq no 2 _ march 31st 1917 _ dear mr roosevelt -- my first letter you will perhaps remember take we to the visitor ' château of ghq and leave we alight there to be greet by the same courteous host captain -- who preside last year over another guest house far away but we be not to sleep at the château which be already full of guest arrangement have be make for we at a cottage in the village near belong to the village schoolmistress the motor take we there immediately and after change we travel-stained dress we go back to the château for dinner many guest -- all of they of course of the male sex and much talk some of the guest -- member of parliament and foreign correspondent -- have be over the somme battlefield that day and give alarmist account of the effect of the thaw upon the road and the ground generally banish for a time by the frost the mud have return and mud on the front become a kind of malignant force which affect the spirit of the soldier the schoolmistress and she little maid sit up for we and shepherd we kindly to bed never be there a more strangely build little house the ceiling come down on we head the stair be perpendicular but there be a stove in each room and the bed though hard and the floor though bare be scrupulously clean in the early morning i wake up and look out there have be a white frost and the sun be just rise in a clear sky its yellow light be shine on the whitewashed wall of the next cottage on which a large pear-tree be train all round be frost-whitened plot of garden or meadow -- _ préaux _ -- with tall poplar in the hedge cut the morning sky suddenly i hear a continuous murmur in the room beneath I it be the schoolmistress and she maid at prayer and presently the house door open and shut it be mademoiselle who have go to early mass for the school be a _ école libre _ and the little lady who teach it be a devout catholic the rich yet cold light the frosty quiet of the village the thin french tree against the sky the ritual murmur in the room below -- it be like a scene from a novel by rené bazin and breathe the old the traditional france we be to start early and motor far but there be time before we start for a little talk with mademoiselle she be full of praise for we english soldier some of whom be billet in the village they be very kind to we people they often help the woman and they never complain -lrb- have the british tommy in these part really forget how to grouse -rrb- i have some of you man billet here i could only give they a room without bed just the bare board ` you will find it hard ' i say ` we will get a little straw ' say the sergeant ` that will be all right ' we man would have grumble -lrb- but i think this be mademoiselle 's _ politesse _ -rrb- and the child be devote to you soldier i have a dear little girl in the school nine year old sometimes from the window she see a man in the street a soldier who lodge with she mother then i can not hold she she be like a wild thing to be go ` voilà mon camarade -- voilà mon camarade ' out she go and be soon walk gravely beside he hand in hand look up at he how do they understand each other i do not know but they have a language you sergeant often know more french than you officer because they have to do the billeting and the talk to we people the morning be still bright when the motor arrive but the frost have be keen and the air on the upland be bite we speed first across a famous battlefield where french and english bone lie mingle below the quiet grass and then turn south-east nobody on the road the line of poplar-tree fly past the magpie flutter from the wood and one might almost forget the war suddenly a railway line a steep descent and we be full in its midst again on we leave a encampment of nissen hut -- so call from they inventor a canadian officer -- those new and ingenious device for housing troops or labor battalion or color worker at a astonishing saving both of time and material in shape like the old-fashioned beehive each hut can be put up by four or six man in a few hour everything be of course standardised and the wood which line they corrugated iron be put together in the simplest and quickest way way easily suggest no doubt to the canadian mind familiar with shack and lumber camp we shall come across they everywhere along the front but on this first occasion my attention be soon distract from they for as we turn a corner beyond the hut settlement which i be tell be that of a machine-gun detachment there be a exclamation from d -- _ tank _ the officer in front point smile to a field just ahead there be one of they -- the monster -- take its morning exercise practise up and down the high and almost perpendicular bank by which another huge field be divide the motor slacken and we watch the creature slowly attack a high bank land complacently on the top and then -- a officer walk beside it to direct its movement -- balance a moment on the edge of another bank equally high a short distance away there it be -- down -- not flop or fall but all in the way of business glide unperturbed london be full of tank of course -- on the film but somehow to be watch a real one under the french sky not twenty mile from the line be a different thing we fall into a eager discussion with captain f in front as to the part play by they in the somme battle and as to what the german may be prepare in reply to they and while we talk my eye be catch by something on the sky-line just above the tank it be a man and a plough -- a plough that might have come out of the odyssey -- the oldest simplest type so be the age interwoven and one may safely guess that the plough -- that very type -- will outlast many generation of tank but for the moment the tank be in the limelight and it be luck that we should have come upon they so soon for one may motor many mile about the front without meeting with any sign of they next a fine main road and a old town seethe with all the stir of war we come upon a crowded market-place and two huge convoy pass each other in the narrow street beyond -- one a ammunition column into which we motor humbly fit itself as best it can by order of the officer in charge of the column and the other a long string of magnificent lorry belong to the fly corps which defile past we on the leave the inhabitant of the town old man woman and child stand to watch the hubbub with amuse friendly face on we go for a time in the middle of the convoy the great motor lorry fill with ammunition hem we in till the town be through and a long hill be climb at the top of it we be allow to draw out and motor slowly past long line of troops on the march first re 's with they store waggon large and small then a cyclist detachment a machine-gun detachment field kitchen a white goat lie lazily on the top of one of they mule heavily laden and lewi gun in little cart then infantry march briskly in the keen air while along other road visible to east and west we see other column converge a division apparently on the march the physique of the man they alert and cheerful look strike I particularly this pitiless war seem to have reveal to england herself the quality of she race though some credit must be give to the physical instructor of the army -- who in the last twelve month especially have do a wonderful work at last we turn out of the main road and the endless column pass away into the distance again a railway line in process of double beyond a village which seem to be mainly occupy by a army medical detachment then two large casualty clearing station and a divisional dress station not many wound here at present the section of the line from which we be only some ten mile distant have be comparatively quiet of late but what preparation everywhere what sign of the come storm hardly a minute pass as we speed along without its significant sight horse-line army service depot burst with store -- a great dump of sandbag -- another of ammunition and as i look out at the pile of shell i think of the most recent figure furnish I by the ministry of munitions last year when the somme offensive begin and when i be write _ england 's effort _ the _ weekly _ output of eighteen-pounder shell be 17-1\/2 time what it be during the first year of the war _ it be now _ 28 _ time as much _ field howitzer ammunition have _ almost double _ since last July that of medium gun and howitzer _ have more than double _ that of the heaviest gun of all -lrb- over six-inch -rrb- _ be more than four time _ as great by the growth of ammunition we may guess what have be the increase in gun especially in those heavy gun we be now push forward after the retreat german as fast as road and railway line can be make to carry they the german government through one of its subordinate spokesman have lately admit they inferiority in gun they retreat indeed on the somme before we pend attack together with the state of they old line now we be in and over they show plainly enough what they have to fear from the british gun and the abundance of british ammunition but what be these strange figure swarm beside the road -- black tousled head and bronze face kaffir boy at work in some quarry feel the cold no doubt on this bright bitter day in spite of they long coat they be part of that large body of native labor chinese kaffir basuto which be now help we own man everywhere to push on and push up as the new labor force behind they release more and more of the fight man for that dogged pursuit which be go on _ there _ -- in that blue distance to we right -- where the german line swing stubbornly back south-east from the vimy ridge the motor stop this be a headquarters and a staff officer come out to greet we -- a boy in look but a dso all the same he small car precede we as a guide and we keep up with he as best we may these be mine village we be pass through and on the horizon be some of those pyramidal slag-heap -- the foss -- which have see some of the fiercest fighting of the war but we leave the village behind and be soon climb into a wooden upland suddenly a halt a notice-board forbid the use of a stretch of road before we from sun-rise to sunset evidently it be under german observation we try to find another parallel but here too the same notice confront we we dash along it however and my pulse run a little quicker as i realize from the map we carry how near we be to the enemy line which lie hide in the haze eastward and from my own eye how expose be the hillside but we be safely through and a little further we come to a wood -- a charming wood to all seem of small tree which in a week or two will be full of spring leaf and flower but we be no sooner in it jolt up its main track than we understand the grimness of what it hold spring and flower have not much to say to it for this wood and its neighborhood -- ablain st nazaire carency neuville st vaast -- have see war at its cruellest thousand of brave life have be yield here some of the dead be still lie unburied in its furthest thicket and man will go softly through it in the year to come stranger go and tell the lacedaemonian that we lie here obedient to they will : -- the immortal word be in my ear but how many be the sacred spot in this land for which they speak we leave the motor and walk on through the wood to the bare upland beyond the wood be still a wood of death actual or potential we own battery be all about we so too be the remains of french battery from the day when the french still hold this portion of the line we watch the gunner among the tree and presently pass a encampment of they hut beyond a high and grassy plateau -- fringe of wood on either hand but we must not go to the edge on we right so as to look down into the valley below through the thin leafless tree however we see plainly the ridge that stretch eastward one behind the other suffused in sunny air there be the tower of mont st eloy -- ours the bertonval wood -- ours and the famous vimy ridge blue in the middle distance of which half be ours and half german we be very near the line notre dame de lorette be not very far away though too far for we to reach the actual spot the famous bluff round which the battle rage in 1915 and now the gun begin -- the first we have hear since we arrive from we leave -- as it seem -- some distance away come the short sharp report of the trench mortar but presently as we walk on gun just behind we and below we begin to boom over we head and we hear again the long-drawn scream or swish of the shell rush on they deadly path to search out the back of the enemy 's line in the haze yonder and fling confusion on he line of communication he supplies and reserve he do not reply he have indeed be strangely meek of late the reason here can not be that he be slip away from we attack as be the case farther south the vimy ridge be firmly hold it be indeed the pivot of the retreat perhaps to-day he be economise but of course at any moment he might reply after a certain amount of hammer he _ must _ reply and there be some quite fresh shell-hole along we path some of they not many hour old altogether it be with relief that as the firing grow hotter we turn back and pick up the motor in the wood again and yet one be loath to go never again shall i stand in such a scene -- never again behold those haunt ridge and this wood of death with the gun that hide in it to have share ever so little in such a bit of human experience be for a woman a thing of awe if one have time to think of it not even group of artillery man chat or complete they morning 's toilet amid the thin tree can dull that sense in I _ they _ be only strafe fritz or make ready to strafe he they have have a excellent midday meal in the hut yonder and they whistle and sing as they go about they work disappear sometimes into mysterious region out of sight that be all there be in it for they they be do they job like the airman and if a german shell find they in the wood why the german will have do _ he _ job and they will bear no grudge it be simple as that -- for they but to the onlooker they be all figure in a great design -- weave into the terrible tapestry of war and charge with a meaning that we of this actual generation shall never more than dimly see or understand again we rush along the expose road and back into the mining region take a westward turn a stately chateau and near it a smaller house where a general greet we lunch be over for we be late but it be hospitably bring back for we and the general and i plunge into talk of the retreat of what it mean for the german and what it will mean for we after luncheon we go into the next room to look at the general 's big map which show clearly how the salient run the smaller and the larger from which the german be fall back follow closely by the troops of general gough news of the condition of the enemy 's abandon line be come in fast let no one make any mistake they have go because they _ must _ -- because of the power of we artillery which never stop hammer they whether on the line or behind the line which interfere with all they communication and supplies and make life intolerable at the same time the retreat be be skilfully do and will of course delay we that be why they do it we shall have to push up road railway supply the bring up of the heavy gun will take time but less time than they think we man be in the pink of condition on which again follow very high praise of the quality of the man now come out under the military service act yet they be conscript say one of we in some surprise and the rest be volunteer no doubt but these be the man -- many of they -- who have to balance duty -- who have wife and child to leave and business which depend on they personally compulsion have cut the knot and ease they conscience they 'll make fine soldier but we want more -- _ more _ and then follow talk on the wonderful development of training -- even since last year and some amusing reminiscence of the early day of england 's astounding effort by which vast mob of eager recruit without gun uniform or teacher have be turn into the magnificent army now fight in france the war office have lately issue privately some extremely interesting note on the growth and training of the new army of which it be only now possible to make public use from these it be clear that in the great experiment of the first two year of war all phase of intellect and capacity have play they part the widely trained mind take large view as to the responsibility of the army towards the nation deliver into its hand so that not only should it be discipline for war but make fitter for peace and the practical inventive gift of individual who in seek to meet a special need stumble on something universal both force have be constantly at work discipline and initiative have be the twin conqueror and the ablest man in the army to use a homely phrase have be out for both many a fresh and valuable bit of training have be due to some individual officer strike with a new idea and patiently work it out the special school which be now daily increase the efficiency of the army if you ask how they arise you will generally be able to trace they back to some eager young man start a modest experiment in he spare time for the teaching of himself and some of he friend and so develop it that the thing be finally recognize enlarged and make the parent of similar effort elsewhere let I describe one such school -- to I a thrilling one as i see it on a clear march afternoon a year ago no such thing exist now each of we army possess one but this letter be already too long no 3 _ easter eve _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- since i finish my last letter to you before the meeting of congress great day have come and go _ america be with we _ at last we english folk can say that to each other without reserve or qualification and into england 's mood of ceaseless effort and anxiety there have come a sudden relaxation a breath of something canning and sustain what you action may be -- whether it will shorten the war and how much no one here yet know but when in some great strain a friend step to you side you do not begin with question he be there you cause you effort be he detail will come discussion will come but there be a breathing space first in which feeling rest upon itself before it rush out in action such a breathing space for england be these easter day meanwhile the letter from the front come in with they new note of joy you should see the american face in the army to-day write one they bring a new light into this dismal spring how many of they may not we now confess to ourselves and we ally that there be already the equivalent of a american division fight with the ally army in france who have use every honest device to get there they have come in by every channel and under every pretext -- wavelet forerunner of the tide for now you too have to improvise great army as we improvise ours in the first two year of war and with you as with we you unpreparedness stand as you warrant before history that not from american mind and will come the provocation to this war but you actual and realize co-operation set I on line of thought that distract I for the moment from the first plan of this letter the special musketry school with which i have mean to open it must wait till its close i find my mind full instead -- in connection with the news from washington -- of those recently issue war office pamphlet of which i speak in my last letter and i propose to run through they story these pamphlet issue not for publication but for the information of those concern be the first frank record of _ we national experience _ in connection with the war and for all you wonderful american resource and inventiveness you american energy and wealth you will certainly as prudent man make full use of we experience in the coming month last year for _ england 's effort _ i try vainly to collect some of these very fact and figure which the war office be still jealously -- ` and no doubt quite rightly -- withhold now at last they be available tell by authority and one can hardly doubt that each of these pass day will give they -- for america a double significance surpass the story if you can we shall bear you no grudge but up till now it remain a chapter unique in the history of war many american as you original letter to I point out have still last year practically no conception of what we be do and have do the majority of we own people indeed be in much the same case while the great story be still in the make while the foundation be still be lay it be impossible to correct all the annoying underestimate all the ignorant or careless judgment of people who take a point for the whole the man at the heart of thing could only set they tooth keep silence and give no information that could help the enemy the battle of the somme last July be the first real testing of they work the hindenburg retreat the success in mesopotamium the marvellous spectacle of the army in france -- and before this letter could be send to press the glorious news from the arras front -- be the present fruit of it like you we have at the outbreak of war some 500000 man all tell of whom not half be fully train none of we british folk will ever forget the rally of the first hundred thousand on the 8th of August four day after the declaration of war lord kitchener ask for they he get they in a fortnight but the stream rush on -- in the fifth week of the war alone 250000 man enlist 30000 recruit -- the yearly number enlist before the war -- join in one day within six or seven week the half-million available at the beginning of the war have be _ more than double _ then come a pause the war office snow under not know where to turn for clothes boot hut rifle gun ammunition try to check the stream by raise the recruit ' standard a mistake -- but soon recognize in another month under the influence of the victory on the marne and while the german be prepare the attack on the british line so miraculously beat off in the first battle of ypre the momentary check have be lose in a fresh outburst of national energy you will remember how the parliamentary recruiting committee come into be that first autumn -- how the prime minister take the lead and the two great political party of the country agree to bring all they organization central or local to bear on the supreme question of get man for the army tory and radical tour the country together the hottest opponent stand on the same platform _ l'union sacrée _ -- to use the french phrase so vivid and so true by which we great ally have charm she own discord to rest in defense of the country -- become a reality here too in spite of strike in spite of ireland by July 1915 -- the end of the first year of war -- more than 2000000 man have voluntarily enlist but the military chief know well that it be but a half-way house they know too that it be not enough to get man and rush they out to the trench as soon as any kind of training could be give they the available man must be sort out some indeed must be bring back from the fight line for work as vital as the fight itself _ so registration come _ -- the first real step towards organise the nation 150000 voluntary worker help to register all man and woman in the country from eighteen to sixty-five and on the result lord derby build he group system which _ almost _ enable we to do without compulsion between October and December 1915 another two million and a quarter man have attest -- that be have pledge themselves to come up for training when call on but as every observer of this new england know we have here less than half the story from a nation not invade protect on the contrary by its sea rampart from the personal cruelty and ravages of war to gather in between four and five million voluntary recruit be a great achievement but to turn these recruit at the shortest possible notice under the hammer-blow of a war in which we enemy have every initial advantage into army equip and train accord to modern standard might well have seem to those who undertake it a impossible task and the task have to be accomplish the riddle solve before in the face of the enemy the incredible difficulty of it could possibly be admit the creator of the new army work as far as they could behind a screen but now the screen be down and we be allow to see they difficulty in they true perspective -- as they exist during the first month of the war in the first place -- accommodation at the opening of war we have barrack-room for 176000 man what to do with these capped bare-headed or straw-hatted multitude who pour in at lord kitchener 's call they be temporarily house -- somehow -- under every kind of shelter but military hut for half a million man be immediately plan -- then for nearly a million timber -- labor -- lighting -- water -- drainage -- road -- everything have to be provide and be provide billet fill up the gap and large camp be build by private enterprise to be take in time by the government of course mistake be make of course there be some dishonest contractor and some incompetent official but the breath the winnowing blast of the national need be behind it all by the end of the first year of war the problem of quarter the troops in the chief training centre have be solve in the next place there be no clothes a dozen manufacturer of khaki cloth exist before the war they have to be push up as quickly as possible to 200 which of we in the country district do not remember the blue emergency suit of which a co-operative society be able by a lucky stroke to provide 400000 for the new recruit -- or the other motley covering of the host that drill in we field and march about we lane the war office note under my hand speak of these month as the tatterdemalion stage for what clothes and boot there be must go to the man at the front and the man at home have just to take they chance well it take a year and five month -- breathless month of strain and stress -- while germany be hammer east and west on the long-drawn line of the ally but by then January 1916 the army be not only clothed house and very largely armed but we be manufacture for we ally as to the arm and equipment look back at these fact when the expeditionary force have take its rifle abroad in August 1914 150000 rifle be leave in the country and many of they require to be resight the few service rifle in each battalion be hand round as the three fate hand round they one eye in the story of perseus old rifle and inferior rifle technically know as dp be eagerly make use of but after seven month ' hard training with nothing better than these makeshift man be apt to get depress it be just the same with the artillery at the outbreak of war we have gun for eight division -- say 140000 man and there be no plant wherewith to make and keep up more than that supply yet gun have to be send as fast as they could be make to france egypt gallipolus how be the gunner at home to be train it be do so to speak with blood and tear for seven month it be impossible for the gunner in training even to see much less to work or fire the gun to which he be be train zealous officer provide dummy wooden gun for they man all kind of device be try and even when the gun themselves arrive they come often without the indispensable accessory -- range-finder director and the like it be a time of hideous anxiety for both government and war office for the military history of 1915 be largely a history of shortage of gun and ammunition -- whether on the western or eastern front all the same by the end of 1915 the thing be in hand the shell from the new factory be arrive in ever-increasing volume and the gun be follow in a chapter of _ england 's effort _ i have describe the amazing development of some of the great armament work in order to meet this cry for gun as i see it in February 1916 the second stage of the war have then begin the first be over and we be steadily overtake we colossal task the somme prove it abundantly but the expansion _ still _ go on and what the nation owe to the direct brain and ceaseless energy of these nominally private but really national firm have never be sufficiently recognize on my writing-desk be a letter receive not many day ago from a world-famous firm whose work i see last year : since you visit here in the early part of last year there have be very large addition to the work building to accommodate new aeroplane and armament construction of different kind be mention and the letter continue : we have also put up another gun-shop 565 foot long and 163 foot wide -- in three extension -- of which the third be near completion these addition be all to increase the output of gun the value of that output be now 60 per cent greater than it be in 1915 in the last twelve month the output of shell have be one and a half time more than it be in the previous year no wonder that the humane director who write speak with keen sympathy of the long-continued strain upon master and man but he add -- when we all feel it we think of we soldier and sailor do they duty -- unto death and then -- to repeat -- if the _ difficulty of equipment _ be huge they be almost as nothing to the _ difficulty of training _ the fact as the war office have now reveal they -lrb- the latest of these most illuminating brochure be date April 2nd 1917 -rrb- be almost incredible it will be a interesting time when we war office and yours come to compare note -- when peace have calm the world for you be now face the same grim task -- how to find the shortest cut to the making of a army -- which confront we in 1914 in the first place what military trainer there be in the country have to be send abroad with the first expeditionary force adjutant nco 's all the experienced pilot in the fly corps nearly all the qualify instructor in physical training the vast majority of all the seasoned man in every branch of the service -- down as i have say to the army cook -- depart overseas at the very last moment a officer or two be shed from every battalion of the expeditionary force to train those leave behind even so there be hardly even a nucleus of expert leave and yet -- officer for 500000 man have to be find -- _ within a month _ -- from August 4th 1914 how be it do the war office answer make fascinating read the small number of regular officer leave behind -- 200 officer of the indian army -- retired officer dug-out -- all honor to they -- wound officer from the front all be utilise but the chief source of supply as we all know be the officer ' training corps at the university and public school which we owe to the divination the patience the hard work of lord haldane _ twenty thousand potential officer be supply _ by the otc 's what should we have do without they but even so there be no time to train they in the practical business of war -- and such a war yet _ they _ business be to train recruit while they themselves be untrained at first those who be grant temporary commission be give a month 's training then even that become impossible during the latter month of 1914 there be practically no special training give to infantry subaltern with temporary commission with 1915 the system of a month 's training be revive -- pitifully little yet the best that could be do but during the first five month of the war most of the infantry subaltern of the new army have to train themselves as best they could in the interval of train they man one 's pen falter over the word before the inward eye rise the phantom host of these boy-officer who spring to england 's aid in the first year of the war and whose grave lie scatter in a endless series along the western front and on the height of gallipolus without count the cost for a moment they come to the call of the great mother from near and far they train themselves while they be train they man not for they the plenty of gun and shell that now at least lessen the hideous sacrifice that war demand not for they the many protective device and safeguard that the war itself have develop they young body -- they precious life -- pay the price and in the mother-heart of england they lie -- gather and secure -- for ever \* \* \* \* \* but let I go a little further with the new war office fact the year 1915 see great and continuous advance during that year a _ average number of over a million troops _ be be train in the unite kingdom apart from the army abroad the first second and third army naturally come off much better than the fourth and fifth who be yet be recruit all the time what equipment clothes and arm there be the first three army get the rest have to wait but all the same the unit of these later army be do the best they could for themselves all the time nobody stand still and gradually -- surely -- order be evolve out of the original chaos the army order of the past have drop out of sight with the beginning of the war everything have to be plan anew the one govern factor be the necessity of get man to the front at the earliest possible moment six month ' course be lay down for all arm it be very rare however that any course could be strictly carry out and after the first three army the training of the rest seem for a time to be all beginning -- with the final stage farther and farther away and always the same difficulty of gun rifle hut and the rest but like its own tank the war office go steadily on negotiate one obstacle after another special course for special subject begin to be set up soon artillery officer have no longer to join they battery _ at once _ on appointment re officer could be give a seven week ' training at chatham little enough for a man suppose to know the use and repair of telephone and telegraph or the way to build or destroy a bridge or how to meet the countless other need with which a sapper be call upon to deal increase attention be pay to staff training and staff course and insufficient as it all be for month the general result of this haphazard training when the man actually get into the field -- all short-coming and disappointment admit -- be nothing short of wonderful have the german forget that we be and always have be a fight people that fact at any rate be bring home to they by the unbroken spirit of the troops who hold the line in france and flander in 1915 against all attempt to break through and at neuve chapelle or loo or a hundred other minor engagement only want number and ammunition -- above all ammunition -- to win they the full victory they have rightly earn of this whole earlier stage the _ junior subaltern _ be the lead figure it be he -- let I insist upon it anew -- whose spirit make the new army if the tender figure of the _ lady of the lamp _ have become for many of we the chief symbol of the crimean struggle when britain come to embody in sculpture or in painting that which have touch she most deeply in this war she will choose -- surely -- the figure of a boy of nineteen laughing eager undaunted as quick to die as to live carry in he young hand the luck of england \* \* \* \* \* but with the end of 1915 the first stage the elementary stage of the new army come to a end when i stand in march 1916 on the scherpenberg hill look out over the salient new condition reign the officer cadet corps have be form a lively and continuous intercourse between the reality of the front and the training at home have be set up special school in all subject of military interest have be found often as we have see by the zeal of individual officer to be then gradually incorporate in the army system man insufficiently train in the early month have be give the opportunity -- which they eagerly take -- of begin at the beginning again correct mistake and incorporate all the latest knowledge even a lieutenant-colonel before command a battalion could go to school once more and even for officer and man in rest there be and be endless opportunity of see and learn which few wish to forgo and that bring I to what be now shape itself -- the final result the year just pass indeed -- from march to march -- have practically round we task -- though the learning of the army be never over -- and have see the transformation -- whether temporary or permanent who yet can tell -- of the england of 1914 with its zealous mob of untrained and tatterdemalion recruit into a great military power -lrb- this letter be finish just as the news of the easter Monday battle of arras be come in -rrb- dispose of army in no whit inferior to those of germany and bring to bear upon the science of war -- now that germany have force we to it -- the best intelligence and the best _ character _ of the nation the most insolent of the german military newspaper be already bitterly confess it \* \* \* \* \* my summary -- short and imperfect as it be -- of this first detailed account of its work which the war office have allow to be make public -- have carry I far afield the motor have be wait long at the door of the hospitable headquarters which have entertain we let I return to it to the great spectacle of the present -- after this retrospect of the past again the crowded road -- the young and vigorous troops -- the manifold sight illustrate branch after branch of the army i recall a draft tire with march clamber with joy into some empty lorry and sit there peacefully content with leg dangle and the ever bless cigarette for company then a aeroplane station -- then a football field with a violent game go on -- a casualty clearing station almost a large hospital -- another football match -- a battery of eighteen-pounder on the march and beyond a old french market town crowd with lorry and man in the midst of it d -- suddenly draw my attention to a succession of great nozzle pass we with they team and limber i have stand beside the forge and temper of they brother in the gun-shop of the north have watch the testing and callipering of they shine throat they be 6-inch naval gun on they way to the line -- like everything else part of the storm to come and in and out among the lorry and the gun stream the french folk woman child old man alert industrious full of hope with friendly look for they ally then the town pass and we be out again in the open country leave the mining village behind we be not very far at this point from that portion of the line which i see last year under general x 's guidance but everything look very quiet and rural and when we emerge on the high ground of the school we have come to see i might have imagine myself on a surrey or hertfordshire common the officer in charge a mighty hunter in civil life show we he work with a quiet but most contagious enthusiasm the problem that he and he colleague engage in similar work in other section of the front have to solve be -- how to beat the german at they own game of snipe which cost we so many life in the first year and a half of war in other word how to train a certain number of man to a art of rifle-shooting combine the instinct and device of a pathfinder with the subtlety of modern optical and mechanical science do not think of this as mean primarily to kill say the chief of the school as he walk beside I -- it be mean primarily to _ protect _ we lose we best man -- young and promising officer in particular -- by the score before we learn the trick of the german ` sniper ' and how to meet they german snipe as we guide explain be by no means all trick for the most part it mean just first-rate shooting combine with the trained instinct and _ flair _ of the sportsman be there anything that england -- and scotland -- should provide more abundantly still there be trick and we man have learn they of the many surprise of the school i may not now speak above all it be a school of _ observation _ nothing escape the eye or the ear every point for instance connect with we two unfamiliar figure will have be elaborately note by those man on the edge of the hill the officer in charge will presently get a careful report on we we teach we man the old great game of war -- wit against wit -- courage against courage -- life against life we try many man here and reject a good few but the man who have go through we training here be valuable both for attack and defense -- above all let I repeat it they be valuable for _ protection _ and what be mean by this i have since learn in greater detail before these school be start _ every day _ see a heavy toll -- especially of officer ' life -- take by german sniper compare with this one of the latest record : that out of fifteen battalion there be only nine man kill by sniper _ in three month _ we leave the hill half slide down the frozen watercourse that lead to it and be in the motor again bind for a army headquarters no 4 _ April 14th _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- as the news come flash in these April day and all the world hold its breath to hear the latest message from arras and the vimy ridge it be natural that in the memory of a woman who six week ago be a spectator -- before the curtain rise -- of the actual scene of such event every incident and figure of that past experience as she look back upon it should gain a peculiar and shine intensity the battle of the vimy ridge -lrb- _ April 8th _ -rrb- be clearly go to be the second -lrb- the first be the german retreat on the somme -rrb- of those decisive event determine this year the upshot of the war to which the commander-in-chief with so strong and just a confidence direct the eye of this country some three month ago when i be in the neighborhood of the great battlefield -- one may say it now -- the whole countryside be one vast preparation the sign of the come attack be everywhere -- troops gun ammunition food dump hospital air station -- every actor and every property in the vast and tragic play be on the spot ready for the moment and the word yet except in the headquarters and staff council of the army nobody know when the moment and the word would come and nobody speak of they the most careful and exact organization for the great movement be go on no visitor would hear anything of it only the nameless stir in the air the face of officer at headquarters the general alacrity the endless _ work _ everywhere prophesy the great thing ahead perpetual highly organised scientific drudgery be three part of war it seem as man now wage it the army as i see it be at work -- desperately at work -- but dream on thing to come one delightful hour of that march day stand out for I in particular the strong attractive presence of a army commander whose name will be for ever link with that of the battle of the vimy ridge surround by a group of distinguished officer a long table and a too brief stay conversation that carry for I the thrill of the _ actual thing _ close by though it may not differ very much from wartalk at home : these be the chief impression that remain the general beside I with that look in he kind eye which seem to tell of night shorten by hard work say a few quietly confident thing about the general situation and then we discuss a problem which one of the party -- not a soldier -- start be it true or untrue that long habituation to the see or inflict of pain and death that the mere sight and sound of the trench tend with time to brutalise man and will make they callous when they return to civil life do man grow hard and violent in this furnace after a while and will the national character suffer thereby in the future the general deny it strongly i see no sign of it the kindness of the man to each other to the wound whether british or german to the french civilian especially the woman and child be as mark as it ever be it be astonishing the good behavior of the man in these french town it be the rarest thing in the world to get a complaint i ask for some particulars of the way in which the british army run the french town and village in we zone how be it do it be all sum up in three word say a officer present m le maire what we should have do without the local functionary assign by the french system to every village and small town it be hard to say they be generally excellent people they have the confidence of they fellow townsman and know everything about they we authority on take over a town or village do all the preliminary through m le maire and all go well the part play indeed by these local chief of the civil population throughout france during the war have be a honorable and arduous -- in many case a tragic -- one the murder under the form of a court-martial of the maire of senli and he five fellow hostage stand out among the innumerable german cruelty as one of peculiar horror everywhere in the occupied department the maire have be the surety for he fellow and the german have handle they often as a cruel boy torment some bird or beast he have capture for the pleasure of show he power over it from the wife of the maire of a important town in lorraine i hear the story of how she husband have be carry off as a hostage for three week while the german be in occupation meanwhile german officer be billet in she charming old house they use to say to I every day with great politeness that they _ hope _ my husband would not be shoot ` but why should he be shoot monsieur he will do nothing to deserve it ' on which they would shrug they shoulder and say ` madame c'est la guerre ' evidently wish to see I terrify but i never give they that pleasure a long drive home through the dark and silent country yet everywhere one feel the presence of the army we draw up to look at a sign-post at some cross road by the light of one of the motor lamp instantly a couple of tommy emerge from the darkness and give help in pass through a village a gate suddenly open and a group of horse come out lead by two man in khaki or from a ymca hut laughter and song float out into the night and soon in these farm and cottage everybody will be asleep under the guard of the british force while twenty mile away in the darkness the gun we see in the morning be endlessly harass and scourge the enemy line prepare for the day when the thought now mature in the mind of the army leader will leap in flame to light \* \* \* \* \* to-day we be off for the somme i look out anxiously with the dawn and see streak of white mist lie over the village and the sun struggle through but as we start on the road to amien the mist gain the upper hand and we begin to be afraid that we shall not get any of those wide view from the west of albert over the somme country which be possible in clear weather again the high upland and this time _ three _ tank on the road but motionless alack the nozzle of they machine gun just visible on they great side then a main road if it can be call a road since the thaw have be at work upon it every mile or two as we chauffeur explain the pavé be all burst up from below and we rock and lunge through hole and rut that only a army motor can stand but german prisoner be thick on the worst bit repair as hard as they can be it perhaps on some of these man that certain of the recent letter that be always come into ghq have be find i will quote a few of those which have not yet see the light here be a batch of letter write in January of this year from hamburg and its neighborhood : it be indeed a miserable existence how will it all end there be absolutely nothing to be get here honey cost _ 6 6d _ a pound goose fat _ 18 _ a pound lovely price be not they one can not do much by way of heating as there be no coal we can just freeze and starve at home everybody be ill all the infirmary be overflow small-pox have break out you be be shoot at the front and at home we be gradually perish on the kaiser 's birthday military band play everywhere when one pass and listen to this tomfoolery and see the emaciated and overworked man in war-time sway to the sound of music and enjoy it one 's very gall rise why music of course if time be different one could enjoy music but to-day it should be the aim of the higher authority to put a end to this murder in every sound of music the dead cry for revenge i can assure you that it be very surprising that there have not be a single outbreak here but it neither can nor will last much longer how can a human be subsist on 1\/4 lb of potato a day i should very much like the emperor to try and live for a week on the fare we get he would then say it be impossible i hear something this week quite unexpectedly which although i have guess it before yet have depress I still more however we will hope for the best you write to say that you be worse off than a beast of burden i could not send you any cake as we have no more flour we have abundant bread ticket from Thursday to Saturday i can still buy five loaf my health be bad not my asthma no but my whole body be collapse we be all slowly perish and this be what it be all come to the outlook here be also sad one can not get a bucket of coal the store and dealer have none the school be close as there be no coal soon everybody will be in the same plight neither coal nor vegetable can be buy holland be send we nothing more and we have none we get 3-1\/2 lb of potato per person in the next few day we shall only have swede to eat which must be dry \* \* \* \* \* a letter write from hamburg in February and other from coblenz be tragic reading : we shall soon have nothing more to eat we earn no money absolutely none it be sad but true many people be die here from inanition or under-feeding or take these from neugersdorf in saxony : we can not send you any butter for we have none to eat ourselves for three week we have not be able to get any potato so we only have turnip to eat and now there be no more to be have we do not know what we can get for dinner this week and if we settle to get we food at the public food-kitchen we shall have to stand two hour for it here be February once more -- one month nearer to peace otherwise all be the same turnip turnip very few potato only a little bread and no thought of butter or meat on the other hand any quantity of hunger i understand you case be not much better on the somme or this from a man of the ersatz battalion 19th far dresden : since January 16th i have be call up and put into the foot artillery at dresden on the 16th we be first take to the quartermaster 's store where 2000 of we have to stand wait in the rain from 230 to 630 on the 23rd i be transfer to the tennis ground we be more than 100 man in one room nearly all of we have freeze limb at present the food too be bad sometimes it can not possibly be eat we training also be very quick for we be to go _ into the field in six week _ or these from itzehoe and hanover : could you get I some silk it cost 8 a metre here to-day the 24th all the shop be storm for bread and 1000 loaf be steal from the bakery there be several other thousand in stock in some shop the window be smash in the grocer ' shop the butter barrel be roll into the street there be soldier in civilian dress the mayor want to hang they there be no potato this week to-day the 27th the baker ' shop in the -- road be storm this afternoon the butcher ' shop be to be storm if only peace would come soon we have be stand to for a alarm these last day as the people here be storm all the baker ' shop it be a semi-revolution it can not last much longer to such a pass have the kaiser and the junker party bring they countryman here no doubt be some of the recipient of such letter among the peaceful working group in shabby green-grey scatter along the road of france as we pass the german nco often look up to salute the officer who be with we and the general aspect of the man -- at any rate of the younger man -- be cheerfully phlegmatic at least they be safe from the british gun and at least they have enough to eat as to this let I quote by way of contrast a few passage from letter write by prisoner in a british camp to they people at home one might feel a quick pleasure in the creature-comfort they express but for the burning memory of we own prisoner and the way in which thousand of they have be cruelly ill-treated torment even in germany -- worst of all perhaps by german woman the extract be take from letter write mostly in December and January last : -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- dear wife do not fret about I because the english treat we very well only we own officer -lrb- nco 's -rrb- treat we even worse than they do at home in barracks but that we be accustom to -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- i be now a prisoner in english hand and i be quite comfortable and content with my lot for most of my comrade be dead the english treat we well and everything that be say to the contrary be not true we food be good there be no meatless day but we have not any cigar -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- write from hospital near manchester : i have be a prisoner since October 1916 i be extremely comfortable here consider the time i really could not wish you all anything better than to be here too -lrb- _ d _ -rrb- i be afraid i be not in a position to send you very detailed letter about my life at present but i can tell you that i be quite all right and comfortable and that i wish every english prisoner be the same we new commandant be very humane -- strict but just you can tell everybody who think differently that i shall always be glad to prove that he be wrong -lrb- _ e _ -rrb- i suppose you be all think that we be have a very bad time here as prisoner it be true we have to do without a good many thing but that after all one must get accustom to the english be really good people which i never would have believe before i be take prisoner they try all they can to make we lot easier for we and you know there be a great many of we now so do not be distressed for we x be pass a large and prosperous town with mill in a hollow we climb the hill beyond it and be off on a long and gradual descent to amien this picard country present everywhere the same general feature of roll downland thrive village old church comfortable country house straight road and well-kept wood the battlefield of the somme be once a continuation of it but on this march day the upland be wind-swept and desolate and chilly white mist curl about they with occasional burst of pale sun out of the mist there emerge suddenly a anti-aircraft section then a great army service dump and presently we catch sight of a row of hangar and the follow notice beware of aeroplane ascend and descend across road for a time the possibility of charge into a biplane give zest to we progress as we fly along the road which cut the aerodrome but alack there be none visible and we begin to drop towards amien then outside the town sentinel stop we french and british we pass be examine and under they friendly look -- betray a little surprise -- we drive on into the old street i be in amien two year before the war between train that i might refresh a somewhat fade memory of the cathedral but not such a crowded such a busy amien as this the street be so full that we have to turn out of the main street direct by a french military policeman and find we way by a détour to the cathedral as we pass through amien arrangement be go on for the take over of another large section of the french line south of albert as far it be rumor as roye and lagny at last with we new army we can relieve more of the french division who have bear so gallantly and for so many month the burden of they long line it be true that the bulk of the german force be mass against the british line and that in some part of the center and the east owing to the nature of the ground they be but thinly string along the french front which account partly for the disproportion in the number of kilometre cover by each ally but also we have to make we army the french god be thank have theirs ready and gloriously have they stand the brunt as the defender of civilisation till we could take we full share and now we who begin with 45 kilometre of the battle-line have gradually become responsible for 185 so that at last say a french friend to I in paris we man can have a rest some of they for the first time and by heaven they have earn it yet in this take over there be many feeling concern for the french _ poilu _ and we tommy it be mostly the occasion for as much fraternisation as they fragmentary knowledge of each other 's speech allow the frenchman be proud to show he line the britisher be proud to take it over there be laughter and eager good will on the whole it be a red-letter day but sometimes there strike in a note too deep for tear here be a fragment from a account of a take over write by a eye-witness : train of a prodigious length be crawl up a french railway one follow so closely upon another that the rear truck of the first be rarely out of sight of the engine-driver of the second these train be full of british soldier most of they be go to the front for the first time they be seat everywhere on the truck on the roof -- leg dangle over the edge -- inside and even over the buffer presently they arrive at they goal the man clamber out on to the siding collect they equipment and be ready for a march up country a few child run alongside they shout anglai anglai and some of they take the soldier ' hand and walk on with they until they be tire now the trench be reach and the man break into single file but the occasion be not the usual one of take over a few trench _ we be relieve some sixty mile of french line _ there be however no confusion the right man be send to the right place and everything be do quietly it be like a great tide sweep in and another sweep out sixty mile of trench be gradually change they nationality the german a few yard over the way know quite well what be happen a few extra shell whizz by a trench mortar or two splutter a welcome but it make little difference to the weary german who man the trench over against he only the new man be fresh and untired and the german have no ally who can give he corresponding relief it have all be so quietly do yet it be really a great moment the store of man power which great britain possess be begin to take practical effect the french who hold the long line at the beginning of war who stand before verdun and throw they legion on the road to péronne be now be free for work elsewhere they have carry on till great britain be ready and now she be ready \* \* \* \* \* this be more than the beginning of a new tour of duty -lrb- say another witness -rrb- i feel the need of some ceremony and i think other feel the need of it too there be little half-articulate attempt in the darkness of man try to show what they feel -- a whisper or two -- in the queer jargon that be grow up between the two army a english sentry mount upon the fire-step and look out into the darkness beside the frenchman and then before the frenchman step down pat he on the shoulder as though he would say : these trench -- _ all right _ -- we 'll look after they then i stumble into a dug-out a candle burnt there and a french officer be take up he thing he nod and smile i go he say i be not sorry and yet -- he shrug he shoulder i understand one be never sorry to go but these trench -- these bit of france where frenchman have die -- would no longer be guard by frenchman then he wave he hand round the little dug-out we give a little more of france into you keep he gesture be extravagant and light but he face be grave as he say it he turn and go out i follow he walk along the communication trench after he man and i along the line of my silent sentry i speak to one or two and then stand on the fire-step look out into the night i have the frenchman 's word in my head : we give a little more of france into you keep it be not these trench only where i stand but all that lay out there in the darkness which have be give into we keep its danger be ours now there be village away there in the heart of the night still unknown to all but the expert at home whose name -- like thiepval and bazentin -- would soon be english name familiar to every man in britain as the street of he own town all this france have entrust to we care this night such be the scene that be quietly go on not much notice by the public at home during the week of February and march and such be the thought in man 's mind how plainly one catch through the word of the last speaker a eager prescience of event to come -- the sweep of general gough on warlencourt and bapaume -- the french reoccupation of péronne one word for the cathedral of amien before we leave the bustling street of the old picard capital this be so far untouched and unharmed though expose like everything else behind the front to the bomb of german aeroplane the great west front have disappear behind a mountain of sandbag the side portal be protect in the same way and inside the superb carving of the choir be bury out of sight but at the back of the choir the famous weep cherub sit weep as before peacefully querulous there be something irritating in he placid and too artistic grief not so be rachel weep for she child in this war-ravaged country sterner image of sorrow be want here -- look out through burning eye for the expiation to come \* \* \* \* \* then we be off bind for albert though first of all for the headquarters of the particular army which have this region in charge the weather alack be still thick it be under cover of such a atmosphere that the german have be steal away remove gun and store wherever possible and leave rear-guard to delay we advance but when the rear-guards amount to some 100000 man resistance be still formidable not to be handle with anything but extreme prudence by those who have such vast interest in charge as the general of the ally we way take we first through a small forest where systematic felling and cut be go on under british forestry expert the work be be do by german prisoner and we catch a glimpse through the tree of they camp of hut in a barbed-wire enclosure they guard sleep under canvas and now we be in the main street of a large picturesque village approach a château a motor lorry come towards we drive at a smart pace and fill with grey-green uniform prisoner -- this time fresh from the field we have already hear rumor on we way of successful fight to the south the famous army commander himself who have send we a kind invitation to lunch with he be unexpectedly engage in conference with a group of french general but there be a welcome suggestion that on we way back from the somme he will be free and able to see I meanwhile we go off to luncheon and much talk with some member of the staff in a house on the village street everywhere i notice the same cheerful one might even say radiant confidence no boasting in word but a conviction that penetrate through all talk that the tide have turn and that however long it may take to come fully up it be we whom it be float surely on to that fortune which be no blind hazard but the child of high faith and untiring labor of that labor the somme battlefield we be now to see will always remain in my mind -- in spite of ruin in spite of desolation -- as a kind of parable in action never to be forget no 5 _ April 26th _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- amid the rush event of these day -- america rouse herself like a eagle with eye intentive to bedare the sun the steady and victorious advance along the whole front in france which day by day be change the whole aspect of the war the balfor mission the sign of deep distress in germany -- it be sometimes difficult to throw oneself back into the mood of even six week ago history be come so fast off the loom and yet six week ago i stand at the pregnant beginning of it all when though nature in the bitter frost and slush of early march show no sign of spring the winter lull be over and everywhere on the british front man know that great thing be stir before i reach ghq field-marshal sir dougla haig have already report the recapture or surrender of eleven village on the ancre during February include serre and gommecourt which have defy we effort in the summer of 1916 that be to say after three month of trench routine and trench endurance impose by a winter which seem to have let loose every possible misery of cold and wet of storm and darkness on the fight host in france the battle of the somme have move steadily forward again from the point it have reach in November only when the curtain rise on the new scene it be find that during these three month strange thing have be happen about the middle of November after general gough 's brilliant stroke on the ancre which give we st pierre divion beaucourt and beaumont hamel and take we up to the outskirts of grandcourt the _ frankfurter zeitung _ write -- for we german the day of the crisis on the somme be over let the french and english go on sacrifice the youth of they country here they will not thereby achieve anything more yet when this be write the german higher command be already well aware that the battle of the somme have be win by the ally and that it would be impossible for germany to hold out on the same ground against another similar attack three month however of a extraordinarily hard winter give they a respite and enable they to veil the fact from they own people the preparation for retirement which snow and fog and the long night of January help they to conceal in part from we air service must have actually begin not many week after general gough 's last success on the ancre when the british advance pause under stress of weather before grandcourt and bapaume so that in the latter half of February when general gough again push forward it be to feel the german line yield before he and by march 3rd the day of my visit to the somme it be only a question of how far the german would go and what the retreat mean meanwhile in another section of the line we own plan be mature which be to bear fruit five week later in the brilliant capture of that vimy ridge i have see on march 2 fill the blue middle distance from the bare upland of notre dame de lorette if on the somme the anvil be to some extent escape from the hammer in the coming battle of arras the hammer be to take its full revenge these thing however be still hide from all but the few and in the first day of march the german have not yet begin to retire in front of the french line further south the somme advance be still the center of thing and bapaume have not yet fall as we drive on towards albert we know that we should be soon close behind we own gun and within range of the enemy 's no one who have see it in war-time will ever forget the market-place of albert -- the colossal heap of wreck that fill the center of it the new pretentious church rise above the heap a brick-and-stucco building of the worst neo-catholic taste which have be so gash and tear and break while still substantially intact that all its mean and tawdry ornament have disappear in a certain strange dignity of ruin and last the hang virgin hold up the babe above the devastation below in dumb protest to god and man the gilded statue which now hang at right angle to the tower have after its original collapse under shell-fire be fix in this position by the french engineer and it be to be hope that when the church come to be rebuild the figure will be leave as it be there be something extraordinarily significant and dramatic in its present attitude whatever artistic defect the statue may have be out of sight and it seem as it hang there passionately hover above the once busy center of a prosperous town to be the very symbol and voice of france call the world to witness a few more minute and we be through the town move slowly along the albert-bapaume road that famous road which will be a pilgrim ' way for generation to come to other folk write a officer quote by mr buchan in he _ battle of the somme _ and on the map one place seem just like another i suppose but to we -- la boisselle and oviller -- my hat to walk about in those hell i go along the sunken road all the way to contalmaison talk about sacred ground the new troops come up now go barge across in the most light-hearted way it mean no more to they than the road behind use to mean to we but when i think how we water every yard of it with blood and sweat child might play there now if it do not look so like the aftermath of a earthquake i have a sort of feel it ought to be mark off somehow a permanent memorial the same emotion as that which speak in this letter -- so far at least as it can be share by those who have no part in the grim scene itself -- hold we the first women-pilgrim to tread these road and trample slope since the battle-storm of last autumn pass over they the sound of a immortal host seem to rush past we on the air -- mingled strangely with the memory of hot July day in a english garden far away when the news of the great advance come thunder in hour by hour the aftermath of a earthquake do the word express the reality before we as we move along the mile of road between albert and la boisselle hardly the earth-shudder that visit a volcanic district may topple town and village into ruin in a few minute it do not tear and grind and pound what it have overturn through hour after hour till there be nothing left but mud and dust not only all vegetation but all the natural surface of the ground here have go and the village be churn into the soil as though some hundred-handed gya have be mix and knead they into a devil 's dough there be no continuous shell-hole as we have expect to see those belong to the ground further up the ridge where fourteen square mile be so closely shell-pocked that one can hardly drive a stake between the hole but here on the way to la boisselle and contalmaison there be just the raw tumble earth from which all the natural covering of grass and tree and all the handiwork of man have be strip and tear and hammer away so that it have become a great dark wound on the countryside suddenly we see gaping line of old trench rise on either side of the road the white chalk of the subsoil mark they course british say the officer in front -- who be himself in the battle only a few step further on as it seem we come to the remains of the german front line and the motor pause while we try to get we bearing there to the south on we right and curve eastward be two trench line perfectly clear still on the brown desolation the british and the enemy front line from that further line at half-past seven on the summer morning for ever blazon in the annals of we people the british army go over the parapet to gather in the victory prepare for it by the deadly strength and accuracy of british gun make possible in its turn by the labor in far-off england of million of worker -- man and woman -- on the lathe and in the fill factory of these island we move on up the road now we be among what remain of the trench and dug-out describe in sir dougla haig 's despatch during nearly two year ' preparation the enemy have spare no pain to render these defence impregnable say the commander-in-chief and he go on to describe the successive line of deep trench the bomb-proof shelter and the wire entanglement with which the war correspondence of the winter have make we at home -- on paper -- so familiar the numerous wood and village have be turn into veritable fortress the deep cellar in the village the pit and quarry of a chalk country provide cover for machine gun and trench mortar the dug-out be often two storey deep and connect by passage as much as thirty foot below the surface of the ground strong redoubt mine-field concrete gun emplacement -- everything that the best brain of the german army could devise for we destruction -- have be lavish on the german line and behind the first line be a second -- and behind the second line a third and now here we stand in the midst of what be once so vast a system what remains of it -- and of all the workings of the german mind that devise it we leave the motor and go to look into the dug-out which line the road out of which the daze and die german fling themselves at the approach of we man after the bombardment and then captain f guide we a little further to a huge mine crater and we sink into the mud which surround it while my eye look out over what once be oviller northward towards thiépval and the slope behind which run the valley of the ancre up and over this tear and naked land where the new army of great britain through five month of some of the deadliest fighting know to history fight they way yard by yard ridge after ridge mile after mile caring nothing for pain mutilation and death so that england and the cause of the ally might live _ there be no straggler none _ let we never forget that cry of exultant amazement wring from the lip of a eye-witness who see the young untried troops go over the parapet in the July dawn and disappear into the hell beyond and there in the packed graveyard that dot these slope lie thousand of they in immortal sleep and as the greek in after day know no nobler oath than that which pledge a man by those who fall at marathon so may the memory of those who fall here burn ever in the heart of england a stern and consecrate force life be but the pebble sink deed the circle grow and from the deed do on this hillside the suffering endure the life give up the victory win by every kind and type of man within the british state -- rich and poor noble and simple street-man from british town country-man from british village man from canadian prairie from australian and new zealand homestead -- one have a vision as one look on into the future of the impulse give here spread out through history unquenched and imperishable the fight be not over -- the victory be not yet -- but on the somme no english or french heart can doubt the end the same thought follow one along the sunken road to contalmaison here first be the cemetery of la boisselle this heap confusion of sandbag of broken and overturn cross of grave toss into a common ruin and a little further be the ruin of contalmaison where the 3rd division of the prussian guard be break and 700 of they take prisoner terrible be the memory of contalmaison recall one letter only -- the letter write by a german soldier the day before the attack : nothing come to we -- no letter the english keep such a barrage on we approach -- it be horrible to-morrow morning it will be seven day since this bombardment begin we can not hold out much longer everything be shoot to piece and from another letter : every one of we in these five day have become year older -- we hardly know ourselves it be among these intricate remains of trench and dug-out round the fragment of the old chateau that such thing happen here and among those ghastly fragment of shattered wood that one see to south and east -- mametz trônes delville high wood -- human suffering and heroism human daring and human terror on one side and on the other reach they height for century after the battle of marathon sound of armed man and horse be hear by night and to pry upon that sacred rendezvous of the soul of the slay be frown on by the god only the man who pass through innocently and ignorantly not know where he be could pass through safely and here also in day to come those who visit these spot in mere curiosity as though they be any ordinary sight will visit they to they hurt \* \* \* \* \* so let the first thought run which be evolve by this brown and torn devastation but the tension naturally pass and one come back first to the _ victory _ -- to the result of all that hard and relentless fight both for the british and the french force on this memorable battlefield north and south of the somme eighty thousand prisoner between five and six hundred gun of different calibre and more than a thousand machine gun have fall to the ally in four month and a half many square mile of french territory have be recover verdun -- glorious verdun -- have be relieve italy and russium have be help by the concentration of the bulk of the german force on the western front the enemy have lose at least half a million man and the ally loss though great have be substantially less we new army have gloriously prove themselves and the legend of german invincibility be go so much for the first-fruit the _ ultimate result _ be only now begin to appear in the steady retreat of german force unable to stand another attack on the same line now that the protection of the winter pause be over how far be we from we gun i ask the officer beside I and as i speak a flash to the north-east on the higher ground towards pozières light up the gray distance my companion measure the hillside with he eye about 1000 yard they objective now be a temporary german line in front of bapaume but we shall be in bapaume in a few day and then _ death _ -- _ victory _ -- _ work _ these be the three lead impression that rise and take symbolic shape amid these scene let I turn now to the last for anyone with the common share of heart and imagination the first think here must be of the dead -- the next of swarm life for these slope and road and ruin be again alive with man thousand and thousand of we soldier be here many of they go up to or come back from the line while other be work -- work -- incessantly at all that be mean by advance and consolidation the transformation of a line of battle into a efficient back of the army require it seem a amazing amount of human energy contrivance and endurance and what we see now be of course a second or third stage first of all there be the clear up of the actual battlefield for this the work of the man now at work here -- re 's and labor battalion -- be too skilled and too valuable it be do by fatigue and bury party from the battalion in occupation of each capture section the dead be bury the poor human fragment that remain be cover with chlorate of lime equipment of all kind the litter of the battlefield be bring back to the salvage dump there to be sort and send back to the basis for repair then -- or simultaneously -- begin the work of the engineer and the labor man enough ground have to be level and shell-hole fill up for the drive through of new road and railway and the provision of place where tent hut dump etc be to stand roughly speak i see as i look round I that a great deal of this work be here already far advance there be hundred of man cart and horse at work on the road and everywhere one see the sign of new railway line either of the ordinary breadth or of the narrow gauge need for the advanced carriage of food and ammunition here also be a great encampment of nissen hut there fresh preparation for a food or a ammunition dump with one pair of eye one can only see a fraction of what be in truth go on but the whole effect be one of vast and increase industry of a intensity of determine effort which thrill the mind hardly less than the thought of the battle-line itself yes war _ be _ work write a officer who go through the somme fight much more than it be fight this be one of the surprise that the new army soldier find out here yet for the hope of the fight moment man will go cheerfully through any drudgery in the long day before and after and when the fighting come will bear themselves to the wonder of the world on we move slowly towards fricourt the shatter remnant of the mametz wood upon we leave more graveyard carefully tend space of peace amid the universal movement and always on the southern horizon those clear line of british trench whence spring on July 1st 1916 the irresistible attack on montauban and mametz suddenly over the desolate ground to the west we see a man hover in mid-air descend on a parachute from a captive balloon that seem to have suffer mishap the small waver object come slowly down we can not see the landing but it be probably a safe one then we be on the main albert road again and after some rapid mile i find myself kindly welcome by one of the most famous leader of the war there in a small room which have surely see work of the first importance to we victory on the somme a great general discuss the situation and the future with that same sober and reason confidence i have find everywhere among the representative of we higher command be we approach victory yes but it be too soon to use the great word itself everything be go well but the enemy be still very strong this year will decide it but may not end it \* \* \* \* \* so far my recollection of march 3rd but this be now April 26th and all the time that i have be write these recollection think have be leap forward to the actual present -- to the huge struggle now pend between arras and rheim -- to the news that come crowd in day by day of the american preparation in aid of the ally -- to all that be at stake for we and for you you eye be now turn like ours to the battle-line in france you triumph -- and you suffer -- with we no 6 _ may 3rd _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- my last letter leave I return to we village lodgings under the wing of ghq after a memorable day on the somme battle-field that night the talk at the visitor ' château during and after a very simple dinner in a old panelled room be particularly interesting and animated the morning 's newspaper have just arrive from england with the official communique of the morning we be push nearer and nearer to bapaume in the fighting of the precede day we have take another 128 prisoner and the king have send he congratulation to sir dougla haig and the army on the german withdrawal under the steady and persistent pressure of the british army from carefully prepare and strongly fortify position -- a fitting sequel to the fine achievement of my army last year in the battle of the somme there be also a report on the air-fighting and air-loss of February -- to which i will return it be of course already obvious that the german retreat on the somme be not -- so far -- go to yield we any very large capture of man or gun prisoner be indeed collect every day but there be no haul such as little more than a month after this evening of march 3rd be to mark the very different course of the battle of arras discussion turn upon the pace of the german retreat and the possible rate of we pursuit do not forget say a officer that they be move over good ground while the pursuit have to move over bad ground -- road with crater in they grind so pit with shell-hole that you can scarcely drive a peg between they demolish bridge village that give scarcely any cover and so on the enemy have he gun with he ours have to be push up over the bad ground he machine-gun be always in pick and prepare position ours have to be improvise and also -- do not forget the weather say another every misty day -- and there be many in February -- be very skilfully turn to account whenever the weather condition make it impossible to use the eye of we air service man would say to each other on we side he 'll go back a lot to-day -- somewhere or other but in spite of secrecy and fog how little respite we have give he the enemy loss in casualty prisoner and store during February be certainly considerable not to speak of the major loss of all that of the strongly fortify line on which two year of the most arduous and ingenious labor that even germany can give have be lavish and almost everywhere write a eye-witness he be hustle and harry much more than be generally know as you go eastward for instance across the evacuate ground you notice everywhere sign of increase haste and flurry such as the less complete felling of tree and telegraph post it be really a fine performance for we infantry and we cavalry patrol necessarily unsupported by _ anything like we full artillery strength _ to keep up the constant pressure they do on a enemy who enjoy almost the full protection of he it be dreadful country to live and fight in after the german have go back over it much worse than anything that troops have to face after any ordinary capture of a enemy line the fact be that old axiom be be everywhere revise in the light of this war in former war the extreme difficulty of a retreat in the face of the enemy be take for grant but this war -- i be try to summarise some first-hand opinion as it have reach I -- have modify this point of view considerably we know now that for any serious attack on a enemy who have plenty of machine-gun and plenty of successive well-wired position a great mass of heavy and other artillery be absolutely indispensable and over ground deliberately wreck and obstruct such artillery _ must _ take time to bring up and yet -- to repeat -- how rapidly how persistently all difficulty consider to use the king 's adjective have the british army press on the heel of the retreat enemy none of the officer with whom i talk believe that anything more could have be do by we than be do if it have be we who be retreat write one of they and the german who be pursue i do not believe they would have push we so hard or cause we as much loss for all they pride in they staff work and it be of course evident from what have happen since i parted from my host at the château that we have now amply succeed during the last few week in bring the retreat enemy to bay no more mask withdrawal no more skilful evasion for either hindenburg or he army the victory of easter week on and beyond the vimy ridge and the renew british attack of the last few day -- i be write on may 1st -- together with the magnificent french advance towards laon and to the east of reim have be so many fresh and crush testimony to the vitality and gathering force of the ally army what be to be the issue we wait to see but at least after the winter lull it be once more join and with such a army as the war office and the nation together during these three year have fashion to he hand -- so train so equip so fire with a common and inflexible spirit -- sir dougla haig and he lieutenant will not fail the hope of great britain of france -- and of america at the beginning of march these last word could not have be add there be a american professor not far from I at dinner and we discuss the blaze indiscretion of herr zimmermann 's mexican letter but he know no more than i only i remember with pleasure the general tone of all the conversation about america that i either engage in or listen to at headquarters just a month before the historic meeting of congress it be one of intelligent sympathy with the difficulty in you way couple with a quiet confidence that the call of civilisation and humanity would very soon -- and irrevocably -- decide the attitude of america towards the war \* \* \* \* \* the evening at the château pass only too quickly and we be sad to say good-bye though it leave I still the prospect of further conversation with some member of the intelligence staff on my return journey from pari and those point of the french line for which thanks to the courtesy of the french headquarters i be now bind the last night under the little schoolmistress 's quiet roof amid the deep stillness of the village be a wakeful one for I the presence of the new army as of some vast impersonal and yet intensely live thing seem to be all around I first as a organization as the amazing product of english patriotic intelligence devote to one sole end -- the defense of civilisation against the immoral attack of the strongest military machine in the world and then so to speak as a moral entity for my mind be full of the sight and sound of the precede day and the army appear to I not only as the mighty instrument for war which it already be but as a training school for the empire likely to have incalculable effect upon the future how much i have hear of _ training _ since my arrival in france it be not a word that have be so far representative of we english temper far from it the central idea of english life and politics say mr bright be the assertion of personal liberty it be i suppose this assertion of personal liberty which drive we extreme liberal wing before the war into that determine fighting of the naval and military estimate year after year that determine hatred of anything that look like militarism and that constant belittlement of the soldier and he profession which so nearly hand we over for lack of a reasonable militarism to the tender mercy of the german variety but year ago matthew arnold dare to say in face of the general british approval of mr bright that there be after all something greater than the assertion of personal liberty than the freedom to do as you like and he put forward against it the notion of the nation in its collect and corporate character control the individual will in the name of a interest wider than that of individual what he have in view be surely just what we be witness in great britain to-day -- what we be about to witness in you own country -- a nation become the voluntary servant of a idea and for that idea submit itself to form of life quite new to it and far remove from all its ordinary habit give up the freedom to do as it like accept the extremity of discomfort hardship and pain -- death itself -- rather than abandon the idea and so put itself to school resolutely and of its own free will that when its piece of self-imposed education be do it can no more be the same as it be before than the youth who have yield himself loyally to the pound and stretch of any strenuous discipline intellectual or physical training -- askêsis -- with either death or the loss of all that make honorable life as the ultimate sanction behind the process that be the present preoccupation of this nation in arm even the football game i see go on in the course of we drive to albert be all part of this training they be no mere amusement though they be amusement they be part of the system by which man be persuade -- not drive -- to submit themselves to a scheme of careful physical training even in they time of rest by which they find themselves so invigorate that they end by demand it as for the elaboration of everything else in this frightful art of war the ever-multiplying staff course the bombing and bayonet school the special musketry and gas school the daily and weekly development of aviation the technical industry and skill both among the gunner abroad and the factory worker at home which have now make we artillery the terror of the german army : a woman can only realize it with a shudder and find comfort in two belief first that the whole horrible process of war have _ not _ brutalise the british soldier -- you remember the army commander whom i quote in a earlier letter -- that he still remain human and warm-hearted through it all protect morally by the ideal he willingly serve secondly in the conviction that this relentless struggle be the only mean that remain to we of so chain up the wild beast of war as the german have let it loose upon the world that we child and grandchild at least shall live in peace and have time give they to work out a more reasonable scheme of thing but at any rate we have go a long way from the time when matthew arnold talk with the manager of the claycross work in derbyshire during the crimean war when we want of soldier be much feel and some people be talk of conscription be tell by he companion that sooner than submit to conscription the population of that district would flee to the mine and lead a sort of robin hood life underground a illuminating passage in more way than one by the way as contrast with the present state of thing -- since it both show the stubbornness of the british temper in defense of do as it like when no spark of a ideal motive fire it and also bring out its equal stubbornness to-day in support of a cause which it feel to be supreme over the individual interest and will but the stubbornness the discipline the sacrifice of the army in the field be not all we want the stubbornness of the nation _ at home _ of the man and the woman be no less necessary to the great end in these early day of march every week 's news be bring home to england the grow peril of the submarine attack would the married woman the elder woman of the nation rise to the demand for personal thought and save for _ training _ -- in the matter of food -- with the same eager goodwill as thousand of the younger woman have show in meet the army ' demand for munitions for the woman head of household have it largely in they hand the answer at the beginning of march be matter for anxiety it be still matter for anxiety now -- at the beginning of may let we however return for a little to the army what would the marvellous organization which england have produce in three year avail we without the spirit in it -- the body without the soul all through these day i have be conscious in the responsible man i have be meeting of ideal of which no one talk except when on very rare occasion it happen to be in the day 's work like anything else to talk of ideal -- but which be in fact omnipresent i find for instance among my war office note a short address give in the ordinary course of duty by a unnamed commandant to he officer-cadet it appear here in its natural place just as part of the whole reveal for a moment the thought which constantly underlie it believe I when i tell you that i have never find a officer who work who do not come through only ill-health and death stand in you way the former you can guard against in a great measure the latter come to we all and for a soldier a soldier 's death be the finest of all fear of death do not exist for the man who have lead a good and honest life you must discipline you body and you mind -- you body by keep they healthy and strong you mind by prayer and think as to the relation between officer and man that also be not talk about much except in its more practical and workaday aspect -- the interest take by officer in the man 's comfort and welfare they readiness to share in the man 's game and amusement and so on and no one pretend that the whole british army be a army of plaster saint that every officer be the little father of he man and all relation ideal but what become evident as one penetrate a little nearer to the great organism be a sense of passionate responsibility in all the finer mind of the army towards they man a readiness to make any sacrifice for they a deep and abide sense of they suffering and danger of all that they be give to they country how this come out again and again in the innumerable death-story of british officer -- those few word that commemorate they in the daily newspaper and how evident be the profound response of the man to such a temper in they officer there be not a day 's action in the field -- i be but quote the eye-witness -- that do not bring out such fact let a senior officer -- a old and try soldier -- speak he be describe a walk over a battlefield on the ancre after one of we victory there last November : it be a curious thing to walk over enemy trench that i have watch like a tiger for week and week but what of the boy who take those trench with they eleven row of barb wire in front of they i do not think i ever before to-day rate the british soldier at he proper value he suffering in this weather be indescribable when he be not in the trench he discomfort be enough to kill any ordinary mortal when he be in the trench it be a mixture between the north pole and hell and yet when the moment come he jump up and charge at the impossible -- and conquer it some of the poor fellow who lay there as they fall look to I absolutely noble and i think of they family who be ache for news of they and hope against hope that they would not be leave unburied in they misery all the loving and tender thought that be lavish on they be not enough there be no word to describe the large heart of these man god bless 'em and what of the french on whose soil they lie can they ever forget the blood that be mingle with they own i hope not i do not think england have ever have as much cause to be proud as she have to-day ah such thought and feeling cut deep they would be unbearable but for the saving salt of humor in which this whole great gathering of man so to speak move suspend as though in a atmosphere it be everywhere coarse or refine it be the universal protection whether from the minor discomfort or the more frightful risk of war volume could be fill have already be fill with it -- volume to which you american soldier when he get to france in he thousand will add considerably -- page all he own i take this touch in pass from a recent letter : a sergeant in my company -lrb- write a young officer -rrb- be the other day bury by a shell he be dig out with difficulty as he lay not seriously injured but sputter and choke against the wall of the trench he co come by ` well so-and-so awfully sorry can i do anything for you ' ` sir ' say the sergeant with dignity still struggle out of the mud ' _ i want a separate peace _ ' and here be another incident that have just come across I whether it be humor or pathos i do not know in this scene they be pretty close together -- the great sister a young fly officer in a night attack be hit by a shrapnel bullet from below he think it have strike he leg but be so absorb in drop he bomb and bring down he machine safely that although he be aware of a feeling of faintness he think no more of it till he have land in the aerodrome then it be discover that he leg have be shoot away be literally hang by a shred of skin and how he have escape bleed to death nobody could quite understand as it be he have drop he bomb and he insist on make he report in hospital he recover from the subsequent operation and in hospital some week afterwards he co appear with the news of he recommendation for the dso the boy for he be little more listen with eye of amuse incredulity open wider and wider as the colonel proceed when the communication be over and the co attribute the young man 's silence to weakness or grateful emotion have pass on the nurse beside the bed see the patient bury he head in the pillow with a queer sound of exasperation and catch the word i call it _ perfectly childish _ that a act so simple so all in the bargain should have earn the dso seem in the eye of the doer to degrade the honor \* \* \* \* \* with this true tale i have come back to a recollection of the word of the fly officer in charge of the aerodrome mention in my second letter after he have describe to I the incessant raiding and fighting of we airman behind the enemy line many of they do not come back what then _ they will have do they job _ the report which reach the château on we last evening illustrate this casual remark it show that 89 machine be lose during February 60 of they german we claim 41 of these and 23 british machine be miss or bring down but as i write the conclude word of this letter -lrb- may 3rd -rrb- a far more startling report -- that for April -- lie before I there have not be a month of such fighting since the war begin and the loss have never reach such a tremendous figure say the _ time _ the record number so far be that for September 1916 in the height of the somme fighting -- 322 but during April accord to the official report the enormous number of 717 aeroplane be bring to earth as the result of air-fight or by gun-fire of these 369 be german -- 269 of they bring down by the british and 98 by the french the british lose 147 the french and belgian if the german claim can be trust 201 it be a terrible list and a terrible testimony to the extreme importance and intensity of the air-fighting now go on how few of we except those who have relative or dear friend in the air-service realize at all the condition of this fighting -- its daring its epic range its constant development all the man in it be young none of they can have such a thing as a nerve anyone who betray the faintest suspicion of one in he first flight be courteously but firmly return to he regiment in peace the airman see this solid earth of ours as no one else see it and in war he make acquaintance by day and night with all its new and strange aspect amid every circumstance of danger and excitement with death always at hand he life stake not only against the enemy and all he device on land and above it but against wind and cloud against the treachery of the very air itself in the midst of these condition the fighting airman shoot dodge pursue and dive intent only on one thing the destruction of he enemy while the observer photograph mark he map with every gun-emplacement railway station dump of food or ammunition unconcerned by the fly shell or the strange dive and swoop of the machine but apart from active fighting take such a common experience as what be call a long reconnaissance pilot and observer receive they order to reconnoitre thoroughly a certain area it may be winter and the cold at the height of many thousand foot may be formidable indeed no matter the thing be do and after hour in the freezing air the machine make for home through a winter evening perhaps as we see the two splendid biplane near the northern section of the line sailing far above we head into the sunset that first day of we journey the reconnaissance be over and here be the first-hand testimony of one who have take part in many as to what it mean in endurance and fatigue : both pilot and observer be stiff with the cold in winter it be often necessary to help they out of the machine and attend to the chill part of the body to avoid frost-bite they face be draw with the continual strain they be deaf from the roar of the engine they eye be bloodshot and they whole body be rack with every imaginable ache for the next few hour they be good for nothing but rest though sleep be generally hard to get but before turn in the observer must make he report and hand it in to the proper quarter so much for the night which be rather for observation than fight though fight constantly attend they but the set battle in the air squadron with squadron man with man the bomber in the center the fight machine surround and protect they be become more wonderful more daring more complicated every month you 'll see -- i recall once more the word of we flight-commander speak amid the noise and movement of a score of practise machine five week before the battle of arras -- when the great move begin _ we shall get the mastery again as we do on the somme _ ask the gunner in the battery of the April advance as they work below the signalling plane ask the infantry whom the gunner so marvellously protect as to the truth of the prophecy we casualty be _ really _ light write a officer in reference to some of the hot fighting of the past month thanks apparently to the ever-growing precision of we artillery method which again depend on aeroplane and balloon information so it be that the fly form in the upper air become for the soldier below so many symbol of help and protection he be restless when they be not there and let we remember that aeroplane be first use for artillery observation not three year ago in the battle of aisne after the victory of the marne but the night in the quiet village wear away to-morrow we shall be fly through the pleasant land of france bind for pari and lorraine for i be turn now to a new task on we own line i have be try to describe for those who care to listen the crowd impression leave on a woman-witness by the huge development in the last twelve month of the british military effort in france but now as i go forward into this beautiful country which i have love next to my own all my life there be new purpose in my mind and three memorable word in my ear : _ reparation -- restitution -- guarantee _ no 7 _ may 10th _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- we be then for a time to put france and not the british line in the forefront of these later letter for when i go out on this task as i think you know i have two object in mind -- intimately connect the first be to carry on that general story of the british effort which i begin last year under you inspiration down to the opening of this year 's campaign and the second be to try and make more people in this country and more people in america realize -- as acutely and poignantly as i could -- what it be we be really fight for what be the character of the enemy we be up against what be the suffering outrage and devastation which have be inflict on france in particular by the wanton cruelty and ambition of germany for which she herself must be make to suffer and pay if civilisation and freedom be to endure with this second intention i be to have combine by the courtesy of the french headquarters a visit to certain central portion of the french line include soisson reim and verdun but by the time i reach france the great operation that have since mark the soissons-reims front be in active preparation road and motor-car be absorb by the movement of troops and store reim and verdun be under renew bombardment and visit to this section of the french line be entirely hold up the french authority understand that i chiefly wish to see for myself some of the wreck and ruin village and town deal with in the french official report suggest first senli and the battle-field of the ourcq and then nancy the ruin village of lorraine and that portion of they eastern frontier line where simultaneously with the battle of the marne general castelnau direct from the plateau of amance and the grand couronné that strong defense of nancy which protect -- and still protect -- the french right and have baulk all the german attempt to turn it meanwhile in the early day of march the german retreat south of the somme and in front of the french line be not yet verify and the worst devastation of the war -- the most wanton crime perhaps that germany have so far commit -- be not yet accomplish i have leave france before it be fully know and could only realize by hot sympathy from a distance the passionate thrill of fury and wild grief which sweep through france when the news begin to come in from the evacuate district british correspondent with the advance army of the ally have see deed of barbarism which british eye and heart will never forget and have send the news of they through the world the destruction of coucy and ham the ruin and plunder of the village the shameless loot everywhere the hideous ill-treatment of the country folk the deportation of boy and girl the massacre of the fruit tree -- these thing have go deep into the very soul of france burn away -- except in the mind of a few incorrigible fanatic -- whatever foolish pacificism be there and steel the mind and will of the nation afresh to that victory which can alone bring expiation punishment and a peace worth the name but everywhere the ruin with which northern central and eastern france be cover whether they be cause by the ordinary process of war or not be equally part of the guilt of germany in the country which i see last year on the belgian border from the great phantom of ypre down to festubert the ravage be mainly the ravage of war incessant bombardment from the fighting line have crumble village after village into dust or gash the small historic town and the stately country house there be no deliberate use of torch and petrol as in the town farther south and east ypre however be deliberately shell into fragment day after day and arras be only a degree less carefully ruin and whatever the military pretext may be the root question remain -- why be the german _ in france at all _ what bring they there but they own determination in the word of the secret report of 1913 print in the french yellow book to strengthen and extend _ deutschtum _ -lrb- germanism -rrb- throughout the entire world every injury that poor france in self-defence or the ally at she side be force to inflict on the village and town which express and be interweave with the history and genius of the french be really a german crime there be no forgiveness for what germany have do -- none she have try to murder a people and but for the splendid gift of that people she would have achieve she end perhaps the tragedy of what be to be see and hear at senli on the battle-grounds of the ourcq and in the village of lorraine be heighten for I by the beauty of the long drive south from the neighborhood of ghq -- some hundred and forty mile it be a cold but clear march day we have but part from snow a little while and we be soon to find it again but on this day austerely bright the land of france unrolled before we its long succession of valley and upland upland and valley here no trace of the invader generally speak no sign of the army for we route lay on a average some forty mile behind the line all be peace solitude even for the few woman old man and boy on the land scarcely tell in the landscape but every mile be rich in the sign and suggestion of a old and most human civilisation -- farm village town the carefully tend wood the fine road run they straight unimpeded course over hill and dale bearing witness to a _ state sense _ of which we possess too little in this country we stop several time on the journey -- i remember a puncture involve a couple of hour ' delay somewhere north of beauvai -- and find ourselves talk in small hot room with peasant family of all age and stage from the blind old grandmother like a brooding fate in the background to the last toddling baby how friendly they be in they own self-respecting way -- the grave-faced elder woman the young wife the child the strength of the _ family _ in france seem to I still overwhelming -- would we have more of it leave in england the prevailing effect be of woman everywhere _ carry on _ -- make no parade of it be indeed accustom to work and familiar with every detail of the land have merely add the task of they husband and son to they own and ask no praise for it the dignity the essential refinement and intelligence -- for all they homely speech -- of these solidly build strong-faced woman in the central district of france be still what it be when george sand draw she berrus peasant nearly a hundred year ago then darkness fall and in the darkness we go through a old old town where be the french general headquarters sentry challenge we to right and left and send we forward again with friendly look the day have be very long and presently as we approach paris i fall asleep in my corner only to be rouse with a start by a glare of light and more sentry the _ barrière _ of paris -- shine out into the night two day in pari follow every hour crowd with talk and the vivid impression of a moment when from beyond compiègne and soisson -- some sixty mile from the boulevard -- the french airman fly over the german line be now bring back news every morning and night of fresh withdrawal fresh village burn as the sullen enemy relax he hold on the third day a most courteous and able official of the french foreign office take we in charge and we set out for senli on a morning chill and wintry indeed but give little sign of the storm it hold in leash to reach senlis one must cross the military _ enceinte _ of paris many visitor from pari and other part of france from england or from america have see by now the wreck of its principal street and have talk with the abbé dourlent the archiprêtre of the cathedral whose story often tell have lose but little of its first vigor and simplicity to judge at least by its effect on two of he latest visitor we take the great northern road out of pari which pass scene memorable in the war of 1870 on both side of we at frequent interval across the flat country be long line of trench and belt of barb wire most of they addition to the defence of pari since the battle of the marne it be well to make assurance doubly sure but although as we enter the forest of chantilly the german line be no more than some thirty-odd mile away and since the battle of the aisne two and a half year ago it have run practically as it still run in the early day of this last march the notion of any fresh attack on pari seem the merest dream it be indeed a striking testimony to the power of the modern defensive -- this absolute security in which paris and its neighborhood have live and move all that time with -- up to a few week ago -- the german battery no farther off than the suburb of soisson how good to remember as one write all that have happen since i be in senlis -- and the increase distance that now divide the german host from the great prize on which they have set they heart how fiercely they have set they heart on it the old curé of senli who be the chief depository of the story of the town be to make we feel anew one enter senli from pari by the main street the rue de la république which the german deliberately and ruthlessly burn on September 2nd and 3rd 1914 we move slowly along it through the blacken ruin of house large and small systematically fire by the german _ pétroleurs _ in revenge for a suppose attack by civilian upon the enter german troops _ les civils ont tiré _ -- it be the universal excuse for these deed of wanton barbarism and for the hideous cruelty to man woman and child that have attend they -- begin with that incident which first reveal to a startled world the true character of the man direct the german army -- the burning and sack of louvain it be to be hope that renew and careful investigation will be make -- -lrb- much preliminary inquiry have already of course take place -rrb- -- after the war into all these case my own impression from what i have hear see and read -- for what it may be worth -- be that the plea be almost invariably false but that the state of panic and excitement into which the german temperament fall with extraordinary readiness under the strain of battle together with the drunkenness of troops traverse a rich wine-growing country have often account for a honest but quite mistaken belief in the mind of german soldier without excuse at all the deed to which it lead of this abnormal excitability the old curé of senlis give one or two instance which strike I we come across he by chance in the cathedral -- the beautiful cathedral i have hear walter pater describe in my young oxford day as one of the loveliest and gracefullest thing in french gothic fortunately though the slender belfry and the roof be repeatedly strike by shrapnel in the short bombardment of the town no serious damage be do we wander round the church alone delight we eye with the warm golden white of the stone the height of the grooved arch the flaming fragment of old glass when we see the figure of a old priest come slowly down the aisle he arm fold he look at we rather dreamily and pass we guide monsieur p follow and speak to he monsieur you be the abbé dourlent i be sir what can i do for you something be say about english lady and the curé courteously turn back will the lady come into the presbytère we follow he across the small cathedral square to the old house in which he live and be show into a bare dining-room with a table some chair and a few old religious engraving on the wall he offer we chair and sit down himself you would like to hear the story of the german occupation he think a little before begin and i be strike with he strong tired face the powerful mouth and jaw and above they eye which seem to have lose the power of smile though i guess they to be naturally full of a pleasant shrewdness of what the french call _ malice _ which be not the english malice he be rather difficult to follow here and there but from he speak word and from a write account he place in my hand i put together the follow story : it be August 30th 1914 when the british general staff arrive in senli that same evening they leave it for dammartin all day and the next two day french and english troops pass through the town what be happen would there be no fighting in defense of paris -- only thirty mile away Wednesday September 2nd -- that be the day the gun begin we gun and theirs to the north of senli but in the course of that day we know finally there would be no battle between we and pari the french troops be go -- the english be go they leave we -- march eastward we heart be very sore as we see they go two o'clock on Wednesday -- the first shell strike the cathedral i have just be to the top of the belfry to see if i could from what direction the enemy be come the bombardment last a hour and a half at four o'clock they enter if you have see they the old curé raise himself on he seat try to imitate the insolent bearing of the german cavalry as they lead the way through the old town which they imagine would be the last stage on they way to pari they come in shout ' _ pari _ -- _ nach pari ' _ madden with excitement they be all singing -- they be like man beside themselves what do they sing monsieur le curé -- deutschland über alle ' oh no madame not at all they sing hymn it be a extraordinary sight they seem possess they be certain that in a few hour they would be in pari they pass through the town and then just south of the town they stop we people show the place it be the nearest they ever get to pari presently a officer with a escort a general apparently ride through the town pull up at the hôtel de ville and ask for the maire -- angrily like a man in a passion but the maire -- m odent -- be there wait on the step of the hôtel de ville monsieur odent be my friend -- he give I he confidence he have resist he nomination as mayor as long as he could and accept it only as a imperative duty he be a employer whom he workman love one of they use to say -- ` when one get into m odent 's employ one life and die there ' just before the invasion he take he family away then he come back with the presentiment of disaster he say to I -- ' i persuade my wife to go it be hard we be much attach to each other -- but now i be free ready for all that may come ' well the german general say to he roughly : ` be you town quiet can we circulate safely ' m odent say ` yes there be no quieter town in france than senli ' ` be there still any soldier here ' m odent have see the french troops defile through the town all the morning the bombardment have make it impossible to go about the street as far as he know there be none leave he answer ` no ' he be take off practically under arrest to the hôtel and tell to order a dinner for thirty with ice and champagne then he secretary join he and propose that the _ adjoint _ or mayor 's assistant should be send for ` no ' say m odent ` one victim be enough ' you see he foresee everything we all know what have happen in belgium and the ardenne the german officer question he again ` why have you people go -- why be these house these shop shut there must be light _ everywhere _ -- all through the night ' suddenly -- shot -- in the rue de la république in a few seconds there be a furious fusillade accompany by the rattle of machine gun the officer spring up ` so this be you quiet town monsieur le maire i arrest you and you shall answer with you life for the life of my soldier ' two man with revolver be set to guard he the officer himself presently take he outside the town and leave he under guard at the little village of poteau at the edge of a wood \* \* \* \* \* what have happen unluckily for senli and m odent some of the french rear-guard -- infantry straggler and a small party of senegalese troops -- be still in the southern quarter of the town when the german enter they open fire from a barrack near the paris entrance and a sharp engagement follow which last several hour with casualty on both side the german get the better and be then free to wreak they fury on the town they break into the house plunder the wine shop first of all and take fifty hostage of whom twenty-six perish and at half-past five while the fighting be still go on the punitive burning of the town begin by a cyclist section tell off for the work and furnish with every means for do it effectively these man accord to a eyewitness do they work with wild shout -- _ cris sauvage _ a hundred and seventeen house be soon burn fiercely on that hot September evening the air be like a furnace before long the street be full of blaze débris two person who have hide themselves in they cellar die of suffocation yet to appear in the street be to risk death at the hand of some drunk or maddened soldier at the opening of the french attack a german officer rush to the hospital which be full of wound in search of francs-tireurs arrive there he see a old man a chronic patient of the hospital and half idiotic standing on the step of the building he blow the old man 's brain out he then force he way into the hospital point he revolver at the french wound who think they last hour have come he himself be wound and at last appear to yield to the remonstrance of the sister in charge and allow he wound to be dress but in the middle of the dress he break away without he tunic and helmetless in a state of mad excitement and presently reappear with a file of soldier place they in the street opposite the room occupy by the french wound he order they to fire a volley no one be hurt though several bed be strike then the woman 's ward be search two sick man _ éclopés _ without visible wound be drag out of they bed and would have be bayonet then and there but for the entreaty of the nurse who ultimately release they a awful night follow in the still burn or smoulder town meanwhile at nine o'clock in the evening a party of german officer betake themselves to the hamlet of poteau -- a village north of senli -- where m odent have be keep under guard since the afternoon six other hostage be produce and they be all march off to a field near chamant at the edge of a wood here the maire be call up and interrogate he companion eight or nine metre away too far to hear what be say watch the scene as i think of it i seem to see in the southern sky the glare of burn senli above it and spread over the stubble field in which the party stand a peaceful moonlight in he written account the curé specially mention the brightness of the harvest moon presently the maire come back to the six and say to one benoit decrey adieu my poor benoit we shall not see each other again -- they be go to shoot I he take he crucifix he purse contain a sum of money and some papers out of he pocket and ask that they should be give to he family then press the hand hold out to he he say good-bye to they all and go back with a firm step to the group of officer two soldier be call up and the maire be place at ten pace ' distance the soldier fire and m odent fall without a sound he be hastily bury under barely a foot of earth and he six companion be leave on the spot through the night expect the same fate till the morning when they be release five other hostage gather haphazard in the street be shoot the same night in the neighborhood of chamant meanwhile the curé know nothing of what be happen to the maire have be think for he parishioner and he church when the bombardment begin he gather together about a hundred and twenty of they who have apparently no cellar to take refuge in and after shelter they in the presbytère for a time he send they with one of he _ vicaire _ out of the town then -- to continue he narrative : i go to the southern portal of the cathedral and stand there tremble at every burst of shrapnel that strike the belfry and the roof and run out into the open at each pause to be sure that the church be still there when the firing cease i go back to the presbytère presently furious sound of blow from the _ place _ i go out i see some enemy cyclist arm with fragment of stone breaking in one of the cathedral door another with a hatchet attack the belfry door at the sight of I they rush at I with they revolver demand that i should take they to the top of the belfry ` you have a machine gun there ' ` nothing of the sort monsieur see for yourselve ' i unlock the door and just as i put my foot on the first step the fusillade in the town begin the soldier start ` you be we prisoner ' cry they chief turn to I as though to seize I ' i know it you have I in you hand ' i go up before they as quickly as my age allow they search everywhere and of course find nothing they run down and disappear but that be not the end of the abbé 's trouble he be presently send for to the german headquarters at the hotel du grand cerf where the table spread for thirty people by the order of m odent be still wait for its guest the conversation here between the curé and the officer of high rank who speak to he be worth repeat from the tenor of it the presumption be that the officer be a catholic -- probably a bavarian i ask leave to go back to the presbytère ` better stay here monsieur le curé you will be safer the burning be go on to-morrow you town will be only a heap of ruin ' ` what be we crime ' ` listen to that fusillade you inhabitant be attack we as they do at louvain louvain have cease to exist we will make of senli another louvain so that pari and france may know how we treat those who may imitate you we have find small shot -lrb- _ chevrotine _ -rrb- in the body of one of we officer ' ` already ' -- i think how have there be any time for the post-mortem but i be too crushed to speak ` and also from you belfry we have be fire on ' at that i recover myself ` sir -- what may have pass in the street i can not say but as to the cathedral i formally deny you charge since war break out i have always have the key of the belfry i do not even give they to you soldier who make I take they there do you wish I to swear it ' the officer look at I ` no need you be a catholic priest i see you be sincere ' i bow a scene that throw much light a false charge -- a excited reference to louvain -- monstrous threat -- the temper that be of panic which be the mother of cruelty at that very moment the german troops in the rue de la republique be drive party of french civilian in front of they as a protection from the senegalese troops who be still firing from house near the paris exit from the town four or five of these poor people be kill by french bullet a child of five force along with she mother be shoot in the thigh altogether some twenty or thirty civilian seem to have be kill next day more house be burnt then for a time the quiet of desolation all the normal population be go or in the cellar but twenty mile away to the southeast great thing be prepare the german occupation of senli begin as we have see on a Wednesday September 2nd on Saturday the 5th as we all know the first shot be fire in that battle of the ourcq which be the western section of the battle of the marne by that Saturday already write the abbé dourlent : there be something change in the attitude of the enemy what have become of the brutal arrogance the insolent cruelty of the first day for three day and night the german troops a army of 300000 man defile through we street it be not the road to paris now that they ask for -- it be the way to nanteuil ermenonville the direction of the marne on the face of the officer one seem to read disappointment and anxiety close to we on the east the gun be speak every day more fiercely what be happen all that the curé know be that in a house belong to person of he acquaintance where some officer of the rear-guard left behind in senli be billet two of the young officer have be in tear -- it be suppose because of bad news another day a armored car rush into senli from paris the man in it exchange some shot with the german soldier in the principal _ place _ and make off again call out courage deliverance be come then on the 9th just a week from the german entry there be another fusillade in the street it be the zouave knock at the door drag out the conqueror of yesterday now a humble remnant with they hand in the air and the curé go on to compare senli to the sand which the creator show to the sea thus far shalt thou go and no farther the grain of sand be senli still red with the flame which have devour she and with the blood of she victim to these barbarian she cry -- ` you want pari -- you want france halt no road through here ' \* \* \* \* \* this combination of the curé 's write and speak account be as close to the fact as i can make it he narrative as he give it to I of what he have see and feel be essentially simple and to judge from the french official report with which i have compare it essentially true there be some discrepancy in detail but nothing that matter the murder of m odent of the other hostage of the civilian place in front of the german troops and of four or five other victim the burning out by torch and explosive of half a flourishing town because of a discreditable mistake the fruit of panic and passion -- these crime be indelibly mark on the record of germany she have do worse elsewhere all the same this too she will never efface let we imagine such thing happen at guildford or hatfield or st alban we part with m le curé just in time to meet a pleasant party of war correspondent at the very inn the hôtel du cerf which have be the german headquarters during the occupation the correspondent be on they way between the french headquarters and the nearest point of the french line soisson or compiègne from whose neighborhood every day the german be slowly fall back and where the great attack of the month of April be in active preparation then after luncheon we sally out into the darkening afternoon through the forest of ermenonville and up to the great plateau stretch north towards soisson southwards towards meaux and eastward towards the ourcq where maunoury 's sixth army striking from pari and the west and the english army striking from the south -- aid by all the gallant french line from château thierry to the grand couronné -- deal that staggering blow against the german right which fling back the german host and weary as the way have be since weary as it may still be in truth decide the war but the cloud hang lower as we emerge on the high bare plain a few flake -- then in a twinkle a whirling snow-storm through which we can hardly see we way but we fight through it and along the road every one of which be famous in the history of the battle at we northernmost point we be about thirty mile from soisson and the line column of french infantry on the march gun ammunition store field kitchen pass we perpetually the motor move at a foot 's pace and we catch the young face of the soldier through the white thickened air and we most animated and animating companion monsieur p -- with he wonderful knowledge of the battle hail every landmark identify every farm and wood even in what have become in less than a hour a white wilderness but it be of one village only of these many whose name be henceforth know to history that i wish to speak -- the village of varedde in my next letter i propose to tell the ghastly story of the hostage of varedde no 8 _ may 17th _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- shall i ever forget that broad wintry plateau of the ourcq as it lay at the opening of march under its bed of snow with its ruin village its grave scatter over the field its utter loneliness save for the column of march soldier in the road and the howling wind that rush over the field the grave the cemetery and whistle through the gaping wall of the poor church and farm this high spreading plain which before the war be one scene of rural plenty and industrious peace with its farm land and orchard drop gently from the forest country of chantilly compiègne and ermenonville down to the ourcq and the marne will be a place of pilgrimage for generation to come most of the battle of the marne be fight on so vast a scale over so wide a stretch of country -- about 200 mile long by 50 broad -- that for the civilian spectator of the future it will never be possible to realize it as a whole and very difficult even to realize any section of it topographically owe to the complication of the action involve but in the battle of the ourcq the distance be comparatively small the action comparatively simple and intelligible while all the circumstance of the particular struggle be so dramatic and the stake at issue so vast that every incident be as it be writ large and the memory absorb they more easily a englishwoman too may be glad it be in this conspicuous section of the battle-field which will perhaps affect the imagination of posterity more easily than any other that it fall to the british army to play its part to general joffre the glory of the main strategic conception of the great retreat to general gallienus the undying honor of the rapid perception the quick decision which fling general maunoury with the 6th army on von kluck 's flank and rear at the first hint of the german general 's swerve to the southeast to general maunoury himself and he splendid troops the credit of the battle proper across the broad harvest field of the ourcq plateau but the advance of the british troops from the south of the marne on the heel of von kluck be in truth all-important to the success of maunoury on the ourcq it be the british expeditionary force which make the hinge of the battle-line and if that hinge have not be strong and supple -- in all respects equal to its work -- the sudden attack of the 6th army on the extreme left of the battle-line and the victory of general foch in the center might not have avail in other word have von kluck find the weak spot he believe in and strike for all would have be different but the weak spot exist only in the german imagination the british troops whom von kluck suppose to be exhaust and demoralise be in truth nothing of the sort rest and in excellent condition they turn rejoice upon the enemy and in concert with the french 6th army decide the german withdrawal every one of the six army align across france from pari to the grand couronne have its own glorious task in the defeat of the german plan but we be then so small a proportion of the whole with we hundred and twenty thousand man and we have become since so accustomed to count in million that perhaps we part in the miracle of the marne be sometimes in danger of become a little blur in the popular english -- and american -- conception of the battle be not the truth rather that we have a twofold share in it it be von kluck 's miscalculation as to the english strength that tempt he to he eastward march it be the quality of the british force and leadership when sir john french 's opportunity come that make the mistake a fatal one how different the aspect of the ourcq plateau at the opening of the battle in 1914 from the snowy desolation under which we see it perfect summer weather -- the harvest stack in the field -- a blaze sun by day and a clear moon by night for the first encounter of the five day ' fight till the rain come down nature could not have set a fairer scene and on the two anniversary which have since pass summer have again deck the battle-field thousand have go out to it from pari from meaux and the whole country-side the innumerable grave single or group among the harvest field and the pasture have be cover with flower and bright mile after mile with the twinkling tricolor as far as the eye could see at barcy and etrépilly the centre of the fight priest have bless the grave and pray for the dead there have be neither labor nor money indeed as yet wherewith to rebuild the ruin village and farm beyond the most necessary repair they stand for the most part as the battle leave they and the field be still alive with innumerable red flag -- distinct from the tricolor of the grave -- which mark where the plough must avoid a unexploded shell in a journal of September 1914 a citizen of senli describe pass in a motor through the scene of the fight immediately after the departure of the german when the scavenging and bury party be still busy how can i describe it where to begin abandon farm on hill of death the grain-giving earth empty of human being no labourer -- no household smoke the fire of the burning village have smoulder out and round the house and in the courtyard lie the debris of they normal life trample dirty and piecemeal under foot poor farm of the ile-de-france -- dwelling of old time into whose barn the rich harvest of the field have be joyously gather year by year -- old tiled roof clothe with ancestral moss -- plain hospitable room where master and servant meet familiarly together : -- you be no more than calcine and blacken stone not a living animal in the ruin stall not a ox not a horse not a sheep one fly from the house only to find a scene more horrible in the field corps everywhere of man and horse and everywhere in the field unexploded shell which it would be death to touch which have already make many unsuspecting victim sometimes as the motor draw near a man or a woman emerge from a building have still on they face the terror of the hour they have live through they scarcely look at we they be absorb in they loss in the struggle to rescue something from the wreck as soon as they be sure it be not the german come back they turn away with slow step bewilder by what they have suffer the small party in the motor include a priest and as it pass near betz at the northern end of the battle-field they see a burying-party of french territorial at work the officer in charge beckon to the priest and the priest go to speak to he monsieur l'abbé we have just bury here twenty-two french soldier he point to a trench freshly dig into which the earth have just be shovel they be breton soldier the officer explain and the man of my bury company be breton too they have just discover that these dead man we have gather from the field be soldier from a regiment recruit in they own district and _ seven _ of they have recognize among these twenty-two dead one a son one a son-in-law one a brother will you come monsieur l'abbé and say a few word to these poor fellow so the abbé go to the new-made grave read the _ de profundis _ say a prayer give the benediction and then speak tear be on the strong rugged face of the bare-headed breton as they gather round he a group some little distance off which be write the name of the dead on a white cross pause catch what be go on and kneel too with bent head it be good to linger on that little scene of human sympathy and religious faith it do something to protect the mind from the horror of much that have happen here \* \* \* \* \* in spite of the storm we indefatigable guide carry we through all the principal point of the battle-line -- st soupplêts -- marcilly -- barcy -- etrépilly -- acy-en-multien village from which one by one by keen hard fight the french attack come eastward from dammartin to pari dislodge the troops of von kluck while to we right lay trocy and varedde a village on the ourcq between which point run the strongest artillery position of the enemy at barcy we stop a few minute to go and look at the ruin church with its fall bell and its graveyard pack with wreath and cross bind with the tricolor at etrépilly with the snow beating in we face and the wind howl round we we read the inscription on the national monument raise to those fall in the battle and look eastward to the spot where trocy lay under thick curtain of storm we try to imagine the magnificent charge of the zouave of the 62nd reserve division under commandant henrus d'urbal who with many a comrade lie bury in the cemetery of barcy five day the battle

chambry barcy puisieux acy-en-multien the 6th 7th and 8th of September -- fierce day to which the grave among the crop bear witness four hundred volunteer send to attack a farm from which only seven

rain of fire mill and house burn like torch -- field red with the dead and with the flaming corn fruit of the field and flower of the race -- the sacrifice consummate the cup drunk to the lees move and eloquent word they gain for I a double significance as i look back from they to the little scene we see at barcy under the snow -- a halt of some french infantry in front of the ruin church the _ salut a drapeau _ be go on that simple daily rite which like a secular mass be the outward and visible sign to the french soldier of he country and what he owe she this passion of french patriotism -- what a marvellous force what a regenerate force it have show itself in this war it spring too from the heart of a race which have the latin gift of expression listen to this last entry in the journal of captain robert dubarle the evening before he death in action : this attack to-morrow besides the inevitable emotion it rouse in one 's thought stir in I a kind of joyous impatience and the pride of do my duty -- which be to fight gladly and die victorious to the last breath of we life to the last child of we mother to the last stone of we dwelling all be thine my country make no hurry choose thine own time for striking if thou needest month we will fight for month if thou needest year we will fight for year -- the child of to-day shall be the soldier of to-morrow already perhaps my last hour be hasten towards I accept the gift i make thee of my strength my hope my joy and my sorrow of all my be fill with the passion of thee pardon thy child they error of past day cover they with thy glory -- put they to sleep in thy flag rise victorious and renew upon they grave let we holocaust save thee -- _ patrie patrie _ a utterance which for tragic sincerity and passion may well compare with the letter of a english officer i print at the end of _ england 's effort _ on they go into the snow and the mist the small sturdy soldier bind northwards for those great and victorious attack on the craonne plateau and the chemin des dames which be to follow so close on we own british victory on the vimy ridge they pass the two lady in the motor car look at we with friendly laughing eye and disappear into the storm then we move on to the northern edge of the battle-field and at rosoy we turn south towards meaux pass varedde to we leave the weather clear a little and from the high ground we be able to see meaux to the west lie beside its great river than which we child 's child will greet no more famous name the marne wind steely gray through the white landscape and we run down to it quickly soon we be make we way on foot through the drip street of meaux to the old bridge which the british break down -- one of three -- on they retreat -- so soon to end then a few minute in the lovely cathedral -- its beauty be a great surprise to I -- a greet to the tomb of bossuet -- ah what a _ discor _ he would have write on the battle of the marne -- and a rapid journey of some twenty-five mile back to pari but there be still a story leave to tell -- the story of varedde varedde -- say a local historian of the battle -- be now a very quiet place there be no movement in the street and little life in the house where some of the injury of war have be repair but there be no spot in the wide battle-field where there burn a more passionate hatred of a barbarous enemy push open this window enter this house talk with any person whatever whom you may happen to meet and they will tell you of the torture of old man carry off as hostage and murder in cold blood or of the agony of fear deliberately inflict on old and frail woman through a whole night the story of varedde be indeed nearly incredible that english or french or italian troops could have be guilty of this particular crime be beyond imagination individual deed of passion and lust be possible indeed in all army though the degree to which they have prevail in the german army be by the judgment of the civilised world outside germany unprecedented in modern history but the instance of long-drawn-out cold-blooded unrelenting cruelty of which the german conduct of the war be full fill one after a while with a shudder sense of something wholly vile and wholly unsuspected which europe have be shelter unaware in its midst the horror have now throw off the trappings and disguise of modern civilisation and we see it and recoil we feel that we be terribly right in speaking of the german as barbarian that for all they science and they organization they have nothing really in common with the graeco-latin and christian civilisation on which this old europe be base we have think of they in former day -- how strange to look back upon it -- as brother and co-worker in the human cause but the man who have make and be sustain this war together with the man civil and military who have breathe its present spirit into the german army be really moral outlaw acknowledge no authority but they own arrogant and cruel will impervious to the moral ideal and restraint that govern other nation and betray again and again under the test of circumstance the trait of the savage and the brute and as one say these thing one could almost laugh at they -- so strong be still the memory of what one use to feel towards the poetic the think the artistic germany of the past but that germany be a mere blind hide the real germany listen at least to what this old village of the ile-de-france know of germany with the early day of September 1914 there be a lamentable exodus from all this district long line of fugitive make for safety and the south cart fill with household stuff and carry the woman and child herd of cattle and sheep crowd the road the german be come and the terror of belgium and the ardenne have spread to these french peasant of the center on September 1st the post-mistress of varedde receive order to leave the village after destroy the telephone and telegraphic connection the news come late but panic spread like wildfire all the night varedde be pack and go of 800 inhabitant only a hundred remain thirty of they old man one of the emigrant do not get far from home he be a man of seventy loui denet by name he leave varedde with he wife in a farm-cart drive a cow with they they go a day 's journey and put up for a few day at the farm of a friend name roger on Sunday the 6th in the morning four german arrive at the farm they go away and come back again in the afternoon they call all the inmate of the farm out into the yard denet and roger appear you be three man this morning now you be only two say one of the german and immediately they take the two old man a little distance away and shoot they both within half a mile of the farm the body of roger be find by he wife the day after that of denet be not discover for some time nobody have any idea to this day why those man be shoot it be worth while to try and realize the scene -- the terror-stricken old man drag away by they murderer -- the wife leave behind no doubt under a guard -- the sound of the distant shot -- the broken heart of the widow and the orphan but that be a mere prelude on Friday September 4th a large detachment of von kluck 's army invade varedde come from barcy which lie to the west it be no doubt move towards the marne on that flank march which be von kluck 's undoing the troops leave the village on Saturday the 5th but only to make a hurry return that same evening von kluck be already aware of he danger and be rapidly recall troops to meet the advance of maunoury meanwhile the french sixth army be press on from the west and from the 6th to the 9th there be fierce fighting in and round varedde there be german battery behind the presbytère and the church have become a hospital the old curé the abbé fossin at the age of seventy-eight spend himself in devoted service to the wound german who fill it there be other dress station near by the mairie and the school be full of wound of whom there be probably some hundred in the village only 135 dead be bury in the neighborhood the german carry off the other in great lorry fill with corpse by Monday the 7th although they be still to hold the village till the 9th the german know they be beat the rage of the great defeat of the incredible disappointment be on they only a week before they have pass through the same country-side cry nach pari and polish up button belt rifle accoutrements generally so as to enter the french capital in _ grande tenue _ for whatever might have be the real plan of the german general staff the rank and file as they come south from creil and nanteuil believe themselves only a few hour from the boulevard from the city of pleasure and spoil what have happen the common cry of man so sharply foiled go up nous somme trahi the german troops in varedde foresee immediate withdrawal and surround by they own dead and die must somehow avenge themselves on some one hostage the village have play we false the curé have be signalling from the church we be in a nest of spy so on the evening of the 7th the old curé who have spend he day in the church do what he could for the wound and be wear out have just go to bed when there be loud knock at he door he be drag out of bed and tell that he be charge with make signal to the french army from he church tower and so cause the defeat of the german he point out that he be physically incapable of climb the tower that any wounded german of whom the church be full could have see he do it have the absurd charge be true he remind they that he have spend he whole time in nurse they man no use he be strike hustled spat upon and drag off to the mairie there he pass the night sit on a hamper and in the morning some one remember to have see he there he rosary in he hand in one of the local account there be a touching photograph take of course before the war of the curé among the boy of the village a mild reserved face with something of the child in it the face of a man who have have a gentle experience of life and might surely hope for a gentle death altogether some fourteen hostage all but two over sixty year of age and several over seventy be take during the evening and night they ask why the answer be the german have be betray one man be arrest because he have say to a german who be boast that the german army would be in paris in two day -- all right -- but you be not there yet another because he have be see go backwards and forwards to a wood in which it appear he have hide two horse whom he have be try to feed one old man of seventy-nine could only walk to the yard in which the other be gather by the help of he wife 's arm when they arrive there a soldier separate they so roughly that the wife fall imagine the horror of the September night -- the terror of the woman who in the general exodus of the young and strong have stay behind with they husband the old man who could not be persuade to leave the farm and field in which they have spend they life what harm can they do to we -- old people no doubt that have be the instinctive feeling among those who have remain to face the invasion but the german be not content without wreak the instinct -- which be the savage instinct -- to break and crush and ill-treat something which have thwart you on the woman of varedde also they gather they out of the farmyard to which they have come in the hope of be allow to stay with the man and shut they up in a room of the farm and there with fix bayonet the soldier amuse themselves with terrifying these tremble creature during a great part of the night they make they all kneel down face a file of soldier and the woman think they last hour have come one be seventy-seven year old three sixty-seven the two other just under sixty the eldest madame barthélemy say to the other -- we be go to die make you ` contrition ' if you can -lrb- the town librarian of meaux from whose account i take these fact hear these detail from the lip of poor madame barthélemy herself -rrb- the cruel scene shape itself as we think of it -- the half-lit room -- the row of kneel and weep woman the grinning soldier bayonet in hand and the old man wait in the yard outside but with the morning the french mitrailleus be hear the soldier disappear the poor old woman be free they be able to leave they prison but they husband be go -- carry off as hostage by the german there be nineteen hostage in all three of they be take off in a north-westerly direction and find some german officer quarter in a château who after a short interrogation release they of the other sixteen fifteen be old man and the sixteenth a child the curé be with they and find great difficulty owe to he age the exhaustion of the night and lack of food in keep up with the column it be now Thursday the 10th the day follow that on which as be generally believe the kaiser sign the order for the general retreat of the german army in france but the hostage be tell that the french army have be repulse and the german will be in paris directly at last the poor curé could walk no farther he give he watch to a companion give it to my family when you can i be sure they mean to shoot I then he drop exhaust the german hail a pass vehicle and make he and another old man who have fall out follow in it presently they arrive at lizy-sur-ourcq through which thousand of german troops be now pass bind not for pari but for soisson and the aisne and in the blackest of temper here after twenty-four more hour of suffering and starvation the curé be bring before a court-martial of german officer sit in a barn he be once more charge with signalling from the church to the french army he again deny the charge and remind he judge of what he have do for the german wound to whose gratitude he appeal then four german soldier give some sort of evidence found either on malice or mistake there be no witness for the defense no further inquiry the president of the court-martial say in bad french to the other hostage who stand by : the curé have lie -- he be a spy -- _ il serum jugé _ what do he mean -- and what happen afterwards the french witness of the scene who survive understand the officer 's word to mean that the curé would be shoot with tear they bid he farewell as he sit crouch in a corner of the barn guard by two german soldier he be never see again by french eye and the probability be that he be shoot immediately after the scene in the barn then the miserable march of the other old man begin again they be drag along in the wake of the retreat german the day be very hot the road be crowd with troops and lorry they be hustle and hurry and they feeble strength be rapidly exhaust the older one beg that they may be leave to die the younger help they as much as they can when anyone fall out he be kick and beat till he get up again and all the time the pass troops mock and insult they at last near coulomb after a march of two hour and a half a man of seventy-three call jourdaine fall he guard rush upon he with blow and kick in vain he have no strength to rise and he murderer finish he with a ball in the head and one in the side and bury he hastily in a field a few metre off the weary march go on all day when it end another old man -- seventy-nine year old -- le père milliardet -- can do no more the next morning he stagger to he foot at the order to move but fall almost immediately then a soldier with the utmost coolness send he bayonet through the heart of the helpless creature another fall on the road a little farther north -- then another -- and another all be kill as they lie the poor maire liévin struggle on as long as he can two other prisoner support he on either side but he have a weak heart -- he face be purple -- he can hardly breathe again and again he fall only to be brutally pull up the german shout with laughter at the old man 's misery -lrb- this come from the testimony of the survivor -rrb- then he too fall for the last time two soldier take he into the cemetery of chouy liévin understand and patiently take out he handkerchief and bandage he own eye it take three ball to kill he another hostage a little farther on who have also fall be beat to death before the eye of the other the following day after have suffer every kind of insult and privation the wretched remnant of the civilian prisoner reach soisson and be dispatch to germany bind for the concentration camp at erfurt eight of they poor soul reach germany where two of they die at last in January 1915 four of they be return to france through switzerland they reach schaffhausen with a number of other _ rapatriés _ in early February to find there the boundless pity with which the swiss know so well how to surround the frail and tortured sufferer of this war in a few week more they be again at home among the old farm and wood of the ile-de-france they be now in peace say the meaux librarian -- among those who love they and whose affection try day by day to soften for they the cruel memory of they calvary and they exile a monument to the memory of the murder hostage be to be erect in the village market-place and a _ plaque _ have be let into the wall of the farm where the old man and the woman pass they first night of agony \* \* \* \* \* what be the moral of this story i have choose it to illustrate again the historic word which should be i think -- and we know that what be in we heart be in you heart also -- the special watchword of the ally and of america in these present day when the german strength _ may _ collapse at any moment and the problem of peace negotiation _ may _ be upon we before we know _ reparation _ -- _ restitution _ -- _ guarantee _ the story of varedde like that of senli be not among the vilest -- by a long long way -- of those which have steep the name of germany in eternal infamy during this war the tale of gerbéviller -- which i shall take for my third instance -- as i hear it from the lip of eye-witness plunge we in deeper depths of horror and the page of the bryce report be full of incident beside which that of varedde look almost colourless all the same let we insist again that no army of the ally or of america or of any british dominion would have be capable of the treatment give by the soldier of germany to the hostage of varedde it bring out into sharp relief that quality or mentality to use the fashionable word which germany share with austrium -- witness the austrian doings in serbium -- and with turkey -- witness turkey 's doings in armenia -- but not with any other civilised nation it be the quality of or the tendency to deliberate and pitiless cruelty a quality which make of the man or nation who show it a particularly terrible kind of animal force and the more terrible the more educate unless we can put it down and stamp it out as it have become embody in a european nation european freedom and peace american freedom and peace have no future but now let I carry you to lorraine -- to the scene of that short but glorious campaign of September 1914 by which while the battle of the marne be be fight general castelnau be protect the right of the french army and to the devastate village where american kindness be already at work rebuild the destroy and comforting the broken-hearted no 9 _ may 24th _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- to any citizen of a country ally with france in the present struggle above all to any english man or woman who be provide with at least some general knowledge of the battle of the marne the journey across france from pari to nancy can never fail to be one of poignant interest up to a point beyond châlons the ligne de l'est follow in general the course of the great river and therefore the line of the battle you pass la fertée-sous-jouarre where the third corps of general french 's army cross the river charly-sur-marne where a portion of the first corps find a unexpectedly easy cross owe it be say to the hopeless drunkenness of the enemy rear-guard charge with defend the bridge and château thierry famous in the older history of france where the right of the first corps cross after sharp fighting and in the course of a gigantic man-hunt in and around the town take a large number of german prisoner before by nightfall come into touch with the left of the french fifth army under franchet d'espercy at dornan you be only a few mile north of the marsh of st gond where general foch after some perilous moment win he brilliant victory over general billow and the german second army include a corps of the prussian guard while at châlons i look up from a record i be reading of the experience of the diocese during the war write by the bishop to watch for the distant cathedral and recall the scene of the night of September 9th when the german headquarters staff in that town fly with insolence and wine after what be describe as a excellent dinner and much riotous drinking be rouse about midnight by a sudden noise in the hôtel and shout of the french be here in fifteen minute write a officer of the staff of general langle de gary the hôtel be empty at épernay and châlons those french officer who be bind for the fight line in champagne east and west of reim leave the train and somewhere beyond épernay i follow in think the flight of a aeroplane which seem to be head northwards across the ridge which bind the river valley -- northwards for reim and that tragic ghost which the crime of germany have set move through history for ever never to be lay or silence -- joan of arc 's cathedral then at last we be do with the marne we pass bar-le-duc on one of she tributary the ornain after which the splendid meuse flash into sight run north on its victorious way to verdun then the moselle with toul and its beautiful church on the right and finally the meurthe on which stand nancy a glorious sisterhood of river the more one realize what they have mean to the history of france the more one understand that strong instinct of the early greek which give every river its god and make of the simoi and the xanthus personage almost as real as achille himself but alas the whole great spectacle here as on the ourcq be sorely muffle and blur by the snow which lay thick over the whole length and breadth of france efface the landscape in one monotonous whiteness if i remember rightly however it have cease to fall and twenty-four hour after we reach nancy it have disappear it last just long enough to let we see the fairy-like place stanisla raise its beautiful gilded gate and white palace between the snow and the moon-light -- a sight not soon forget we be welcome at nancy by the préfet of the department monsieur léon mirman to whom a old friend have write from pari and by the courteous french officer capitaine de b who be to take we in charge for the french army during we stay m mirman and he active and public-spirited wife have do a great work at nancy and in the desolated country round it from the ruin village of the border the poor _ réfugiés _ have be gather into the old capital of lorraine and what seem to I a remarkably efficient and intelligent philanthropy have be deal with they need and those of they child nor be this all m mirman be a old radical and of course a government official send down some year ago from pari lorraine be ardently catholic as we all know and she old catholic family be not the natural friend of the republican _ régime _ but president poincaré 's happy phrase _ l'union sacrée _ -- describe the fusion of all party class and creed in the war service of france have nowhere find a stronger echo than in lorraine the préfet be on the friendliest of term with the catholic population rich and poor and they on they side think and speak warmly of a man who be clearly do he patriotic best for all alike we first day 's journeying be to show we something of the quality of this catholic world of lorraine a charming and distinguished frenchwoman who accompany we count no doubt for much in the warmth of the kindness show we and yet i like to believe -- indeed i be sure -- that there be more than this in it there be the thrilling sense of a friendship between we two nation a friendship new and far-reaching cement by the war but look beyond it which seem to I to make the background of it all long as i have love and admire the french i have often -- like many other of they english friend and admirer -- feel and fret against the kind of barrier that seem to exist between they intimate life and ours it be as though at bottom and in the end something cold and critical in the french temperament combine with ignorance and prejudice on we own part prevent a real contact between the two nationality in lorraine at any rate and for the first time i feel this something go let we only carry forward _ intelligently _ after the war the process of friendship bear from the stress and anguish of this time -- for there be a art and skill in friendship just as there be a art and skill in love -- and new horizon will open for both nation the mutual respect the daily intercourse and the common glory of we two army fight amid the field and wood of france -- soon to welcome a third army you own to they great fellowship -- be the foundation to-day of all the rest and next come the effort that have be make by british and american to help the french in remake and rebuild they desolated land effort that bless he that give and he that take but especially he that give of which i shall have more to say in the course of this letter but a common victory and a common ardor in rebuild the waste place and bind up the broken-hearted : even they will not be enough unless beyond the war all three nation nay all the ally do not set themselves to a systematic interpenetration of life and think morally socially commercially as far as france and england be concerned english people must go more to france french people must come more to england relation of hospitality of correspondence of wide mutual acquaintance must not be leave to mere chance they must be further by the mind of both nation we english child must go for part of they education to france and french child must be systematically woo over here above all the difficulty of language must be tackle as it have never be yet so that it may be a real disadvantage and disgrace for the boy or girl of either country who have have a secondary education not to be able to speak in some fashion the language of the other as for the work class and the country population of both country what they have see of each other as brother in arm during the war may well prove of more lasting importance than anything else \* \* \* \* \* but i be wander a little from nancy and the story of we long Sunday the snow have disappear and there be voice of spring in the wind a french army motor arrive early with another french officer the capitaine de g -- who prove to be a most interesting and stimulating guide with he i drive slowly through the beautiful town look at the ruin house which be fairly frequent in its street for nancy have have its bombardment and there be one gun of long range in particular surname by the town -- la grosse bertha which have do and still do at interval damage of the kind the german love bomb too have be drop by aeroplane both here and at lunéville in street crowd with non-combatant with the natural result it have be in reprisal for this and similar deed elsewhere and in the hope of stop they that the french have raid german town across the frontier but the spirit of nancy remain quite undaunted the child of its school drill to run down to the cellar at the first alarm as we child be drill to empty a school on a warning of a zeppelin raid be the gayest and most spirited creature as i see they at they game and action song unless indeed it be the child of the _ réfugiés _ in whose face sometimes one seem to see the reflection of scene that no child ought to have witness and not even a child can forget for these child come from the frontier village ravage by the german advance and still some of they in german occupation and the orgy of murder cruelty and arson which break out at nomény badonviller and gerbéviller during the campaign of 1914 have scarcely be surpass elsewhere -- even in belgium here again as at varedde the hideous deed do be largely owing to the rage of defeat the german mainly bavarian on the frontier have set they heart on nancy as the troops of von kluck have set they heart on pari and general castelnau command the second army deny they nancy as maunoury 's sixth army deny pari to von kluck but more of this presently we start first of all for a famous point in the fighting of 1914 the farm and hill of léomont by this time the day have brighten into a cold sunlight and as we speed south from nancy on the lunéville road through the old town of st nichola du port with its remarkable church and past the great salt work at dombasle all the country-side be clear to view good fortune indeed -- as i soon discover when after climb a steep hill to the east of the road we find ourselves in full view of the fighting line and a wide section of the frontier with the forest of parroy which be still partly german stretch its dark length southward on the right while to the north run the famous height of the grand couronné -- name of good omen -- which suggest so happily the historical importance of the ridge which protect nancy and cover the french right then turn westward one look over the valley of the meurthe with its various tributary the mortagne in particular on which stand gerbéviller and away to the moselle and the meuse but the panoramic view be really make to live and speak for I by the able man at my side with french precision and french logic he begin with the geography of the country its river and hill and plateau and its natural capacity for defense against the german enemy handle the view as though it have be a great map and point out as he go the disposition of the french frontier army and the use make of this feature and that by the french general in command this lorraine campaign at the opening of the war be very little realize outside france it last some three week it be precede by the calamitous french reverse at morhange where on August 20th portion of the 15th and 16th corps of the second army young troops draw from south-western france -- who in subsequent action fight with great bravery -- break in rout before a tremendous german attack the defeat almost give the german nancy but general castelnau and general foch between they retrieve the disaster they fall back on nancy and the line of the mortagne while the german advance farther south occupy luneville -lrb- August 22nd -rrb- and burnt gerbéviller on the 23rd 24th and 25th there be fierce fighting on and near this hill on which we stand capitaine de g -- with the 2nd battalion of chausseur under general dubail have be in the thick of the struggle and he describe to I the action on the slope beneath we and how through he glass he have watch the enemy on the neighbouring hill force party of french civilian to bury the german dead and dig german trench under the fire of they own people the hill of léomont and the many grave upon it be quiet enough as we stand talk there the old farm be in ruin and in the field stretch up the hill there be the remains of trench all around and below we spread the beautiful lorraine country with its river and forest and to the south-east one could just see the blue mass of mont donon and the first spur of the vosge can you show I exactly where the french line run i ask my companion he point to a patch of wood some six mile away there be a french battalion there and you see that other patch of wood a little farther east there be a german battalion there ah suddenly he break off and the younger officer with we capitaine de b -- come run up point overhead i craned my neck to look into the spring blue above we and there -- 7000 to 8000 foot high accord to the officer -- be three boche aeroplane pursue by two french machine in and out a light band of white cloud the fighter in the air chase each other shrapnel burst all round they like tuft of white wool they be so high that they look mere white speck yet we could follow they action perfectly -- how the german climb before run for home and how the french pursued it be breathless while it last but we do not see the end the three taube be clearly drive back and in a few seconds they and the frenchman have disappear in distance and cloud towards the fighting-line the follow day at a point farther to the north a well-known french airman be bring down and kill in just such a fight beyond léomont we diverge westward from the main road and find ourselves suddenly in one of those utterly ruin village which now bestrew the soil of northern central and eastern france of that france which have be pre-eminently for century in spite of revolution the pious and watchful guardian of what the labor of dead generation have bequeath to they son vitrimont however be destroy in fair fight during the campaign of 1914 bombardment have make wreck of the solid house build of the warm red stone of the country it have destroy the church and tear up the graveyard and when its exile inhabitant return to it by degree even french courage and french thrift quail before the task of reconstruction but presently there arrive a quiet american lady who begin to make friend with the people of vitrimont to find out what they want and to consult with all those on the spot who could help to bring the vision in she mind to pass -- with the préfet with the official local and governmental of the neighbouring town with the catholic woman of the richer lorraine family gentle charitable devout who quickly perceive she quality and set themselves to co-operate with she it be the american lady 's intention -- simply -- to rebuild vitrimont and she be steadily accomplish it with the help of generous money subsidy come month by month from one rich american woman -- a woman of san francisco -- across the atlantic how one envy that american woman the sight of miss polk at work live indeed a warm memory in one 's heart she have establish herself in two tiny room in a peasant 's cottage which have be make just habitable for she a few touch of bright color a picture or two a book or two some flower with furniture of the simplest -- amid these surroundings on the outskirts of the ruin village with one of its capable kindly face woman to run the _ ménage _ miss polk life and work realize bit by bit the plan of the new vitrimont which have be draw for she by the architect of the department and follow loyally old lorraine tradition the church have be already restore and reopen the first mass within its thronged wall be -- so the spectator say -- a move sight _ that sad word -- joy _ -- landor 's pregnant phrase come back to one as express the bitter-sweet of all glad thing in this countryside which have see -- so short a time ago -- death and murder and outrage at they worst the gratitude of the villager to they friend and helper have take various form the most public mark of it so far have be miss folk 's formal admission to the burgess rights of vitrimont which be one of the old commune of france and the village insist that she shall claim she rights when the time come for divide the communal wood in the neighbouring forest she fellow citizen arrive to take she with they and show she how to obtain she share as to the affection and confidence with which she be regard it be enough to walk with she through the village to judge of its reality but it make one happy to think that it be not only american who have do this sort of work in france look for instance at the work of the society of friend in the department of the marne -- on that fragment of the battlefield which extend from bar-le-duc to vitry st françois go and ask write a french writer in 1915 for the village of huiron or that of glanne or that other with its name to shudder at splash with blood and powder -- sermaize inquire for the english quaker book perhaps have teach you to think of they as people with long black coat and long face where be they here be only a band of workman smooth-faced -- not like we country folk they laugh and sing while they make the shaving fly under the plane and the saw they be build wooden house and roofing they with tile around they be poor people whose feature be stiff and gray like those of the dead these be the woman the old man the child the weakling of we sweet france who have live for month in damp cave and den till they look like lazarus rise from the tomb but life be begin to come back to they eye and they lip the hand they stretch out to you tremble with joy to-night they will sleep in a house in _ they _ house and inside there will be bed and table and chair and thing to cook with as they go in and look they embrace each other sobbing by June 1915 150 friend have rebuild more than 400 house and rehouse more than seven hundred person they have provide plough and other agricultural gear seed for the harvest field and for the garden poultry for the farmyard and from that day to this the adorable work have go on _ by this shall all man know that ye be my disciple if ye love one another _ \* \* \* \* \* it be difficult to tear oneself away from theme like this when the story one have still to tell be the story of gerbéviller at vitrimont the great dream of christianity -- the city of god on earth -- seem still reasonable at hérémenil and gerbéviller we be within sight and hearing of deed that befoul the human name and make one despair of a world in which they can happen at luncheon in a charming house of old lorraine with a intellectual and spiritual atmosphere that remind I of a book that be one of the abide joy of my younger day -- the _ récit d'une soeur _ -- we hear from the lip of some of those present a account of the arrival at lunéville of the fugitive from gerbéviller after the entry of the bavarian into the town woman and child and old man literally mad with terror have escape from the burning town and find they way over the thirteen kilomètres that separate gerbéviller from lunéville no intelligible account could be get from they they have see thing that shatter the nerve and brain of the weak and old they be scarcely human in they extremity of fear and when a hour later we ourselves reach gerbéviller the terror which have inspire that frenzied flight become as we listen to soeur julie a tangible presence haunt the ruin town gerbéviller and soeur julie be great name in france to-day gerbéviller with nomény badonviller and sermaize stand in france for what be most famous in german infamy soeur julie the chère soeur of so many narrative for that form of courage and whole-hearted devotion which be specially dear to the french because it have in it a touch of _ panache _ of audacity it be not too meek it get its own back when it can and like to punish the sinner as well as to forgive he sister julie of the order of st charle of nancy madame rigard in civil parlance have be for year when the war break out the head of a modest cottage hospital in the small country town of gerbéviller the town be prosperous and pretty its garden run down to the mortagne flow at its foot and it own a country house in a park full of treasure new and old -- tapestry picture book -- as lorraine like to have such thing about she but unfortunately it occupy one of the central point of the fighting in the campaign of lorraine after the defeat of general castelnau 's army at morhange on August 20th 1914 the exultant and victorious german push on rapidly after that action lunéville be occupy and the fight spread to the district south and west of that town the campaign however last only three week and be determine by the decisive french victory of September 8th on the grand couronné by September 12th nancy be safe lunéville and gerbéviller have be retake and the german line have be drive back to where we see it from the hill of léomont but in that three week a hell of cruelty in addition to all the normal suffering of war have be let loose on the village of lorraine on nomény to the north of nancy on badonviller baccarat and gerbéviller to the south the bavarian troops whose record be among the worst in the war get terribly out of hand especially when the tide turn against they and if there be one criminal who if he be still live will deserve and i hope get a impartial trial some day before a international tribunal it will be the bavarian general general clauss here be the first-hand testimony of m mirman the prefét of the department at gerbeviller he write the ruin and slaughter of the town and its inhabitant have nothing to do with legitimate war : we be here in presence of a inexpiable crime the crime be sign such signature be soon rub out i see that of the murderer -- and i bear my testimony the bandit who be at work here be assassin : i have see the body of they victim and take the evidence on the spot they shoot down the inhabitant like rabbit kill they haphazard in the street on they doorstep almost at arm 's length of these victim it be still difficult to ascertain the exact number it will be more than fifty most of the victim have be bury when i first enter the town here and there however in a garden at the entrance to a cellar the corpse of woman still await burial in a field just outside the town i see on the ground they hand tie some with they eye bandage -- fifteen old man -- murder they be in three group of five the man of each group have evidently cling to each other before death the clenched hand of one of they still hold a old pipe they be all old man -- with white hair some day have elapse since they murder but they aspect in death be still venerable they quiet close eye seem to appeal to heaven a staff officer of the second army who be with I photograph the scene with other _ pièces de conviction _ the photograph be in the hand of the governmental commission charge with investigate the crime of the german during this war the bavarian soldier in gerbéviller be not only murderer -- they be incendiary even more deliberate and thorough-going than the soldier of von kluck 's army at senli with the exception of a few house beyond the hospital spare at the entreaty of soeur julie and on she promise to nurse the german wound the whole town be deliberately burn out house by house the bare wall leave stand the rest destroy and as _ after the fire _ the place be twice take and retake under bombardment its present condition may be imagine it be during the burning that some of the worst murder and outrage take place for there be a maddening force in triumphant cruelty which be deadlier than that of wine under it man become demon and all that be human perish the excuse of course be here as at senlis -- les civils ont tiré there be not the slightest evidence in support of the charge as at senli there be a french rear-guard of 57 chasseur -- leave behind to delay the german advance as long as possible they be tell to hold they ground for five hour they hold it for eleven fight with reckless bravery and firing from a street below the hospital the german take by surprise lose a good many man before at small loss to themselves the chasseur retreat in they rage at the unexpected check and feeling no doubt already that the whole campaign be go against they the german avenge themselves on the town and its helpless inhabitant we half-hour in soeur julie 's parlor be a wonderful experience imagine a portly woman of sixty with a shrewd humorous face talk with french vivacity and with many homely turn of phrase draw straight from that life of the soil and the peasant amid which she work a woman name in one of general castelnau 's order of the day and entitle to wear the legion of honor a woman too who have see horror face to face as few woman even in war have see it yet still simple racy full of irony and full of heart talk as a mother might talk of she grand blessés but always with humorous aside and a utter absence of pose or pretence flash now into scorn and now into tenderness as she describe the conduct of the german officer who search she hospital for arm or the helplessness of the wound man whom she protect i will try and put down some of she talk it throw much light for I on the psychology of two nation during the fighting we have always about 300 of we wound -lrb- _ no cher blessés _ -rrb- in this hospital as fast as we send they off other come in all we store be soon exhaust i be thankful we have some good wine in the cellar -- about 200 bottle you understand madame that when we go to nurse we people in they farm they do not pay we but they like to give we something -- very often it be a bottle of old wine and we put it in the cellar when it come in handy often for we invalid ah i be glad of it for we _ blessés _ i say to my sister -- ` give it they and not by thimbleful -- give they enough ' ah poor thing -- it make some of they sleep it be all we have one day i pass a soldier who be lie back in he bed with a sigh of satisfaction ' _ ah ma soeur ça resusciterait un mort _ ' -lrb- that would bring a dead man to life -rrb- so i stop to ask what they have just give he and it be a large glass of lachryma christus but then come the day when the commandant the french commandant you understand come to I and say -- ` sister i have sad news for you i be go i be take away the wound -- and all my store those be my order ' ` but mon commandant you 'll leave I some of you store for the grand blessés whom you leave behind -- whom you can not move _ what _ -- you must take it all away ah ça -- _ non _ i do not want any extra -- i will not take you chloroform -- i will not take you bistouri -- i will not take you electric thing -- but -- hand over the iodine -lrb- _ en avant l'iode _ -rrb- hand over the cotton-wool -- hand over the gauze come my sister ' i can tell you i plunder he -- and my sister come with they apron and the linen-basket -- we carry away all we could then she describe the evacuation of the french wound at night -- 300 of they -- all but the 19 worst case leave behind there be no ambulance no proper preparation of any kind oh it be a confusion -- a ugly business -lrb- _ ce n'etait pa rise _ -rrb- the sister tear down and split up the shutter the door to serve as stretcher they tear sheet into long strip and tie we poor child on to the shutter and hoist they into country cart of every sort and description quick -- quick she give we a wonderful sense of the despairing haste in which the night retreat have to be effect all night they work go on the wound never make a sound -- they let we do what we would without a word and as for we my sister bind these big fellow -lrb- _ ce gro et grands messieurs _ -rrb- on to the improvise stretcher like a mother who fasten she child in its cot ah jésus the poverty and the misery of that time by the early morning all the french wound be go except the nineteen helpless case and all the french soldier have clear out of the village except the 57 chasseur whose order be to hold the place as long as they could to cover the retreat of the rest then when the chasseur finally withdraw the bavarian troops rush up the town in a state of furious excitement burn it systematically as they advance and treat the inhabitant as m mirman have describe soon soeur julie know that they be come up the hill towards the hospital i will quote the very language -- homely biblical direct -- in which she describe she feeling _ me rein flottaient comme ça -- ils allaient tomber à mes talon instantanément pas une goutte de salive dans la bouche _ or -- to translate it in the weaker english idiom -- my heart go down into my heel -- all in a moment my mouth be dry as a bone the german officer draw up and ask for the superior of the hospital she go out to meet they here she try to imitate the extraordinary arrogance of the german manner they tell I they would have to burn the hospital as they be inform man have be shoot from it at they troops i reply that if anyone have be shoot it be the french chasseur who be post in a street close by and have every right to shoot at last they agree to let the hospital alone and burn no more house if she would take in the german wound so presently the ward of the little hospital be full again to overflow but while the german wound be come in the german officer insist on search the nineteen french wound for arm i have to make way for they -- i _ have _ to say ' _ entrez messieurs _ ' then she drop she voice and say between she tooth -- think how hard that be for a lorrainer so two german officer go to the ward where the nineteen frenchman lay all helpless case and a scene follow very like that in the hospital at senlis one draw he revolver and cover the bed the other walk round poniard in hand throw back the bedclothes to look for arm but they find nothing -- _ only blood _ for we have have neither time enough nor dressing enough to treat the wound properly that night a frightful moment -- the cower patient -- the officer in a state of almost frenzied excitement search bed after bed at the last bed occupy by a badly wound and quite helpless youth the officer carry the dagger bring the blade of it so near to the boy 's throat that soeur julie rush forward and place she two hand in front of the poor bare neck the officer drop both arm to he side she say as if he have be shoot and stand stare at she quiver all over but from that moment she have conquer they for the german wounded soeur julie declare she have do she best and the officer in charge of they afterwards write she a letter of thanks then she mouth twist a little but i be not -- well i do not _ spoil _ they -lrb- _ je n'étais pa trop tendre _ -rrb- i do not give they we best wine and one officer whose wound she dress a prussian colonel who never deign to speak to a bavarian captain near he be oblige to accept a good many home truth from she he be convince that she would poison he leg unless he put on the dressing himself but he allow she to bandage he afterwards during this operation -- which she hint she have perform in a rather spartan fashion -- he whimper all the time and she be able to give he a good deal of she mind on the war and the behavior of he troops he and the other she say be always talk about they kaiser one might have think they see he sit on the cloud in two or three day the french return victorious to find the burnt and outraged village the german be force in they turn to leave some badly wound man behind and the french _ poilus _ in they mingled wrath and exultation could not resist some of they abuse the german wound through the window of the hospital but then with a keen dramatic instinct soeur julie draw a striking picture of the contrast between the behavior of the french officer go down to the basement to visit the wounded german officer there and that of the german officer on a similar errand she convey with perfect success the cold civility of the frenchman begin with a few scathing word about the treatment of the town and then proceed to a investigation of the personal effect of the boche officer you papers gentleman ah those be private letter -- you may retain they you purse -- he look at they -- i hand they back to you you note-book _ ah ça -- c'est mon affaire _ -lrb- that be my business -rrb- i wish you good morning soeur julie speak emphatically of the drunkenness of the german they discover a store of mirabelle a strong liqueur in the town and have soon exhaust it with apparently the worst result well -- the march afternoon run on and we could have sit there listen till dusk but we french officer be grow a little impatient and one of they gently draw the dear sister as every one call she towards the end of she tale then with regret one leave the plain parlor the little hospital which have play so big a part and the brave elderly nun in whom one seem to see again some of those quality which spring from the very soil of lorraine and in the heart of a woman have once long year ago save france \* \* \* \* \* how much there would be still to say about the charm and the kindness of lorraine if only this letter be not already too long but after the tragedy of gerbéviller i must at any rate find room for the victory of amance alas -- the morning be dull and misty when we leave nancy for amance and the grand couronné so that when we stand at last on the famous ridge immediately north of the town which see on September 8th 1914 the wreck of the final german attempt on nancy there be not much visible except the dim line of forest and river in the plain below we view ought to have range as far almost as metz to the north and the vosge to the south but at any rate there at we foot lay the forest of champenoux which be the scene of the three frantic attempt of the german debouch from it on September 8th to capture the hill of amance and the plateau on which we stand again and again the 75 's on the hill mow down the advance horde and the heavy gun behind complete they work the german break and flee never to return nancy be save the right of the six french army advance across france at that very moment on the heel of the retreat german in the battle of the marne be protect thereby from a flank attack which might have alter all the fortune of the war and the course of history and general castelnau have write he name on the memory of europe _ but _ -- the kaiser be not there even colonel buchan in he admirable history of the war and major whitton in he recent book on the campaign of the marne repeat the current legend i can only bear witness that the two french staff officer who walk with we along the grand couronné -- one of whom have be in the battle of September 8th -- be positive that the kaiser be not in the neighborhood at the time and that there be no truth at all in the famous story which describe he as watch the battle from the edge of the forest of champenoux and ride off ahead of he defeat troops instead of make as he have reckon a triumphant entry into nancy well it be a pity the god do not order it so -- to be a tale for those that should come after one more incident before we leave lorraine on we way up to the high village of amance we have pass some three or four hundred french soldier at work they look with wide eye of astonishment at the two lady in the military car when we reach the village prince r -- the young staff officer from a neighbouring headquarters who be to meet we there have not arrive and we spend some time in a cottage chat with the woman who live in it then -- apparently -- while we be on the ridge word reach the man work below from the village that we be english and on the drive down we find they gather three or four hundred beside the road and as we pass they they cheer we heartily see in we for the moment the british alliance so that we leave the grand couronné with wet eye and heart all passionate sympathy towards lorraine and she people no 10 _ June 1st _ 1917 dear mr roosevelt -- in look back over my two precede letter i realize how inadequately they express the hundredth part of that vast and insoluble debt of a guilty germany to a injured france the realisation of which become -- for I -- in lorraine on the ourcq and in artoi a burning and overmastering thing from which i be rarely or never free and since i return to england on march 16th the conduct of the german troops under the express order of the german higher command in the french district evacuate since February by hindenburg 's retreat force have only sharpened and deepen the judgment of civilised man with regard to the fight german and all he way which have be form long since beyond alteration or recall think of it it cry to heaven think of reim and arras of verdun and ypre think of the hundred of town and village the thousand of individual house and farm that lie ruin on the old soil of france think of the suffering of the helpless and the old the hideous loss of life of stored-up wealth of natural and artistic beauty and then let we ask ourselves again the old old question -- why have this happen and let we go back again to the root fact from which whenever he or she consider they afresh -- and they should be constantly consider afresh -- every citizen of the ally nation can only draw fresh courage to endure the long and passionate preparation for war in germany the half-mad literature of a glorified force head by the bernhardi and treitschke and repeat by a thousand smaller folk before the war the far more illuminating manifesto of the intellectual since the war germany 's refusal of a conference as propose and press by great britain in the week before August 4th france 's acceptance of it germany 's refusal to respect the belgian neutrality to which she have sign she name france 's immediate consent the provision of mercy and of humanity sign by germany in the hague convention trample almost with a sneer under foot the jubilation over the _ lusitanium _ and the arrogant defense of all that have be most cruel and most criminal in the war as necessary to germany 's interest and therefore moral therefore justified let none -- none -- of these thing rest forget in we mind until peace be here and justice do the german army be capable of _ no undisciplined cruelty _ say the 93 professor without see how damn be the phrase no -- theirs be a cruelty by order meditate organise and deliberate the story of senli of varedde of gerbéviller which i have specially choose as free from that element of sexual horror which repel many sensitive people from even try to realize what have happen in this war be evidence -- one must insist again -- of a national mind and quality with which civilised europe and civilised america can make no truce and what folly lie behind the wickedness let I recall to american reader some of the phrase in the report of you former minister in belgium -- mr brand whitlock -- on the belgian deportation the slave hunt that germany have carry out in belgium and which have tear from nearly every humble home in the land a husband father son or brother these proceedings -lrb- say mr whitlock -rrb- place in relief the german capacity for blunder almost as sharply as the german capacity for cruelty they have destroy for generation any hope whatever of friendly relation between themselves and the belgian people for these thing be do not as with the early atrocity in the heat of passion and the first lust of war but by one of those deed that make one despair of the future of the human race -- a deed coldly plan studiously mature and deliberately and systematically execute a deed so cruel that german soldier be say to have weep in its execution and so monstrous that even german officer be now say to be ashamed but the average german neither weep nor blame he be generally amaze when he be not amuse by the state of feeling which such proceedings excite and if he be a intellectual a professor he will exhaust himself in ingenious and utterly callous defence of all that germany have do or may do a astonishing race -- the german professor the year before the war there be a historical congress in london there be a hospitality committee and my husband and i be ask to entertain some of the learn man i remember one in particular -- a old man with white hair who with he wife and daughter join the party after dinner he name be professor otto von gierke of the university of berlin i gather from he conversation that he and he family have be very kindly entertain in london he manner be somewhat harsh and over-bearing but he white hair and spectacles give he a venerable aspect and it be clear that he and he wife and daughter belong to a cultivate and intelligent _ milieu _ but who among he english host could possibly have imagine the thought and idea in that gray head i find a speech of he in a most illuminating book by a danish professor on german chauvinist literature -lrb- _ hurrah and hallelujah _ by j p bang dd professor of theology at the university of copenhagen translate by jessie bröchner -rrb- the speech be publish in a collection call _ german speech in hard time _ which contain name once so distinguish as those of von wilamovitz and harnack professor von gierke 's effusion begin with the usual german falsehood as to the origin of the war and then continue -- but now that we german be plunge in war we will have it in _ all its grandeur and violence _ neither fear nor _ pity _ shall stay we arm before it have completely bring we enemy to the ground they shall be reduce to such a condition that they shall never again dare even to snarl at germany then german kultur will show its full loveliness and strength enlighten the understanding of the foreign race absorb and incorporate into the empire and make they see that only from german kultur can they derive those treasure which they need for they own particular life at the moment when these line be write -- for the book be publish early in the war -- the orgy of murder and lust and hideous brutality which have sweep through belgium in the first three week of the war be begin to be know in england the trace of it be still fresh in town after town and village after village of that tortured land while the testimony of its victim be just begin to be sift by the expert of the bryce commission the hostage of varedde the helpless victim of nomény of gerbéviller of sermaize of sommeille and a score of other place in france be scarcely cold in they grave but the old white-haired professor stand there unashamed unctuously offer the kultur of he criminal nation to a expectant world and when the victory be win he say complacently -- the whole world will stand open to we we war expense will be pay by the vanquish the black-white-and-red flag will wave over all sea we countryman will hold highly respect post in all part of the world and we shall maintain and extend we colony _ god forbid _ so say the whole english-speaking race you on you side of the sea and we on ours but the feeling of abhorrence which be not at such a moment as this sternly and incessantly translate into deed be of no account so let I return to a last survey of the war on my home journey from nancy i pass through pari and be again welcome at ghq on my way to boulogne in paris the breathless news of the german ' quicken retreat on the somme and the aisne be varied one morning by the welcome tiding of the capture of bagdad and at the house of one of the most distinguish of european publicist m joseph reinach of the _ figaro _ i meet on we passage through the lively vigorous man with he look of irish vivacity and force -- m painlevé -- who only a few day later be to succeed general lyautey as french minister for war at we own headquarters i find opinion as quietly confident as before we be on the point of enter bapaume the push up be go extraordinarily well owe to the excellence of the staff-work and the energy and efficiency of all the auxiliary service -- the engineer and the labor battalion all the maker of road and railway the builder of hut and leveller of shell-broken ground and the vital importance of the long struggle on the somme be become every day more evident only about russium both in pari and at ghq be there a kind of silence which mean great anxiety lord milner and general castelnau have return from petrograd in pari at any rate it be not believe that they bring good news all the huge effort of the ally to supply russium with money munitions and transport be they to go for nothing owe to some sinister and thwarting influence which seem to be strangle the national life then a few day after my return home the great explosion come and when the first tumult and dust of it clear away there indeed be a strangely altered europe from france great britain and america go up a great cry of sympathy of congratulation the tsardom be go -- the dark force have be overthrow the political exile be free and freedom seem to stand there on the russian soil shade she bewildered eye against the sun of victory amaze at she own deed but ten week have pass since then and it would be useless to disguise that the outburst of warm and sincere rejoicing that greet the overthrow of the russian autocracy have pass once more into anxiety be russium go to count any more in this great struggle for a liberated europe or will the force of revolution devour each other till in the course of time the fate savior of society appear and old tyranny come back general smut himself the hero of a national struggle which have end happily for both side and the world have be give admirable expression here to the thought of many heart first of all to the emotion with which all lover of liberty have see the all but bloodless fall of the old tyranny it might have take another fifty year or a century of tragedy and suffer to have bring it about but the enormous strain of this war have do it and the russian people stand free in they own house now what will they do with they freedom ten week have pass and the russian army be still disorganised the russian future uncertain meanwhile germany have be able to throw against the ally in france and austrium have be able to throw against italy on the isonzo force which they think they need no longer against russium and the pace of victory have thereby be slacken but general smut make he eloquent appeal to the russium which once hold and break napoleon : liberty be like young wine -- it mount to you head sometimes and liberty as a force in the world require organization and discipline there must be organization and there must be discipline the russian people be learn to-day the greatest lesson of life -- that to be free you must work very hard and struggle very hard they have the sensation of freedom now that they bond and shackle be go and no doubt they feel the joy the intoxication of they new experience but they be live in a world which be not govern by formula however cleverly devise but in a world of brute force and unless that be smash even liberty itself will suffer and can not live will the newly-freed forget those that be still suffer and bind will russia forget belgium -- and forget serbium serbium be the reason why we go to war she be go to be crush under the austrian heel and russium say this shall not be allow serbium have in that way become the occasion probably of the greatest movement for freedom the world have ever see be we go to forget serbium no we must stand by those martyr people who have stand by the great force of the world if the great democracy of the world become tired if they become faint if they halt by the way if they leave those little one in the lurch then they shall pay for it in war more horrible than human mind can foresee i be sure we shall stand by those little one they have go under but we have not go under england and america france and russium have not go under and we shall see they through and shame on we if ever the least thought enter we mind of not see they through \* \* \* \* \* noble and sincere word one can but hope that the echo of they may reach the ear and heart of russium but if towards russium the sky that seem to have clear so suddenly be at present clouded and obscure -- westward look the land be bright a fortnight after the abdication of the tsar congress meet in washington and president wilson 's speech announce war between germany and america have ring through the world all that you sir the constant friend and champion of the ally and still more of they cause and all that those who feel with you in the state have hope for so long be now to be fulfil it may take some time for you country across those thousand mile of sea to _ realize _ the war to feel it in every nerve as we do but in these seven week -- how much you have do as well as say you have welcome the british mission in a way to warm we british heart you have show the french mission how passionately america feel for france you have send we american destroyer which have already play they part in a substantial reduction of the submarine loss you have lend the ally 150 million sterling you have pass a bill which will ultimately give you a army of two million man you be raise such troops as will immediately increase the number of american in france to 100000 -- equal five german division you be send we ten thousand doctor to england and france and hundred of they have already arrive you have double the personnel of you navy and increase you regular army by nearly 180000 man you be construct 3500 aeroplane and training 6000 airman and you be now talk of 100000 aeroplane not bad for seven week \* \* \* \* \* for the ally also those seven week have be full of achievement on easter Monday April 9th the battle of arras begin with the brilliant capture by the canadian of that very vimy ridge i have see on march 2nd from the plateau of notre dame de lorette lie in the middle distance under the spring sunshine that expose hill-side -- those battery through which i have walk -- those crowd road and travel gun those march troops and pile ammunition dump -- how the recollection of they give accent and fire to the picture of the battle as the telegram from the front build it up day by day before one 's eye week by week afterwards with a mastery in artillery and in aviation that nothing could withstand the british army push on through April after the first great attack which give we the vimy ridge and bring we line close to lens in the north and to the neighborhood of bullecourt in the south the 23rd of April see the second british advance which give we gravrelle and guemappe and make further breach in the hindenburg line on April 16th the french make they magnificent attack in champagne with 10000 prisoner on the first day -lrb- increase to 31000 by may 24th -rrb- -- follow by the capture of the immensely important position of moronviller and craonne altogether the ally in little more than a month take 50000 prisoner and large number of gun general allenby for instance capture 150 gun general home 64 while general byng form three pan-germanic group out of he we recover many square mile of the rob territory of france -- 40 village one day 100 village another while the condition in which the german have leave both the recover territory and its inhabitant have steel once more the determination of the nation at war with germany to put a end to this particular form of ill-doing on the part of a uncivilised race during may there have be no such striking advance on either the french or british front though roeux and bullecourt both very important point from they bearing on the drocourt-quéant line behind which lie douaus and cambraus have be capture by the british and the french have continuously better they line and defy the most desperate counter-attack but may have be specially italy 's month the italian offensive on the isonzo and the carso beginning on may 14th in ten day achieve more than any onlooker have dare to hope in the section between tolmino and gorizium where the isonzo run in a fine gorge the western bank belong to italy and the eastern to austria all the important height on the eastern bank across the river except one that may fall to they any day have be carry by the superb fighting of the italian amongst whom dante 's fellow citizen the florentine regiment and regiment draw from the rich tuscan hill have specially distinguish themselves while on the carso that rock-wilderness which stretch between gorizium and trieste where fighting especially in hot weather supply a supreme test of human endurance the italian have push on and on from point to point till now they be within ten mile of trieste british artillery be with the italian army and british gun have be shell military quarter and store in the outskirts of trieste while british monitor be co-operate at sea the end be not yet for the austrian will fight to they last man for trieste and owe to the russian situation the austrian have be able to draw reinforcement from galicium which have seriously stiffen the task of italy but the omen be all good and the italian nation be more solidly behind its army than ever before so that in spite of the apparent lull in the ally offensive on the french front during the later week of may all have really be go well the only result of the furious german attempt to recover the ground lose in April have be to exhaust the strength of the attacker and the ally cause be steadily profit thereby we own troops have never be more sure of final victory let I quote a soldier 's plain and graphic letter recently publish : this break-away from trench war give we a much better time we know now that we be the top dog and that we be keep the german on the move and they be busy wonder all the time they do not know where the next whack be come from mind you i be far from say that we can get they out of the hindenburg line without a lot of fight yet but it be only a question of time it be a different sensation go over the top now from what it be in the early day you see we use to know that we gun be not nearly so many as the german ' and that we have not the stuff to put over now we just climb out of a trench and walk behind a curtain of fire it make a difference it seem to I we be steadily beat the boche at he own game he use to be strong in the matter of gun but that be be take from he he use gas -- do you remember the way the canadian get the first lot well now we gas shell be a bit too strong for he and so be we flame shell i bet he wish now that he have not think of he flame-thrower then there be another thing and that be the way we chap keep improve the fritz be not so good as they use to be you get up against a bunch now and again that fight well but we begin to see more of the ` kamerad ' business it be as much up to the people at home to see this thing through as it be to the man out here we need the gun and shell to blow the german out of the strong place that they have have year to build and dig and the folk at home can leave the rest to we we can do the job all right if they back we up and do not get tired i think we have show they that too you 'll get all that from the papers but maybe it come better from a soldier you can take it from I that it be true i have see the beginning and i have be in place where thing be pretty desperate for we and i have see _ the start of the finish _ the difference be marvellous i have only have a army education and it might strike you that i be not able to judge i be a soldier though and i look at it as a soldier i say give we the stuff keep on give we the tool and the man to use they and -- it may be soon or it may be long -- we 'll beat the boche to he knee the truth seem to be that the german be outmatch first and foremost in aircraft and in gun you will remember the quiet certainty of we young flight-commander on march 1st -- when the next big offensive come we shall down they just as we do on the somme the prophecy have be make good abundantly good -- at the cost of many a precious life the air observation on we side have be far better and more daring than that on the german side and the work of we artillery have be proportionately more accurate and more effective as to gun and ammunition the number of heavy shell fire in the first week of the present offensive -- say a official account -- be nearly twice as great as it be in the first week of the somme offensive and in the second week it be 6-1\/2 time as great as it be in the second week of the somme offensive as a result of this great artillery fire which have never be exceed in the whole course of the war a great saving of british life have be effect and no praise can be too high for we gunner in a field where two year ago germany have the undisputed predominance we have now beat she alike in the supply of gun and in the daring and efficiency of we gunner nevertheless let there be no foolish underestimate of the still formidable strength of the german the british and french mission will have bring to you government all available information on this point there can be no doubt that a wonderful effort as one of we minister call it have be make by germany during the past winter she have mobilise all she people for the war as she have never do yet she have increase she munitions and put fresh division in the field the estimate of she present fighting strength give by we military writer and correspondent do not differ very much colonel repington in _ the time _ put the german fight man on both front at 4500000 with 500000 on the line of communication and a million in the german depot mr belloc 's estimate be somewhat less but not materially different both writer agree that we be in presence of germany 's last and greatest effort that she have no more behind and that if the ally go on as they have begin -- and now with the help of america -- this summer should witness the fulfilment at least of that forecast which i report to you in my earlier letter as so general among the chief of we army in france -- _ ie _ this year will see the war _ decide _ but may not see it end since i come home indeed more optimistic prophecy have reach I from france for some week after the american declaration of war we shall be home by christmas be the common cry -- and amongst some of the best-informed but the russian situation have no doubt : react to some extent on these April hope and it be clear that during April and early may under the stimulus of the submarine success german spirit have temporarily revive never have the junker be more truculent never have the pan-germans talk wilder nonsense about annexation and indemnity until quite recently at any rate the whole german nation -- except no doubt a cautious and intelligent few at the real source of information -- believe that the submarine campaign would soon bring england to she knee they be so confident that they run the last great risk -- they bring america into the war how do it look now the situation be still critical and dangerous but i recall the half-smiling prophecy of my naval host in the middle of march as we stand together on the deck of he ship look over he curtseying and newly-hatched flock of destroyer gather round he in harbor be it not perhaps as near the mark as that of we airman host on march 1st have prove itself to be have patience and you 'll see great thing the situation be serious but quite healthy two month and a little more since the word be speak : -- and week by week heavy as it still be the toll of submarine loss be at least keep in check and you navy now at work with ours -- most fitting and welcome nemesis -- be help england to punish and baffle the uncivilised race who if they have they way would blacken and defile for ever the old and glorious record of man upon the sea you who store such thing in you enviable memory will recollect how in the odyssey that kindly race of singer and wrestler the phaeacian be the escort and conveyer of all who need and ask for protection at sea they keep the waterway for civilised man against pirate and assassin as you nation and ours mean to keep they in the future it be true that a treacherous sea-god jealous of any interference with he right to slay and drown at will smite the gallant ship that bear odysseus safely home on she return and make a rock of she for ever poseidon may stand for the kaiser of the story he be go however with all he kin but the humane and civilise tradition of the sea which this legend carry back into the dawn of time -- it shall be for the ally -- shall it not -- in this war to rescue it once and for ever from the criminal violence which would stain the free path of ocean with the murder and sudden death of those who have be in all history the object of man 's compassion and care -- the wound the helpless the woman and the child \* \* \* \* \* for the rest let I gather up a few last thread of this second instalment of we british story of that vast section of the war concern with the care and transport of the wound and the health of the army it be not my purpose to speak at length in these letter like everything else it have be steadily and eagerly perfect during the past year never have the wound in battle in any war be so tenderly and skilfully care for -- never have such intelligence and goodwill be apply to the health condition of such huge mass of man nor be it necessary to dwell again as i do last year on the wonderful work of woman in the war it have grow in complexity and bulk women-worker in munitions be now nearly a fifth of the whole body but essentially the general aspect of it have not change much in the last twelve month but what have change be _ the food situation _ owe partly to submarine attack and partly to the general shortage in the food-supply of the world in one of my earlier letter i speak with anxiety of the still unsettled question -- will the house-wife and mother of the nation realize -- in time -- we food necessity will they thrift-work in the home complete the munition-work of woman in the factory or must we submit to the ration-system with all its cumbrous inequality and its host of official because the will and intelligence of we people which have rise so remarkably to the other task of this war be not equal to the task of check food consumption without compulsion it look now as though they would be equal since my earlier letter the country have be more and more generally cover with the national war savings committee which have be carry into food-economy the energy they spend originally on the raising of the last great war loan the consumption of bread and flour throughout the country have go down -- not yet sufficiently -- but enough to show that the idea have take hold : -- _ save bread and help victory _ and since you declaration of war it strengthen we own effort to know that america with she boundless food-supplies be stand by and that she man-and sea-power be now to be combine with ours in defeat the last effort of germany to secure by submarine piracy what she can not win on the battle-field meanwhile change which will have far-reaching consequence after the war be take place in we own home food-supply the long neglect of we home agriculture the slow and painful dwindle of we country population be to come to a end the government call for the sowing of three million additional acre of wheat in great britain and throughout the country the steam tractor be at work plough up land which have either never bear wheat or which have cease to bear it for nearly a century thirty-five thousand acre of corn land be to be add to the national store in this county of hertfordshire alone the wages of agricultural labourer have rise by more than one-third the farmer be to be protect and encourage as they never have be since the cobdenite revolution and the corn production bill now pass through parliament show what the grim lesson of this war have do to change the old and easy optimism of we people as to the energy that have be throw into other means of food-supply let the potato now grow in the flower-bed in front of buckingham palace stand for a symbol of it the potato-crop of this year -- bar accident -- will be enormous and the whole life of we country village have be quicken by the effort that have be make to increase the produce of the cottage garden and allotment the pride and pleasure of the woman and the old man in what they have be able to do at home while they son and husband be fight at the front be move to see food price be very high life in spite of increase wages be hard but the heart of england be set on win this war and the letter which pass between the father and mother in this village where i live and the son at the front in whom they take a daily and hourly pride would not give germany much comfort could she read they i take this little scene as a illustration fresh from the life of my own village : imagine a visitor on behalf of the food-economy movement endeavor to persuade a village mother to come to some cookery lesson organise by the local committee mr s be discover sit at a table on which be preparation for a meal she receive the visitor and the visitor 's remark with a air -- quite unconscious -- of tragic meditation and she honest labour-stained hand sweep over the thing on the table cheese -- she say at last -- _ eightpence _ the ` arf pound a pause the hand point in another direction _ lard -- sevenpence _ -- that scrubby little piece _ sugar _ sixpence ` a ` penny the pound the best part of two shillin 's go whatever _ be _ we comin ' to gloom descend on the little kitchen the visitor be at a loss -- when suddenly the round motherly face change -- but _ there _ now i be goin ' to smile whatever ` appens i be not one as be goin ' to give in and we ` ad a letter from arthur -lrb- she son in the trench -rrb- this morning to say ` be company 's on the list for leave and ` e 's apply -- oh dear miss just to _ think _ of it then with a catch in she voice : but it be not the comin ' home miss -- it be _ the goin ' back again _ yes i 'll come to the cookin ' miss if i _ possibly _ can there be the spirit of we country folk -- patriotic patient true as to labor condition generally i speak perhaps in my first letter rather too confidently for the moment of the labor situation there have be one serious strike among the engineer since i begin to write and a good many minor trouble but neither the tyne nor the clyde be involve and though valuable time be lose in the end the man be bring back to work quite as much by the pressure of public opinion among they own comrade man and woman as by any government action the government have since take a important step from which much be hope by divide up the country into district and appoint local commissioner to watch over and if they can remove the cause of unrest -- cause which be often connect with the inevitable friction of a colossal transformation and sometimes with the sheer fatigue of the worker whose achievement -- munition-worker ship-wright engineer -- during these three year have be nothing short of marvellous as to finance the colossal figure of last year of which i give a summary in _ england 's effort _ have be much surpass the budget of great britain for this year include advance to we ally reach the astounding figure of two thousand three hundred million sterling we war expenditure be now close upon six million sterling a day -lrb- # 5600000 -rrb- of this the expenditure on the army and navy and munitions have rise from a daily average of nearly three million sterling as it stand last year to a daily average of nearly five million but the nation have not spend in vain compare the first twenty-four day of the fighting on the somme last year -- say mr bonar law in a recent speech -- with the first twenty-four day of the operation of this spring four time as much territory have be take from the enemy in this offensive as be take in the somme against the resistance of double the number of german division and of those division just one-half have have to be withdraw -- shatter -- from the fight line while the british casualty in the offensive have be from 50 to 75 per cent less than the casualty in the somme fight consider too the news which be still fresh as i finish this letter -- -lrb- June 11th -rrb- -- of the victory of messine perhaps the most complete the most rounded success -- so far -- that have fall to the british army in the war last year in three month ' fighting on the somme we take the strongly fortify albert ridge and force the german retreat of last February on April 8th of this year begin the battle of arras which give we the vimy ridge and a free outlook over the douaus plain and finally on June 7th four day ago the messine ridge which i see last year on march 2nd -- apparently impregnable and inaccessible -- from a neighbouring hill with the german trench score along its slope be capture by general plumer and he splendid army in a few hour after more than twelve month ' preparation with lighter casualty than have ever fall to a british attack before with heavy loss to the enemy large capture of gun and 7000 prisoner we troops have since move steadily forward and the strategic future be rich in possibility the german have regain nothing and the german press have not yet dare to tell the german people of the defeat let we remember also the victorious campaign of this year in mesopotamium and the welcome stroke of the past week in greece by which king tino have be at last dismiss and the liberal force of the greek nation set free \* \* \* \* \* aye we do consider -- we do remember -- these thing we feel that the goal be draw slowly but steadily nearer that ultimate victory be certain and with victory the dawn of a better day for europe but who least of all a woman can part from the tragic spectacle of this war without bitterness of spirit _ who will give we back we child _ wickedness and wrong will find they punishment and the dark hour now pass in the torch-race of time will hand the light on to hour of healing and of peace but the dead return not it be they whose appealing voice seem to be in the air to-day as we think of america among the celt of ancient brittany there be a belief which still survive in the tradition of the breton peasant and in the name of part of the breton coast every all soul ' night say a story at least as old as the sixth century the soul of the dead gather on the cliff of brittany above that bay which be still call the bai des trépassés wait for they departure across the ocean to a far region of the west where the god sit for judgment and the good find peace on that night the fisherman hear at midnight mysterious knocking at they door they go down to the water 's edge and behold there be boat unknown to they with no visible passenger but the fisherman take the oar and though they see nothing they feel the presence of the soul crowd into the boat and they row on and on into the west past the farthest point of any land they know suddenly they feel the boat lighten of all that weight of spirit and the soul be go -- streaming out with solemn cry and longing into the wide illimitable ocean of the west in search of some invisible shore so now the call of those hundred of thousand who have give they young life -- so beloved so rich in promise -- for they country and the freedom of man be in you ear and ours the dead be witness of the compact between you and we for that cause to which they bring they ungrudged sacrifice have now lay its resistless claim on you together the free people of europe and america have now to carry it to victory -- victory just necessary and final mary a ward end of the project gutenberg ebook of towards the goal by mr
