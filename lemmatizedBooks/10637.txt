fact which be note by american reviewer on the appearance of the translation and have also make sundry change in the work design to bring it down to the present time and to adapt its counsel to the new light that be break in upon we in the progress of event these change however have be few and relate chiefly to the policy of emancipation for so truly have this remarkable book prove a prophecy that the author on review it after a lapse of several eventful month can find nothing to strike out as have prove untrue we be indebted to the kindness of count de gasparin for one or two correction of trifling biographical misstatement in the translator 's preface the pamphlet concern the trent affair and the surrender of messr mason and slidell which we append to this edition will be read with interest at the present crisis as a able exposition of the view of european statesman on the international difficulty which have spring so unexpectedly upon we while it justify the surrender on the ground of technical error it utter a solemn warning in the name of europe that if the demand be a mere pretext to force we into a ruinous war such a proceeding will not again be tolerate this pamphlet entitle _ une parole de paix _ be the article which appear in the _ journal des débats _ December 11 12 and 13 since publish as a _ brochure _ with some addition this new edition be especially valuable inasmuch as it seal the faith of we noble friend and sympathizer a few month ago say count de gasparin in he preface i believe in the uprising of a great people now i be sure of it let not the issue shame we by disappointing he trust mary l booth new york _ February _ 1862 \* \* \* \* \* preface to the second edition i have nothing to change in these page when i write they before the break out of the american crisis i foreboded which be not difficult that the crisis would be long and grievous that there would be mistake and reverse but i foreboded also that through these mistake and reverse a immense progress be about to come to light some have undertake to doubt it : at the sight of civil war and the evil which it necessarily entail at the recital of one or two defeat they have hasten to raise they hand to heaven and to proclaim in every key the ruin of the united state this be not the place to discuss judgment sometimes superficial sometimes malevolent which too often pass current among we to examine what have be what should be the attitude of we europe what be we responsibility what be we interest and we duty we alone i be ashamed to admit it we alone run the risk of render doubtful the final triumph of the good cause we have not cease to be in spite of ourselves the only chance and the only hope of the champion of slavery perhaps i shall enter ere long in a new study upon the important subject which i confine myself to indicate here and which pre-occupy the government at washington to such a degree that it seem incline to order defensive preparation in view of a unnatural conflict between liberal america and ourselves everything may happen -- alas the seemingly impossible like all else it be not enough therefore to declare this impossible and monstrous it be not enough to prove that the present state of feeling in europe be far from give reason to foresee a intervention in favor of the south it be necessary to sap at the base these deplorable sophism more fully credit than be imagine which may in due time under the pressure of certain industrial need or of certain political combination urge france and england into a course which be not they own for the present i have only wish to repeat with a strengthened conviction what i say a few month ago i believe then in the uprising of a great people now i be sure of it valleyre _ November _ 2 1861 \* \* \* \* \* translator 's preface at this moment when we be anxiously scrutinize every indication of european feeling with respect to the american question the advent of a book bear the stamp of a close philosophical political and practical study of the subject and written withal in so hopeful a spirit as to make we feel with the writer that whatever may result from the present crisis must be for good can not fail to be of public interest and utility so truly prophetic be this work in its essence that we can hardly believe that it be write in great part amid the mist that precede the inauguration of mr lincoln all probability appear to have be foresee and the unerring exactness with which event have take place hitherto precisely in the direction indicate by the author encourage we to believe that this will continue until he prediction will have be fulfil to the end clear-sighted philosophical appreciative of american genius and accomplishment critical yet charitable to tenderness stigmatize the fault yet forgive the offender cheer we nation onward by word of encouragement bravely speak at the needed-moment menacing europe with the scorn of posterity if forget she oft-repeated profession she dare forsake the side of liberty to traffic in principle such be the scope of what a late reviewer call the wisest book which have be write upon america since de tocqueville few man be better qualify to judge american affair than count de gasparin a many-sided man combine the scholar the statesman the politician the man of letter and the finish gentleman possess of every advantage of culture wealth and position he have devote a long life to the advocacy of liberty in all its form whether religious or political and have end by make a profound study of

european in a position to comprehend man and thing concern the storm which be now agitate the whole country it can scarcely fail of a hearty welcome i commend the follow interpretation which i have

be no more great question in europe to dispute we attention with the american question or until the american question have shape itself and we be able to know clearly what interest it will serve in what consequence it will end i be not sorry i confess to applaud duty before it be recommend by success when success shall have come man eager to celebrate it will not be want and i shall leave to they the care of demonstrate then that the north have be in the right that it have save the united state to construct the philosophy of event after they have pass be very interesting without doubt but the work to be accomplish to-day be far more serious the point in question be to sustain we friend when they be in need of we when they battle far from be win be scarcely begin the point in question be to give we support -- the very considerable support of european opinion -- at the time when it can be of service the point in question be to assume we small share of responsibility in one of the gravest conflict of this age let we enlist for the slave state on they part be lose no time they have profit well i must admit by the advantage assure to they by the complicity of the minister of mr buchanan in the face of the inevitable indecision of a new government around which care have be take to accumulate in advance every impossibility of act the decide bearing of the extreme south its air of audacity and defiance have have a certain éclat and a certain success already its partisan raise they head they dare speak in its favor among we they insult free trade by transform it into a argument destine to serve the interest of slavery and shall we remain mute shall we listen to the counsel of that false wisdom that always come too late so much do it fear to declare itself too early shall we not feel impel to show in all its true light the sacred cause of liberty ah i declare that the blood boil in my vein i have hasten and would gladly have hasten still more circumstance

\* \* \* \* a great people rise \* \* \* \* \* introduction the title of this work will produce the effect of a paradox the general opinion be that the united state continue to pursue a upward course until the election of mr lincoln and that since then they have be decline it be not difficult and it be very necessary to show that this opinion be absolutely false before the recent victory of the adversary of slavery the american confederation in spite of its external progress and its apparent prosperity be suffer from a fearful malady which have well-nigh prove mortal now a operation have take place the suffering have increase the gravity of the situation be reveal for the first time perhaps to inattentive eye do this mean that the situation be not grave when it do not appear so do this mean that we must deplore a violent crisis which alone can bring the cure i do not deplore it -- i admire it i recognize in this energetic reaction against the disease the moral vigor of a people habituate to the laborious struggle of liberty the rising of a people be one of the rarest and most marvellous prodigy present by the annals of humanity ordinarily nation that begin to decline decline constantly more and more a rare power of life be need to retrieve they position and stop in its course a decay once begin we have a strange way of second the generous enterprise into which the united state have enter with so much courage we prophesy to they nothing but misfortune we almost tell they that they have cease to exist we give they to understand that in elect mr lincoln they have renounce they greatness that they have precipitate themselves head foremost into a abyss that they have ruin they prosperity sacrifice they future render henceforth impossible the magnificent character which be reserve to they mr buchanan we seem to say be the last president of the union this thank god be the reverse of the truth but lately indeed the united state be advance to they ruin but lately there be reason to mourn in thinking of they the step might have be count which it remain for they to take to complete the union of they destiny with that of a accursed and perishable institution -- a institution which corrupt and destroy every thing with which it come in contact to-day new prospects be open to they they will have to combat to labor to suffer the crime of a century be not repair in a day the right path when long forsake be not find again without effort guilty tradition and old complicity be not break through without sacrifice it be none the less true notwithstanding that the hour of effort and of sacrifice grievous as it may be be the very hour of deliverance the election of mr lincoln will be one of the great date of american history it close the past but it open the future with it be about to commence if the same spirit be maintain and if excessive concession do not succeed in undoing all that have be do a new era at once purer and greater than that which have just end let other accuse I of optimism i willingly agree to it i believe that optimism be often right here below we need hope we need sometimes to receive good news we need to see sometimes the bright side of thing the bright side be often the true side if love be blindfold i see a triple bandage on the eye of hate kindliness have its privilege and i do not think myself in a worse position than another to judge the united state because they inspire I with a earnest sympathy because after have mourn they fault and tremble at they peril i have joyfully salute the noble and manly policy of which the election of mr lincoln be the symptom be it not true that at the first news we all seem to breathe a whiff of pure and free air from the other side of the ocean it be a pleasure in time like ours to feel that certain principle still live that they will be obey cost what it may that question of conscience can yet sometimes weigh down question of profit the abolition of slavery will be i have always think the principal conquest of the nineteenth century this will be its recommendation in the eye of posterity and the chief compensation for many of its weakness as for we old soldier of emancipation who have not cease to combat for it for twenty year and more at the tribunal and elsewhere we shall be excuse without doubt for see in the triumph of we american friend something else than a subject of lamentation chapter i american slavery if they have not triumph do you know who would have gain the victory slavery be only a word -- a vile word doubtless but to which we in time become habituate to what do we not become habituate we have store of indulgence and indifference for the social iniquity which have find they way into the current of cotemporary civilization and which can invoke prescription so we have come to speak of american slavery with perfect sing froid we be not therefore to stop at the word but to go straight to the thing and the thing be this : every day in all the southern state family be sell at retail : the father to one the mother to another the son to a third the young daughter to a fourth and the father the mother the child be scatter to the four wind of heaven these heart be break these poor being be give a prey to infamy and sorrow these marriage be rupture and adulterous union be form twenty league a hundred league away in the bosom and with the assent of a christian community every day too the domestic slave-trade carry on its work merchant in human flesh ascend the mississippus to seek in the _ produce _ state wherewith to fill up the vacuum cause unceasingly by slavery in the _ consume _ state they ascent make they scour the farm of virginium or of kentucky buying here a boy there a girl and other heart be tear other family be disperse other nameless crime be accomplish coolly simply legally : it be the necessary revenue of the one it be the indispensable supply of the other must not the south live and how dare any one travesty a fact so simple by what right be pen that eloquent calumny call uncle tom 's cabin a calumny i ask how any one would set to work to calumniate the custom which i have just describe say then that the law of the south be a calumny that the official act of the south be a calumny for i affirm that the simple reading of these act and these law a glance at the advertisement of a southern journal sadden the heart more and wound the conscience deeper than the most poignant page of mr harriet beecher stowe i admit willingly that there be many master who be very kind and very good i admit that there be some slave who be relatively happy i cast aside unhesitatingly the story of exceptional cruelty it be enough for I to see that these _ happy _ slave expose themselves to a thousand death to escape a situation declare preferable to that of we workman it be enough for I to hear the heart-rending cry of those woman and young girl who adjudge to the highest and last bidder become by the law and in a christian country the property yes the property -lrb- excuse the word it be the true one -rrb- of the debauchee they purchaser and remark here that the virtue of the master be a weak guarantee : he may die he may become bankrupt and nothing then can hinder he slave from be sell into the hand of the buyer who scour the country and make he choice we should calumniate the south if we amuse ourselves by make a collection of atrocious deed in the same manner that we should calumniate france by seek in the _ police gazette _ for the description of she social state there be notwithstanding this difference between the iniquity of slavery and we own : the first be almost always unpunished while the second be repress by the court a institution which permit evil create it in a great measure : in say that man be thing it necessarily engender more crime more act of violence more cowardly deed than the imagination of romancer will ever invent when a class have neither the right to complain nor to defend itself nor to testify in law when it can not make its voice hear in any manner we may be excuse for not take in earnest the idyl chant on its felicity we must be ignorant at once of the heart of man and of history to preserve the slightest doubt on this point i add that those who like I have have in they hand the document of we colonial slavery have become terribly suspicious and be likely to look with a skeptical eye on these arcadian description the worth of which they can appreciate once more i do not contest the humanity of many master but i remember that there be humane master too in martinique guadeloupe and bourbon yet this do not prevent the discovery on a rigid scrutiny sometimes of excess as fearful as inevitable of the discretionary power at other of a systematic depravation and this to such a point that in one of we colony the custom of regular union have become absolutely unknown to the slave i can not help believe that man be the same everywhere never in any time or in any latitude have it be give he to possess he fellow without fearful misfortune have result to both have we not hear celebrate the delightful mildness of spanish slavery in cuba traveller entertain by the creole usually return enchant with it yet notwithstanding it be find that on quit the city and penetrate into the plantation the most barbarous system of labor be discover that exist in the entire world cuba devour she black population so rapidly that she be unceasingly oblige to purchase negro from abroad and these be once on the island have not before they a average life exceed ten year in the united state the planter of the extreme south be also oblige to renew they supply of negro but as they have recourse to the domestic instead of the african trade and as the domestic trade furnish slave at a excessively high price it follow that motive of interest oppose the adoption of the destructive system of cuba other higher motive also oppose it i be certain and i be far from compare the system of louisiana or the carolina to that which prevail in the spanish island we exaggerate nothing however and whatever may be the point of difference we may hold it as certain that those of resemblance be still more numerous : the tree be the same it can not but bear the same fruit it must be affirm besides that slavery be peculiarly odious on that soil where the equality of mankind have be inscribe with so much eclat at the head of a celebrated constitution liberty impose obligation there be at the bottom of the human conscience something which will always cause slavery to be more scandalous at washington than at havana what happen in the united state will be denounce more violently more loudly than what happen in brazil and this be right this say i pause : i have not the slightest wish to introduce here a perfectly superfluous discussion on the principle and the consequence of slavery i know all with which american reproach we european it be we frenchmen englishman spaniard hollander who impose on they this institution which we take delight in combate -- this inheritance which we anathematize before attack slavery we would do well to turn we attention to we own crime -- to the oppression of the weak in we manufactory for instance but these retaliatory argument have the fault of prove nothing at all we will leave they we have say enough on the nature of american slavery let we proceed to the special subject of we work chapter ii where the united state be drift before the election of mr lincoln i have speak of the great peril which the unite state encounter before the election of mr lincoln the time have come to enter into some detail in justification of this proposition which must have appear strange at first sight but the term of which i have weigh well : if the slavery party have again achieve a victory the united state would have go to ruin here be the fact : formerly there be but one opinion among american on the subject of slavery the southerner may have consider it as a necessary evil in any case they consider it as a evil carolina herself nobly resist its introduction upon she soil other colony do the same washington inscribe the wish in he will that so baleful a institution might be promptly suppress to pen up slavery to prevent its extension to reduce it to the _ rôle _ of a local and temporary fact which it be determine to restrain still more -- such be the sentiment which prevail in the south as in the north and in fact slavery be ere long abolish in the majority of the state compose the union to-day slavery have become a beneficent evangelical institution the corner-stone of republic the foundation of all liberty it have become a source of blessing for the black as for the whites we not only be not to think of reduce the number of slave state but it become important to increase they unceasingly : to interdict to slavery the entrance into a new territory be almost iniquitous such be the theory proclaim by the governor by the legislator of the cotton state they propose they openly without scruple and without circumlocution under the name of political -- what do i say of moral and christian axiom for these theory they take fire they become excite they feel that enthusiasm which be inspire in other time by the love of liberty see entire population who under the eye of god and invoke he support devote themselves body soul and goods to the _ holy _ cause of slavery its conquest its indefinite extension its inter-state and african trade and the conquest of slavery do not figure only in platform they be pursue and accomplish effectively on the soil of america in the face of the nineteenth century free texa have be transform into a slave state to create other slave country be the aim propose and slave country multiply and the south do not tolerate the slightest obstacle to conquest of this kind and it go forward and nothing stop it -- i be wrong the election of mr lincoln have stop it and this be why its fury break out to-day one would he furious for less cause every thing have go so well till then the south speak as a master and the north humbly bow its head before its imperious command its exaction increase from day to day and it be not difficult to see to what abyss it be lead the entire american union shall we give we reader a idea of this crescendo of pretension we will content ourselves with go back to the last mexican war and to the wilmot proviso this be as be know a measure or _ proviso _ stipulate that slavery could not be introduce into conquered province such be the start point it be seek then in 1847 to prevent the territorial extension of slavery this seem to I reasonable enough and i be not astonish that the lincoln platform tend simply to return to this primitive policy the measure pass the house of representative but be defeat in the senate notwithstanding the american people hold firm to the principle that slavery shall henceforth no longer be extend it elect in 1848 the upright administration of gen taylor the cause of justice seem about to triumph when the death of the whig president succeed by the feeble mr fillmore come to restore good fortune to the southerner the _ proviso _ be forget and the nation weary of resistance end by adopt a series of deplorable compromise begin from this moment the progress of the evil be rapid among the compromise the oldest and most respected date back to 1820 be that which bear the name of the _ missourus compromise _ on admit missourus as a slave state it have be stipulate that slavery should be no longer introduce north of the 36th degree of latitude of this limit so long accept the south now complain it be no longer willing that the development of its peculiar institution shall be obstruct in any thing other combat another victory a bill propose by mr dougla annul the missourus compromise and base on the principle of local sovereignty withdraw from congress the right to interfere in the question of slavery the wilmot proviso could not subsist in the presence of these absolute pretension the liberty of slavery -lrb- pardon I this mournful and involuntary conjunction -rrb- find a application on the spot at this juncture texa a province detach from mexico be admit in the quality of a slave state what happen then the partisan of slavery hamper by nothing any longer either by limit at the north or limit at the south or proviso or compromise encounter to they great horror a obstacle of quite a different nature the local sovereignty which they have invoke turn against they in the territory of kansas the majority vote the exclusion of slavery at once the southerner change theory against local sovereignty they invoke the central power they demand they exact that the decision of the majority in kansas shall be trodden under foot they put forward the natural right of slavery why shall they be prevent from settle in a territory with the slave they property when this territory shall be by and by transform into a state there will doubtless be a right to determine the question but to abolish slavery be quite a different thing from exclude it if the south do not win the cause this time it be not the fault of the government of the united state but of the inhabitant of kansa as for mr buchanan he show himself what he have constantly be the most humble servant of the slavery party they come together into collision with _ squatter sovereignty : _ they find for the first time in they path that solid resistance of the west which be manifest in the last election and which i firmly hope be about to save america but in the mean time they have take a new step forward -- a formidable step and one which introduce they into the very bosom of the free state : they have obtain a decision from the supreme court -- the dred scott decree in the preamble of this too celebrated decision the highest judicial power of the confederation do not fear to proclaim two principle : first that there be no difference between a slave and any other kind of property secondly that all american citizen may settle everywhere with they property what a menace for the free-soiler how easy to see to what length the south would shortly go since slavery constitute property like any other it be necessary to prohibit the majority from proscribe it in state as well as in territory who know whether we should not some day see slave and even slave-markets -lrb- the right of property carry with it that of sale -rrb- in the street even of philadelphium or boston let no one cry out against this : those who demand and those who frame the dred scott decision know probably what they wish to do with the right of property understand in this wise no state have the power either to vote the real abolition of slavery or to forbid the introduction of slave or to refuse they extradition and effectively horrible law order fugitive slave to be give up be accord to the violent demand of the south liberty by contact with the soil that great maxim of we europe be interdict america the very state that most detest slavery be condemn to assist indignant and shudder in the federal invasion of a sheriff enter they home to lay hand on a poor negro who have believe in they hospitality and who be about to be deliver up to the whip of the planter it be ask much of the patience of the north yet notwithstanding this patience be not yet at a end the administration be give up a prey to the will of the southerner on they prohibition the mail cease to carry book journal letter which excite they suspicion they have seize upon the policy of the union and they rule it accord to they liking no one have forget those enterprise favor underhand then disavow after failure those filibuster expedition in central america and in the island of cuba they be the policy of the south execute by mr buchanan with he accustomed docility the point in question be to make conquest and conquest for slavery by any means and at any price the south be to procure new state cuba would furnish some several would be carve out of mexico and central america for otherwise the slavery majority would be compromise in congress and slavery would be force to renounce forever the election of the president of free america to avoid such a misfortune there be nothing that they would not have be ready to undertake thus step after step and exaction after exaction overthrow one after the other all barrier the wilmot proviso the missourus compromise the right of majority in the territory the very sovereignty of the state annul by the dred scott decision the south have succeed in draw the united state into those violent and dishonest political practice which fill the administration of mr buchanan the barrier of public probity and the right of man yield in turn the administration dare write officially that cuba be necessary to the united state and that the affranchisement of slave in cuba would be a legitimate cause of war the united state be yoke to the car of slavery : to make slave state to conquer territory for slavery to prevent the terrible misfortune of a abolition of slavery such be the program in negotiation in election nothing else be perceive than this if the liberty of the sea and the independence of the flag be proudly claim it be by the order of the south and there result thence whether desire or not a progressive resurrection of the african slave-trade if candidate in favor of the maintenance of the union be recommend it be to assure the conquest of slavery within and without the invasion of neighbor country the extradition of fugitive slave the subjugation of majority rebellious to the south the suppression of law disagreeable to the south the overthrow of the last obstacle which fetter the progress of the south and it be thus far to this degree of disorder and abasement that a noble people have be drag downward in the course of year sink constantly deeper abandon one by one its guarantee lose its title to the esteem of other nation approach the abyss see the hour draw nigh in which to rise would be impossible bring down malediction upon itself force those who love it to reflect on the word of one of its most illustrious leader : i tremble for my country when i remember that god be just all this under the tyrannical and pitiless influence of a minority constantly transform into a majority picture to yourself a man on a vessel standing by the gun-room with a light match in he hand he be alone but the rest obey he for at the first disobedience he will blow up himself with all the crew this be precisely what have be go on in america since she go adrift the working of the ship be command by the man who hold the match at the first disobedience we will quit you such have always be the language of the southern state they be know to be capable of keep they word therefore there cease to be but one argument in america : secession revoke the compromise or else secession modify the legislation of the free state or else secession risk adventure and undertake conquest with we for slavery or else secession lastly and above all never suffer yourselve to elect a president who be not we candidate or else secession thus speak the south and the north submit let we not be unduly surprise at it there be patriotism in this weakness many citizen inimical to slavery forbore to combat its progress in order to avoid what appear to they a greater evil declivity like these be descend quickly and the deplorable presidency of mr buchanan stand to testify to this the policy of the united state have become doubtful they good renown be dwindle away even with they warmest friend they cause be become blended more and more with that of servitude they liberty be compromise and the federal institution be bend before the institution of the south no more rights of the majority before the institution no more sovereignty of the state before the institution the ultra policy of mr buchanan have covet cuba essay violence in kansas give up the government of america in fine to a cabinet of such a stamp that a majority be nearly find in it ready to disavow major anderson and to order the evacuation of fort of the confederation menace by carolinian force during this time a incredible fact have come to light it be one of the glory of america to have abolish the african slave trade before any other nation and even to have put it on the same footing with the crime of piracy the south have openly demand the re-establishment of a commerce which alone could furnish it at some day with the number of negro proportion to its vast design what have mr buchanan do he doubtless have not consent officially to a enormity which congress on its part would not have tolerate but repression have become so lax under he administration that the number of slave ship fit out in the port of the united state have at length become very considerable the port of new york alone which participate but too much in the misdeed and tendency of the south fit out eighty-five slaver between the month of February 1859 and July 1860 these slaver proudly bear the united state ' flag over the sea and defy the english cruiser as for the american cruiser mr buchanan have take care to remove they all from cuba where every one know that the living cargo be land the slave trade be therefore in the height of prosperity whatever the last presidential message may say of it and as to the application of the law concern piracy i do not see that they have have many victim we can now measure the peril which menace the united state it be not such or such a measure in particular but a collection of measure all direct towards the same end and tend mutually to complete each other : conquest the domestic and the foreign slave trade the overthrow of the few barrier oppose to the extension of slavery the debasement of institution the definitive enthroning of a adventurous policy a policy without principle and without scruple to this the country be advance with rapid stride do they who raise they hand and eye to heaven because the election of mr lincoln have cause the break forth of a inevitable crisis fancy then that the crisis would have be less serious if it have break forth four year later when the evil would have be without remedy already the five hundred thousand slave of the last century have give place to four million be it advisable to wait until there be twenty million and until vast territory absorb by american power have be people by black tear from africa be it advisable to await the time when the south should have become decidedly the most important part of the confederation and when the north force to secede should have leave to other the name the prestige the flag of the united state do they fancy that by chance with the supremacy of the south with its conquest with the monstrous development of its slavery secession would have be avoid no it would have appear some day as a necessary fact only it would have be accomplish under different auspices and in different condition such a secession would have be death a shameful death and slavery itself who imagine then that it can be immortal it be in vain to extend it it will perish amidst its conquest and through its conquest : one can predict this without be a prophet but between the suppression of slavery such as we hope will some time take place and that which we should have be force to fear in case the south have carry it still further be the distance which separate a hard crisis from a terrible catastrophe the south know not what nameless misfortune it have perhaps just escape if it have be so unfortunate as to conquer if it have be so unfortunate as to carry out its plan to create slave state to recruit with negro from africa it would have certainly pave the way with its own hand for one of those bloody disaster before which the imagination recoil : it would have shut itself out from all chance of salvation it be not possible in truth to put a end to certain crime and wholly avoid they chastisement there will always be some suffering in deliver the american confederation from slavery and it depend to-day again upon the south to aggravate in a fearful measure the pain of the transition however what would not have be possible with the election of mr dougla or mr breckenridge have become possible now with the election of mr lincoln we be at liberty to hope henceforth for the rising of a great people chapter iii what the election of mr lincoln signify i think that i have justify the fundamental idea of this work and the title which i have give it if the slavery policy have achieve a new triumph if the north have not elect its president the first that have belong to it in full since the existence of the confederation if supremacy have not range itself in fine on the side with force and justice this unstable balance would have have its hour of downfall : and what a downfall of so much true liberty of so much progress of so many noble example what would have be leave stand the secession of the south be not the secession of the north affranchisement with four million of slave be not affranchisement with twenty million the crisis of 1861 be not that of 1865 or of 1869 the united state i repeat with a profound and study conviction -- the united state have just be save there be those who ask gravely whether the elector of mr lincoln have a plan all ready to effect the abolition of slavery we answer that this be not in question among the influential and earnest man of the victorious party not one could be cite who would think of propose any plan whatever of emancipation one thing alone be propose : to check the conquest of slavery that it shall not be extend that it shall be confine within its present limit be all that be seek to-day the policy of the founder of the confederation have become that of they successor in turn and to this policy what can be object be not the sovereignty of the state respect do they not remain free to regulate what concern they do they not preserve the right of postpone so long as they deem proper the solution of a dreaded problem could not this solution be think over and prepare by those who best know its element the matter be indeed more complicated and difficult than be generally imagine should we be imprudent enough to meddle with it we might rightfully be blame here summary proceedings be evidently not admissible time and the spirit of christianity must do they work by degree they will do it be sure provide the evil be circumscribe provide the seat of the conflagration be hem in and prevent henceforth from spread further now such be the great result acquire by the election of mr lincoln it be nothing more than this but it be all this : it be prudence in the present and it be also the certainty of success in the future emancipation be by no means decree it will not be for a long time perhaps : yet the principle of emancipation be establish irrevocably establish in the sight of all irrevocability have prodigious power over we mind : without be conscious of it we make way for it we arrange in view of it we conduct we plan and even we doctrine once fully convince that its propagandism be check that the future of which it dream have no longer any chance of success the south itself will become accustomed to consider its destiny under a wholly new aspect the border state in which emancipation be easy will range themselves one after another on the side of liberty thus the extent of the evil will become reduce of itself and instead of advance as during some year past towards a colossal development of servitude it will proceed in the direction of its gradual attenuation i reason on the hypothesis of a final maintenance of the union whatever may be the incident of temporary secession i be not ignorant that there be other hypothesis which may possibly be realize and which i shall examine in the course of this treatise but whatever may happen i have a full right to call to mind the true scope of the vote which have just be take it do not involve the slightest idea of present emancipation it contents itself with check the progress of slavery and to check its progress be doubtless to diminish the peril of its future abolition it be important to present this observation for nothing pervert we judgment of the american crisis more than the inexact definition which be give of abolitionism we willingly picture abolitionist to ourselves as madman seek to attain they end on the spot regardless of all else through blood and ruin that there may be such be possible be even inevitable but the man who exercise any political influence over the north have not for a moment adopt such theory this be so true that the other day at boston the people themselves -lrb- the people who nominate mr lincoln -rrb- disperse a meeting intend to discuss plan of immediate emancipation what if abolitionism moreover be a party what if it make use of the means employ by party what if it have its journal its publicist its orator what if it seek ally what if it be base on interest which may be give it by the majority what if it appeal to the passion of the north as the slavery party appeal to those of the south i do not see in truth why this should astonish we i be far from believe that all the act of abolitionism be worthy of approbation i say only that it would be puerile to repudiate a great party for the sole reason that it have the bearing of a party the duty of citizen in a free country be to choose between party and to unite with that whose cause be just and holy let they protest against wrong measure let they refuse to participate in they -- nothing can be better but to withdraw into a sort of political thebai because the noblest party have stain on they banner be in truth to turn they back on the civil obligation of real life the abolition party be a noble one several of its champion have give they life to propagate they faith but lately indeed the texan journal take pain to tell we that a number of they have just be hang in that state and without even speak of these noble victim whose death complete the dishonor of the southern cause be there any bolder deed in the history of mankind than those of the citizen of new england who to wrest kansa from slavery go thither to build they cabin thus brave a fearful struggle not only with the slaveholder but with the president he illegal measure and the troops charge with maintain they we must fight to conquer this seem little understand by those who reproach abolitionism with have be a party militant to hear they the true way of bring about the abolition of slavery be to let it alone : to attack be to exasperate it this argument be so unfortunate as to be employ in all bad cause i remember that when measure be take against the slave trade we be tell that the suffering of the slave would be thus increase and that the slaver would be _ exasperated _ later when we hold up to the indignation of the whole world the protestant intolerance of sweden we be assure that these public denunciation would put back the question instead of accelerate it we persevere and we do rightly sweden be advance though at too slow a pace towards religious liberty it would be difficult to cite any social iniquity that have reform of themselves and since the existence of the world the method which consist in attack evil have be the one sanction by success in america itself the progress make by the border state do not seem to confirm what be tell we of the reaction cause by the aggression of abolitionism in virginium in kentucky in missourus in delaware etc the liberty party have be continually gain ground and the vote receive in the slave state by mr lincoln prove it a very great mistake to suppose let alone to be the condition of progress would to god that slavery have not be let alone when the republic of the united state be found then abolition be easy the slave be few in number and no really formidable antagonism be in play unhappily false prudence make itself hear : it be resolve to keep silence and not to deprive the south of the honor of a voluntary emancipation -- in fine to reserve the question for the future the future have bent under the weight of a task which have continue to increase with year thanks to let it alone a little more let alone and the weight would have crush america it be time to act the abolition party or rather the party oppose to the extension of slavery have act with a resolution which should excite we sympathy the future of the united state be at stake it know it and it struggle in consequence remember the effort essay four year ago for the election of mr fremont effort which would have succeed perhaps if mr fremont have not be a catholic remember those three month of balloting by which the north succeed in carry the election of speaker of the house of representative remember the conduct of the north in the sad affair of john brown its refusal to approve a illegal act its admiration of the heroic farmer who die after have witness the death of he son on see the public mourning of the free state on hear the minute gun discharge in the capital of the state of new york on the day of execution one might have foresee the irresistible impulse which have just end in the triumph of mr lincoln the indignation against slavery the love of country and of its compromise honor the just susceptibility of the north the liberal instinct so long repress the desire of elevate the debased and corrupt institution of the land the need of escape insane project the powerful impulse of the christian faith all these sentiment contribute without doubt to swell the resistance against which the supremacy of the south have just be break this then be a legal victory one of the most glorious spectacles that the friend of liberty can contemplate on earth it be the more glorious the more effort and sacrifice it demand the lincoln party have oppose to it the puseyistic and financial aristocracy of new york the maneuver of president buchanan be unite against it with those of the southern state many of the northern journal accuse it of tread under foot the interest of the seaport and of compromise the sacred cause of the union to succeed in elect mr lincoln we must not forget that it be necessary to put the question of principle above the question of immediate interest which usually make themselves hear so distinctly the unity the greatness of the country the gigantic future towards which it be advance be so many obstacle arise in the way then come the reckoning of profit and loss the inevitable crisis the southern order already withdraw the certain loss of money it seem to I that man who have brave such chance have nobly accomplish they duty america it be say be the country of the dollar the american think only of make money all other consideration be subordinate to this if the reproach be sometimes well-founded we must admit at least that it be not always so those who wish to persuade we that the abolitionist in this again have simply seek they own interest by seek to break down the competition of servile labor forget two or three thing : first that the slave produce tobacco or cotton while the north produce wheat so that there be not a race in the world that compete less with it : next that the cotton of the south be very useful to the north useful to its manufacture useful to its trade both transit and commission the people of the north be not repute to lack foresight they be not ignorant that in elect mr lincoln they have for the time at least every thing to lose and nothing to gain they be not ignorant that mr lincoln occasion the immediate threat of secession that the threat of secession be a commercial crisis be the political weakening of the country and the unsettling of many fortune but neither be they ignorant that above the fleeting interest of individual and of the nation arise those permanent interest which must rest only on justice they decide cost what it might to wrest themselves from the detestable and ere long fatal allurement of the slavery policy let we beware how we calumniate without intend it the few generous impulse which break out here and there among mankind i know that there be a would-be prudent skepticism which attack all moral greatness that it may depreciate it all enthusiasm that it may translate it into calculation to admire nothing be most deplorable and i hasten to add most absurd without wander from the subject of slavery i can cite the great emancipation act wrest from parliament by christian public opinion in england have not mean be find to prove or at least to insinuate that this act the most glorious of we century be at the bottom nothing but a machiavellian combination of interest doubtless those who have take the trouble to look over the debate of the time know what we be to think of this fine explanation they know what resistance be oppose by _ interest _ to the emancipation both in the colony and in the heart of the metropolis they know with how much obstinacy the tory represent the tradition of english politics combate the propose plan they know in what term the certain ruin of the planter the manufacture and the seaport be describe they know by how many petition the church the religious society the woman and even the child succeed in wrest from parliament a measure refuse by so many statesman but the mass of the people do not go back to the beginning they take for grant the summary judgment that english emancipation be a master-piece of perfidy we hear very nearly the same thing say of that glorious movement which have just take place in america we would gladly detect all motive in it except one that be generous and christian as if a vulgar calculation of interest would not have dictate a contrary course and it be precisely this that make the greatness of the resolution adopt by the north it know all the consequence they have be announce by the south recapitulate by prudent man state in detail by the newspaper of great commercial city it choose to be just despite the inevitable mingling of base and selfish impulse which always become complicate in such manifestation the ruling motive in this be a protest of conscience and of the spirit of liberty the account that have come to we from america demonstrate the lofty character of the joy which be manifest after the election man shake hand with each other in the street they congratulate each other on have at last escape from the yoke of a ignoble policy they feel as though relieve from a weight they breathe more freely the true the noble destiny of the united state reappear on the horizon they salute a future that should be better than the present a future worthy of they sire those early pilgrim who carry nothing with they but they bible have lay the foundation of a free country with poor but valiant hand i should like to quote here the sermon in which the rev mr beecher pour out he christian joy at that time he speak of the strength of the weak he show that principle however despise they may be end by reveng themselves on interest he recall the fact that the gospel be a power in america to rise up to attack its enemy manfully to arraign the cause of the national decline to approach boldly the solution of the most formidable problem which could be propound here on earth such be not the act of a nation of calculator something else be imply in it than tactic something else than combination of vote or sectional rivalry to vote as they do they have to overcome almost as many obstacle in the north as in the south for in consequence of the vote the north have to suffer like the south and they know it if you wish to be just to the united state compare they with other country in which slavery exist in the united state there be a struggle the question be a live one man do not turn aside from it with lax indifference i love the noise of free nation i find in the very violence of they debate a proof of the earnestness of conviction man must become excited about great social problem if abuse exist they must at least be point out attack and stigmatize the prescription of silence must never be accord they devoted voice must exclaim against they unceasingly in the name of justice and of humanity such a spectacle do good to the soul it solace the sorrow of the present it carry within itself guarantee for the future the sad profoundly sad spectacle be that of nation where crime make no noise look at brazil like the united state it have slavery but it be a honorable discreet slavery of which nothing be say whatever may happen there no one inquire about it there be no discussion either through the press or in the court no party would dare insert such a question into its platform one thing very properly have be find to disturb it and the public sale of slave have just be forbid look above all at spain and its island of cuba there too be perfect silence nothing in truth oppose the belief that cuba be the abode of felicity and that the atrocity of slavery be the monopoly of the united state but inquisitive people who like to search to the bottom of thing discover that if the master be very gentle at havana the overseer be scarcely so on they account on the plantation i have already give the proof of it out of ten slaver that be seize on the high sea nine be always destine to cuba spain have forbid the slave trade she have even be compensate for it by the english but this do not prevent she from suffer it to be carry on before she eye with almost absolute impunity she high-sounding phrase change nothing the smallest fact be of more value at cuba the landing of slave be continual and the place of disembarkation be know now the american flag protect no one at the time of disembark why be no opposition make to this why have the importation of negro triple in cuba why do no slaver american or any other steer towards brazil since brazil have _ desire _ to put a end to the slave trade the answer to these question will be give we on the day when spain shall _ desire _ in turn to suppress it in the mean time she prefer to keep silence unless when a word from london strike out a concert of protestation more patriotic than convince save in this case the government be silent public opinion be silent no colonial sheet be find ready to hazard a objection nor even a metropolitan journal that be willing to disturb so touch a equanimity the court of madrid in which many question be agitate prudently stand aloof in the matter of slavery and the slave trade among the numerous party dispute for power not one dare venture on a ground where it would meet nothing but unpopularity ah after this death-like silence how the soul be refresh by the fiery contest of the united state the great word-combats carry on in every village of the union the appeal address to the conscience the battle in broad daylight how refreshing to see by the side of these nation who sleep so tranquilly while regard the inroad of slavery a people whom it disquiet whom it irritate who refuse to take part in it and who rather than conform to the evil agitate become divide and rend themselves perchance with they own hand chapter iv what we be to think of the united state we be not just towards the united state they civilization so different from ours wound we in various way and we turn from they in the ill-humor excite by they real defect without take note enough of they eminent quality this country which possess neither church nor state nor army nor governmental protection this country bear yesterday and bear under a puritanic influence this country without past history without monument separate from the middle age by the double interval of century and belief this rude country of farmer and pioneer have nothing fit to please we it have the exuberant life and the eccentricity of youth that be it afford to we mature experience inexhaustible subject of blame and raillery we be so little inclined to admire it that we seek in its territorial configuration for the essential explanation of its success be it so difficult to maintain good order and liberty at home when one have immense desert to people when land offer itself without stint to the labor of man -- i do not see for my part that land be lack at bueno ayre at montevideo in mexico or in any of the pronunciamento republic that cover south america it seem to I that the turk have room before they and that the middle age be not suffer precisely from a excess of population when they present everywhere the spectacle of anarchy and oppression be sure that the united state which have something to learn of we have also something to teach we theirs be a great community which it do not become we to pass by in disdain the more it differ from we own europe the more necessary be impartial attention to comprehend and appreciate it especially be it impossible for we to form a enlighten opinion of the present crisis unless we begin by take into consideration the surroundings in which it have break out the nature of the struggle and its probable issue the difficulty of the present and the chance of the future will be clear to we only on condition of we make a study of the united state a few detail will therefore be permit I among the yankee the fault be on the surface i be not one to justify lynch law whatever may be the necessity which exist in the far west riot in the united state be cite which have perform they work of fire and devastation and which no one have dare treat rigorously afterwards for fear of incur disgrace from the sovereign people but i remember i fancy that similar thing have be see in paris itself we will not therefore lay too great stress on they one thing that be not see in pari be unhappily remark in america : the general tendency among woman to substitute masculine quality which scarcely befit they for the feminine quality which constitute they grace they strength and they dignity thence result a certain something unpleasant and rude which do no credit to the new world i by no means admire coarseness and i do not admit that it be the necessary companion of energy the tone of the journal and of the debate in congress be often calculate to excite a just reprobation there be in the united state a levelling spirit a jealousy of acquire superiority and above all of inherit distinction which proceed from the worst sentiment of the heart what be graver still the tender and gentle side of the human soul such as shine forth in the gospel appear too rarely among this people where the gospel notwithstanding be in honor but where the labor of a gigantic growth have develop the active instead of the loving virtue the american be cold even when good charitable and devout they may love money and often concentrate they thought on the means of make it i will not contest this although i doubt on see what pass among ourselves whether we have the right to cast the stone at they especially as american liberality as i shall presently show be of a nature to put we parsimony to shame as to the bankrupt act of which american creditor have many time complain nothing can justify they yet here again the rôle of pedagogue scarcely become we if more than one american railroad company have take advantage of a crisis to declare without much dishonor a suspension of payment it be not prove that these suspension of payment must be convert into bankruptcy if more than one town or more than one county make the half yearly payment of they debt with reluctance the court always do fair justice on this ill will there be some country russium for instance where the court do not do as much if in fine at one time a number of state fail to keep they engagement and a single one dare proclaim the infamous doctrine of repudiation all have since pay except one state of the extreme south mississippus once more be we sure of be in a position to reprove such misdeed we whose government anterior to '89 make use without much scruple of the fall of stock and bankruptcy we whose debt on emerge from the revolution take the significant name of _ tier consolidé _ let we not forget that the population of the united state have increase tenfold since the close of the last century they have receive immigrant annually by hundred of thousand who have not always be the elite of the old world must not this perpetual invasion of stranger promptly transform into citizen have necessarily introduce into the decision of public affair some element of immorality i admire the honorable and religious spirit of the american which have be able to assimilate and rule to such a degree these great mass of irish and german few country would have endure a like ordeal as well remark that in spite of all public order be maintain without pay troops -lrb- continental europe will find it hard to credit this -rrb- tranquillity reign in the largest city of the united state respect for the law be in every heart great balloting take place million of excited man await the result with tremble yet notwithstanding not a act of violence be commit american riot -- for some there be -- be certainly less numerous than ours and they have the merit of not be transform into revolution the greater part of the immigrant remain of course in the large city here they come almost to make the law and here too noble cause encounter the most opponent mr lincoln to cite a example receive only a minority of suffrage in the city of new york whilst the unanimity of the country suffrage secure he the vote of the state contempt of the color class that crime of the north break out most of all in the large city and particularly among agglomeration of immigrant none be harsher to free negro it must be admit than newly-landed european who have come to seek a fortune in america as to crime they be numerous only in city still the criminal record of the united state appear somewhat full when compare with ours i know how great a part of this must be assign to the insufficiency of repression in america criminal doubtless escape punishment much oftener than among we notwithstanding there be real security and a child might travel over the entire west without be expose to the slightest danger m de tocqueville have say that moral be infinitely more rigid in north america than elsewhere this be not it seem to I a trifling advantage whatever may be the depravity of the seaport where the whole world hold rendezvous it remain certain that it do not penetrate into the interior of the country open the journal and novel of the united state you will not find a corrupt page in they you might leave they all on the drawing-room table without fear to call a blush to the brow of a woman or to sully the imagination of a child in the heart of the manufacturing state model village be find in which every thing be combine to protect the artisan of both sex from the peril that await they in other country who have not hear of the town of lowell where farmer ' daughter go to earn they dowry where the labor of the factory bring no dissipation in its train where the workwoman read write teach sunday-school where they morality detract nothing from they liberty and progress when i have add that the united state have not a single foundling asylum it seem to I that i have indicate what we be to think at once of they good moral and good sense and let not the american he represent as a people at once honest and narrow-minded if they be still far from we level -- and this must necessarily be true in a artistic and literary point of view -- we be not however at liberty to despise a country which count such name as hawthorne longfellow emerson cooper poe washington irve channing prescott motley and bancroft note that among these name man of imagination hold a prominent place which prove we may say in pass that the country where we oftenest hear the exclamation of what use be it agree in find poetry of some use and i speak here neither of orator like mr seward or mr dougla nor of scholar like lieutenant maury nor of those who like fulton or morse have apply science to art : judgment have be pass on all these point but the true superiority of american be in the universality of common instruction the puritan who come hither with they bible be of necessity zealous founder of school the bible and the school go together see therefore what the school be in the united state the state of massachusett alone which do not number a million of soul devote five million yearly to its public instruction if other state be far from equal it in academy and higher institution all be on a level with it as regard primary school a man or woman therefore be rarely find outside the class of immigrant who do not possess a solid knowledge of the elementary science the extent of which would excite we surprise by the side of the primary school and to complete its instruction in the religious point of view the american have everywhere open sunday-school keep gratuitously by volunteer teacher among whom have figure many man of the highest standing several of whom have be president of the confederation these sunday-school not less than twenty thousand in number and superintend by one hundred and fifty thousand teacher count more than a million of pupil of which ten thousand at least be adult calculate the power of such a instrument people read enormously in america there be a library in the meanest cabin of roughly-hewn log construct by the pioneer of the west these poor log-house almost always contain a bible often journal instructive book sometimes even poetry we in europe who fancy ourselves fine amateur of good verse would scarcely imagine that copy of longfellow be scatter among american husbandman the political journal have many subscriber those of the religious papers be no less numerous i know of a monthly journal design for child -lrb- the _ child 's paper _ -rrb- of which three hundred thousand copy be print this be the intellectual aliment of the country in the town lecture be add to book journal and review : in all imaginable subject this community which the government do not charge itself with instruct -lrb- at least beyond the primary education -rrb- educate and develop itself with indefatigable ardor idea be agitate in the smallest market-town life be everywhere accustom to act for themselves know that they can not count on the administrative patronage of the state the american excel in bring individual energy into action there be few functionary few soldier and few tax among they they know nothing like we of that malady of public function the violence of which increase in proportion as we advance they know nothing of those enormous impost under which europe be bend by degree -- those tax which almost suppress property by overburden its transmission they have not come to the point of find it very natural to devote one or two million every year to the expense of the state and no theory have be form to prove to they that of all the expense of the citizen this be apply to the best purpose they have not enter with the old world into that rivalry of armament in which each nation though it become exhaust in the effort be bind to keep on a level with its neighbor and in which no one will be stronger in the end when the whole world shall be subjugate they ten thousand regular suffice and they have they militia for extraordinary occasion lastly they federal debt be insignificant and if the private debt of a few state reach a high figure they be nowhere of a nature to impose on the tax-payer a large surplus of charge all of the great liberty exist in the united state : liberty of the press liberty of speech right of assemblage right of association except in the slave state where the national institution have be subject to deplorable mutilation in fact every citizen can express he opinion and maintain it openly without meet any other obstacle than the contrary opinion which be express with equal freedom but there be one ground above all where we should acknowledge the superiority of america : i mean religious liberty we be still in the beginning of doubt upon the point as to where the interference of the state should cease in what measure it should govern the belief of the citizen and its manifestation these question alas be still propound among we and there be country at we door where man shudder at the mere idea that the law may some day cease to decide for each in what manner he be bind to worship god that the court may cease to punish those whose conscience turn aside from the path of the nation protestant sweden but lately condemn dissenter to fine and imprisonment catholic spain daily inflict the severest penalty on those who suffer themselves to profess or to propagate belief which be not those of the country -- those who sell the scripture and those who read they the united state have not only proclaimed and loyally carry out the glorious principle of religious liberty but have adopt as a corollary another principle much more contest among we but which i believe destine also to make the tout of the world : the principle of separation of church and state that believer should support they own worship that religious and political question should never be blended that the two province should remain distinct be a simple idea which seem most strange to we to-day it will make its way like all other true idea which begin as paradox and end by become axiom meanwhile the american confederation enjoy a advantage which more than one european government i suspect would at some moment purchase at a high price : it have not to trouble itself about religious interest either in its action without or its administration within if there be conflict everywhere in the spiritual order it leave they to struggle and become resolve in the spiritual order without need to trouble itself in the matter hence arise for the state a freedom of bear a simplicity of conduct which we who have to steer adroitly through so many danger can hardly comprehend the american government be sure of never offend any church -- it know none it do not interfere either to combat or to aid they it have renounce once for all intervention in the domain of conscience the result doubtless be that this domain be not so well order as in europe the administrative ecclesiastical state have by no means submit to such regulation be that to say that this inconvenience -lrb- if it be one -rrb- be not largely compensate for by its advantage be it nothing to suppress inheritance in religious matter and to force each soul to question itself as to what it believe in the united state adhesion to a church be a individual spontaneous act result from a voluntary determination this be so true that four-fifth of the inhabitant of the country do not bear the title of church member although attend worship although manifest a interest and zeal in the subject to which we be little accustomed although assiduous church-goer and liberal giver they have not yet feel within themselves a conviction strong and clear enough to make a public profession of faith think what we may of such a system we must avow at least that it imply a profound respect for sacred thing nothing can less resemble that indolent and formal assent which we give in conformity with custom and without bind ourselves in earnest to the religion that prevail among we hence arise something valiant in american conviction hence arise also it may be say that dispersion of sect the picture of which be so often draw for we i be far from love the spirit of sectarianism and i be careful not to present the american church as the beau ideal in religious matter the sectarian spirit the fundamental trait of which be to confound unity with uniformity to transform divergency into separation to refuse to admit into the bosom of the church the element of diversity and of liberty to exact the signing of a theological formulum and the formal adhesion as a whole to a collection of dogma and practice without tolerate the slightest shade of difference -- the sectarian spirit with its narrowness with its tradition of man with its exaggeration of little thing with its separate denomination be certainly not worthy of admiration i reject it in america as elsewhere but i think it well to state that the religious disruption produce by it have be much exaggerate we must greatly abbreviate the formidable list of church furnish we by traveller put aside those which have no value either as to influence or number we reduce the number of denomination exist in the united state outside the roman catholic church to five -lrb- and these be too many -rrb- namely : methodist baptist congregational episcopal and presbyterian the remainder be compose of small eccentric congregation which spring up and die and of which no one take heed except a few tourist who be always willing to note down extraordinary fact we will add that the sectarian spirit be now attack in america and that the essential unity which bind the member of the five denomination together in spite of some external difference be manifest itself forcibly not only do the evangelical alliance prove to the most sceptical that this unity be real but a fact peculiar to the united state the great awakening produce by the crisis of 1857 have give evidence of the perfect harmony of conviction in the innumerable meeting cause to spring up by this awakening from one end of the country to the other it have be impossible to distinguish baptist presbyterian or congregationalist from each other all have be there and no one have betray by the least shade of dogmatism those self-styled profound division about which so much noise be make i invite those still in doubt to look at the manner in which public worship be establish in the west : as soon as a few man have form a settlement a missionary come to visit they no one inquire about he denomination for the bible that he bring be the bible of all and the salvation through christ which he proclaim be the faith of all it suffice besides to see this entire people so restless so laborious leave its business on Sunday to occupy itself with the thought of another life it suffice to observe the unanimous uprising of the public conscience at the rumor of a attack direct against the gospel to perceive that unity subsist beneath lamentable division and that individual conviction create the most active of all cohesive power in the heart of human community i know of no cement that equal it if individual conviction be a strong bond they be also a inexhaustible source of life it be easy to assure ourselves of this by a brief survey of the proof of christian liberality which be display in the united state here there be no legal charity no aid to be expect from the government either for the support of church or for that of the sick and poor the _ voluntary system _ must suffice for all and in fact it do suffice for all what be the first thing in question to collect thirty million franc annually for the payment of the clergy the thirty million be furnish : poor and rich all give eagerly and without compulsion the next thing in question be to provide for the construction of new church now it be necessary to finish not less than three of these daily for the clearing of the forest advance with rapid stride and a thousand church at least be build every year the majority of these church be doubtless compose of beam lay one upon another then paint white or left of the natural color and surmount by a bell they be simple and inexpensive and in the infant village the street of which be still block up by tree leave stand the place serve at once for a church and a school where the people gather round a itinerant preacher be not decorate with much sumptuousness yet these new edifice demand annually from twelve to fifteen million next come the religious society in the west preacher be need hardy laborer who live in privation traverse vast solitude on horseback and journey continually without repose until they strength be exhaust eight hundred missionary or agent be require for the american board of mission for the presbyterian the baptist and all the other church now they can not send they to the four quarter of the globe without provide for they want the bible society which print three hundred thousand bible annually the religious tract society which publish every year five million of tract and which in new york alone employ a thousand visitor or distributor the various work in a word expend from nine to ten million franc such then be the budget of voluntary charity in the united state -lrb- a -rrb- it amount to fifty or sixty million franc without count the very considerable donation destine to public instruction without counting -lrb- and this be immense -rrb- the relief of the sick and the poor you will scarcely find a village in the whole united state that have not its benevolent society and private benevolence which be the best also carry on its work independently of society i know of no country where act of profuse liberality be more frequent one man found a hospital another a observatory asylum be open for all human unfortunate for lunatic the blind the deaf orphan abandon child be i not right in say that this be a great people whatever may be its vice we be not at liberty to speak of it with disdain if the american know how to make a fortune they know also how to make a noble use of they fortune accuse with reason as they be of be too often preoccupy with question of profit we have see they retrench much of they luxury since the commercial crisis yet economize very little in they charity the budget of the church and religious society remain intact at the very time that embarrassment be everywhere prevail i can not help believe that there be peculiar blessing attach to so many voluntary sacrifice which carry back the mind to the early age of christianity we may be sure that the religion that cost something bring something also in return footnote : -lrb- footnote a : it seem that i have understate the truth but i prefer to do so i wish above all to avoid exaggeration -rrb- chapter v the church and slavery this lead I to examine a side of the american question upon which attention be naturally fix at the present time how be it that the iniquity of slavery be maintain among this charitable and liberal people how be it that such iniquity have subsist under the influence of so powerful a christian sentiment can it be true that christian have desert the cause of justice have the gospel have the place which belong to it in the great struggle that be go on between the north and the south yes or no this be perhaps the point of all other most important to clear up first because it be the one on which the most error have accumulate next because it be the one most closely connect with the final solution for this solution will not be happy if the gospel have no hand in it to judge rightly let we approach and endeavor to comprehend the true position of those whose conduct we seek to appreciate see the south for example where the almost universal opinion be favorable to slavery where governor write dithyrambic on its benefit where many christian have succeed in discover that it be sanction by the gospel where man of sincerity be now place they impious crusade in behalf of its extension under the protection of god where numerous preacher expound in they own way the celebrated text curse be canaan do not these sentiment of the south detestable as they be find to a certain point they explanation and excuse in the circumstance in which the south be place the power of surroundings be incalculable if we ourselves who condemn slavery and be right in so do have be rear in charleston if we have lead a planter 's life from we earliest infancy if we have nourish we mind with they idea if we consider we monetary interest menace by abolitionism if the image of more fearful peril of violent destruction and massacre appear to haunt we thought if the political antagonism between the north and the south come to add its venom to the passion already excite within we be it certain that we ourselves should no be figure at the present time among the desperado who be firing upon the ship of the union and attempt the foundation of a southern confederacy it be well to ask this of ourselves in order to learn to respect to love and consequently to aid those whose conduct we blame the most strongly for my part whenever i be tempt to set myself up as a judge or a accuser of the south i ask myself what i should do if i belong to the south and this bring I back to the true position i remember too what i see with my own eye at the time when the discussion on slavery be carry on in france the colonial passion the blindest and most violent of all break out in martinique and the isle of bourbon as they have break out before in jamaica where the circular of mr canning the proposition for example to suppress the flagellation of woman have excite a veritable explosion there be some very honorable man among those who be indignant at this measure and among we likewise the planter who determine to combat all modification of the negro system be good man severity be almost always a defect of memory we blame other without pity only when we begin by forget we own history we frenchmen who have so much difficulty in emancipate we own slave and who would not perhaps have succeed in it have it not be for the bold decision of m schoelcher we who have seek to take back in part through we colonial regulation the liberty accord the black we who suffer recruital by purchase to be make on the african coast who formerly organize the expedition charge with re-establish slavery and the slave trade at st domingo who suppress the slave trade at the congress of vienna only in stipulate its continuance for some year who carry into we discussion on the right of search a very meager interest for the victim of the slaver we whose conscience be burden with these misdeed be bind to use indulgence towards the state of the south this remark be necessary : it be from the south that the biblical theory in favor of slavery proceed it be on account of the south that these theory have be adopt by certain christian of the north desirous above every thing of avoid both the dismemberment of the united state and that of the church and religious society take away the south and no one in america any more than in europe will dream of discover in the gospel the divine approbation of the atrocity of slavery i comprehend better than most the sentiment of indignation that be cause by these deplorable teaching in which slavery be sometimes excuse sometimes exalt i comprehend that under the impulse of a sentiment so justifiable one may be lead on to anathematize preacher and church in a mass that he may even come to the point of represent to himself the christian faith as the true obstacle to the progress of liberty this be a great perversion of the truth but we can easily understand how it have succeed in gain the assent of generous and sincere mind i myself have read a sermon which be listen to with sympathy in a certain presbyterian church in new york in which slavery declare right until the return of jesus christ cease to be so i know not why during the millennium i know the nature of that theology too truly style _ cottony _ which be display in the clerical column of the _ new york observer _ notwithstanding i hasten to say that these revolting excess seldom appear except in seaport and especially in new york the interest of this great city be bind up to such a degree with those of the cotton state that until very lately new york might have be consider as a prolongation of the south we need not be surprised therefore to find some congregation there which be rule by the prejudice of the south besides even in new york other church protest with holy zeal and other journal among which i will cite the _ independent _ the organ of the congregationalist combat slavery unceasingly in the name of the gospel then people persist in see only new york in take notice only of what pass in new york but they forget that new york be ordinarily a exception in the north as much by its commercial position as by its opinion and vote let we go ever so short a distance from the city into the surrounding country and we will encounter a different spirit -- a spirit thoroughly impregnate with christian faith and little disposed to covenant with slavery there we begin to see that race of puritan farmer but lately represent by john brown have not the attempt be make to transform he also into a free thinker a philosophic enemy of the bible and from this very cause a enemy to slavery we need nothing more than he last letter to he wife to show from what source he have draw that courage so misdirected but so indomitable which he display at harper 's ferry the christian the biblical and orthodox christian come to explain the liberal and the hero that christian in general condemn the enterprise of john brown while sympathize with he i hasten to acknowledge and i be far from blame they that many have commit the real wrong of recoil before the consequence of a open and decide conduct i be force to admit yes without even mention the south where as every one know the reign of terror prevail there be numerous protestant and catholic church in the remainder of the confederation which have refuse to declare themselves as they should have do in opposition to the crime of slavery let we not hasten however to cry out against falsehood and hypocrisy most honorable and sincere man have believe that they would do more harm than good by bring on a rupture with the south let we not forget that political rupture be complicate here with religious rupture now all the church extend over both north and south all the charitable society number committee and subscriber in both north and south the point in question then -lrb- let we weigh the immensity of the sacrifice -rrb- the point in question be to rend in twain all the church to break in piece all the society to expose to perilous risk all the great work that do honor to the united state doubtless to have go they way to have do they duty and not to have trouble themselves about the consequence be the great rule of action i grant it yet notwithstanding i refuse to stigmatize as many have do those man who have commit the fault of hesitate i feel that to rank they among the champion of slavery be to pervert fact and to fall into a blamable exaggeration again to-day after the election of mr lincoln can not citizen be cite in the north who be devote to the cause of the negro but who refuse to participate in abolitionist demonstration because they fear -lrb- and the sentiment do they honor -rrb- to encourage the impending insurrection this say i wish to prove by some too well-known fact what have be this forbearance or even this pretend hesitation of orthodox christianity on regard the church i see two and the most considerable which have openly declare themselves : the congregationalist and the methodist about six month since the general conference of methodist resolutely plunge into the current without suffer itself to be trammel by the protest which come to it from the south i read in a report present to one of the great division of this church : we believe that to sell or to hold in bondage human being under the name of chattel be in contradiction to the divine law and to humanity and that it conflict with the golden rule and with the rule of we discipline last year a numerous assemblage of delegate of the congregational church adopt the following resolution : slaveholding be immoral and slaveholder should not be admit as member of christian church we ought to protest against it without cease in the name of the gospel until it shall have entirely disappear and this resolution have not remain a dead letter : a congregational church of ohio have expel from its bosom one of its deacon who have contribute in the capacity of magistrate to the extradition of a fugitive slave other church without take so decide a position have at least manifest by they internal convulsion the profound interest excite among they by the question of slavery in this manner a secession have just rent the presbyterian church in twain because the declare adversary of slavery be unwilling to remain responsible for a forbearance which appear to they criminal these thing be sign of life and these sign be begin to show themselves even in the midst of ecclesiastical body which have act until now in the most unchristian manner a warm discussion have be thus call forth and this signify a great deal among the member of the episcopal church in new york the majority stifle the debate will it be able to do this always if from the church we proceed to the religious society we find the same symptom among they here they declare themselves openly against slavery in spite of the menace of the south there they succeed in stave off the question yet at the price of excited debate which continually spring up again of a great scandal and of protest which be hear by christian through the whole world the course of conduct adopt by the great american board of mission be the more significant inasmuch as its committee be compose of member belong to various evangelical denomination it stand therefore as they permanent representative yet this have not prevent its adoption after long hesitation of resolution indicate in what course it will henceforth proceed : it have break off its relation with the missionary employ among the choctaw for the sole reason that they obstinately refuse openly to attack indian slavery and the abominable practice which it engender the society which long too long contented itself with a timid and inconsistent censure have be oblige therefore to resort to more decisive measure another great body the tract society unfortunately have not follow this example the general assembly hold at new york and rule by the spirit of that city have give a majority to the party oppose to the discussion of the subject but be it say to the honor of american christian the very large minority resist to the end the latter be sustain by outside opinion and many friend of the gospel join with it in deplore the pusillanimity which yield to the menace of the south a crisis thence arise which have not yet reach its height and the first fruit of which have be the foundation of a rival society in boston to which adherent be gather from all side these be grave event for they manifest the inmost revolution of the human soul would you know what will take place in political society begin by inform yourself about what be take place in the conscience of the public now it be evident that the public conscience be in motion in the united state the vast obstacle by which this movement be trammel have be surmount on every side i wish no other proof of this than the deplorable fact of which i have just make mention : the conduct of the tract society the internal crisis which it have experience the reprobation which it encounter in europe as in america be not these palpable proof of the too little known truth that the great moral force which be struggle with american slavery be the gospel and how could it be otherwise if we have not positive fact before we eye if we do not know that one entire sect of christian the quaker have devote themselves body and goods to the service of poor fugitive slave if we do not recognize the deep puritan imprint in the movement which have colonize kansa and in that which have bear mr lincoln to the presidency should we not be force to ask ourselves whether it be possible that the gospel remain a stranger to a struggle undertake for liberty there exist thank god between liberty and the gospel close eternal and indestructible relation i know of one species of freedom which contain the germ of all the rest -- freedom of soul now what be it if not the gospel that introduce this freedom into the world remember ancient paganism : neither liberty of conscience nor liberty of individual nor liberty of family -- such be its definition the state lay its hand upon all the inmost part of existence the creed of the father and the education of the child moral slavery also exist everywhere and if slavery properly call have be anywhere want it would have give cause for astonishment the gospel come and with it these new phenomenon : individual belief true independence make its advent here on earth a liberty worthy of the name appear finally among man from this time we see man lift up they head despotism find its limit the humblest the weakest oppose to it insurmountable barrier they act without reflection who attempt to place in opposition these two thing : the gospel and liberty and remark that in the united state in particular the gospel and liberty be accustom to go together they first land together at new plymouth with the passenger of the mayflower why have these poor pilgrim tear themselves from all the habit of home and country to seek in the dead of winter a asylum on a unknown soil because they love the gospel and because they desire liberty the chief of liberty -- that of the conscience from the 21st of December 1620 there exist on the shore of the new world the beginning of a free people -- free through the powerful influence of the gospel all who have study the united state with sincerity will ratify the opinion of m de tocqueville : america be the place of all other where the christian religion have preserve the most power over soul this power be such that we find it at the base of all lasting reform in this country in which the idea of authority have little force there be one authority that of the bible before which the majority bow and which be of the more importance inasmuch as it alone command respect and obedience if you doubt the decisive part which the gospel fill in american debate look at the pain take by party to render public homage to it the democrat as the republican mr buchanan as mr lincoln then look more closely at the republican party do you not find in it again the visible trace of puritanism it be the ancient state it be old america it be also the young america of the farmer of the pioneer of the western solitude the america of the clearer of the forest the america of the bible and the school this america long since abolish slavery and prevent its introduction into the territory that acknowledge its influence in the meanest of its cabin you will find the scripture hymn book report of religious society in the majority of its family domestic worship be celebrate in its prayer-meeting it be not rare to see physician lawyer magistrate marine officer take part publicly its statesman do not think themselves dishonor by keep a sunday-school the gospel in a word be a power to which no other can compare and outside of which it would be puerile to expect to succeed in accomplish any thing of importance here the action of the gospel can be plainly detect a important religious event precede and pave the way for the political event which we have witness : before the election of mr lincoln a awakening take place the american awakening which must not be confound with those _ revival _ the description and sometimes the caricature of which have be transmit we by traveller the awakening which have neither ecstasy nor convulsive sob and the distinctive feature of which be a tone of simplicity and conviction produce one of those profound agitation of the conscience which give rise to generous resolution the financial crisis have just overthrow the fortune of the people they turn towards god and begin to pray on a route of three thousand mile wherever one might stop he find a meeting a simple spontaneous meeting at which the pastor do not take the initiative where they be present instead of preside ere long public attention become fix on this movement the greatness of which could not be contest the most hostile journal end by render it homage and it last it still subsist it have produce something else than meeting and prayer it have induce extensive moral reform it have close place of debauchery and tavern by hundred the military and commercial marine of the united state have be especially subject to its influence captain officer and sailor in great number have show by they life that they habit of piety be more than a vain form american vessel be perhaps the only one at the present day in which group of sailor assemble to converse on the interest of they soul and to make the praise of god resound over the ocean in strengthen the religious element in exciting the puritan fiber of america the awaken certainly contribute a great share to the success of the party oppose to slavery south carolina acknowledge this herself lately when she insert the follow phrase in she declaration of independence : the public opinion of the north have give to a great political error the sanction of a still more erroneous religious sentiment be this religious sentiment assail by the slaveholder that of free thinker or of christian the south be not mistaken it know that the truly difficult act of emancipation be accomplish on earth only by the power of the gospel it see the great abolition impulse rise in england and spread over the united state journal committee correspondence all indicate that the english have become the american movement and be continue under the same banner under this banner and this alone it have conquer a colossal work in fact be here in question before which all purely human force fall to the ground if such prodigious christian effort be need to give the victory to wilberforce what will be require in the heart of a country where slavery be not exile to distant colony and where it have acquire formidable proportion with year there be easy abolition which be work in some sort of themselves and which seem the natural corollary of a political revolution as for instance that which occur forty year ago in the spanish republic bolivar quiroga and the other leader need the support of all class of the population in they struggle against spain they adopt the expedient of suppress slavery in take this resolution they accomplish a most honorable deed but they make little change in the condition of the country for large plant be rare and both the black and the whites be few in number less numerous indeed than the indian and the half breed if political reason then suffice it be evident that they be far from suffice to-day : we must seek elsewhere for the explanation of the movement which a long time wavering and suppress have just manifest its irresistible power in the united state we have recognize in it the hand of the gospel and this be no indifferent matter for if the gospel have no part in it such a movement would end in destruction the responsibility of christian will be great in america they can do much for the favorable solution of a problem which menace the future of they country and overshadow that of humanity the mode of pacification here be to declare themselves the pretension of the south its fatal progress the extreme peril to which but lately it expose the confederation be due much more than be imagine to the deplorable hesitation of the religious society and the church if it have long since be bring face to face with a determine evangelical doctrine the south which know also though in a less degree the influence of the gospel would have avoid fall into the excess to which it be now abandon the fault of the past be irreparable but it be possible to ward off they return let all northern church let all society let all eminent christian take henceforth with firmness the position which they ought to have take from the first let they present to they southern brethren a solid rally point and the effect of this faithful conduct will not be slow in make themselves feel there be in the slave state especially in those occupy a intermediate position more disturbance of thought and more conflict of feeling than we generally suppose let the banner of the christian faith be openly display and many good man will rally round it : this be certain and let no one put forward the shameful pretext : there be sceptic rationalist free thinker in the rank of abolitionism why not question of this sort thanks to the gospel have enter in the domain of common morality shall i desert these question in order to avoid contact with man who reject the essential doctrine of christianity i confess that the orthodoxy which should draw such conclusion would appear suspicious to I voltaire plead for the cala will not make I turn my back on religious liberty chan write page against slavery reveal a heart more christian than he doctrine parker blend he noble effort in favor of the negro with he assault against the bible will not alienate I from a cause which be mine before it be theirs i say besides that the objection of these man against christianity force I to ask whether we conduct as christian be not one of the principal cause of they scepticism be it quite certain that voltaire himself would have be the adversary that we know he if he have not see that thought be stifle that liberty be crush that conscience be violate in the name of the gospel would not this same gospel have present itself under a different aspect to parker channing and the other unitarian of boston if they have see it at its post the post of honor at the head of all generous idea and true liberty yes there be abolitionist who reject the bible because they have hear certain orthodox christian maintain that the bible be in favor of slavery whoever preach this be of a school of impiety chapter vi the gospel and slavery how do they set to work to preach this i will answer this question by two other : how do bossuet set to work to write he _ politique tirée de l'ecriture _ to proclaim in the name of the bible obligatory monarchy divine right the absolute authority of king the duty of destroy false religion by force the duty of officially sustain the truth the duty of have a budget of mode of worship the duty of unite church and state without speaking of he biblical apology for war for the use of loui xiv how do certain doctor among the roundhead in they turn set to work to proclaim the divine right of republic and to ordain the massacre of the new amalekite the method be very simple : it consist only in confound the law with the gospel this confusion once work the political and civil institution of the old testament lose they temporary and local character and we go to the new testament in search of what be not there : namely political and civil institution though the gospel be not the law it be a truth which have be make its way since the seventeenth century and which seem to be no longer contest to-day except in the camp of the champion of slavery the gospel which address itself to all nation and all age do not pretend to force they into the strait vestment of the ancient jewish nation no more do it pretend to sew a piece of new cloth on a old garment else the new cloth taketh away from the old and the rent be make worse i speak here with a view to those who in the law as in the gospel in the new testament as in the old venerate the infallible word of god a revelation to be divine do not cease to be progressive and nothing exact that all truth should be promulgate in a single day if god deem proper to give to he people so long as they need it a legislation adapt to they social condition this legislation divinely give at that time may be also divinely abrogate afterward and this be what have take place those who quote to we text from the old testament concern slavery appear to have forget the say of jesus christ in reference to another institution divorce : it be on account of the hardness of you heart yes on account of the hardness of they heart god establish among the israelite incapable at that time of rise higher provisory regulation -lrb- b -rrb- perfect as regard he condescension but most imperfect as he declare himself as regard the absolute truth he who make no account of this great fact will find in the book of mose and in the prophet pretext either for practise to-day what be tolerate only for a time or for attack the scripture indignant at what they contain it be jesus christ himself therefore who draw the line of demarcation between the law and the gospel -- who announce the end of local and temporary institution have he reveal other institution this time definitive to form such a idea of the gospel we must never have open it the gospel be not a koran in the koran we doubtless find both civil and criminal law and the principle of government the apostle do not once tread on this ground fancy what they work would have be have they substitute a social for a spiritual revolution -- have they touch above all the question of slavery which form part of the fundamental law of the ancient world and here i wish my thought to be clearly comprehend : i do not pretend that the apostle be conscious of the unlawfulness of slavery and that they avoid point it out through policy for fear of compromise they work no indeed this happen unconsciously accord to all appearance they hold the opinion of they time and god reveal nothing to they on the subject wish that the abolition of slavery like all the social result of the gospel should be produce by moral agency which work from within outward which change the heart before change the action at the time of the apostle there be many other abuse than slavery they never write a word in they condemnation they make allusion to war yet say nothing of the nameless horror which then attend it they speak of the sword place in the king 's hand to punish crime yet say nothing of those atrocious torture in the first rank of which must be cite crucifixion they make use of figure borrow from the public game yet say nothing either of the combat of the gladiator or of the abomination which sully other spectacles they unceasingly call to mind the reciprocal relation of husband and wife of parent and child yet say nothing of the despotic authority which the roman law confer upon the father or of the debasement to which it condemn the wife the evangelical method be this : it have not occupy itself with community yet have work the profoundest of the social revolution it have not demand any reform yet have accomplish all of they the atrocity of war and of torture the gladiatorial combat and immodest spectacles the despotism of father and the debasement of woman all have disappear before a profound internal action which attack the very root of the evil not only do the gospel forbear to touch on social and religious problem but even on question of moral it refuse to furnish detailed solution its system of morality be very short and in this lie its greatness through this it become morality instead of casuistry case of conscience special direction a moral code promulgate article by article -- you will find in it nothing of this sort what you will find there and there alone be a grow morality which pass my expression two or three saying be write eighteen century ago and these saying contain in the germ a series of commandment of transformation of progression which we have not nearly exhaust i speak a moment since of the progress of revelation i must speak now of the progress which be be work in virtue of a revelation constantly the same but constantly become better understand which multiply we duty in proportion as it enlighten we conscience with the one say : what ye would that man should do unto you do ye also to they the gospel have open before we infinite vista of moral development before this one say the cruelty and infamous custom of ancient society not mention by the apostle have successively succumb before this one say the modern family have be form before this one say american slavery will disappear as european slavery have disappear already with this say we be all advance we be learn and we shall continue to learn yes the time will come i be convince when we shall see new duty rise up before we when we can not with a clear conscience maintain custom what i know not which we maintain conscientiously to-day this carry we somewhat further it must be grant than a list of fix duty _ ne varietur _ it oppose slavery in a different manner than a sentence pronounce once for all the gospel take the surest means of overthrow it when let alone the reform of institution it contented itself with pursue that of sentiment when it thus prepare the time when the slaveholder himself would be force to ask what be contain in the inexhaustible saying : what ye would that man should do unto you do ye also unto they even in the heart of the southern state despite the triple covering of habit prejudice and interest this say be make its way and be disturb the conscience of the people much more than be generally believe and the work that it have begin it will finish it will force the planter to _ translate _ the word slavery to consider one by one the abominable practice which constitute it be it to do to other as we would that they should do to we to sell a family at retail to maintain law which give over every slave whether wife or maiden to she owner whatever he may be and which take away from this maiden from this wife the _ right _ of remember she modesty and she duty -- what do christian call this to produce marketable negro to dissolve marriage to ordain adultery to inflict ignoble punishment to interdict instruction -- be this do to other what we would that they should do to we the christian sense of right be relentless thank god it do not suffer itself to be deceive by appearance where we dispute about word it force we to go to fact now look at the fact which be really in question in america when the great subject of slavery be discuss there theoretically against the great evangelical system of morality the judaical interpretation of such or such a text have little chance the epistle of paul send back to philemon he fugitive slave onesimus be quote to we assuredly the apostle pronounce in it no anathema against slavery nor do he exact enfranchisement these idea be unknown to he but he say : i beseech thee for my son whom i have beget in my bond whom i have send again : thou therefore receive he that be my own bowels without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it be of necessity but willingly for perhaps he therefore depart for a season that thou shouldest receive he forever not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved have confidence in thy obedience i write unto thee know that thou wilt do also more than i say do any one fancy philemon treat onesimus after this epistle as fugitive slave be treat in america put up he wife and child directly after for sale or deliver he over to the first slave merchant that be willing to take charge of he and carry he a hundred league away it be so certain that philemon do more than have be tell he that the epistle to the colossian show we the faithful and well-beloved brother onesimus honorably mention among those concern about the spiritual interest of the church do what one will there be a implied abolition of slavery -lrb- imply but positive -rrb- at the bottom of that close fraternity create by the faith in the savior between _ brethren _ the relation of master and slave of merchant and merchandise can not long subsist to sell on a auction-block or deliver over to a slave-driver a immortal soul for which christ have die be a enormity before which the christian sense of right will always recoil in the end in this it be write there be neither greek nor jew nor circumcision nor uncircumcision nor barbarian nor seythian nor bond nor free but christ be all and in all let slaveholder put to themselves the question what they would say to-day if the epistle to philemon be address to they and it be address to they the onesimus of the south -- and such there be -- be thus throw upon the conscience of they master they brother i have say enough on the subject to dispense with examine very numerous passage in which slavery be _ suppose _ by the writer of the new testament the duty of master and of slave be lay down by they without doubt and the existence of the institution be not contest for a moment only it be bring face to face with that which will slay it : the doctrine of salvation through christ of pardon of humility of love be in itself and without the necessity of express it the absolute negation of slavery it have fully prove so and the early age of christianity leave no doubt as to the interpretation give by christian to the teaching of the apostle despite the rapid corruption introduce into the church we see one brilliant fact shine forth in they : emancipation become more frequent slave as well as free man succeed to ecclesiastical office spiritual equality produce the fruit which it can not help produce namely legal equality observe too how the edict of the emperor multiply as soon as the influence of christianity be exert in the roman world and all these edict have but one aim : to sweeten servitude to increase affranchisement by law to facilitate voluntary emancipation what the gospel do then against european slavery it be do now against american slavery its end be the same its weapon be the same they have not rust during eighteen century those planter of the english island be not mistake who instinctively divine where lay they great enemy have recourse to every measure to expel missionary from among they neither be those texan executioner mistake who lately put to death the missionary bewley a touching martyr to the cause of the slave i ask in the face of the gallows of bewley what we be to think of that prodigious paradox accord to which the gospel be the patron of slavery to those who mistake its meaning on this point the gospel reply by its act it reply also by the unanimous testimony of its servant what be more striking in fact than to see that apart from the country in which the action of interest and habit disturb the judgment of christian there be but one way of comprehend and interpret the scripture on this point consult england france germany christian everywhere will tell you that the gospel abolish slavery although it do not say a single word which would proclaim this abolition why if the doubt be possible would not diversity of opinion be also possible among disinterested judge to speak only of france see the synod of we free church which continually stigmatize both swedish intolerance and american slavery see a address sign three year ago by the pastor and the elder of five hundred and seventy-one french church which have go to carry to the united state the undoubted testimony of a conviction which in truth be that of all it seem to I that we demonstration be complete what would it be if i should add that american slavery which its friend so strangely claim to place under the protection of the apostle have nothing in common with that of which the apostle have cognizance the thing however be certain slavery in the united state be found on color it be _ negro _ slavery now this be a fact wholly new in the history of mankind a monstrous fact which profoundly modify the nature of slavery before las casas that virtuous creator of the slave trade the name of which comprise to he alone a whole commentary on the maxim do evil that good may come before las casas no one have think of connect slavery with race now the slavery connect with race be that of all other most difficult to uproot for it bear a indelible sign of inequality a sign which the law do not create and which it can not destroy such be not the slavery that offer itself to the eye of the prophet and apostle a normal servitude of right base upon a native and indestructible inferiority be not then in question but a accidental servitude among equal to which the chance of war have give birth and which emancipation suppress entire quite different be the slavery which depend on race and which it may be say suppose a malediction do what one will this latter will subsist it will in a manner survive itself it will find besides in the idea of a providential dispensation the natural excuse for its excess this slavery the bible condemn in the most explicit manner if its champion dare suppose two species the book of genesis show they all mankind spring from one man and the gospel recount to they the redemption work in behalf of all the descendant of adam if they argue from the curse pronounce against canaan the old testament present to they the detailed enumeration of the canaanite a vast family in which the whites figure as well as the black in short there be a deadly struggle between the gospel and slavery under all its form and particularly under the odious form which the african slave trade have give it in modern time the gospel have be be and will be at the head of every earnest movement direct against slavery it be important that it should be so it be the only means of avoid the act of violence the revolt the extreme calamity from which the whites and the black would equally suffer the gospel be admirable inasmuch as by the side of the duty of master it proclaim those of slave as in the time of the apostle it do not hesitate to recommend to they gentleness submission scrupulous fidelity love for those who maltreat they the practice of difficult virtue it make they free within in order to render they capable of become free without to judge of this method we have only to compare the miserable population of st domingo with the beautiful free village which cover the english island how true the say : the wrath of man never accomplish the justice of god wherever the wrath of man have have full sway even to chastise abominable abuse it have remain a curse i tremble when i think of the revolt which may break out at any moment in the southern state bloodsh let we not forget would sully we banner to the right of the slave such a crisis would be forever oppose and who know whether a terrible return might not burst upon they the mind become troubled at the mere image of the horror that would ensue from civil war may the christian of america comprehend at length in a more perfect manner the greatness of the part that god reserve for they and the extent of the responsibility that be weigh upon they to take a stand frankly against slavery to remove they last pretext from sincere man who seek to reconcile it with the gospel to organize in the north the action of a vast moral power to address to the south word breathe forth truth and charity to appeal without weary to the heart of master and slave to prepare for try moment that guarantee which nothing can replace the common faith of the black and the whites to keep courage even when all seem lose to practice the christian vocation which consist in pursue and realize the impossible to show once more to the world the power that reside in justice -- this be to accomplish a noble task footnote : -lrb- footnote b : these provisory and imperfect regulation appear none the less admirable when compare not only with the system of legislation of other nation of antiquity but with those which prevail to-day even in the southern state accord to the law of mose the jewish slave always become free in seven year the foreign slave also become free when he master wound he in chastise he he have the right to testify in law he have the right to acquire and to possess -rrb- chapter vii the present crisis we now possess the principal element of we solution we can approach the problem just propound by the present crisis and confine ourselves no longer to the appreciation of the past can glance at the future not indeed that i make any pretension to prophecy political prediction suspect with reason in all time should be still more so at we epoch which be that of the unforeseen but i have a right to prove that the work which be be pursue in america be as i have affirm a work of elevation not of destruction the danger which the nation be advance to meet be nothing compare with those towards which it be lately progress the election of mr lincoln and the secession of the cotton state have introduce a new position which at last afford a glimpse of real chance of salvation i have name secession : what be we to think of the principle on which it rest for this question another may be substitute : what be a confederation if we reduce it which be inadmissible to a simple league of state it still remain none the less binding on each of they so long as the end of the league remain intact never yet exist on earth a federal compact conceive in this wise : the state which form a part of this league will remain in it only till it please they to leave it such notwithstanding be the formulum on which the southern theorist make a stand among the anarchical doctrine that we age have see hatch -lrb- and they be numerous -rrb- this seem to I worthy of occupy the place of honor this right of separation be simply the _ liberum veto _ resuscitate for the benefit of federal institution as in the horseback diet of poland a single oppose vote could put a stop to every thing so that it only remain to vote by sabre-stroke so confederation recognize the right of separation would have no other resort than brute force for no great nation can allow itself to be kill without defend itself picture to yourselve i intreat you the progress that political demoralization would make under such a system as there be never a law or a measure that be not displease to some one it would be necessary to live in the presence of the continually repeat threat : if the law pass if the measure be adopt if the election take place if you do not do all i want if you do not yield to all my caprice i leave you i constitute myself a independent state i provoke the formation of a rival confederacy the worst cause be the readiest to threaten in this style have nothing reasonable to say in they own favor they willingly proceed to violence and the say of themistocle would find here a legitimate application : you be angry therefore you be wrong what the result of this would be we can imagine no question would be longer judge by its own merit the despotism of bad man would be establish expedient would take the place of principle fear would put justice to flight national resolution would be nothing more than compromise and bargain this we must admit be something like what have be pass in the united state since the south proclaim its ultra policy and place its pretension under the protection of its threat if they have once more bow the head all would have be lose the dignity the mental liberty of america would have suffer complete shipwreck of all this noble system of government there would have remain standing but a single maxim : accord always and everywhere whatever be necessary to prevent the separation of the south unconstitutional in all place the theory of separation be doubly so in the united state where the federal system be more concentrated than elsewhere it be without doubt a federal system the separate state preserve the right in it of regulate they special legislation of govern themselves as they choose and even of hold and practise principle which be profoundly repugnant to other part of the confederation the central power be however endowed with a extended sphere it have its tax its officer its army its court it possess in the territory of the different state federal property depend upon it alone in fine its general government and general legislation apply to the effective handling of all the essential interest of the nation i be not surprise that the american confederation be so strongly cement together exclude the pretended right of separation better than any other the state that unite towards the close of the last century be already in the habit of act in concert they be of the same blood and have live under the same rule they history they interest they custom they tongue they religion all contribute to bind they closely to each other besides the question be unanimously resolve in the united state apart from the _ fire-eater _ not a person be find who have the slightest doubt as to the impossibility of modify by the violent decision of a few the common constitution which contain the enumeration of the state and which can only be amend by a solemn act vote in the special form prescribe by the compact mr lincoln merely express the general opinion when he say the other day : the union be a regular marriage not a sort of free relation which can be maintain only by passion _ secession be revolution _ be a political axiom which have be current at all time in the united state it be because they be something else than a juxtaposition of state that they comprise by the side of a senate in which all the state be equal a house of representative in which the number of deputy be in proportion to the population we constitution write madison be neither a centralized state nor a federal government but a blending of the two the experience which they have have from 1776 to 1789 have teach the different state the necessity of give a more concentrated character to they federation let we not forget that they be bind by oath to remain faithful to _ perpetual union _ and that there be not a federal officer in america who have not swear to maintain this union i shall not dwell on the fact that the confederation purchase with its money two of the state that now pretend to secede from it that it give seventy-five million to france for louisiana and twenty-five million to spain for florida no i choose to appeal from this to precedent the authority of which be not contest and which form in some sort the interpret commentary of the constitution in the last century the state of new york on give in its adhesion to the constitution desire to reserve to itself this same power of secede some day if it pleased but such a reservation be reject at the epoch of the war of 1812 and the embargo law a convention of the new england state assemble at hartford and talk of eventual separation whereupon the southern party liken all separation without consent to treason and this doctrine be sustain by the _ richmond inquirer _ the organ of jefferson when afterwards south carolina accustom to the fact dare proclaim that act of nullification which be the prelude to a complete renunciation of federal obligation it be plainly signify to she that a revolt would be suppress by force of arm and she yield on the spot when the other day this same south carolina lower the color of the united state and unfurl the palmetto flag mr buchanan himself proclaim -lrb- how could he do otherwise -rrb- the flagrant illegality of such a act it be true that after have declare it illegal he take care to disavow all intention of put the law in force and this same conduct of mr buchanan be the precise explanation of the prodigious haste which the south carolinian have use in they proceedings they know that the president in power could not if he would act with vigor against he own party he inaction be assure there be two month of interregnum of which it be important to make the most so that mr lincoln on come into office might find himself check or at least harass by the power of a deed accomplish it seem as though mr buchanan be anxious himself to give the signal of revolt the message that be issue by he after the election of mr lincoln be really the most extraordinary document ever write by the head of a great state he doubtless declare in it that a regular election can not of itself alone furnish sufficient cause for the violence of the south he take care however to add that the south have reason to complain that reparation and guarantee be due it and that if these be refuse -lrb- that be if the north refuse to replace its head under the yoke and to decree at once the ruin and the shame of america -rrb- it will then he time for action the carolinian think that they might be excuse for be a little less prudent than the first magistrate of the united state since moreover they see they pretension sanction by he why not attack the confederation while it have a chief who be determine to make as little defense as possible the weakness of mr buchanan justify the confidence of carolina he refrain to place in the federal fortress troops destine to protect they against a expect assault when a brave man major anderson take measure to defend the post that have be confide he this unexpected resistance by which the program be deranged appear as ill-timed to mr buchanan as insolent to the people of charleston and the despatch of the 30th of December address to they commissioner exculpate he from the crime of have send the reinforcement and make excuse in pitiful term for the conduct of major anderson whom they ought to hear before condemn in fact anderson act on he own responsibility and incur the blame of the minister of war who advise in full council the surrender of the fort the american government be as timid as the secede state be resolute we generation which have witness sad spectacles have never yet perhaps contemplate any more humiliating minister one of whom hardly out of the cabinet have go to preside over the secession convention at montgomery and another of whom have take care to pave the way in advance for the revolt of the south and to secure for it the resource of money arm and munitions which it be about to need minister who vote openly for the insurgent whose financial intrigue have be prove by investigation and whose electoral maneuver duplicate by embezzlement of public money have end in a sort of political treason disavow only by general cass a cabinet in the last extremity still essay to continue its former course by kill with its veto the bill adopt by the legislature of nebraska to prohibit slavery in its territory a government fall apart by piecemeal for fear of compromise itself by resist some part of the south : do you know of any thing so shameful mr buchanan will end as he begin : for four year he have be struggle to obtain a extension of slavery for a month he have be favor the plan of separation by oppose he force of inertia to the grow indignation of the north be unable to prevent every thing he do at least what he can : force to send some reinforcement he speedily withdraw they in a manner seemingly design to render easy the attack on fort sumter and to discourage major anderson in the hand of a president who understand he duty thing would have go on very differently in the first place the south would have know on what to rely and would have be remind of the message of general jackson in 1833 exact the _ immediate _ disbanding of its troops next preliminary measure of precaution would not have be systematically neglect lastly at the first symptom of revolt a sufficient number of ship of war would have be send to charleston to insure the regular collection of tax and respect for the federal property nothing be so pacific as resolution : face to face with a strong government we look twice before launch into adventure but with mr buchanan it be almost impossible for the cotton state to refrain from precipitate themselves headlong into they the repression that will come by and by will not repair the evil that have be do explanation will also follow too late it be for the president to reply on the spot and categorically to the manifesto issue by the south to let the violent state know that they unconstitutional plan would meet a prompt chastisement to let the neighboring state know that they sovereignty be by no means menace and that they would continue to regulate they internal institution as they please to say to all that the discussion of plan of abolition be not in question to say too to all that the majority of free-soiler would be protect in the territory and that the conquest of slavery be end : what language would have be better fitted than this to isolate the gulf state -- perhaps to check they i say _ perhaps _ because i know that passion have reach such a pitch of exasperation that a rupture seem inevitable in south carolina for example the governor have recommend both house in advance to take measure for secede if mr lincoln should be elect a special commission be nominate and hold permanent session in texa senator wigfall do not fear to say in support mr breckenridge : if any other candidate be elect look for stormy weather there may be a confederation indeed but it will not number more than thirty-three state mr jefferson davi of mississippus and mr benjamin of louisiana hold no less explicit language announce that at the first electoral defeat of the south it would set about form a separate confederation long since demand by its true interest what the south call its interest what it end by adopt as a political platform outside of which there be no safety be as we have see the subjugation of majority in the territory the restriction of sovereignty in the northern state the reform of the liberty bill which refuse the prison of these state and the co-operation of they officer to the federal agent charge with arrest fugitive slave the power of transport slavery over the whole confederation the duty of extend indefinitely the domain of slavery who pay walker who continually recruit band of adventurer to launch on cuba or central america who prepare the well-known list of slave state with which the south count on enrich itself : four state some day to be carve out of texa -lrb- the south have cause this to be authorize in advance -rrb- three state to be create in the island of cuba a indefinite number of state to be detach one after another from central america and mexico who clamorously demand the reëstablishment of the african slave trade alone capable of people this vast extent and of lower the excessive price of the negro supply by the produce state the extreme south which alone be concern in this saw gigantic vista open before it on which it fasten with ecstasy now already in spite of the more or less avowed support of mr buchanan its success be already check it feel itself provoke and thwart henceforth all its hope be concentrate on the election of 1860 : we may judge therefore of its disappointment and of the furious ardor with which it must have seize upon its last resource namely secession which might prove in its hand either a means of terrifying the north and of bring it again under the yoke or of enter alone into a new destiny of have elbow-room and of devote itself entirely to the propagation of slavery the fact be know i do not think of recount they i content myself with remark the enthusiasm which prevail in the majority of the cotton state one could not commit suicide with a better grace it be easy to recognize a country hermetically seal to contradiction which be enchant with itself and which end by accomplish the most horrible deed with a sort of conscientious rejoice the enthusiasm which be display in proclaim secession or in firing on the american flag be display in free the captain of a slaver a noble martyr to the popular cause there be something terrifying in the enthusiasm of evil passion when i consider the folly of the south which so heedlessly touch the match to the first cannon point against its confederate when i see it without hesitation give the signal for a war in which it run the risk of perish when i read its law decree the penalty of death against any one who shall attack the palmetto state and its dispatch in which the removal of major anderson be exact in the tone which a master employ toward a disobedient servant i ask myself whether the present crisis could really have be evade and whether any thing less than a rude lesson could have open eye so obstinately close to the light people have take in earnest the plan of the southern confederacy nothing could be more impose in fact if they have the least chance of success the fifteen southern state already immense join to mexico cuba and central america -- what a power this would be and doubtless this power would not stop at the isthmus of panama : it would be no more difficult to reëstablish slavery in bolivium on the equator and in peru than in mexico thus the patriarchal institution would advance to rejoin brazil and the dismayed eye would not find a single free spot upon which to rest between delaware bay and the bank of the uruguay furthermore this colossal negro jail would be stock by a no less colossal slave trade : barracoon would be refill in africa slave expedition would be organize on a scale hitherto unknown and whole squadron of slave ship -lrb- those float hell -rrb- would transport they cargo under the southern color proudly unfurl patriotic indignation would be arouse at the mere name of the right of search and the whole world would be challenge to defend the liberty of the sea such be the project in its majestic unity such be the glorious ideal which the extreme south hope to attain by its union with the north and which it now seek to attain by its separation the heart of man beat high at the thought and many be ready to give they life heroically in order to secure its realization alas we be thus make passion excuse every thing transfigure every thing each one feel instinctively moreover that no part of the plan can be separate from the whole that it must be great to be respect that to people this vast extent with slave the african slave trade be indispensable of course they take care not to avow all this at the first moment it be necessary in the begin to delude other and perhaps themselves it be necessary to obtain recognition on this account the prudent politician who have just draw up the program of the south have be careful to record in it the prohibition of the african slave trade and the disavowal of plan of conquest but this do not prevent the necessity of the position from become know by and by true program adapt to the position of affair be not change from day to day i defy the slave state provide they confederation succeed in exist to do otherwise than seek to extend towards the south hem in on all side by liberty incessantly provoke by the impossibility of prevent the flight of they negro they will fall on those of they neighbor who be the least capable of resistance and whose territory be most to they convenience this fact be obvious as it be also obvious that they will have recourse to the african slave trade to people these new possession it be in vain to deny it on account of europe or of the border state the necessity will subsist and sooner or later they will be obey if the border state persist in delude themselves on this point and fancy that they will always keep the monopoly of this infamous supply of negro sell at enormous price this concern they in any case the illusion will finally become dispel it be not in the nomination of jefferson davi as president of the confederate state that we be to look for the final repudiation of those project of which this politic man be in some sort the living representative and when they be renew we shall see a invincible obstacle rise up in the way of the realization of a plan so monstrous as soon as the african slave trade be establish the domestic slave trade will cease the revenue of the produce state will be suppress the price of negro will fall everywhere and the fortune of all the planter will fall in like proportion can it be possible that they will accept the chance of civil war of insurrection and of massacre in order to ensure to themselves the risk of ruin in case of success can it be possible above all that europe will lend a hand as we seem to imagine to the most audacious attack ever direct against christian civilization i know that we must always make allowance for probable perfidy and i be far from dream as time go that chivalric europe will refuse to serve she own interest because these interest would cost she principle something no indeed i imagine nothing of the sort yet i think that i should wrong the nineteenth century if i suppose it capable of certain thing there be sentiment which can not be provoke beyond measure with impunity remember the shudder that run through the world when texa a free country be transform into slave territory as the result of the victory of the united state multiply the crime of texa by ten by twenty and you will have a faint image of the impression of disgust that the southern republic be about to call forth among we it be important that they should know this in advance at charleston and not delude themselves as to the kind of welcome for which the palmetto state and its accomplice have to hope not only will no one recognize they pretended independence at this time for to recognize it would be to tread under foot the evident rights of the united state but they will excite one of those moral repulsion which the least scrupulous policy be force to take into account it be one thing to hold slave it be another to be found expressly to serve the cause of slavery on earth this be a new fact in the history of mankind if a southern confederacy should ever take rank among nation it will represent slavery and nothing else i be wrong it will also represent the african slave trade and the fillibustering system in any case the southern confederacy will be so far identify with slavery with its progress with the measure design to propagate and perpetuate it here below that a chain and whip seem the only device to be embroider on its flag will this flag cover the human merchandise which it be design to protect against the interference of cruiser will there be a country will there be a heart forgetful enough of its dignity to tolerate this insolent challenge fling at we best sympathy i doubt it and i counsel the carolinian to doubt it also the representative of england at washington be say to have already declare that in presence of the slave trade thus practice he government will not hesitate to pursue slaver into the very port of the south france will hold no less firm a tone whatever may be the dissent as to the right of search the _ right of slave ship _ be sure will be admit by none a sea-police will soon be find to put a end to they if need be the punishment will be inflict on they crew that be in store for a much less crime that of piracy these wretch will be hang with short shrift at the yard-arm without form or figure of law the carolinian deceive themselves strangely they fancy that they will be treat with consideration that they will even be protect because they maintain the principle of free trade and because they hold the great cotton market free trade cotton these be the two recommendation upon which they count to gain a welcome in europe let we see what we be to think of this i shall not be suspect in what i be about to say of free trade -- i who have always be its declare partisan i who sustain it twenty year ago as candidate in the bosom of one of the electoral college of pari and who applaud unreservedly we recent commercial treaty with england but man do not live by bread alone and if ever a school of commercial liberty should anywhere be find that should carry the adoration of its principle so far as to sacrifice to it other and nobler liberty a school dispose to set the question of cheapness above that of justice and to extend a hand to whoever should offer it a channel of exportation malediction enough would not be find for it let england take care those who have no love for she take delight in foretell that she sympathy will be weigh in the balance with she interest and that the protection of the north risk offend she much more than the slavery of the south i be convince that it will amount to nothing and that we shall once more see how great be the influence of christian sentiment among englishman should the reverse be true we must veil we face and give over this vile bargaining adorn with the name of free trade to the full severity of public opinion i repeat that it will amount to nothing moreover do not let we exaggerate either the protective instinct of the north or the free trade of the south the new tariff just adopt at washington -lrb- a grave error assuredly which i do not seek to palliate -rrb- may be amend in such a manner as to lose the character of prohibition with which certain state have seek to invest it let we not forget that by the side of pennsylvanium which urge the excessive increase of tax the north count a considerable number of agricultural state the interest of which be very different now these be the state which elect mr lincoln and which will henceforth have the most decisive weight on the destiny of the union we may be tranquil the protective reaction which have just triumph in part will not long be victorious all liberty cling together : the liberty of commerce will have its day in the united state but if all liberty cling together all slavery cling together also and can not be liberal at will even in commercial matter the southern state plume themselves on be thus liberal and it be seek to give they this reputation however the fact be little in harmony with they brilliant program far from proclaim free trade the confederate state by a formal act adopt on the 18th of February have maintain the tariff of 1857 they have go further : they congress have just establish a new and relatively heavy tax which must burden the exportation of cotton this be not commercial liberty as i understand it notwithstanding the watchword have be give the champion of slavery have skilfully organize they system of maneuver in europe and it be develop accord to they wish to be indignant at the new tariff to speak only of the new tariff to create by means of the new tariff a sort of popularity for the southern republic -- such be the end which they seek to attain i doubt whether they have fully obtain it although the south i say it to we shame have already succeed in procure friend and praiser among we the factitious indignation will fall without doubt but cotton remain : at the bottom the south count much more upon cotton than free trade to bring the old world into she interest on rush into a mad enterprise all the peril of which enrage as it be it could not disguise it say to itself that its cotton would protect it be it not the principal and almost the only producer of a raw material without which the manufacture of the whole world would stand still be there not million of workman in england -lrb- one-sixth of the whole population -rrb- who live by the manufacture of cotton be not the wealth of great britain found on cotton which alone furnish four-fifth of its export manufacture all this be true and they be not ignorant of it at manchester notwithstanding what happen there the other day a immense meeting be convoke for the purpose of carefully examine the great cotton business and the peril create by the present crisis i do not know that among these manufacturer know that they interest be menace that among these workman know that they means of livelihood be at stake that from the heart of this country know that want famine and insurrection might come to she door there arise a voice a single one to address a word of sympathy to the southern state and to promise they the slightest support it be because there be something transcend manufacturing supplies and even the bread of family : the need i be glad to state of protest against certain crime instead of extend a hand to the secessionist of charleston the english manufacturer resolutely lay the foundation of a vast society destine to develop on the spot the production of cotton by free labor in indium the antille and africa such be they answer and if you know they most secret thought you would have no difficulty in discover that the ambition of the south its turbulent policy and its aggression without pretext be far from exciting the gratitude of english commerce or of inspiring its confidence every one in england comprehend that from the standpoint of interest the separation of the south be a mortal blow deal to the cotton production which will henceforth have the aid neither of credit nor entrepôts and which be advance towards catastrophe which may involve a conflict of arm from another and higher standpoint the public opinion of england have not make we wait for its verdict : already its abolition society have regain life and begin they movement already under the pressure of the universal feeling the court of queen 's bench have revise the affair of the negro anderson to deliver into the strong hand of the metropolis a question before which the judicial authority of canada hesitate and to pronounce at length a verdict of acquittal the south have take account in its calculation neither of man nor god god especially seem to have be forget though it place itself formally under he protection who do not shudder at the enunciation of these unheard-of plan : we will do this then we will do that we will hold england through cotton we will entice france through influence -- we will have many negro much produce and much money and what will god think of it everywhere else but in south carolina this question would appear formidable beyond expression if the south have take its wish for reality in europe it have commit the same error in america its secession have some chance -lrb- and what a chance -rrb- only on condition of draw in all the glare state without exception now it seem by no means probable that such a unanimity suppose it to be gain by surprise could ever be maintain successfully the negro-raising state could not possibly regard the future in the same light as the consuming state they revenue be base on the value of the domestic slave trade which bear no resemblance to that of the african slave trade ask virginium or maryland long to sustain a policy the result of which would be to lower the price of she slave in one day from a thousand dollar to two cent this be so clearly feel in the extreme south that the provisional constitution adopt at montgomery be draw up with a express view to reassure the produce state on this point they be afraid of the african slave trade it shall not be reopen they be anxious to sell they negro they shall be buy only of those state form part of the southern confederacy it belong to they to ask now whether this montgomery constitution adopt for a year really guarantee any thing to they and whether it be possible that a attempt will not be make to revive the african slave trade provide the southern confederacy succeed in endure however this may be they be hold apart by so many cause that they would only unite to-day to separate to-morrow i know well that the passion of slavery rule in many of the border state especially in virginium as violently as in the extreme south i do not disguise from myself that the habit of sustain a deplorable cause in common have create between the border and the cotton state a bond of long standing and difficult to break but i say this : the impulse of the first hour will have they morrow when the frontier state witness the commencement of those territorial invasion which must necessarily bring the african slave trade in they train when they know what reliance to place on the fine promise make to-day to attract they when they perceive that in separate from the north they themselves have remove the sole obstacle in the way of the flight of all they slave when in fine they feel weigh upon they and they first the peril of a armed struggle and a negro insurrection they will listen perhaps to those of they citizen who even now be urge they to turn to the side of justice -- of justice and of safety by the fewness of they slave by the nature of they climate which resemble that of marseille and montpellier by the kind of cultivation to which they country be adapt by the number of manufacture which be begin to be establish among they it seem as if they must be lead or at least some day lead back to the policy of union this be no discovery : the _ secede state _ know it already they form a separate band america have not forget the retreat of the seven which a few month ago dismember the democratic convention assemble at charleston these seven be south carolina florida alabama mississippus arkansa texa and louisiana in other word all those state which be the first to vote for secession the same list with the addition of georgium and north carolina appear again on the day of the presidential election : these nine state alone adopt mr breckenridge as they candidate here then be a profound distinction which attach to interest and tendency which have manifest itself already which will manifest itself more and more and which will work sooner or later the salvation of the united state the border state can not unite with the cotton state definitively they give proof of this in the last election five among they tennessee kentucky delaware virginium and maryland at that time take a intermediate position by make a intermediate choice : mr bell without go so far missouri protest at least against the nomination of mr breckenridge by cast its vote for mr dougla better than this a declare adversary of slavery mr blair be elect representative by this same slave state missourus on the day before the balloting for the presidency and on the next day he friend vote openly for mr lincoln while no one dared-annul they vote as have be do four year before mr lincoln thus obtain fifteen thousand vote in missourus four thousand in delaware fifteen hundred in maryland a thousand in kentucky and as many in virginium the figure be nothing the symptom be significant the slave state of this intermediate region contain in they bosom therefore man who do not fear to attack the patriarchal institution have we not just see a republican committee act at baltimore in the midst of maryland have not this same maryland just reject by the popular vote the infamous law which its legislature have adopt and by virtue of which free negro who should not quit the state would be reduce by right to slavery when i remember these fact so important and so recent i comprehend how it be that a kentuckian hold the south at bay behind the menaced wall of fort sumter and how the cabinet of mr lincoln have minister in its midst who belong to the border state people take the peculiar situation of the border state too little into account in look into the future which be prepare for america they persist in present to we two great confederacy and in some sort two united state call to divide the continent if any thing like this could occur it could not endure doubtless there be hour of vertigo from which we may look for every thing even the impossible and who know perhaps the impossible most of all nevertheless the border state can not attach themselves forever to a cause which be not they own by the side of the manifestation which have take place in virginium and south carolina we have already a right to cite demonstration of a different kind have not missouri just decide prudently that in the matter of separation the decision of she legislature shall not be valid until ratify by the whole people this little resemble the eagerness with which state elsewhere rush into secession it be therefore probable that the united state will keep or soon bring back into they bosom a considerable number of the border state by they side the gulf state will attempt to form a rival nation aspire to grow towards the south such be the true extent of the separation that be prepare suppose these project to become some day reality we may ask whether a real weakening of the united state would be the result suppose even that another secession base on different motive which nothing foretell at present should take place beyond the rocky mountain suppose that a pacific republic should some day be found would the american confederation have reason to be greatly trouble at witness the formation on she side of the association of the gulf state californium and oregon look at a map and you will see that the valley of the mississippus and of the lake and the shore of the atlantic be not necessarily connect either with the gulf of mexico -lrb- save the indispensable outlet at new orlean -rrb- or the region beyond the great desert and the rocky mountain the land of the mormon and the gold-digger unity be not always the absolute good and it may be that progress must come through disruption who know whether instantaneous secession would not perform the mission of resolve certain problem otherwise insoluble who know whether slavery must not disappear in this wise in the very effort that it make to strengthen itself through isolation who know whether it be not important to the prosperity and real power of the united state to escape from theory of territorial monopoly those evil counsellor but too much heed who know in fine whether the day will not come when the question of slavery once settle new federal tie will again bind to the center the part that stray from it to-day i put these question i make no pretension to resolve they in any case the imagination have have full scope for some time past people have not be satisfy with the southern confederacy have they not invent both the pretended pacific confederacy which i have just mention and the central confederacy in which the border state will take shelter in common with two or three free state as pennsylvanium and indiana have they not suppose in the bargain -lrb- for they seem to find it necessary to discover the dissolution of the union every where at all cost -rrb- that the agricultural population of the west discontented with the tariff recently adopt and put in practice the new maxim accord to which they be to have recourse to separation instead of pursue reform will seek a asylum in canada i need not discuss such fable i be convince for my part that the principle of american unity be much more solid than people affirm i see in the united state a single race and almost a single family : they may divide they will not cease to be relate the relationship will take back its rights for the time however secession seem to have a providential part to enact it facilitate in certain respects the first step of mr lincoln thanks to it the hostile majority in the senate be blot out the uncertainty of the house of representative be decide the government become possible in the face of the senator and representative of the gulf state i do not see how mr lincoln could have succeed in act do not the senate last year adopt the proposition of mr jefferson davi in opposition to the liberty of the territory congress would have trammel one after another all the measure of the new administration now on the contrary the rôle of the victorious party will be easy its preponderance be assure in both house the supreme court will cease ere long to represent the doctrine of the extreme south and to issue dred scott decree this be a vast change general cass in truth comprehend the interest of slavery better than mr buchanan when he demand that the government should arrest with vigor from the begin the faintest wish of separation chapter viii probable consequence of the crisis general cass be nearer right than he himself imagine in arrest from the begin the development of the plan of the south by a vigorous attitude and by the blockade then easy of charleston the government would not only have render it the trifling service of maintain its means of opposition in congress but also the inappreciable boon of avert the danger of war what have happen on the contrary precisely what must have happen the human heart be such as it be when on one side be find all the ardor all the activity all the resolution and into the bargain all the apparent success while on the other be find languor hesitation inaction and disgraceful delay it happen almost infallibly that the undecided be hurry away by the fanatic let the united state take care the chance of the future incur the risk at this moment of become more grave to-day the border state be on the point of declare themselves to-day in consequence it be important to offer to they natural irresolution the support of a policy as firm as moderate give over without defense to the ardent solicitation of the extreme south they be only too likely to yield particularly if the federal government give they reason to believe that the separation will encounter no serious obstacle we must remember that ignorant community be here in question who be rule by they prejudice and who have never tolerate the slightest show of discussion upon question connect with the subject of slavery such community be capable of commit the most egregious folly panic sudden resolution mistaken unanimity be common among they formerly king be pity who live surround by flatterer it be say -lrb- we have provide against that -rrb- that the truth never reach they the planter be the only man i see to-day that can be liken to these monarch of olden time neither book nor journal nor preacher be permit to point out to they they duty or they interest in the matter of slavery the slightest symptom of inertia or of feebleness in the federal government at this time will therefore expose the border state to great peril and through they the whole confederation as easy as it would have be with a little energy to prevent the evil to confine secession within its natural limit and to weaken the chance of civil war so difficult have it become at present to attain the same end painful duty perhaps will be impose on mr lincoln i wonder in truth at the politician who advise he to a masterly inactivity that be who urge he to continue mr buchanan doubtless he do right to leave to the insurgent all the odium of act on the offensive but he moderation should detract nothing from he firmness and it be even of importance that the means of action which he be about to prepare should manifest so clearly the overwhelming superiority of the north that the resistance of the south will be thereby discourage adversary of slavery be not want who be almost indignant at the adoption of such measure by the new president do they fancy then that a formidable question could be resolve without risk the repression of the assault of force by force away with childishness in elect mr lincoln it be know that the cotton state be ready to protest with arm in they hand he be not elect to receive order from the cotton state or to sign the dissolution of the united state on the first requisition who will the end will the means no one certainly desire more than myself the peaceful repression of the rebellion may the success of the blockade render the employment of the army useless may the resolute attitude of the confederation arrest the majority of the intermediate state on the dangerous declivity upon which they be stand once let they be draw into the circle of influence of the extreme south and little chance will remain of confine the civil war within the limit beyond which it be so important that it should not spread then will appear the _ irrepressible conflict _ of mr seward whether desire or not if the two confederation be place side by side the one represent all the slavery the other represent all the liberty the conflict will take place it will take place perhaps now perhaps a little later however this may be no one will have the power to hinder it suppose the south thus complete relinquish -lrb- and nothing be less certain -rrb- the opening by itself of a war in which it must perish and its great plan of attack against washington for instance be abandon suppose the united state on they side avoid a direct attack which might give the signal for insurrection suppose they limit themselves to purely maritime repression of the revolt that after strike off the southern harbor from the list of seaport and declare that custom-house duty can not be legally pay there they maintain this blockade which europe ought to applaud would they have avert all chance of conflict no alas however temporary such a situation might be complaint recrimination and ere long violent reprisal would be see everywhere arise rivalry of principle rivalry of interest bitter memory of past injury such be the rock on which peaceful policy would be in continual danger of shipwreck we must not cherish illusion the chance of civil war have be increase for a few week past with fearful rapidity if mr lincoln have confine himself scrupulously to conservative and defensive measure there have be on the contrary in the action of the south a violent precipitation which have surpass all expectancy it be the haste of skilful man who attempt by a bold stroke to carry off the advantage of a deed accomplish it be at the same time and chiefly perhaps the haste of man who have nothing to lose the ringleader of the present hour at the end of resource the insurgent south have already increase its tax inordinately it have kill public and private credit it have create a disturbed revolutionary condition intolerable in the end which no longer permit deliberation or even reflection will the south pause on such a road it be difficult to hope it as to the north its plan of action be very simple and easily maintain : suppose even that through impossibility it should give over force the rebel back to they duty who can ever imagine that it would suffer itself to be deprive of the mouth of the mississippus or that it would abandon to the rival confederacy the capital itself of the union inclose within the slave state let we see thing as they be : the maintenance and development of slavery in the south will render the abolitionist proceedings of its neighbor intolerable in its eye if it have not be able to endure a contradiction accompany with infinite circumspection and temper by many prudent disclaimer how will it support this daily torture a unanimous and well-founded censure a perpetual denunciation of the infamy which accompany and constitute the patriarchal institution the north on its side will be unable to forget that by the act of the south without reason or pretext the glorious unity of the nation have be break that the star-spangled banner have be rent in twain that the commercial prosperity of america have be shake at the same time with its greatness let one of those incident then occur that be constantly arise a southern slave ship stop on the high sea by the north a negotiation of the south threaten to introduce europe into the affair of the new world and directly hostility will break out what they will be in the end i scarcely dare imagine if the planter be force at present to mount guard day and night to prevent the insurrectionary movement that be constantly ready to break out on they estate if many family be already send they woman and child into safer country what will it be when the arrival of the force of the north shall announce to the slave that the hour of deliverance have sound it will be in vain to deny it they arrival will always signify this in the sight of the south there be certain fact the popular interpretation of which end by be the true interpretation i have no doubt that the general of the united state before attack the southern confederacy will recommend to the negro to remain at peace and will disavow and condemn act of violence but what be a manifesto against the reality of thing and the necessity of situation there be a word that i see write in large letter everywhere in the project of the south -- yes the word _ catastrophe _ be to be read there in every line the first success of the south be a catastrophe the greatness of the south will be a catastrophe and if the south ever realize in part the iniquitous hope towards which it be rush the catastrophe will acquire unheard-of proportion it will be a st domingo carry to the tenth power one can not with impunity give full scope to he imagination and in the year of we lord 1861 set to work to contrive the plan of a confederacy design to protect and to propagate slavery these thing will be avenge sooner or later ah if the south know how important it be that it should not succeed if it comprehend that the north have be hitherto its great its only guarantee this be literally true a slave country above all to-day need to be back up by a free country to ensure the subsistence of a institution contrary to nature otherwise the first accident the first war give it over to peril that make we shudder thanks to they metropolis we colony be able first to keep and afterwards to enfranchise they slave without succumb to the task but let a southern confederacy come in which the immigration of the whites will be naught while the increase of the black will be pursue in all way and in case of success the moment will soon arrive when many state will see themselves place as be the case already with south carolina in presence of a number of slave exceed that of free man such a social monstrosity never exist under the sun even in greece even in rome even among the mussulman the total number of free man remain superior the colony alone through the effect of the slave trade present a inverse phenomenon and the colony be consolidate with they metropolis in the same manner that the state of the south be consolidate with those of the north in this will be find i repeat a most important guarantee the south in reject it and imagine itself able alone to maintain a situation which will become graver day by day delude itself most strangely at the hour of peril when servile insurrection perhaps shall ravage its territory it will be astonish to find itself leave alone in the presence of its enemy and this enemy be not one that can be conquer once for all even after the victory even in time of peace the threat of servile insurrection will ever remain suspend over the head of the southern confederacy it will be necessary always to watch always to be on the guard always to repress and to tell the truth always to tremble the planter whether they know it or not be not prepare to sleep on a bed of rose to labor to accomplish a iniquitous work amidst the malediction of the universe to increase they estate and they slave under penalty of death and to feel instinctively that they will die for have increase they to tremble because of european hostility to tremble because of american hostility to tremble because of hostility from without and within -- what a life that one might accept it in the service of a noble cause i can comprehend but the cause of the south in truth this would be take great pain for small wages the south inspire I with profound compassion we have tell it much too often that its confederacy be easy to find to find yes to make lasting no here it be not the first step that cost -- it be the second it be the third the southern confederacy be not viable let we suppose that to its misfortune it have succeed in all that it have just undertake : charleston be free the border state be draw in there be a new federal compact and a new president the northern state have of necessity abandon the suppression of the insurrection by force europe have surmount its repugnance and receive the envoy of the great slave republic all question seem resolve but no not a single one have attain its solution the policy of the south must have its application its first article whether it declare it or not exact conquest the absorption of mexico for example the fillibuster of walker be still ready to set out and the first moment past when the question be to appear discreet it be scarcely probable that they will meet with much restraint now that the prudence of the north be no longer at hand to counterbalance the passion of slavery admit that this enterprise bring no difficult complication for these new territory the question will be to procure negro the second article of the southern policy will find then _ nolens volen _ its inevitable application : the african slave trade will be re-establish the richest planter of georgium mr goulden have take care to set forth its necessity mark the language which he hold lately : you have hardly negro enough for the exist state obtain the opening of the slave trade then you can undertake to increase the number of slave state will the official re-opening of the slave trade be some day effect without bring on a storm which will destroy the new confederacy i can not say in any case i know one thing : that the value of the slave and consequently that of southern property will experience a decline greatly exceed that by which it be now threaten as it be say by the abolition tendency of the north already through the mere fact of secession the price of negro have diminish one-half and more than one intelligent planter foresee the time when this price shall have diminish three-fourths perhaps nine-tenth southern fortune be fall off therefore with extreme rapidity and this arise not only from the anticipated effect of the slave trade but also from the certainty of be unable henceforth to put a stop to the escape of the slave these escape take all in all remain insignificant so long as the union be maintain there be not more than fifty thousand free negro in canada but henceforth the southern confederacy will have a canada everywhere on its frontier how retain that slavery that will escape simultaneously on the north and the south the southern republic will be as it be the common enemy and no one assuredly will aid it to keep its slave it must not be believe moreover that it will succeed long in preserve itself from intestine division -- division among the whites if at the first moment when every thing be easy unanimity be far from appear as complete as have be foretell it will later be much worse we shall then perceive how prophetic if i may dare say so be the often-quoted word of washington 's farewell address : it be necessary that you should accustom yourselve to regard the union as the palladium of you happiness and you security that you should watch over it with a jealous eye that you should impose silence on any who shall ever dare counsel you to renounce it that you should give vent to all you indignation on the first effort that shall be attempt to detach from the whole any part of the confederation a very different voice that of jefferson speak the same language a southern man address himself to the south which talk already of secede he describe in thrilling word the inevitable consequence of such a act : if to rid ourselves of the present supremacy of massachusett and connecticut we be to break up the union would the trouble stop there we should soon see a pennsylvanian party and a virginian party form in what remain of the confederation and the same party spirit would agitate public opinion by what new weapon would these party be arm if they have power to threaten each other continually with join they northern neighbor in case thing do not go on in such or such a manner if we be to reduce we union to north carolina and virginia the conflict would break out again directly between the representative of these two state we should end by be reduce to simple unity be not this the anticipated history of what be about to happen in the southern confederacy suppose it to succeed in unite with a part of the border state the open program will last as long as program usually do when the true plan of the south veil for a moment shall reappear -lrb- and it must indeed reappear unless it perish before it have begin to exist -rrb- when the question shall be to increase and be people to make conquest and to reëstablish the african slave trade when the serious purpose in a word shall have replace the purpose of circumstance what will take place between the border state and the cotton state the profound distinction which exist between they will then manifest itself even if it do not break forth before a new south and a new north will be form as hostile perhaps as the old and less forgiving towards each other of they mutual fault inasmuch as they will be embittered by misfortune nothing divide people like a bad cause that turn out badly they think themselves unite they call themselves unite until the moment when they discover that they have neither the same end nor the same mind i do not see why the victory of mr lincoln will have transform the south and suppress the divergency which separate it into two group : that of the gulf state vote for mr breckenridge that of the border state vote for mr dougla or mr bell and even cast ballot for mr lincoln not only will the gulf state the only true secessionist never act in concert with the border state but they will not be long in see party spring up in they own bosom which will be little disposed to come to term a sort of feudal question as be well know be near obtain a position in the south the _ poor whites _ there be two or three time as numerous as the planter the struggle of class may therefore break out as soon as the effect secession shall have banish to the second rank the struggle against the adversary of slavery the impoverishment of the south will not aid in calming its intestine quarrel european immigration already so meager in the slave state -lrb- charleston be the only large american city whose population have decrease accord to the last census -rrb- european immigration i say will evidently diminish still more when the south shall have take a independent and hostile position opposite the northern state who will go then to expose himself lightly to the fearful chance which the first war with any country american or european may bring in its train and credit will go the same way as immigration : to lend money to planter whose entire property be continually menace with destruction be one of those hazardous operation from which commerce be accustom to recoil deprive of the capital furnish it by new york obtain only with great difficulty a few onerous and precarious advance in europe the south will see itself smite at once in all its means of production and after the harvest of 1860 which secure we supplies for a year after that of 1861 which it will succeed probably in gathering but which it will be more difficult to sell it be not easy to divine how it will set to work to continue its crop while the south produce less cotton and we lose the habit of buying of it the cotton culture will become acclimated elsewhere the future will thus be destroy like the present final ruin will approach with hasty stride they tell we of a loan that the new confederacy design to contract unless it be transform into a forced loan i have little faith in its chance they add that it will be only necessary to establish on export cotton a duty of a few cent per pound and the coffer of the south will be fill but in the first place to export cotton they must produce it -- they must have money it be almost impossible that the state should be rich when all its citizen be in distress then the exportation itself will be expose to some difficulty if the united state organize a blockade and i say nothing of the bad effect that will be produce by this tax _ à la turque _ -- this tax on exportation in the very midst of plan of commercial freedom neither do i speak of the effect which this extra charge which be term trifling but which be in fact considerable will have on the sale of american cotton already so defective when compare with the average price of other cotton poor country which blind passion and above all indomitable pride precipitate into the path of crime and misery poor excommunicate nation whose touch will be dread whose flag will be suspect whose continually increase humiliation will not even be compensate by a few meager profit the heart be oppress at the thought of the clear certain inevitable future which await so many man less guilty than err between they and the rest of the world there will be nothing longer in common they will establish on they frontier a police over book and journal essay to prevent the fatal introduction of a idea of liberty : the rest of the world will have for they neither political sympathy nor moral sympathy nor religious sympathy will they at least have the consolation of have kill the united state will a glorious confederation have perish by they retreat no a thousand time no even though they should succeed in draw the border state into the southern confederacy the united state thank god will keep they rank among nation where will the united state be after secession where they be before for a long time the gravitation of they power have be tend towards the northwest the true america be there that of ancient tradition and that of present reality if any serious fear might have be conceive as to its duration they disappear on the day of the election of mr lincoln on that day we all learn that the united state would subsist and that they malady be not mortal great news be this do you ever ask yourself how much would be miss here on earth if such a people should disappear it live and it will live look at the calm and confident air of the north and compare it with the noisy violence of the south the north be so sure of itself that it do not deign either to become angered or to hasten it even carry this last to extreme it have the air of know that in spite of the apparent success which may mark the first effort of the south the final success must be elsewhere let the south take care to have against it both right and might be twice as much as be need to be beat the north support mr buchanan because it be await mr lincoln mr lincoln come the north still have patience but will end by fall into line and the serious struggle will begin in case of need the final issue of this struggle can scarcely be doubtful on one side i see a confederacy divide impoverished bend under the weight of a crush social problem see constantly on its horizon the menace of insurrection and of massacre unable either to negotiate or to draw the sword or to resolve any of the difficulty from without without thinking of the still more formidable difficulty from within on the other side i see the united state master of themselves unanimous know what they want and place at the service of a noble cause a power which be continually increase the match will not be equal i can not help believe therefore that the triumph of the north will be even much more complete than we imagine to-day i do not know what be to happen but this i know : the north be more populous richer more united european immigration go only to the north european capital go only to the north of what element be the population of the south compose the first six state that proclaim they separation number exactly as many slave as freeman what a position be it probable indeed that this confederation contrary to nature in which each white will be charge with guard a black can afford a long career the south divided weakened bearing in its side the continually bleed wound of slavery reduce to choose in the end between the direful plan which must destroy after have dishonor it and the union which consolidate its interest while thwart its passion -- be it possible that the south will not return to the union something tell I that if the union be dissolve it will be form again a lasting separation be more difficult than be imagine face to face with europe face to face with the united state the great republic of the south would find it too difficult to live to live at peace be impossible to live without peace be not to be think of the great southern republic must perish surely by its failure and still more surely by its success for this monstrous success will draw down its destruction there be in america a necessity as it be of union unity be at the foundation diversity be only on the surface unity be bind up with the national life itself with race origin belief common destiny a like degree of civilization in a word with profound and permanent cause diversity proceed from the accident of institution look only at the province of interest be it easy to imagine a irremediable rupture between new york and charleston between the valley of the mississippus and new orlean what would the valley of the mississippus be without new orlean and new orlean isolate from the vast country of which it be the natural market can you fancy new york renounce half she commerce cease to be the broker of cotton the necessary medium between the south and europe can you fancy the south deprive of the intervention and credit which new york assure she the dependence of the north and the south be reciprocal if the south produce the cotton it be the north which furnish the advance then purchase on its own account or on commission and expedite the traffic with europe in the united state every part have need of the whole agricultural state manufacture state commercial state they form together one of the most homogeneous country of which i know i should be surprise if such a country be destine to become forever dismember and that too at a epoch less favorable to the dismemberment of great nation than to the absorption of small one shall i say all that i think when anglo-saxon be in question we latin be apt to deceive ourselves terribly one would not risk much perhaps in suppose that event would take place precisely in the reverse of we hypothesis we have loudly predict in europe the end of the united state the birth and progress of a rival confederacy a irremediable separation : be not this a reason for suppose that there will be ultimately neither a prolonged separation nor a rival confederacy worthy of consideration free country especially those of the english race have a habit of which we know little : they word be exceedingly violent and they action exceedingly circumspect they make a great noise : one would say that every thing be go to destruction but it be prudent to look at they more closely for these country of discussion be also country of compromise the victor be accustom to terminate political crisis by yield something of they victory in appearance it be true rather than in reality fully decide at heart they consent willingly to appear less positive in form here i know that the extreme violence of the south render a compromise very difficult at least a present compromise as it be accustom to rule and will be content with no less as it know that the north decidedly emancipate will not replace its head beneath the yoke it seem resolve to incur all risk rather than renounce its fixed idea for two month the probability of compromise have be become constantly weaker but if we have scarcely a right to count on they now so far as the gulf state be concern we must remember that the border state be at hand that they be hesitate between the north and the south and that certain concession may be make to they to prevent they separation such be the true character of the discussion relate to compromise confine to these limit they nevertheless possess a vast interest for the party which the border state be about to choose and that to which they will perhaps attach themselves afterwards will have a great influence over the general course of the crisis the point in question be no longer doubtless to retain virginium whose well-known passion impel she to the side of charleston but to induce the other state to take a attitude in conformity with they interest and they duty it will not therefore be useless to give a account of the disposition that prevail among many american with respect to compromise what be produce by that peace conference convoke with so much noise by virginium the ancient political state the country of washington jefferson madison and monroe nothing worth the trouble of mention a considerable number of state refuse to be present at this conference which have it be general would have become transform into a convention and have annul congress in point of fact then in session in the same city its plan accept with great difficulty by a factitious majority never appear to have much chance of adoption the point in question above all be to decide that below a fix latitude the majority of the inhabitant of a territory could not prohibit the introduction of slavery -lrb- disguise it be true under the euphuistic expression involuntary servitude -rrb- this measure be to be declare irrevocable unless by the unanimous consent of the state despite the support of mr buchanan and that of the higher branch of trade in new york second as usual by some fashionable circle of boston the almost unanimous public opinion of the north forbid all belief in the success of such a amendment to the constitution which in accordance with the constitution itself could be adopt only on condition of unite two-third of the vote of congress to the affirmative vote of three-fourth of the state compose the confederation another project be put forward : all the member of congress be to tender they resignation and the new election be to manifest the definitive will of the country on the question of slavery that be from the intense excitement of the country be to be demand some final element of reaction some means of disavow the election of mr lincoln in either case it would have be thus prove by a exceptional act that a election which be not ratify by the south may rightfully demand extraordinary measure now there be nothing but what be customary simple and right in the conduct of the north it know it and will not i think permit such a advantage to be gain over it to allow talk to allow proposition and to go its own way this be the program to which it be bind to remain faithful what make its honor make also its strength : this be the privilege of good cause the north have not to seek basis for a compromise they be all lay down and i dare affirm whatever may happen that to these basis constantly the same it will not fail to return provide at least that the era of compromise shall not be close and that the south shall not have succeed in impose on the north a decidedly abolition policy to speak truly it have but one declaration to make : to proclaim anew the constitutional law by virtue of which each state sovereignly decide its own affair and consequently exclude all interference of congress in the matter of slavery perhaps alas it will join if need be to this declaration which it have never refuse the promise to respect to the utmost of its power the principle of the restitution of fugitive slave which unhappily be also base upon the constitution but on this point promise be worth what they will fetch for doubtless no one will imagine that it be easier to constrain the free state to accomplish a odious deed which be revolt to they conscience since they have verify they strength by elect mr lincoln lastly upon the ruling question that of the territory the theory of the north evince justice and clearness between the ultra abolitionist who wish congress to interfere to close by force all the territory to slavery and the south which wish congress to interfere to open by force all the territory to slavery it adopt this middle position : all the inhabitant of the territory shall open or close they to slavery accord to they will it be the right of the majority recognize there as elsewhere i be not ignorant that mr seward have go much farther in the path of concession and it be not absolutely impossible that these counsel of weakness may prevail we must be prepare for any thing in this respect nevertheless the president have by no means continue the imprudent word of he future prime minister the language of mr lincoln be remarkably clear in he inaugural speech to go no further back indicate on the spot the true the great concession which till new order may be make to the south : those who elect I place in the platform present for my acceptance as a law for they and for I the clear and explicit resolution which i be about to read to you : ` the maintenance intact of the right of the state and especially of the right which each state possess to regulate and exclusively control its institution accord to its own view be essential to that balance of power on which depend the perfection and duration of we political structure and we denounce the invasion in contempt of the law by a armed force of the soil of any state or territory upon whatever pretext it may be as the greatest of crime ' mr lincoln add further : congress have adopt a amendment to the constitution which however i have not see the purpose of which be to provide that the federal government shall never interfere in the domestic institution of the state include those which relate to person hold in service in order to avoid all misunderstanding concern what i have say i depart from my intention of not speak of any amendment in particular to say that consider this clause henceforth as a constitutional law i have no objection that it be render explicit and irrevocable concern fugitive slave the inaugural discourse cite the text of the federal constitution which decide the question for the present but he do not ignore the fact that this constitutional decision be as well execute as it can be the moral sense of the people lend only a imperfect support to the law as to the territory mr lincoln declare clearly that the minority must submit to the majority under penalty of fall into complete anarchy neither do he hesitate on the subject of the decision of the supreme court these decree in he eye be merely special decision render in particular case and detract nothing from the right which the confederation possess to regulate its institution and its policy all this be very firm without be provoke the limit of concession be mark out and a conciliatory spirit be maintain it be above all in disclose he line of conduct towards the rebellious state that mr lincoln happily resolve the problem of abandon none of the rights of the confederation while manifest the most pacific disposition and leave to other the odium of aggression he doctrine on this point may be sum up in this wise : in the first place the separation be unconstitutional it should be it will be combate nothing on earth can bring the president to accede to the destruction of the union in the second place he will not be the aggressor he will endeavor to shun a war which expose the south to fearful peril in the third place he will fulfill the duty of preserve federal property and collect federal tax in the south in other term he will employ the means which should have be employ on the first day and which would have then be more efficacious he will attempt the establishment of a maritime blockade in order to reduce the rebellion of the whites without provoke the insurrection of the negro already the vessel of war have be recall from distant station alas i have little hope that the precaution dictate to mr lincoln by prudence and humanity will bear they fruit the south raise a army and be about to attack fort sumter know that it will thus expose itself to a formidable retribution mr lincoln in fact have not leave it in ignorance of this : in you hand my dissatisfied fellow-citizen in yours and not mine be find the terrible question of civil war the government will not attack you you will have no conflict if you be not the aggressor you have not on you part a oath register in heaven to destroy the government whilst i on my side be about to take the most solemn oath to maintain to protect and defend it such be the respective position man will agitate be agitate already about the new president to take away from he thought and design this resolute character which make they force they attempt to demonstrate to he not only that fort sumter so easy to revictual under mr buchanan have now become inaccessible to aid and that no other course remain than to authorize its surrender but that fort picken itself should be surrender to the south in order to reserve every chance of reconciliation and in no degree to assume the responsibility of civil war i hope that mr lincoln will know how to resist these enfeeble influence after have demonstrate to he that it be necessary to deliver up the fort they will demonstrate to he that it be necessary to renounce the blockade which be not tenable without the fort then who know they will demonstrate to he finally that it be necessary to sign some disgraceful compromise and submit almost to the law of the rebel once more it be prudent to foresee every thing and it be for this that i mention such thing i count moreover on they not be realize in elect mr lincoln the united state decide thus : slavery will make no more conquest what they have decide they will ultimately maintain even though they should have the air of abandon it they have respect and they will respect the sovereignty of the state upon this point they will give all the guarantee that may be desire and congress we have see have already vote a amendment to the constitution design to offer this basis of compromise but they will go no further than this the north must feel that of all way of terminate the present crisis the most fatal would be the disavowal of principle and the desertion of the flag the compromise that promise any thing more than respect for the sovereignty of the state in the matter of slavery promise more than they could perform every one feel this in the south as in the north the policy of the south form a whole of which nothing subsist if any thing be retrench and above all if the complicity of the government cease to be assure to it on the day that the south accept any compromise whatever it will have renounce not the maintenance doubtless but the propagation of slavery it will have renounce its rule compromise -lrb- there will be such perhaps let we swear to nothing before or after the war with the entire south or with a part of it -rrb- compromise will be sign henceforth without any delusion the south know marvellously well that these compromise will bear little resemblance to those sign in former time those mark by they constantly increase pretension the upward march of the south these will mark the phase of its decline how many change which can never be retrace no more conquest to promote slavery no more reopen of the african slave trade no more impunity secure to those numerous slave-ship which daily to the knowledge and in the sight of all for year past have quit the port of the confederation no more chance of equalling by the creation and population of new state the rapid development of the north henceforth the question be end the south must be resign to it : the majority of the free state will become such that it can be contest neither in the house of representative nor in the senate nor in the presidential election the supremacy reside at the north the program of the south be rent in a thousand piece against this all the compromise in the world can do nothing if mr lincoln be the first president oppose to slavery mr buchanan be the last president favorable to slavery the american policy be henceforth fix reflect in fact on what these four year of government will produce the result be so enormous that unhappily one might be tempt to say at washington : we will do all that be wish provide we preserve the handling of affair the power of a president be doubtless inconsiderable but he advent be that of a party this party be about to renew all administration great and small the same majority which have elect he will modify before long the tendency of the court in fine the general affair of the union will be manage in a new spirit it be advance in one direction it be about to move in the opposite mr lincoln be not one to shut he eye on filibuster attempt to strive to take cuba for the slavery party to permit state to be carve out of mexico and other to be make ready by subdivide texa the process which be about to be accomplish remind I of the measure take to combat a vast conflagration : the first thing do be to circumscribe its locality at the end of the four year of mr lincoln 's administration the flame which threaten to devour the union will be completely hem in consider the united state as a whole and independently of the incident of separation we be justified in believe that the respective number of free and of slave state will leave no chance for the ulterior extension of a great scourge do we delude ourselves by think that the progress already begin in the border state will have be accelerate in its course and that many of they will have freely pass over to the side of liberty be it certain moreover that the hesitation of some of the church will have cease and that the influence of the gospel so decisive in america will have finally place itself entire at the service of the good cause let there be a compromise or not let the great secession of the south be prevent or not let civil war break forth or not let it give or not give to the south the fleeting eclat of first success one fact remain settled henceforth : the united state be totter on they base they have regain they equilibrium the deadly peril which they lately incur from the plan of conquest of the south and the indefinite extension of slavery be at length conjure down they have no longer to ask whether some day the south have grow beyond measure secession must not be effect by the north leave in the hand of the slaveholder the glorious name and the starry banner of the union i think that i have go over the whole series of hypothesis which offer any probability i have be careful to adopt none of they for i make no pretension thank god to read the future it would be puerile to prognosticate what will happen and not less puerile perhaps to describe it from what have happen in the face of the accident in different direction which be attract public attention and fill the column of newspaper i have attempt to make a distinction between what may happen and what must endure the lasting consequence of the present crisis be what i propose to investigate faithfully the reader know what be my conclusion it may be that it will end in the adoption of some blamable compromise but whatever may be inscribe in it the election of mr lincoln have just write in the margin a note that will annul the text the time for certain concession be past and the south have no more doubt of it than the north it may be that the slave state will succeed in found they deplorable confederacy but it be impossible that they should succeed in make it live they will perceive that it be easier to adopt a compact or to elect a president than to create in truth in the face of the nineteenth century the nationality of slavery i have therefore the right to affirm that whatever may be the appearance and incident of the moment one fact have be accomplish and will subsist : the united state be perish and be save yes whatever may be the hypothesis on which we pause three new and decisive fact appear to we eye : we know that the north henceforth have the mastery we know that the peril which threaten the union come from the south and not from the north we know that the day of the patriarchal institution be number beneath these three fact it be not difficult to perceive the uprising of a great people the victory of the north the consciousness which it have of its strength and of its fixed resolution whatever may be the appearance to the contrary to circumscribe a evil which be ready to overflow on every side be the first fact there be no need to return to it as to the second carolina and georgium have charge themselves with bring it to light they have prove by they act that abolitionism have be calumniate in accuse it of menace the unity of the united state the secessionist passion have show themselves in the other camp there upon the mere news of a regular election have be sacrifice unhesitatingly the greatness and it would seem the very existence of the country the proclamation from charleston and the shot fire on the federal flag have apprise we of what intelligent observer suspect already : that the state for which slavery have become a passion and almost a mission must some day experience the need of procure to such a cause the security of isolation and in act in this wise these state strange to say have themselves state the problem of abolition no one thought of it it may be say every one respect the constitutional limit of they sovereignty they would not have it thus they carry the question into the territory of federal right and federal relation they exclaim : secure the extension of slavery and perish the united state if the united state have perish there would not have be malediction deep enough for those who have commit such a crime the united state will not perish but they will long remember with gratitude what they owe to the secessionist of 1860 when the hour of emancipation shall have strike and it will strike some day the secessionist of 1860 will not probably speak of they rights to indemnity they have just give a quittance of it in cannon ball the third fact remain : be it true that in all the hypothesis the cause of the negro have just realize such progress that the ultimate issue of the contention can no longer be doubtful this be most obvious let there be separation or not slavery have just enter upon the road which lead to abolition more or less rapid but infallible if there be no separation this immense progress will he effect with more wisdom and slowness violent means will be avert the benevolent influence of the gospel will pave the way for progressive and peaceful transformation by preach to the slave as to the master more of they duty than of they rights if there be separation emancipation will be accomplish much more quickly and more calamitously servile war will break out ultra abolitionism to which hitherto the prudence of the north have refuse all real credit will be no longer restrain by the prudence of a people desirous of shun bloody catastrophe sustain by the increase animosity which will inflame the two confederacy against each other it will find means of introduce into the south appeal to revolt and will multiply expedition like that of john brown but let we leave these generality and examine nearer by from the stand-point of emancipation the four or five hypothesis which we have signal out most plainly and between which seem to lie the chance of the future i shall examine first of all the one whose realization be evidently pursue by the able man of the extreme south the question be after have speedily gain over the north thanks to mr buchanan to arrive as quickly as possible at something which shall have the appearance and authority of a fact accomplish audacity and again audacity upon this point the politic and the violent meet in unison to-day it have secede it have invade the federal property it have trump up a government it have give itself a president it be about to have a army it be already attempt to represent itself officially at the court of the great power by the side of audacity prudence have play its part it have take good care not to unfurl its flag it have make itself small modest moderate as much so at least as the passion of the mob would permit it ask nothing in truth but to live honestly in a corner of the globe who speak then of conquest who would wish to re-establish the african slave trade on a large scale far from be retrograde the man of the south be champion of progress witness they program of commercial freedom be there no honest man to be find in the north to restrain mr lincoln and to prevent he from oppress they be there no government in europe that can interpose and recommend the maintenance of peace be not this peace which prevent the insurrection of negro and the destruction of cotton for the interest of all why should there not be two confederacy live side by side as good friend it be evident that the able party tend to this and that the violent have allow they to give for the common interest this subdue tone to the insurrectionary movement the able party know too well what a prolonged war would be to desire it they prepare for it in the hope if not to avoid it entirely at least to prevent its duration and to obtain at once in behalf of southern secession that species of security which be confer in we time by the deed accomplished perhaps the united state yield to a sentiment which certainly have something honorable in it will allow the confederacy of the gulf state to subsist rather than crush it which would be but too easy by bring upon it a war which would be accompany by slave insurrection let we not be in haste to blame such a course let we remember that the whole world be prompt in this direction that all the counsel give to mr lincoln in the old world as in the new begin invariably with the word : strive to avoid civil war let we remember also that to solve the american problem much more time will be need than we imagine in europe let we endeavor to put ourselves in the place of those who see thing as they be and who find themselves in a struggle with the difficulty patience will doubtless have here its great inconveniency the confederacy of the cotton state if combate without vigor will seem the living proof of the right of separation it will be a asylum all prepare in which the discontented border state can take refuge at need nevertheless the question be to tolerate this confederacy but by no means to recognize the legitimacy of the act which give it birth the question be to make use of a generous forbearance to which new threat of secession will necessarily put a end then be it nothing to manifest a spirit of peace fit to touch the most prejudiced to bind the majority of the border state to the destiny of the union to give evidence of the distinction which exist between they and the extreme south to force they in fine to declare themselves if they surmount the present temptation -lrb- and they will never encounter a stronger one -rrb- if they consent to sacrifice they immediate interest and to renounce the traffic in slave which be in danger of cease from day to day in case they do not join the confederate state be such a resolution nothing do it contain no guarantee for the future we do not set foot in the right path with impunity honorable resolve always carry we further thank god than we count on go suppose even that the border state which refuse to unite with the south design to impose on the north certain vexatious condition they will be none the less turn from they former alliance they will have none the less begin to move in a new direction we should do wrong if we do not recognize how honorable be the conduct of several among they in watch over they legislature in enact that the vote of secession shall be submit to the ratification of the whole people certain frontier state seem to have already show themselves resolve to foil the intrigue at charleston the cause of emancipation take therefore a very important step in advance in the hypothesis of a southern confederacy reduce or nearly so to the gulf state alone limited secession be perhaps of all combination the one most favorable to the suppression of slavery picture to yourself in fact what this southern confederacy will he it will be a impossible short-lived republic the separation of which will one day cease and which meanwhile will be incapable of realize any of its favorite project from the first hour the extreme south find itself bring to face a dilemma : either to draw in all the slave state and then to await the moment favorable to the execution of its grandiloquent plan to hasten towards its destiny its ideal to conquer territory to people they with negro and to perish through the accomplishment of a impious work or to remain alone and undertake nothing and still perish but this time through impotence to exist what be to be do when there be only the miserable confederacy of some thousand whites the owner and keeper of some hundred thousand black make conquest they dare not open the slave trade it would draw down destruction upon they now mark that in the bosom of a confederacy morally isolate from the entire world receive aid neither from immigrant nor capital deprive in a large part at least of the fresh supply of negro which it formerly draw from the north unable even to incur the risk of imitate spain which buy _ free _ negro from the slave-hunter of the african continent not in a condition to stop the escape which will take place on all she frontier the question of slavery will proceed necessarily towards its solution the extreme south strange to say will find itself place providentially as a obstacle between the united state and the country of which it lately meditate the acquisition the united state will have the advantage of be unable even to think of cuba or central america or mexico they will be deliver for a time from these baleful temptation and from the state in which they meet the warmest support and during this time the extreme south will be force in some sort to look at the problem of slavery under a aspect before unknown to it later will come the shock the postpone but inevitable conflict blockade at the south blockade at the north blockade on the african side undermine and tear by its intestine division the extreme south will have to face at one time or another the irresistible power of the united state do any one imagine by chance that the latter will forever relinquish new orlean and the gulf of mexico the more they become elevated and strengthen the more they will be lead say rather force to absorb again the portion of they former domain which have attempt to exist without they from this time the discussion relative to slavery will assume in the united state a simple and decide bear the extreme south in quit they will have give they every facility it will have endow they with political homogeneousness and liberal majority by the mere effect of the departure of the senator and representative of the extreme south the party oppose to slavery will have acquire at the outset the numerical majority which it lack in congress it will be in a position to ensure the passage of its bill to form its administration to constitute by degree court in every respect favorable to its principle next the border state who shall not have follow the fortune of the extreme south will find themselves bind to those of the north associate with its interest open to its idea and it be a fixed fact that several will not be long in complete the work of liberty already begin among they and thus become with they rich and extensive territory of the number of those fortunate state in which the suppression of slavery give the signal for the fruitful invasion of immigrant for agricultural progress for wealth and for credit in this manner the patriarchal institution will disappear peaceably from the intermediate region while it will be threaten by more terrible shock in the tropical region this be a chance which be common to limited and to total secession but which be still more unavoidable in the last face to face with the miserable confederacy of the extreme south the united state can afford to be patient face to face with the confederacy comprise all the slave state -lrb- or which mean the same face to face with two distinct confederacy comprise the one the cotton state the other the border state yet unite against the north through a old instinct of complicity -rrb- the attitude of the united state as every one foresee will inevitably be more hostile total secession itself can be bear only from a sentiment of declare hostility it amount to a declaration of war suppose that mr lincoln reject the advice of those of he cabinet who would incline to accept the fact of separation suppose that while treat the south with gentleness and strive to spare it the horror of a armed strife he persist in protect the rights of the confederation and secure to it by a maritime blockade the collection of tax suppose that the blockade be organize from south carolina to the rio grande support by fort picken jefferson and taylor which will have be revictualle at all cost after the force evacuation of fort sumter suppose that in this manner watch be keep over the port of charleston savannah mobile and new orlean may it not happen that the insurrectional government at montgomery will decide to effect a march on washington be it not probable that north carolina virginium and maryland will allow themselves to be cross without say a word more than this be we not justified in believe that these state and with they a considerable number of the central one rally around they ancient banner by the very approach of peril will make common cause with the slave confederacy in such a case how avert the chance of a direful conflict will the united state carry patience with respect to the aggressor the fear of give a signal of ruin deference to the counsel lavish on they perhaps so far as to refuse to return a violent attack and to consent to the ravishment of they capital it be hard to believe if the south make the attack the war will break out and the border state will be expose to the first blow but admit that they succeed in prevent a immediate explosion the mere fact of a total secession and of the formation of two confederacy almost equal -lrb- in appearance at least -rrb- will permit no one to count on the prolonged preservation of peace what repulsion what grievance will be find in all relation in all question and from a grievance to war from war to negro insurrection what will be the distance i ask the south will be then a immense powder magazine to which the first spark will set fire and the south will not lose its habit of arrogance it will be quarrelsome as always have it not already announce in its journal that on the first encouragement give to its fugitive slave it will draw the sword now such encouragement certainly will not be want the south do not know at the present time how much the north of which it complain contribute to prevent the escape which it fear the federal government be at hand to oppose they in some measure at least when the preventive obstacle shall have disappear the south will see with what rapidity its slavery will glide away on every point of its frontier it will see its _ happy _ negro ready to brave a thousand peril rather than remain under its law alas it will see many other proof of they devotion to servitude i do not like to bring bloody image at which i shudder too often before the eye of the reader it must be say notwithstanding while it be yet time that the general confederacy of the south intoxicate with its project resolve to increase its possession force to demand from the african slave trade the means of repeople its state depopulate by escape and to install slavery into new territory will draw upon it not only the wrath of the united state but the indignation of the entire world and what misery what ruin will ensue from the first conflict i like better to fix my thought on the third hypothesis -- that of a return to the now broken union teach by experience recognize how little weight it have in the world since its separation from the united state poor weak divide comprehend the impossibility of realize its true plan without expose itself to calamity lose its resource one after another even to the cultivation of cotton which also demand credit and security incapable of prevent the flight of its slave and not daring to brave that great power of public opinion which will interdict it the african trade the southern confederacy exhaust and dismay will perhaps one day prefer return to the bosom of the union to plunge into the extremity of misfortune in this case again the question of affranchisement will have make vast stride the united state will have take a decide position in the absence of the south which its return can not destroy conviction will be fix the final impulse will have be give and to this impulse the south come to repentance will know that nothing be leave it but to submit finally come a last hypothesis which i mention because it be necessary to foresee every possibility under the combined influence of the border state and the state of the north equally desirous of maintain the union the attempt of the extreme south will have fail its secession will have last only a few month and a compromise will have serve to cover its retreat but what compromise could compensate for a fact so important as the election of mr lincoln it have a deep significance which no compromise will remove it signify that the conquest of slavery be end this prove the future be easy to foresee : increase majority in the north increase disproportion of the two part of the confederation at the end of the four year of a lincoln administration the slave state will have lose all hope of struggle with they eight thousand whites charge with keep four million of black against the twenty million of citizen that inhabit the free state let we add that the future once fix and the question of preponderance once resolve many passion will moderate by degree the number of free state will increase not only by the settling of new territory but also by the affranchisement of the thinly scatter slave become continually more thinly scatter of maryland of delaware or of missourus we can even now describe this affranchisement so well be the _ american method _ know it consist as every one know in emancipate the child that be to be bear this be the method which have be uniformly apply in the northern state and which will be doubtless apply some day in the border state provide however civil war do not come to accomplish a very different emancipation -- emancipation by the rising of the slave there will be nothing of this i hope pacific progress will have its way we shall then see these intermediate state one after the other regain life in the same time as liberty : they will become transform as if touch by the wand of a fairy such be the future prospects which offer themselves to we if we remember besides the movement which be begin to be work in the religious society and the church -- a movement which can not fail to be soon complete we shall know on what to rely concern the fate which await a social iniquity against which be at once conspire the folly of its friend and the indignation of its foe chapter ix coexistence of the two race after emancipation something more difficult to foresee than the suppression henceforth certain of slavery be the consequence of this suppression the problem of the coexistence of the two race rest at the present hour with a crush weight on the thought of all it mingle poignant doubt with the hope of some it exasperate the resistance of other be it true that emancipation would be the signal of a struggle for extermination be there not room upon american soil for free black by the side of free whites i do not conceal from myself that there be here a accredit prejudice a admit opinion which perhaps more than any thing else trammel the progress of the united state let we attempt to estimate it m de tocqueville who have judge america with so sure a eye have be notwithstanding mistake upon some point he warmest admirer must admit it write at a epoch when the great result of english emancipation have not yet be produce he be lead to frame that formidable judgment of which so much advantage have be take : hitherto wherever the whites have be the more powerful they have hold the negro in degradation and slavery wherever the negro have be the more powerful they have destroy the whites this be the only account which can ever be open between the two race another account be open thank god and no one will rejoice at it more sincerely than m de tocqueville -- he who be so generous and whose abolition sentiment be certainly no mystery to any of he colleague of the chamber but he opinion remain in he book and every one repeat after he that the black and the whites can not live together on the same soil unless the latter be subject to the former i repeat that at the time at which he write he have reason or at least known fact give he reason to say this the liberty of the black have then but one name -- st domingo to-day the victory of christian emancipation have come to contrast with the catastrophe provoke by impenitent despotism the english colony bear a striking analogy to the southern state of the union the black there be numerous more numerous even in proportion to the whites than in the carolina or florida the climate be even more scorching and the culture demand still more imperiously the labor of the black as to the prejudice of the master i dare affirm that the planter of the continent and those of the antille have not long have any thing with which to reproach each other notwithstanding what have happen in the antille not only have liberty be proclaim -- this be the act of the metropolis -- but the coexistence of race have subsist it be to this point that i claim attention they the whites and the black alike free invest with the same privilege exercise the same rights encounter each other in the rank of the militia in the magistracy and even in the seat of the colonial assembly admirably accept this life in common and the whites there observe be anglo-saxon that be they belong to that race which be declare incapable of endure free black in its neighborhood it be necessary to appeal sometimes from those axiom so boldly lay down which serve we to make inflexible law for that which must be subject in a infinite measure to the mobility of circumstance and influence the influence of the gospel especially be a fact the scope of which be never sufficiently measure it have create in the antille a negro population which maintain its equality face to face with the whites yet which do not entirely reject they patronage a dependent population which be also a free population free in the most absolute sense of the word the black of the antille labor on the plantation and secure the success of large plantation but at the same time they themselves become landholder form by degree one of the happiest and most remarkable class of peasant that ever exist they little field they pretty village manifest real prosperity and there be something among they that be worth more than prosperity there be moral progress the development of intellect and the elevation of soul it will be demand of we if in the midst of so much progress the production of sugar have not suffer i answer that on the contrary it have increase it have be predict that emancipation would be a death-blow to the british colony i suspect that many people be even yet persuade of it now in spite of the fault commit by the planter who have neglect nothing to disgust the negro with labor and to drive they from they old mill they be find to return to they content themselves with wages that scarcely rise above a average of a shill a day if we compare the two last census of liberty with the two last year of slavery we shall discover that the total production of sugar have increase in the colony in which emancipation be effect in 1834 and they have not only have to endure this crisis of emancipation but also another crisis still more formidable that of the sudden introduction of free trade in 1834 the colonial sugar expose to competition with the sugar produce at havana and elsewhere by slave labor experience a prodigious decline there be cause to believe that the production be about to be destroy it have rise again notwithstanding and the english antille with they free negro and they unprotected sugar force to face entire liberty in all its form import to-day into the metropolis nearly a million more hogshead than at the moment when the crisis of free trade break forth liberty work miracle we always distrust she and she reply to we suspicion by benefit the english antille which during the last thirty year have have to surmount besides the two crisis of emancipation and free trade the earthquake of 1840 and six consecutive year of drought the english antille which have have to liquidate they old debt and to repair the ruin accrue from the failure of the bank of jamaica be now in a attitude which prove that they have no fear for the future and scarcely regret the past under slavery the antille be hasten to they ruin with liberty they have become one of the richest channel of exportation which england possess under slavery they could not have support the shock of free trade with liberty they have gain this new battle : such be the net proceeds of experience if we still have doubt let we compare dutch guiana which hold slave to english guiana which have emancipate they the resource of these two country be almost equal english guiana be progress while the culture of surinam be forsake three-fourth of its plantation be already abandon and the rest will follow but the question of profit and loss be not the only one here i think and after have compute the proceeds of sugar after have show that in this respect english emancipation be in rule it be allowable to mention also another kind of result look at these pretty cottage this neat and almost elegant furniture these garden this general air of comfort and civilization question these black whose physical appearance have become modify already under the influence of liberty these black who decrease rapidly in number during the epoch of slavery and who have begin to increase on the contrary since they affranchisement they will tell we that they be happy some have become landowner and labor on they own account -lrb- this be not a crime i imagine -rrb- other unite to strengthen large plantation or perhaps to carry to the work of rich planter the cane gather by they on they own grounds some be merchant many hire themselves out as farmer whatever may be the fault of some individual the ensemble of free negro have merit the testimony render in 1857 by the governor of tobago : i deny that we black of the country be of indolent habit so industrious a class of inhabitant do not exist in the world a admirable spectacle and one which the history of mankind present to we too rarely be that of a degraded population elevate itself more and more and place itself on a level with those who before despise it concubinage so general in time of servitude as to give rise to the famous axiom negro abhor marriage be now replace by regular union in become free the negro have learn to respect themselves : the unanimous report of the governor mark the progress of they habit of sobriety crime have greatly diminish among they they be polite and well bring up fall even into the excess of exaggerated courtesy they respect the aged : if a old man pass through the street the child rise and cease they play these child be assiduously send to school the support of which depend in a great part upon the voluntary gift of the negro grateful to the gospel which have set they free the former slave have become passionately attach to they pastor they first resource be consecrate to church to school and sometimes also to distant mission to the evangelization of that africa which they remember to do it good we should be at once surprised and humiliate be we to compare the much-vaunted gift of we charity with those of these poor people these free man of yesterday whom we think that we may rightfully treat with disdain thanks to the gospel and it be to this that i return the problem of the coexistence of race be resolve in the most pacific manner in the antille among freemen however little these freeman may be christianize specific inequality become speedily efface and the prejudice of skin be not find to be ultimately as insurmountable as we have be tell in these english colony which be true republic govern themselves and which also remind we through this feature of the southern state the black have come to be accept as fellow-citizen they practice the liberal profession they be elector and often elect for they form of themselves alone one-fifth of the colonial assembly at jamaica they be officer of the police and the militia and they authority never fail to be recognize by all i name jamaica just now some may seek to bring it as a argument against I the fact be that this great island have seem to form a exception to the general prosperity considerable fortune have be sink there and the transformation have be slower and more painful there than elsewhere but when they arm themselves with these circumstance they forget two thing : first that the cause of the malady be anterior to emancipation next that the cure have come from emancipation itself before emancipation jamaica be insolvent she plantation be mortgage beyond they value and its planting be threaten in other way far more than now do you know what have since happen difficulty which appear insoluble have be resolve to-day the cape be double and man navigate in peace at the present time jamaica comprise two or three hundred village inhabit by free negro the latter be willing to work for accord to the latest information -lrb- February 1861 -rrb- the price of daily labor decrease instead of rise among these free negro there be not less than ten thousand landholder and three-eighth of the cultivate soil be in they hand they have establish sugar-mill everywhere imperfect rude yet work in a passable manner and mill of this sort be number by thousand the middle class of color thus grow richer day by day the family that compose it all own a horse or a mule they have they bank-book and they account with the savings bank lastly which be of more value than all else the free negro of jamaica have build more than two hundred chapel and as many school at the very moment when i write these line a enthusiastic religious movement be prevail among they the rum-shop be abandon the most degraded class enter in they turn the path of reformation i should have be glad to cite we own colony instead of confine myself to the english island i have be prevent from this not only by the memory of the conflagration of 1859 at martinique and of the state of siege which it become necessary to proclaim there but above all by the circumstance that the liberty of we former slave have be too often restrain by means of the vagabond regulation that labor have continue to be impose on they to a certain point that the parcel out of property have be trammel by fiscal measure that moreover it be less the labor of we former slave than of the coolie and other employ which have secure the success of we experiment whence it follow that this success be far from be as conclusive as that which have be obtain elsewhere under the system of full liberty nevertheless we success which be no less real signify something also if we have not yet those little free village that class of small negro landholder of which i just speak we have like the english free negro in we militia and in we marine like they we have have we election and all class of the population have take part in they like they and perhaps in a greater degree we have increase we sugar production since emancipation it be true that the crisis of free trade have not yet pass among we and that we can not know how this would be support by we colonial sugar but it will not be long before we shall be inform on this point : by a act which we can not but applaud and which continue the work it have undertake the french government have just suppress the protection continue hitherto to we planter if ere long as it be justifiable to hope they be deliver from the charge of the colonial system whose advantage they have lose we shall see they struggle and successfully i be convince against the spanish sugar produce by slave labor it will be perhaps maintain that the antipathy of race be stronger in the united state than elsewhere and that the american in this respect be inferior to the english i be as conscious as any one else of those infamous proceedings towards free negro which be the crime of the north a crime no less odious than that of the south what conscience be not arouse at the thought of those prejudice of skin which do not permit black to sit by the side of whites in school church or public vehicle only the other day nothing less than a denunciation in open parliament be need to begin the destruction by a public rebuke of the classification which be be make on the english steamer themselves between liverpool and new york there be some new state which purely and simply exclude free negro from they territory those which do not exclude they from the territory repulse they from the ballot-box the injustice in fine be as gross as cry as it be possible to imagine must we conclude from this that the coexistence of race possible elsewhere be impossible in the united state i distrust those sweeping assertion which resolve problem at one stroke i refuse above all to admit so easily that iniquity must be maintain for the sole reason that it exist and that it suffice to say : i be thus make what would you have i can not change myself to abstract one 's self from the accomplishment of the most elementary duty to endure negro at one 's side to respect they independence to abstain from wrong towards they to consent to the full exercise of they rights be a elementary duty christian duty i need not say demand something better do this mean that we be to set ourselves up as judge and brand as wretch all those who thus mistake the law of charity and justice i fear much that in they place we would do precisely as they live in the south we would have slave and would defend slavery to the last living in the north we would tread under foot the free color class be there then neither the true nor the false nor justice nor injustice god forbid the just and the true remain iniquity should be condemn without pity but we be bind to be more indulgent towards man than towards thing we be bind to remember that the influence of surroundings be enormous and that if crime be always without excuse there be many excusable criminal when we examine man by the prejudice of skin such as prevail in the united state we be not long in discover that it rest in great part on a misunderstanding : man mistake coexistence for amalgamation i do not fear to affirm that the second would be as undesirable as the first would be desirable why dream of blending or of assimilate the two race why pursue as a ideal frequent marriage between they and the formation of a third race : that of mulatto america do right to resist such idea and to inscribe she testimony against such a future evidently very little in conformity with the design of god but coexistence by no means draw amalgamation in its train on this point also experience have speak in the english colony the liberty of the black be entire the legal equality of the two race be not contest public manners have shape themselves to that mutual consideration without which they could not live together yet neither amalgamation nor assimilation be in question and the aristocracy of skin remain what it should be a lasting distinction accept on both side between race which be not design to mingle together i do not know that many marriage be contract between the whites and the negress of jamaica and i believe that the class of mulatto increase much more rapidly under slavery than with liberty look in this respect at what take place even now in the united state : as quadroon sell better than black mixture of white or almost white slave abound there and the unhappy woman who refuse to lend themselves to certain combination be often whip in punishment with liberty each race can at least remain by itself with it there can be coexistence without amalgamation both mingling and hostility can be prevent this be the more easy inasmuch as the negro with the gentleness of they race willingly accept the second place and by no means demand what we insist on refuse they let they liberty be complete let legal equality and friendly relation be maintain and they will ask no more but they will ask no less and they be right i do not understand in truth why so harmless a co-existence should be so long repulse by the enlighten people of the united state there be negro in spanish america who have reach the highest grade of the army and who show as much intelligence decorum and dignity in command as white man could do i myself have see at paris a clergyman of ebony blackness who be really the most distinguished unexceptionable man that it be possible to meet he be a remarkable scholar and have receive the title of doctor from several european university in fact the negro be we fellow and we equal much more than we imagine they adapt themselves better than the indian to we civilization they seek to be instruct and not only do the free black of the english island hasten as we have see to provide themselves with teacher but even those of the united state crush as they be by contemptuous treatment neglect no means of introduce they child into the school where be find one-ninth of they total number in liberium they have show themselves hitherto very capable of ruling in haytus since they deliverance from the ridiculous and odious yoke of soulouque they have advance rapidly it be affirm in the way of true progress legal marriage increase popular instruction be become establish religious liberty be respect lastly in the negro colony of buxton in canada the fugitive slave have become industrious landholder and be respect by all let we not say that prejudice of skin be indestructible the suppression of slavery may modify it profoundly what degrade the free negro to-day be the existence of the negro slave to be respectable we all need to be respect the poor free negro be ashamed of himself he dare not aspire to any thing noble and great he preserve besides as the legacy of slavery the idea that labor be dishonor that idleness be a sign of independence this be enough to make he remain a stranger to honorable occupation and confine himself to the practice of vile trade when slavery shall have disappear the situation of the free black will become quite different : they will be numerous they will have a appreciable share in the regulation of national affair they vote will count and thenceforth we may be tranquil no one will be afraid to treat they with respect and perhaps to pay court to they the law of new york as well as the supreme court of that state have already admit that color exercise no influence over the rights of citizen the time draw near when the north will no longer contest the intervention of free negro at the ballot-box this will be a great step in advance let we remark moreover that after general emancipation the black population while exercise its share of influence will never be able through the number of suffrage at its disposal to alarm the jealous susceptibility of the whites the latter in fact will be continually recruit by european immigration and the day will come when the few negro of the united state will be scarcely perceptible in the heart of a gigantic nation the honor of the north be at stake it belong to it to give a example at this time and to show by the reform of its own habit that it have the right to combat the crime of the south it must set to work seriously resolutely to resolve the problem of the coexistence of race while the south resolve willing or unwilling the problem of emancipation liberty in the south equality in the north the one be no less necessary than the other it may even be say that one great obstacle to the idea of emancipation be this other idea that black and whites can not live together but that one must some day exterminate the other why suffer the establishment of this lie axiom which check all progress why not cast we eye on the neighbor colony where the prejudice of color reign supremely before emancipation and where it have since become rapidly efface the united state have a lofty end to attain let they beware how they take too low a aim they will not have more than they need with the effort of all the charity of all the sacrifice of all the earnest endeavor by which all can elevate themselves above vulgar prejudice to accomplish a task at once the most difficult and most glorious that have ever be propose to a great people the north i repeat be bind to give a noble example by obtain a shine victory over itself let it say to itself that coexistence be not amalgamation the question be not to marry negro but to treat they with justice the fear of amalgamation once vanish many thing will change in appearance why in fact be the prejudice of race stronger in the free state than in the slave state because the latter know that slavery be a sufficient line of demarcation and because they have not to dread amalgamation now this be and will be nowhere to be dread the instinct of both race will prevent such mingling and the black be as anxious to remain separate from the whites as the whites be to avoid alliance with the black as i have say nothing but slavery and the perverse habit that it engender could have succeed in some sort in break down this barrier if the class of mullatto thus form rule in some republic of south america it proceed from the absence of a numerous and powerful white race like that which be cover the united state with its continually increase population decidedly fear of amalgamation be puerile in such a country and decidedly also any other solution than the coexistence of race would be wrong doubtless a natural concentration of the emancipate negro will be some day effect they will flock to those state where they relative number will ensure to they the most influence perhaps we may even obtain a glimpse of the time when by the result of a providential compensation the country which have be the witness of they suffering and which they have water with they tear these country where they better than any other can devote themselves to labor will belong to they in great part be the antille and the region of the gulf of mexico destine to become the refuge and almost the empire of african tear from they own continent it be possible but not certain in any case this geographical repartition of the race would be work peaceably the effort to effect it by violent measure would justly arouse the conscience of the human race so long as we talk of transport the black to africa to st domingo or elsewhere so long as the peaceable coexistence of the race be not accept the barbarous proceedings which dishonor america will not cease the northern state will maltreat they free negro and the south will cling to slavery as to the only means of prevent a struggle for extermination at the north as well as the south man need to accustom themselves in fine to the idea of coexistence yes there will be whites and free black in various part of the union yes it be certain that in some part the black population will be possess of influence it may even happen that in one or two point of the extreme south it will come to rule if this hypothesis improbable in my opinion should ever be realize it would not be a cause of shame but of glory to the union it be say that the great indian tribe of the southwest think of form a state which will demand admission into the union and which have a chance to obtain it why should there not be at need a negro state by the side of a indian state this reparation would be fully due to the oppressed race and america would be honor in tread she repugnance under foot and in show to the whole world that she so much vaunted liberty be not a vain word she would show at the same time that she christian faith be not a vain formality if the desire of avoid amalgamation have legitimate grounds the antipathy of race be simply abominable word can not be find severe enough to censure the conduct of those _ christian _ who pursue with they indignation the slavery of the south refuse to fulfil the simplest duty of kindness or even of common equity towards the free negro of the north but i hope that the gospel accustom to work miracle will also work this let we be just we have already see the pious lady of philadelphium lavish they care on black and white without distinction at the time of the cholera invasion they wash and dress with they own hand in the hospital which they have found the child render orphan by the scourge without take account of the difference of color this be a sign of progress and i could cite several other i could name city chicago for instance where the school be open by law to the black as well as the whites there be a power in the united state which will overthrow the obstacle of the north as well as that of the south which will abolish both slavery and prejudice of skin this power have show in the antille what it can do there pastor and missionary school work of charity pursue in common have place on a level the black and the whites devote to the same cause and ransom by the same savior in the united state likewise the christian faith will raise up the one and will teach the other to humble themselves it will destroy the vice of the negro and will break the detestable pride of the anglo-saxon the real influence of faith on both -- this be the true solution this be the true bond of the race through this will be establish relation of mutual love and respect what a mission be reserve for the church of the united state check hitherto by enormous difficulty which it would be unjust not to take into account they have not act the part in the recent struggle against slavery which revert to they of right they have do a great deal whatever may be say they be dispose to do still more and they attitude have improve visibly within a year but this can not suffice there be two problem to resolve instead of one the question be now to approach both face to face true equality be found under the eye of god through the community of hope and of repentance through close association in worship in prayer in action and this equality have nothing in common with the jealous spirit of levelling which suffer old grievance to subsist and continually invent new it be peaceable forgetful of evil confide truly fraternal i do not dream of course of the universal conversion of the population of the united state both black and white i know only that the gospel though it deeply penetrate comparatively few heart extend its influence much further and act on those that it have not win let the christian of america set to work let they reject for it be time the scandal still present here and there by they apologist for slavery let they forbear to spare that which be culpable to call good evil or evil good and they will render to they country a service which they alone can render it and to which nothing on earth can be compare the united state do not know how great will be the transformation of they internal condition and the increase of they good renown abroad when they church they school they public vehicle they ballot-box shall be widely accessible to person of color when equality and liberty shall have become reality on they soil they do not know how great will be they peace and they prosperity let the two inseparable problem of slavery and the coexistence of race be resolve among they under the ruling influence of the gospel and they will witness the birth of a future far better than the past no more fear no more rivalry no more separation in perspective they conquest will become accomplished of themselves and no longer destine to swell the domain of servitude they will win the applause of the entire world and all this will not be purchase as man seem to believe by the sacrifice of the cotton culture at the present time this culture incur but one serious risk : the momentary triumph of a party that dream of a slavery propaganda it will be save alone by the progress of liberty on the day when emancipation shall be achieve if work by the action of moral agent and social necessity instead of by that of civil war and insurrection the cultivation of cotton in the southern state will receive the impetus to a magnificent development the emancipate negro make large quantity of sugar in the antille why should they not make cotton on firm ground if affranchisement produce the destruction of plant in st domingo we know now the reason it be a proved fact that negro who do not owe they liberty to insurrection remain disposed to devote themselves to labor in the field with slavery observe disappear one after the other the obstacle in the way of agricultural progress the capital which no one dare risk to-day in the southern state will flow into they emulously as soon as slavery shall be abolish i say more : as soon as its progressive abolition shall be no longer doubtful in the sight of all european immigration the current of which turn aside with so much circumspection avoid a territory accursed and give over to calamity will flock towards those country more beautiful more fertile and broader than those of the far west machinery will come to more than fill up the void cause by the pass diminution of the number of laborer the slave can be intrust with none but the simplest implement : every one know that the plough introduce originally into we french colony disappear to make room for the hoe as soon as colbert have authorize the slave trade plough have reappear there since emancipation they agricultural and industrial progress date from the same epoch : to-day we colonist understand the use of manure and make improvement in manufacture a new era be dawn in fine what will it be in the united state among that people which seem destine to surpass all other in the application of mechanic to agriculture still i have make one concession too much in admit the diminution of the number of laborer suppose that a few negro quit the field many whites will come to take they place white labor be fully possible in the majority of the slave state and immigrant from europe will not hesitate to engage in it wherever slavery reign it be that and not the climate that must be arraign if the whites fold they hand labor have become there a servile act -- it be blighted as it be in its essence a competent writer say the other day : if algerium have be subject to the sway of slavery cultivation there would have be repute impracticable for the french and example of mortality would not have be want the whites have labor in the antille the whites can labor not only in all the slave state of the intermediate region but in louisiana cotton be already produce in texa thanks to its german settler the question be only to go on in this way slavery once abolish the small proprietor who at present carry all the criminal extravagancy of the south further than any other will be compel to set they hand to work this will be a advantage both to the country and themselves who will not pray for the come of the time when so considerable a part of the population will cease to possess slave which it be incapable of feed when it will be transform into the middle class and thus escape the real servitude which embitter it moreover let we not forget new culture that of the vine among other which be fit to become introduce into these new country or to develop there and which lack nothing but liberty in order to flourish the art and manufacture also have they place independently of the tiller of the soil properly call the southern state will have need of workman in manufactory and of manager of agricultural machine large plantation will often become divide as have happen in the antille and we shall witness the appearance of the small estate that essential basis of social order there will be employment for all and the rich southern culture will be less neglect than before whoever have descend the ohio have involuntarily compare its two bank : here the state of ohio whose prosperity advance with rapid stride there the state of kentucky no less favor by nature yet which languish as if abandon why because slavery blight all that it touch could not the whites of kentucky and virginium labor as well as those of ohio the comparative poverty of these slave state remind I of the destitution of we colony and those of england before emancipation : mortgage estate plantation burden with expense the complete destruction of credit -- such be they position we must read american statistics to form a idea of the truly unheard-of extent of this fact -- impoverishment by slavery with a larger extent and much richer land the slave state possess neither agricultural growth nor industrial growth nor advance of population which can be compare far or near with that which be find in the free state a book by mr hinton rowan helper _ the impending crisis of the south _ express these difference in figure so significant that it be impossible to contest they the southern state therefore be certain to increase they culture and to find they lasting prosperity by enter the path that lead to emancipation but if they take the contrary road they will hasten to they destruction and with strange rapidity already they violent act of secession and the monstrous plan which be necessarily attach to they have have the first effect easily foresee of deal a most dangerous blow to american cotton in a few week they have do themselves more harm than the north suppose its hostility as great as it be little could have do they in twenty year the meeting of manchester have reply to the manifesto of charleston england have say to herself that from man so determine to destroy themselves she should count on nothing and have take she resolution she will proceed with it speedily let the southern state take care english indium can produce as much cotton as america before long if the carolinian persist they will have obtain the glorious result of despoil they country of its chief resource they will have kill the hen that lay the golden egg the matter be serious i ask they to reflect on it as england under pain of fall into want and riot can not dispense with cotton for a single day she will act energetically cotton grow marvellously in many country in the antille where it have be produce already in algerium where the plantation be about to be increase on the whole continent of africa in fine where it enter perhaps into the plan of god thus to make a breach in indigenous slavery by the fault commit by slaveholder in america chapter x the present crisis will regenerate the institution of the united state it remain for I to inquire what influence the present crisis may exert on the institution of the united state it be at the expense of these institution that the slave state inferior in strength in number in progress of every kind would reëstablish they fatal and grow preponderance here again therefore my thesis subsist : the victory of the south have compromise every thing the resistance of the north be about to save every thing the election of mr lincoln be a painful but salutary crisis it be the first effort of a great people rise the party of slavery have introduce into the heart of american democracy a permanent cause of debasement and corruption in this respect also it be lead the confederation to its death by the most direct and speedy way i wish to show how it develop the worst side of the democratic system i hope to be impartial towards this system although persuade that the government of which england offer we the model be better suit to guaranty public liberty and to second true progress in every thing i be not of those who place the shadow before the substance and who condemn democracy without appeal be we destine some day to pass into its hand have we already begin to glide down the descent that lead to it it be possible in any case it would be unjust to hate america on account of it as be too often do america have have no choice in virtue of its origin and its history it could be nothing else than a democracy if it have the fault of democracy the unamiable rudeness the violent proceedings the levelling passion i be scarcely surprise at it i ask myself rather if it have know how to find a basis of support against the temptation of such a system if it have prevent the subjugation of individual by the mass the absorption of conscience by the state the substitution of the sovereignty of the end for that of the people these be the shoal of democracy have they be shun by the united state have they be able to avoid transform it either into tyranny or socialism we shall see that if it have not succumb to the temptation this have not be the fault of the party of slavery thanks to it the corruption of democratic institution be rapidly advance a single adversary constantly the same have combate the progress of this work of destruction we shall encounter again upon the ground of political institution the fundamental antagonism of the gospel and slavery i say first that it be rarely that name be altogether fortuitous and do not correspond to thing it have often give rise to astonishment that the party of slavery should have take the name of the democratic party notwithstanding nothing be more natural how could slavery have be defend if not by exaggerate democracy it be necessary in such a cause to deny the notion of right of truth and of justice it be necessary that the greater number should become right truth and justice something more even be need the _ sovereignty of the end _ must yield if necessary before the sovereignty of number a cause like that of slavery be only defend in the heart of a democratic nation by teach it contempt of scruple and the stifle of the conscience every thing be allowable every thing be good provide that we succeed in we end this be the rule which it design shall prevail in political contest a single question see nothing but itself determine to spare nothing offering itself to party whoever they may be who seek a change create factitious majority to effect the end of base ambition take account neither of honor nor country and attain its end through every thing -- this be enough to vitiate profoundly institution and moral the sovereignty of the idea when it have lay hand on the sovereignty of the people be in a position to go to great length and to sink very low moral maxim and write law be trodden under foot a struggle without pity or remorse begin a struggle of life and death social passion easily acquire a degree of perversity which political passion do not possess the former be without conscience and without compassion they will be satisfied cost what it may triumph be in they eye a absolute a inexorable necessity rather than not conquer they will rend the country what the regular working of institution become under such a pressure every one can divine for some year past in proportion as the pretension of the slavery party have increase we have see public moral become taint in the united state indifference to means have make alarming progress and have be feel even in the habit of commerce and the relation of private life the spirit of enterprise have come to be exalt even in its most dishonorable act respect for bankrupt seem almost to be propagate it be a fact that man like mr jefferson davi the present president of the revolt south be not afraid to recommend the repudiation of debt in the school of slavery a disembarrassed and unscrupulous manner of act have give its stamp to the general manner of the nation affair be go on rapidly the liberty of america be on the high road to ruin it be time that the reaction of liberal and honorable sentiment should make itself feel the election of 1860 mark the stopping-place i wonder that they could have stop such a fact demand a explanation for ordinarily the declivity of democratic decline be never remount the natural tendency there be to deny the right of the minority -lrb- the most precious of all -rrb- to sink the man entire in the ballot to lay violent hand on the private portion of he life and to force even he conscience into the social contract it follow that government arise in which the question of limitation become efface by the question of origin in the face of such a power nothing be leave stand no more rights no more principle no more of those solid and resist block which serve to stem the popular current the province of the state become indefinite and how much more irresistible and more perverse be this tendency when a profound cause of corruption such as slavery add its action to the strength of such democracy it be no longer in such case the sovereign majority alone before which the right may be force to bow it be a party determine to attain its end which penetrate with violence into that domain of conscience where human law should not enter a party which set about regulate sometimes the belief sometimes the thought sometimes the speech such have be the influence exercise in the united state by the institution of slavery it have forbid author to write clergyman to preach and almost individual to think any thing that displeased it it have invent the right of secession in order to have at its disposal a formidable means of intimidation and to place a threat behind each of its demand to yield to descend to descend still further to obey a continued impulse of democratic debasement such be the course to which it have impel the whole confederation notwithstanding the united state have resist i shall tell why i shall show by virtue of what marvellous force american have escape the absolute levelling which seem destine to be produce by a complicated democracy of slavery but i wish first to finish depict the natural effect of such a system suppose for a moment a nation -lrb- and such be not want -rrb- model after the antique the pagan principle reign there supremely the state absorb every thing soul be band together and govern a centralized power a visible providence be substitute for individual action creed have essentially the hereditary and national form each one believe what the rest believe each one do what the rest do each one hold the opinion which be find in the ancient tradition of the country truth be no longer a personal conviction acquire at the price of earnest struggle and worth much because it have cost much it descend to the rank of custom to which it be fitting to conform it have its marked place among social obligation and form part of the duty of the citizen let democracy come to establish its empire in the heart of such a nation and you will see with what rapidity every thing will disappear that bear the slightest resemblance to individual independence the more effectual the level the greater will seem the community and the smaller the individual the more too in face of the privilege of the whole will the very idea of personal rights become efface the majority be hold infallible and the minority appear criminal if it take the liberty of refuse to subject its thought -lrb- yes its very thought -rrb- to that of the majority in this innumerable host of like being no one be authorize to possess any thing in private of all aristocracy that of the conscience appear then least endurable man believe in the majority in the mass in the nation we have no idea of the intellectual despotism of a democracy which fail to encounter on its road the obstacle of personal conviction it dispose of the human soul it create a unlimited confidence in the judgment of public opinion it head a school of popular courtier and teach each one the art of set he watch by the clock of the market-place intelligence conscience conviction -- all bend and what do not bend be break this happen above all we repeat without weary when a detestable cause like that of slavery pervert the working of democratic institution then the tyranny of the majority have no bound the majority themselves be form by means of ignoble contract and monstrous alliance in the midst of lower passion let loose through band party imperative mandate and factitious organization which no longer leave the smallest outlet for the flight of the least independent wish the perversity of corrupt and mislead democracy have full scope in write these page have i describe american democracy yes and no yes for such be really the temptation to which america have be expose such be really the vice with which it might have often be reproach no for a principle of resistance have always reveal itself in the darkest moment a irrepressible something have always remain in vain the heavy roller have pass and repass over the ground it have always encounter block of granite that would not be break this be the point which i have at heart to signal out in close this study know that it form its most essential part and that whoever have not give it he attention can not comprehend the united state the extraordinary fact much more extraordinary than be suppose that under the system of democracy rule by slavery man have be able to pause and retrace they step be only explain by the peculiar form which religious belief have put on in the united state we have not before we eye a latin nation a nation clothe in the vestment of greece or rome a nation have accord to the ancient mode its religion and its usage universally but indolently admit this republic of the new world be by no means one of those slave republic of ancient time in which the citizen take delight in converse on public affair but in which no one have the bad taste to question he conscience with respect to the public creed the pagan life with its obligatory worship its common education its suppression of the family and the individual in behalf of the state its existence transport to the forum the pagan life in which the citizen absorb the individual and in which the calm and serene uniformity of indifferent century end by give to each one the national physiognomy bear no resemblance to the moral and social life of the united state among they not the smallest trace be find of that system which seek to make nation and which forget to make man they be bear as we may say of a protestation of the human conscience a noble origin which explain many thing it be in fact the revindication of religious independence against religious uniformity and the established church which create it two hundred year ago of course i have not to examine here the intrinsic value of the puritan doctrine i content myself with affirm that they land in america in the name of liberty that they be destine to establish liberty there that they be destine to build there the true rampart against democratic tyranny from the first day the state be deprive of the direction of the intellectual and moral man despite that inevitable mixture of inconsistency and hesitation which mark we first effort in all thing the puritan colony destine one day to become the united state set out on the road which lead to liberty of belief of thought of speech of the press of assemblage of instruction the most considerable most important rights be abstract at the outset from the domain of democratic deliberation insuperable bound be set to the sovereignty of number the right of minority that of the individual the right of remain alone against all other the right of be of one 's own opinion be reserve furthermore they do not delay to break the bond between the church and the state entirely in such a manner as to deprive the official superintendence of belief of its last pretext self-government be found that be the most formal negation of subjugation by the democracy while the latter tend to the maximum of government the american government tend to the minimum of government that form _ par excellence _ of liberalism and it do not tend thither as in the middle age by anarchy by the absence of national tie and moreover by despoil the individual of he rights of conscience and think confiscate then more entirely for the benefit of a sovereign church than they have be since for the benefit of the state no american individualism proceed differently : if it restrain with salutary vigor the province of government it be to enlarge that of the human soul this be a great conquest the whole future of the modern world be contain in it destine as we be to submit in a measure at least to the action of democracy the question whether we shall he slave or free man be resolve in this : shall we after the example of america have we reserved tribunal we closed domain in which the public power shall be permit to see nothing shall there be thing among we -lrb- the most important of all -rrb- which shall not be put to the vote shall we democracy have its boundary and beyond these boundary shall a vast country be see to extend -- that of free belief of free worship of free thought of the free home it be because american democracy have boundary that its worst excess have finally find chastisement it be not install alone in the united state opposite it another power which know no fear be occupy with resist it the entire history of america be explain by this double fact : the fall and the rise again the servitude and the liberty the too long triumph of the slavery party and the recent victory of mr lincoln the deadly peril so lately incur and the noble future that open to-day individualism be not isolation individual conviction be not sectarian conviction they find on the contrary the most powerful of the unity moral unity the thing which most actively dissolve society while seem to unite they be the uniformity of national dogma which accept as a inheritance remain without action over the heart what be in fact the great bond on earth if not duty and affection now nothing but personal conviction earnestly acquire by the sweat of we brow can destroy selfishness in we without this strong cement of conviction at once individual and common you will build nothing that will endure the united state have in they heart strong conviction which be also common conviction through external diversity we have see that fundamental conformity be real and all earnest appeal to christian truth agitate this country so divide in appearance from one end to the other national life be here a reality i do not think that socialism which excuse we from believe ourselves which place we soul under responsible administration and preserve we it be say from the baleful disruption engender by individualism succeed as well in destroy selfishness and in diffuse idea of devotion and duty when democracy become socialistic -lrb- and it never have be able to become so in the united state -rrb- it grind down and reduce soul to such a degree that nothing be leave but a fine dust a sort of intellectual and moral powder which it be true be a obstacle to nothing but which create nothing either to build a edifice stone be need sand will not suffice christian individualism make the stone and the democratic party have just perceive it in a country where independence of soul have acclimate independence in all its form man may indeed bow the head sometimes to democracy ally to slavery but this debasement have a limit and the time be come when they will raise they head strong belief be a strong rampart the slave of truth be free man and true independence begin in the heart to have conviction in order to have character to have believer in order to have citizen to have energetic mind in order to have powerful nation to have resistance in order to have support -- such be the program of individualism show I a country where man be proud enough not to bow before the majority where they do not think themselves lose when they depart from the beaten track and jostle of receive opinion and i will admit that there it will be possible to practice democracy without fall into servitude there be but one country of individual belief that could attempt the alliance hitherto deem impossible of democracy and liberty the theory in accordance with which the public liberty of england have the aristocracy for they essential basis be admit as a axiom without contemn this element of social organization it be advisable to mine deeper than this to discover the true foundation of liberty individual belief -- this be the foundation the more we reflect the more we discover that the essential thing be not the form of government or even the relation of the different class but the moral state of the community be man there have soul become master of themselves be character form have the force of resistance appear whoever shall have reply to these question will have decide knowingly or unknowingly whether liberty be possible i do not know that any people should be exclude from liberty only all be bind to pursue it by the path that lead to it by earnestness of conviction by internal affranchisement which signify by the gospel we may seek in vain we shall find no means comparable to this -lrb- i speak in the political point of view -rrb- when the question be to make citizen to place one 's self under the absolute authority of god and he word be to acquire in the face of mere party majority general opinion a independence that nothing can supply the independence within be always translate without he who be independent of man in the domain of belief and of thought will be equally so in the domain of public affair thus democracy itself will not degenerate into socialism no one have be able to point out the slightest symptom of socialism in the united state notwithstanding democracy be fully complete there and the election of mr lincoln once drover once flatboatman once rail-splitter once clerk -- of mr lincoln the son of he work who have succeed by he own power in become a well-informed man and a orator this election prove certainly that american equality be not menace by the success of the republican party it menace only the evil democracy which under the guidance of the slavery party seek to force the nation into the path of socialism but it will not succeed in this the question have just be decide between these two system which be to contend for contemporaneous community between socialism and individualism the choice of the united state be make before witness the affranchisement of the slave we shall therefore witness the affranchisement of american politics they have endure a shameful yoke and receive sad lesson since jefferson the bear enemy of true liberalism found the democratic party the united state have continue to descend the declivity of radicalism a work of relentless levelling be thenceforth pursued and the domain of the conscience become gradually invade the democratic party find its fulcrum in the south the slave state force the enclosure of the private tribunal and confiscate in behalf of the state the inviolable rights of the individual : neither think the press nor the pulpit be free among they the fundamental maxim of puritan tradition be sacrifice by they one after the other they do more : thanks to they man be begin to learn in the free state how to set to work to pervert they own conscience and to substitute for it respect for sovereign majority every day cry iniquity be cover by the pretext : if we be just we should compromise the national unity or we should risk lose the vote secure to we party violence menace brutality and corruption be boldly introduce into political struggle man become habituate to evil : the most odious crime the southern law reduce to legal slavery every free negro who should not quit the soil of the state hardly raise a murmur of disapprobation the united state seem on the point of lose that faculty which nothing can survive -- the faculty of indignation behold in what school the democratic party have place the american people -- that noble people which despite the grave fault with which it may be reproach represent in the main many of the lofty principle which be ally to the future of modern community the reign of the democratic party would form the subject of a inglorious history in it we should see figure the glorification of servitude piracy apply to international right and in conclusion those fact of corruption and waste which serve to crown its last presidency the most consistent champion of the doctrine and practice of the democratic party be those man who have just declare that vote be valid only on condition of give the majority to slavery and that a regular election be a sufficient cause for separation conclusion i have not seek to recount event but to attempt a study which i believe to be useful to we and which may also not be useless to the united state we owe they the support of we sympathy it be more important than people imagine to let they hear word of encouragement from we at this decisive moment let we not hasten to declare that the union be destroy that henceforth and forever there will be two confederacy exist on the same footing that the united state of slavery will have they great _ rôle _ to perform here below like the united state of liberty this would be in any case immense exaggeration let we not forget that the union have often before seem lose that the confederation have often before seem ready to perish be the man who be terrify at the present peril ignorant of those which surround the cradle of the united state : mutinous troops contend ambition threat of separation anarchy ruin this america then so weak be the same that have since become so strong in spite of its own fault at the moment when it rebel against england it have neither art and manufacture nor commerce nor marine and its two or three million of inhabitant be far from agree among themselves yet such be the vigor of its genius such be its carelessness of every kind of danger such be the impetuosity with which it affront and surmount obstacle such be the power of its national motto go ahead that through internal struggle crisis and momentary exhaustion it have attain the stature of a great people count the steamboat on its river estimate the tonnage of its vessel compute the amount of its internal trade measure the length of its canal and railroad and you will still have but a faint idea of what it be capable of undertaking and accomplish we must remember these thing and not imitate those enemy of america who sometimes feign to put on mourning for she sometimes jest at she distress and find in the present situation of the _ disunited state _ -lrb- for thus they style they -rrb- a agreeable subject for pleasantry forget that this disunion have a serious cause which be certainly of importance enough to make itself understand forget too that generous struggle for humanity and the country be worthy to obtain we fullest respect and let we beware how we say that this crisis do not concern we -- that we can do nothing in it the selfish isolation of nation be henceforth impossible the question to be decide here involve we own affair not only because a portion of we fortune be pledge to the united state but above all because we principle and we liberty be concern the victory of justice wherever they may be win be the victory of the human race we can aid this one in some measure america which affect sometimes to declare itself indifferent to we opinion gather they up however with jealous care i have see respectable american blush at encounter that instinctive blame which among we be address to the progress of slavery they suffer at see they country thus fall from the esteem which it formerly enjoy proud nation like america always avenge themselves by noble impulse for the reprobation which they be conscious of have deserve the moral intervention of europe be not therefore superfluous it be the less so in that the south insult we by count on we the ringleader of charleston and new orlean affect to say that england be ready to open she arm to they and that france promise a sympathize reception to she envoy these envoy themselves have be select with care honorable have friend among we -- capable in a word of present the cause of slavery in a almost seductive light it be important therefore that we should not keep silence let government be reserve let they avoid every thing that would resemble direct action in the internal affair of the united state let they have recourse to the commonplace of speech employ by diplomacy to escape pledge they policy -- this be well but to imagine that these commonplace promise alliance or protection be to be credulous indeed a rebellion under cover of the flag of slavery be sure will find it difficult to make partisan among we french whatever may be we indolent indifference in other respects in this matter a indifference so great that at the present time the american question _ do not exist _ to the most of we moreover we shall shake off this inertia and as to the english they will not suffer they brightest title to glory in modern time to be tarnish by any latent complicity with the gulf state the brutal doctrine of interest so often profess publicly in parliament by mr bright may indeed find organ and great britain will be counsel to remember cotton and forget justice the measure already take by she at washington and which appear to have be support by france a measure design to declare that the blockade of the southern port must be effectual to be recognize be perhaps a concession wrest from she by this detestable school of selfishness happily there be another school face to face with this the christian sentiment the sentiment of abolition will arise and enforce obedience never be a more important work in store for it to unveil every suspicious act of the british government to keep public opinion arouse to maintain in fine that noble moral agitation which make the success of good cause and the safety of free nation such be the mission proffer in england to the defender of humanity and the gospel if they could forget it the populace of mobile or savannah pursue english consul would remind they to what principle the name of great britain be inevitably pledge for the sake of its honor france and england i be confident will act in unison here as elsewhere they alliance which comprise within itself the germ of all true progress will be find as useful and as fruitful in the new world as it have prove in the old this be of such importance that i beg leave to dwell on it evidently we influence have not yet be exercise as it should have be and if mr lincoln now bend somewhat before counsel devoid of energy and dignity it proceed in part from we reserve we silence we apparent neutrality -- who know even from the discouraging language that have be sometimes hold in we name the publication of the unlucky morrill tariff -lrb- sign we may say in pass by mr buchanan and the revocation of which i be convince will be sign some day by mr lincoln -rrb- have give the signal for political demonstration all of which be very far from be to the credit of europe we _ moniteur _ have publish article to be regret but it be above all among the english that the cotton party have have full scope let england beware it be better for she to lose malta corfu and gibraltar than the glorious position which she struggle against slavery and the slave trade have secure she in the esteem of nation even in we age of armed frigate and rifle cannon the chief of all power thank god be moral power woe to the nation that disregard it and consent to immolate its principle to its interest from the beginning of the present conflict the enemy of england and they be numerous have predict that the cause of cotton will weigh heavier in she scale than the cause of justice and liberty they be prepare to judge she by she conduct in the american crisis once more let she beware and under what pretext do we chaffer with the government of mr lincoln for those energetic persevere sympathy on which it have a right to count let we examine we hear in the first place of the vigor of the south and the weakness of the north it be not the first time that a bad cause have show itself more ardent more daring less preoccupy by consequence than a good one good cause have scruple and every scruple be a obstacle i be assuredly as sorry as any one to see mr lincoln strike with a sort of paralysis to my mind the danger of inactivity be considerable i believe that it discourage friend and encourage adversary i believe that it sanction more or less the baleful and erroneous principle of secession a principle more contagious than any other i believe in fine that by postpone civil war it probably risk increase its gravity nevertheless shall we not take into account the exceptional difficulty with which mr lincoln be surround the precede administration take care to leave no resource in he hand : he find the fort either surrender or indefensible the arsenal invade the army scatter the navy despatch to distant part of the sea be it strange that he should have yield in some degree to the entreaty of so many able man all urge in the same direction if to-morrow he should yield entirely if he should recognize the southern confederacy would it be great cause for astonishment let we not forget moreover that the border state be at hand form a rampart as it be to protect the extreme south several of these state i be convinced incline sincerely towards the north and will remain unite with it but be there not other virginium for instance which perhaps only refrain from secede for the better protection of those that have do so and whose present rôle consist in prevent all repression while its future rôle will be to trammel all progress by the continue threat of join the southern confederacy these be serious obstacle yet i have not point out the most serious of all -- the intense and sincere repugnance which many northern people though declare adversary of slavery experience towards measure that be calculate to provoke slave insurrection and endanger the safety of the planter i must acknowledge that the patience of the strong seem here rather more laudable than the so much vaunted audacity of the weak who count on this patience and know that they can be arrogant without much risk the second pretext that be audaciously bring forward to solicit we good will towards the south be that it have just ameliorate the federal institution let we ask in what consist this pretend amelioration the south have not fear to write in set term in its fundamental law what none before it ever dare write _ the constitutional guarantee of slavery _ slavery in accordance with the constitution of the south can neither be suppress nor assail slavery will be the holy ark to be regard with respect from afar off the corner-stone which all be forbid to touch by the side of this the south ostentatiously proclaim freedom of speech of the press of discussion in every form man shall be free to speak but on condition of not touch nearly or remotely on any subject connect with slavery -lrb- and every thing be connect with it in the south -rrb- they shall be free to print but on condition of give no write whatever to the public from which may be infer the unity of mankind the sanctity of family tie the great principle in fact which the patriarchal system throw overboard they shall be free to discuss but on condition of not disturb this institution impatient by nature and still more so in future now that it feel itself hem in and threaten on all side it will be by itself alone the whole constitution of the south this one article will devour the rest in default of legislature and court the southern populace know how to give force to the guarantee of slavery and to restrain freedom of speech of the press and of discussion it be true that adroit patron of the south carolinian rebellion have a third argument at they service which be no less specious all be over they exclaim there be nobody now to sustain there be no sympathy now to testify in four day peace will be make the new confederation will be recognize by lincoln in person a commercial treaty will even ally it to the united state : the affair be end the affair be scarcely begin we answer one must be blind not to see it what be end be only the first skirmish as to the war it will be as long believe I as the life of the two principle which be struggle in america let mr lincoln assure himself and let the european adversary of slavery remember as well that it will be necessary to combat and to persevere never be a more obstinate and more colossal strife commence on earth many of the border state will not be long in raise pretension to which they will join threat of new secession they will again bring up the question of the territory and will propose compromise who know they will aspire perhaps to establish in the interest of the extreme south the extradition of slave escape from the rival confederacy who know again they will perhaps attempt to restore they domestic slave trade with charleston and new orlean this be not all the time will come when the extreme south incapable of endure the life that it have just create for itself will demand to return to the bosom of the union it will then insist on dictate its condition it will propose the election of a general convention charge with reconstruct the constitution of the united state it will appeal to the selfishness of some and to the ambition or even the patriotism of other present to they sight the re-establishment of the common greatness which separation have compromise what a motive to veil principle for a moment what a temptation to return to the fatal path so lately forsake i know very well that it will be henceforth impossible to return to it completely nevertheless the vigilance of mr lincoln will not cease to be necessary and what will be no less necessary be the moral support which we be bind to lend he in the hour of success and in the hour of discouragement in good and in bad reputation where do we find a more glorious cause than this despite the impure alloy which be mingle with it of course as with all glorious cause be it not fit to stir up generous heart already thanks to the defeat of the democratic party the united state that we once know those of the last ten year those that the south govern with its wand those whose institution be corrupt and debase by slavery those who number in the north as in the south so many fortune base openly on the slave traffic those who have see among they president a slave merchant carry on he speculation in public view -- these unite state have just end they career they have enter the domain of history they disappearance have be verify by the retreat of the extreme south the american people be now strive to rise enterprise as difficult as glorious whatever may be the issue of the first conflict it will be only the first conflict there will be many other the uprising of a great people be not the work of a day sometimes at peace sometimes perhaps at war with the state that take in hand the cause of slavery the american confederation will witness the development one after another of the consequence necessarily produce by that decisive event the election of mr lincoln have break with the past it will be force to enter further and further into the path of the future we have already see that whichever hypothesis be realize of those which we be permit to foresee the cause of slavery be destine to experience defeat after defeat it have cease to grow it be about to decrease to decrease by separation to decrease by union to decrease by peace to decrease by war as surely as there will be obstacle without number to surmount in order to accomplish this work so surely will this work be accomplish certainly it deserve to be love and sustain without discouragement and hesitation europe will comprehend it on see she attitude the angry champion of slavery will doubtless perceive that they be mistaken and that it be time to make new calculation as for the brave man of the north they will he glad to learn what be think of they on this side of the atlantic this may aid and greatly in the more or less distant re-establishment of the union if the gulf state know what insurmountable disgust will be arouse here by they confederacy found to secure the duration and prosperity of slavery if the border state know what sympathy they will gain by siding with liberty and what malediction they will incur by declare themselves for slavery if the northern state know what support be secure to they by that power the chief of all other public opinion we be justified in believe that the present crisis would come to a prompt and peaceful solution it be a fixed fact that the nineteenth century will see the end of slavery in all its form and woe to he who oppose the march of such a progress who be not deeply impressed by the thought that on the 4th of march at the very hour when mr lincoln in take possession of the presidency at washington signify to the attentive world the will of a great republic determine to arrest the conquest of slavery the generous head of a great empire signify to he minister he immutable resolve to prepare for the emancipation of the serf in such coincidence who do not recognize the finger of god i be therefore tranquil : russian opposition have fail american opposition will fail there will be american opposition there will be there be such already in the very surroundings and cabinet of the president we have just see how it seek to enervate he resolution to pledge he irrevocably to that waver policy more to be dread for he than the project of assassination about which right or wrong so much noise have be make nevertheless this evil have its bound mark out in advance he whom god guard be well guard if you wish to know what the presidency of mr lincoln will be in the end see in what manner and under what auspices it be inaugurate listen to the word that fall from the lip of the new president as he quit he native town : the task that devolve upon I be greater perhaps than that which have devolve on any other man since the day of washington i hope that you my friend will all pray that i may receive that assistance from on high without which i can not succeed but with which success be certain yes yes we will pray for you such be the response of the inhabitant of springfield who weep and with uncovered head witness the departure of they fellow-citizen what a _ debut _ for a government have there be many inauguration here below of such thrilling solemnity do uniform and plume the roar of cannon triumphal arch and vague appeal to providence equal these simple word : pray for I we will pray for you ah courage lincoln the friend of freedom and of america be with you courage you hold in you hand the destiny of a great principle and a great people courage you have to resist you friend and to face you foe it be the fate of all who seek to do good on earth courage you will have need of it to-morrow in a year to the end you will have need of it in peace and in war you will have need of it to avert the compromise in peace or war of that noble progress which it be you charge to accomplish more than in conquest of slavery courage you rôle as you have say may be inferior to no other not even to that of washington : to raise up the united state will not be less glorious than to have found they it be doubtless from a distance that we express these sympathy but there be thing which be judge better from a distance than near at hand europe be well situate to estimate the present crisis the opinion of france especially should have some weight with the united state : independently of we old alliance we be of all nation perhaps the most interested in the success of the confederation they be friendly voice which here and elsewhere in we review and we journal bear to it the cordial expression of we wish in wish the final triumph of the north we wish the salvation of the north and south they common greatness and they lasting prosperity but the south disquiet we we can not disguise it it be in bad hand a sort of terror reign there important but moderate man be force to bow the head or to feel that it will be necessary to do so ere long the planter must see already that in seek to put away what they call the yoke of the north they be prepare for themselves other master business be suspend money for cultivation be lack credit be everywhere refuse the ensue harvest be mortgage the loan which it be seek to issue find no taker outside the extreme south the resource of revolution remain and they will be use unsparingly what a position under the constitution vote scarcely a month ago we already hear the deep rumble of the quarrel of class of the planter and the poor whites of the aristocracy and the numerical majority of the prudent adversary of the slave trade and its headstrong partisan of the statesman who be tolerate for appearance and those who count on replace they of the present and the future people will some day see clearly even in charleston the separation which be to establish the prosperity of the south by permit it at last to live to its liking to obey its genius and to serve its interest have hitherto result in little save the singing of the _ marseillaise -lrb- the marseillaise of slavery -rrb- _ and the strike down of the federal color before the flag of the pelican and the rattlesnake a great many blue ribbon and colt 's revolver be sell and bust of calhoun the first theorist of secession axe carry about ostentatiously next to present a good mien to the eye of europe a constitution be vote in haste a government be form a army be decree but the revolutionary basis be remain and we perceive but too quickly how great disorder prevail in mind and thing at the present hour the democracy of the south be about to degenerate into demagogism and dictatorship but the north present quite a different spectacle mark what be pass there pierce beneath appearance beneath inevitable mistake beneath the no less inevitable wavering of a _ debut _ so well prepare for by the precede administration and you will find the firm resolution of a people uprising who speak of the end of the united state this end seem approach but lately in the hour of prosperity then honor be compromise esteem for the country be lowered institution be become corrupted apace the moment seem approach when the confederation taint by slavery could not but perish with it now every thing have change aspect the friend of america should take confidence for its greatness be inseparable thank god from the cause of justice _ justice can not do wrong _ i like to recall this maxim when i consider the present state of america in escape a sudden and shameful death it will not assuredly escape struggle and difficulty in return to life it will encounter battle and danger longer than it imagine life be compose of this to live be a laborious vocation and nation who wish to keep they place here below who wish to act and not to sleep must know that they will have they share of suffer perhaps it enter into the plan of god that the united state should endure for a time some diminution of they greatness let they be sure notwithstanding that they flag will be neither less respect nor less glorious if it shall thus lose a few of its star those which it lose will reappear on it some day and how many other meanwhile will come to increase the federal constellation with what acclamation will europe salute the future progress of the united state as soon as they progress shall have cease to be that of slavery at present the point in question be to liquidate a bad debt the moment of liquidation be always painful but when it be over credit revive so will it be in america she have often boast of the energetic sang-froid of she merchant when ruin they neither lament nor be discourage there be a fortune to make again in the same manner put thing at the worst suppose the present crisis to be comparable to ruin there be a nation to make again it will be re-made gentleman say mr seward lately in conclude he great speech in congress if this union be shatter to-day by the spirit of faction it would reconstruct itself to-morrow with the former majestic proportion a word of peace on the difference between england and the united state by count agénor de gasparin a word of peace \* \* \* \* \* between the meeting of liverpool and the ovation of new york be there not room for a word of peace a word of peace i know well must be a word of impartiality the speaker must resign himself to be treat as a american in england and as a englishman in america but what do this matter if truth make its way and if a obstacle the more be raise in the way of this horrible war this war contrary to nature which would begin by ensure the triumph of the champion of negro slavery and would end by expose the cause of free institution to more than one perilous hazard there be one fundamental rule to follow in question arise out of the right of search : to distrust first impression these be always very vivid a insult to the honor of the flag be always in question patriotic sensibility which i comprehend and which i respect be always bring into play it be impossible that these officer these stranger sailor who have give command and exact obedience who have stop the ship on its way who have set foot on the sacred deck where float the banner of the country who have interrogate who have search who have have recourse perhaps to graver measure -- it be impossible that they should not have call forth many sentiment of anger and indignation even when practice with the most rigid formality even when confine within the limit of the strictest legality the right of search can not fail to produce a feeling of annoyance the recent search of the _ jule et marie _ the yard of which be carry away and the barricading drive in seem to I the faithful type of all visit of search on the high sea -- every one of they bring damages in its train notwithstanding the right of search be dispute by no one and will be exercise in time of war until the moment when the american proposition reproduce again the other day by general scott shall be welcome by we old world i have just write the name of general scott and i do so with a feeling of pleasure whoever have read he letter must have say to himself with I that there exist in the united state a class of intelligent and moderate man -- patriot who have give proof of they capacity and be capable of examine dispassionately the demand of the english government these man know how much the maintenance of friendly relation with england be worth in the present position of america whatever opinion they may form on the question of right grow out of the action of captain wilke they comprehend that no consideration can weigh in the balance against the danger of bring about the recognition of the southern confederacy the breaking of the blockade war in short with a powerful and friendly nation a sister nation spring from the same blood speak the same language devote to the same mission of civilization and liberty no honorable sacrifice would cost they too dear in order to avert this fearful catastrophe would that they could see with they own eye be it but for a moment what be pass to-day in europe they enemy triumph and they friend be strike with consternation we who have always love america and who love she better now that she be suffer for a noble cause we who have defend she we who have never cease to believe in she final success despite mistake and repulse feel all we hope threaten at once the ground seem sink beneath we foot no we can not suppose that america in recklessness of heart will destroy with she own hand the fruit of so many effort and sacrifice this would not be patriotism it would not be dignity it would be a act of madness and suicide if the _ trent _ have violate the rule of neutrality it remain none the less certain that other rule have be violate by the _ san jacinto _ the duty of naval officer be limit to visit ship and stop they if need be to carry they before a prize court they can not exercise the office of judge in substitute the arrest of individual for the seizure of ship and a military act for a judicial decree captain wilke have give ground for the well-founded protest of england at the same time that he have leave the way open thank god for measure of reparation to be adopt by the united state i know very well that there would have be no less indignation at liverpool and london in case that the _ trent _ have be stop on she way and carry before american court perhaps indeed the regular and correct procedure would have be more deeply wounding than that of which england complain we may be permit to doubt with general scott that the injury would have be less have it be greater but this be not the practical question the only one that now concern we the point be to get out of embarrassment and the error commit by the commander of the _ san jacinto _ furnish a reasonable ground for consent to the liberation of the prisoner far from be a humiliation to the government at washington this act of wisdom would be one of its brightest title to glory it would prove that it be not want in moral power that man calumniate it in represent it as the slave of a bad democracy incapable of resist the clamor of the street and of accept for the safety of the country a hour of unpopularity let it believe we its true friend that in arrest messr mason and slidell it have do more for the cause of the south than general beauregard or price would have do by win two great victory on the potomac and in missourus messr mason and slidell be a hundred time more dangerous under the bolt of fort warren than in the street of pari or london what they diplomacy would not certainly have obtain for they in many month captain wilke have procure for they in a hour see what rejoicing be take place in the camp of the southern partisan they be begin to despair recognition that only chance of the defender of slavery seem farther off than ever the recent success of the federal army announce the commencement of a great change in affair the war be carry from the suburb of washington to the heart of south carolina itself the only resource of consequence remain be those that might spring up during the winter from the discontent of we industrial centre yet behold suddenly the state of affair transform recognition become possible the blockade be threaten the united state be in danger of be force to turn from the south to face a more redoubtable foe really what have mr jefferson davi do for you that you should render he such a service let we now turn to england and tell she also the truth so long as england shall not treat the affair of the _ trent _ on its own merit and with coolness so long as she shall give ear to those falsehood invent by passion which envenom question of this sort and exclude conciliatory measure and pacific hope she will labor actively to destroy all that she have gloriously build upon earth it be impossible to imagine the consequence fatal to every form of liberty which such a policy would comprise within itself it be at first suppose that captain wilke have act by virtue of instruction and that mr lincoln 's government have expressly order he to seize the southern commissioner on board the english vessel now it be find that captain wilke return from africa have no instruction of any sort he act to use he expression at he own risk and peril like a true yankee it be next suppose that mr lincoln 's government have conceive the ingenious project -lrb- such thing be gravely print and find man to believe they -rrb- of seek of itself a rupture with england it be in need of new enemy it hope by this mean to rally to itself its present adversary it be about to give over combate they and to seek compensation through the conquest of canada i have follow the progress of event in america as attentively as any one i have read the american newspaper i have receive letter i have study document among other the famous circular of mr seward i have see there more than one sign of discontent with the un-sympathizing attitude of england i have also see there the symptom of the somewhat natural fear which the intervention of europe in mexico excite in man attach to the monroe doctrine but as to these incredible plan i have never discover the slightest trace of they i add that a marked return towards friendly relation with england will be manifest the moment that the latter show herself more amicable towards america if there be any quality for which credit can not be refuse to the government of mr lincoln it be precisely that of moderation and good sense he have not take very high ground -- he have abstain far too much in my opinion from lay down those principle from utter those word which create sympathy and make the conscience of the human race vibrate in unison say that he be a little prosaic a little of the earth earthy do not say that he bluster and that the best thing that england can do be to attack he without wait to be first attack in order to support right or wrong a fable which have find but too ready belief another story be invent : the government of mr lincoln be at the end of its strength despair henceforth of conquer the south it wish at any price to procure a diversion those who hold such language have doubtless never hear either of the beaufort expedition or of the evacuation of missourus by the confederate troops or of the victory recently gain in kentucky they do not know that the united state have accomplish the prodigy of put half a million of man under arm that act of insubordination have nearly cease that volunteer for three year have everywhere replace the three month ' volunteer they do not know that the finances of the country be prosperous and that mr chase the secretary of the treasury have just negotiate under favorable condition the last part of he loan i recommend they to read the last letter of mr russell the correspondent of the _ time _ they will see there what a impartial witness think lately of the respective chance of the north and south yes before the intervention of the _ san jacinto _ -- that involuntary ally of the south to whom the inhabitant of charleston themselves ought to vote sword of honor -- before the _ san jacinto _ the situation of the united state present the most favorable aspect since that time i admit it have change let we see now whether english indignation have not give to the act of captain wilke greatly exaggerated proportion english indignation have omit one side of the affair i mean the conduct of the packet _ trent _ if by chance it should have violate the principle of neutrality this question would wear quite a different aspect this doubtless would not prevent the demand for reparation from be well found it would prevent the negotiation relate to it from assume a air of harshness which would suffice to render they success doubtful let we therefore examine the conduct of the _ trent _ some have think to justify it by observe that the vessel be go from america what do this matter neutral be bind to act as neutral when they be go from a place as well as when they be come towards it they might as easily take side with one of the belligerent by carry despatch for instance design to secure to it aid as by bring it other despatch announce that this aid be forthcoming other have base they argument on the fact that the _ trent _ have quit a neutral port to repair to a neutral port again a distinction which proclamation of neutrality have never admit and which no jurisprudence have endorse to my knowledge what do plain good sense tell we in fact that you departure from a neutral port and you destination to a neutral port do not hinder you in any way from serve the belligerent whose despatch you have receive especially if these despatch be on the way to solicit from a neutral country a alliance or supplies of munitions of war the rights of neutral demand to be preserve in my opinion and france be interested in it more than any other nation but these rights let we not fear to acknowledge have for they fundamental condition a _ real _ neutrality now you take it upon yourself knowingly and willingly to carry despatch destine for a country to which it be a notorious fact that one of the belligerent be look for its only serious chance of success these despatch be draw up it may be in this wise : let vessel load with arm and ammunition leave southampton or liverpool as quickly as possible and come to charleston where the cruiser be now few in number let expedition be combine in such a manner as to force the blockade we be in need of they arrival in order to push we army forward or else the despatch read : buy up the newspaper and work on public opinion in the manufacturing district let maritime power know that we will consent if necessary to cession of territory or protectorate that in any case we will grant they exceptional advantage if they protest against the blockade if they disquiet we enemy if they seek a quarrel with he and draw off he attention to fix it on a eventual struggle with europe at the first step of this kind we will attempt a offensive movement the least menace against the blockade be worth as much to we as the despatch of a army be it not to mock at people in the face of so new a position of a war in which one of the party though he do not fail to boast of he strength and he resource count in fact before every thing upon european support to propound fine theory in accordance with which the transportation of despatch send from a neutral port and destine for a neutral country would not be contrary to neutrality _ because these despatch could not increase the military advantage of either of the belligerent _ it have be seek to assimilate mail packet to vessel of war and consequently to except they from the exercise of the right of search the pretence be so ill-founded that it fall to the ground upon examination who do not feel that the presence of a lieutenant of the royal navy or the color of a uniform be not sufficient to constitute a vessel of war or a transport it be ask whether other packet which have carry minister send by the united state to europe have not also infringe the rule of neutrality it be possible but this do not concern we suppose that the mission of these minister in europe where they be regularly accredit like they predecessor to the different government and where they have no support no new act no violation of the blockade to demand may be assimilate to the mission of the southern delegate suppose that they letter of credit bear some analogy to the despatch intrust to messr mason and slidell it belong in any case to the southern cruiser to stop and search the packet in which they have take passage the powerlessness of one of the belligerent could not impose on the other the duty of abstain in like manner rest next on the diplomatic quality of the southern envoy it have be attempt to insinuate that they mission be purely a civil one not only do the diplomatic character not exist since it have have no recognition but the southern commissioner be expressly charge with procure to the army of slavery the most essential assistance which they could receive in view of military success and strategy they success by ensure the breaking of the blockade would alone have be worth more to they than the winning of several battle i say nothing moreover of the shipment of arm and ammunition which they would have doubtless organize in europe can it be that mail packet have the singular privilege of facilitate such operation without fail in the duty of neutrality if this be true it be worth while to have it understand and so long as it be not understand we must make some allowance for belligerent who do not consider it self-evident it be clear that when the exercise of the right of search be define by precedent and treaty mail packet do not exist perhaps it would be well to lay down special regulation concern they this agreement might be profitably negotiate at present between the united state and the maritime power of europe why should not the conflict which occupy we attention instead of end in war result in a useful negotiation i have no doubt that the noble overture the initiative of which have just be take by general scott would be approve by mr lincoln to enlarge the scope of the present question by cause a international progress a emancipation of the commerce of the world to grow out of it would be somewhat better it seem to I than to cut each other 's throat and to ensure the triumph in the middle of the nineteenth century of the most shameful revolt that have ever break out on earth -- a revolt in favor of slavery england and america these two great country be worthy of give to the world the spectacle of a generous and fruitful mutual understanding in which a deplorable disagreement shall be swallow up as it be and disappear who do not see that combine with the promulgation of a more liberal regulation of the right of search the satisfaction demand of the united state would assume a new character and would have many more chance of be accord it be the less difficult for the english to take this ground since the act of the _ san jacinto _ in which the design of offend england in particular might at first have be suspect appear to-day under a very different aspect in proportion as we learn all the exploit of this terrible vessel its impartiality become less dubious french danish and other vessel be visit by it within a few day it be certain that if the french instead of the english mail packet have be carry the commissioner and they papers the former would have be board by captain wilke he mode of procedure be rough and on this point apology ought to be make not indeed that england who have just sustain in prussium the famous macdonald negotiation be in a very good position to show herself difficult in point of courtesy nevertheless the error of great britain in germany do not excuse those of the united state on the ocean it appear that captain wilke fire shoot to enforce he first order to stop the remainder be in keep nevertheless to give every one he due it be just to remember that he offer to take on board the family of the commissioner and to give they he best cabin it be just also to add that after the arrest the intercourse between the officer of the _ san jacinto _ and the prisoner never cease to be full of decorum and courtesy let we now approach more closely the question of right it be well in the first place to rid ourselves of secondary question which hinder we from see it and above all from see it as it be they seem to have be afraid in england to look this question of right boldly in the face there be no subterfuge that they have not try in order to avoid its serious investigation have they not go so far as to object to the united state that consider the southern state as rebellious and refuse they the quality of belligerent they could not exercise the right of search which be reserve to belligerent from this point of view they add messr mason and slidell would simply be rebel take refuge under the english flag and what country would consent to give up political refugee the answer be simple : no country more than england have recognize in this instance the quality of belligerent which she partisan be seek to contest in she name moreover the southern blockade be admit by she and by the other power now blockade be as impossible as right of search apart from a state of war another subterfuge : the united state have always oppose the right of search -- it ill become they to exercise it england have always exercise the right of search it ill become she to oppose it let we be honest rights of this kind be always odious to those who submit to they and always dear to those who profit by they alas this be not the only instance in which a change in we position work a change in we mode of view thing let we take the human heart as it be and not demand under penalty of war that the american in the midst of one of the most terrible social crisis -lrb- and also of the most glorious -rrb- of which history make mention should hesitate to seize a weapon which be formerly use against they and which they feel the need of use in return in neglect to seize it they would fail perhaps in they duty to themselves and to the noble cause of which they be the representative there be finally a last and more simple manner of avoid a embarrassing examination : what be the use of examine precedent we hear on every side this be not a matter for legal adviser it appear to I however that it be something of the kind since great britain have begin by interrogate the lawyer of the crown and since she have make peace or war depend on the decision which they might render it would be too convenient truly to take exception to precedent make by one 's self and to say to those who act as he have not cease to do : i permit no one to imitate I what i practice in time past i authorize no one to practice to-day i have not apprise you of this but you ought to have divine it and for not have divine it you shall have war precedent keep then they full value what be they the enemy of america have cite one which have nothing to do here the letter write by king loui philippe to queen victorium to express he regret that a pilot under the protection of the british flag have be carry away by the expedition bind to mexico a very different thing be a abduction of this kind have nothing in common with the right of search or the maintenance of neutrality and the capture of the southern commissioner it be in the familiar history of the right of search that precedent must he seek and they abound there in quote some of they i impose on myself a double law : first i will not confound act of violence with precedent and from the abuse which the english make in time past of they maritime preponderance i will not conclude that every one be at liberty to do to-day as they have do secondly among the grave and weighty author who have make a special study of these question in the quiet of they retirement i will confine myself to consult none but english authority doubtless they will not think of challenge these in england chancellor kent write : if on make the search it be discover that the vessel be employ hi contraband trade that it transport the enemy 's property troops or _ despatch _ it may be rightfully seize and carry for adjudication before a prize court mr phillimore a english author and a authority on these question and one of the judge in the admiralty express himself thus : the carrying of official despatch write by official personage on the public affair of one of the belligerent _ impress a hostile character on those bear they _ sir william scott be no less precise : the transportation of two or three shipload of ammunition be necessarily a limited assistance _ but by despatch the whole plan of the campaign may be transmit in such a manner as to destroy all the plan of the other belligerent in that part of the world _ and he dwell at length on this idea insist on the incompatibility which exist between veritable neutrality and the bearing of despatch which be a act of the most prejudicial and hostile nature let we also cite mr jenkinson afterwards lord liverpool he establish in clear term the fundamental principle of the matter by put this question which plain good sense must answer : can it be lawful for you to extend this right -lrb- that of the free navigation of neutral vessel -rrb- in such a way as to injure I and to serve my enemy observe that the queen in she proclamation of neutrality have be careful not to omit the interdiction of the transport of despatch she therein declare that those who transport officer soldier _ despatch _ arm ammunition or any other article consider by law and modern usage as contraband of war for either of the contender will do it at he own risk and peril and will incur the high displeasure of she majesty nothing can be more explicit more consistent and at the same time more reasonable than these declaration sir william scott be right in say that in undertake to carry despatch person cease to be neutral and become enemy this be evident above all in the present conflict as the serious chance of success of the south be all in europe as it would not have revolt have it not count on europe as it would lay down its arm to-morrow if it be prove to it that never for cotton or any thing else would europe come to its aid it follow thenceforth that the despatch forward from the south to europe greatly surpass in military importance the send of soldier or supplies this be so what ought the commander of the packet _ trent _ to have do i do not impugn he intention he may have act very innocently but if this excuse of ignorance of the rule of the law be valid for he i think that it should also be so for captain wilke and that there would be little justice in treat with extreme rigor a first offence which evidently have take every one by surprise and have find nowhere a very complete understanding of the condition of the right of search the commander of the _ trent _ saw man come to he whose quality as southern commissioner challenge he attention he know what anxiety and trouble be pervade the north concern they mission and despatch the contents of which excited grave suspicion there have even be talk exaggerate doubtless of a proposition of a protectorate and other offer design to gain at any price the support of one or more maritime power the enthusiastic welcome which the people of havana enemy of the united state and ardent friend of slavery have just give to messr mason and slidell permit no doubt of the especial gravity of the hostile mandate with which they be charge then or never be the occasion to say that messenger and message of this nature must travel under they own flag and that neutral be bind not to facilitate they mission in any manner in circumstance so grave and with such a responsibility commander of packet could not take refuge behind they innocence or argue that the consul of the united state have not take pain to forewarn they i should like to know what reception a neutral would find in england who should take it into he head to say to she : i think myself at liberty to carry hostile despatch and those bear they because the english consul do not come to bind I to do nothing of the sort be it true as have be maintain that the fault be divide the message have be carry by one packet and the messenger by another this appear doubtful and matter little moreover in the eye of impartial judge the fact be that voluminous papers be seize on the _ trent _ at the same time with the rebel commissioner now and to have do with the question of right shall i say a few word of what it be permissible to call the hackneyed rhetoric and declamation of the subject man have talk of course of a insult to the flag they have call to mind that the deck of a english vessel be the same as the soil of the country they have invoke the rights of british hospitality and demand whether she could consent to see she guest take from she by force so many phrase for effect which unhappily never fail to arouse implacable passion but what be there behind these phrase the flag be not insult when the search be exercise in conformity with the law of nation it be in vain that the deck of a english merchant vessel be the soil of the country a belligerent be authorize to seize it if it be carry man employ in behalf of the enemy officer for example the rights of hospitality be bound by the duty of neutrality and the vessel which would claim to protect its guest at any price when its guest serve the war would simply be guilty of a culpable action in brief there be wrong on both side and if ever difference admit of discussion interpretation if necessary arbitration even it be certainly this be sure therefore that europe attentive to all that be pass and desirous of avert war will find it inexplicable if the question be put in insulting term of a nature to render hostility almost inevitable if in fine captain wilke have seize the vessel instead of seize the commissioner and if the vessel have be duly condemn by a american court the proceeding would have be irreproachably regular this be so by the acknowledgment of the english themselves who will be willing to admit that any will be find bold enough to cause a irretrievably fatal rupture to grow out of a quarrel of this kind concern the mode of procedure england have consult she legal adviser america will consult hers also do dispute in which the national honor be involve admit of consultation of this sort be lawyer or judge ever ask whether the country be insult or attack when it really be so let england assure herself that the first condition of the demand for reparation be that she shall make the reparation _ possible _ time be need patience be need -- patience which will not pause before the first difficulty and take as final the first refusal courtesy be need -- courtesy which in the stronger agree so well with dignity and avoid render the form of satisfaction unnecessarily wound and consequently almost inadmissible it be clear that if she contents herself with signify to washington a absolute demand if she give a single week if she exact -lrb- let we foresee the impossible -rrb- not only the setting at liberty of the commissioner themselves but they transportation on a american vessel charge to trail its repentant flag across the sea if she accept no more easy mode if she hearken to no mediation it be clear that mr lincoln will need superhuman courage to grant what she thus demand this superhuman courage i wish for he i ask of he in display it he will have deserve much of america and of humanity but i hope little for such marvel nor do i believe that it be fitting to exact miracle in serious affair the english be full of condescension and generosity towards america while she be strong if they should be so unfortunate as no longer to have condescension and generosity towards america when she be weak they would warrant supposition much more fatal to they honor than be the grave error -lrb- yet easily reparable with the good will of both party -rrb- just commit by captain wilke i have the right to hold this language to they for i be of the number of those who lore england and have prove it in my first parliamentary speech which be on occasion of this very right of search i expose myself to much animosity in defend she later in the pritchard affair i do not draw back even from the depths of my retreat it have rarely happen to I to take up my pen without render homage to a country and government which be not popular among we i have reason therefore to hope that my word will have some weight nothing be more antipathetic to I than a coarse and ignorant anglophobia but it be important for england to know all the phase of the debate in which she have enter it have a european phase this be not a discussion between two power a third the first of all public opinion must also have its say it wish peace and will not let it be sacrifice for a error easily repair and voluntarily exaggerate public opinion strongly repudiate the cause of the south which be that of slavery -lrb- the speech of mr stephen vice-president of the southern confederacy give proof of this -rrb- at the announcement of the heinous fact that england recognize the confederacy expressly found to maintain glorify and extend slavery public opinion believe I would give vent to a outburst of wrath which would cast the indignation meeting of liverpool wholly in the shade england have maintain she neutrality in the new world for the year past and she deserve well for this for angry instinct dictate to she another policy however if she have be neutral she have not be sympathize this vast social revolution which begin with the election of mr lincoln which have inscribe on its banner no extension of slavery and which thus enter in the way lead one day to emancipation this generous revolution which deserve to be encourage have meet with little in england but distrust and hostility upon other point while preserve she neutrality england know very well how to give she moral support to cause which she love -- the support of journal of parliamentary speech and of public meeting here there be nothing of the sort i know not what fatal misunderstanding have keep down the generous sentiment which should have make themselves feel from the begin the principal english journal especially those repute to express the view of lord palmerston have not cease to proclaim openly that the south be right in secede that the separation be without remedy that it be just and in conformity with the wish of england again and again have the recognition of the south be present as a act to be expect and for which we must be prepare from all this if care be not take the inference will be draw that in the excessive eagerness with which the affair of the _ trent _ have be seize upon in the peremptory term of the demand for redress in the form adopt in order to render the reparation difficult may be see the intention of reach the end which england propose of effect the recognition break the blockade obtain cotton and substitute a parcelled-out america for the too powerful republic of the united state liverpool have this time give the signal lancashire urge on the rupture behind the national honor there may be something else take care if this must not be think it must not be true and it will be true if you declare the question close at the very moment when it begin to attract public attention if you exact a reparation without admit a explanation if in short you reject in advance all idea of negotiation mediation or arbitration war instead of negotiation mediation or arbitration war at the first word for a question which have be submit to legal adviser and which offer facility assuredly for several equally sincere interpretation _ war at any price _ do not belong to we time what i say here other will make it they business to say on the other side of the channel there have be there will be liberal and christian voice there who will not fear to protest against the incitement of passion we have hear little yet except the bell of the manufactory other sound will soon make themselves hear the great party which in abolish slavery and combate the slave trade have win the chief title of honor in england -- this great party i think be not dead it be time for it to give sign of life as to america its friend be await its final resolution with a anxiety which i scarcely dare depict never be graver question place before a government the whole future be contain in it if she be sufficiently mistress of herself to grant what be ask and to admit a reparation even though it be excessive of the fault evidently commit in she name she will have the approbation and esteem of all true heart she ship -- the ship which bring back the commissioner -- will be welcome with acclamation to we shore and it will be plainly see that the united state in yield much be neither weaken nor humiliate ah the affair would he so easily arrange if both side desire it on both side be man so worthy to effect a reconciliation for the glory of we time and the happiness of humanity on both side be nation so well fitted to understand and to love each other must we despair then of the progress of the spirit of peace must we look with we own eye upon english vessel employ in ensure the success of the champion of slavery must we veil we head with we mantle a de gasparin valleyre -lrb- switzerland -rrb- _ December _ 5 1861 p -- i wish to add here a single observation : i have not pretend to exhaust in this rapid study the decision which might be borrow from english author and which would be of a kind to be appeal to by america sir william scott for example -lrb- see c robinson p 467 -rrb- say in express term : _ you may stop the ambassador of you enemy _ i have be careful not to draw the conclusion from this on my part that captain wilke be right in act as he do i simply infer from it that the case be by no mean a hang one and that in stop the commissioner and they papers without stop the ship and turn she from she course he yield perhaps -lrb- let we be just to all -rrb- to the desire of not expose the packet and passenger to serious inconvenience let we say that he be unfortunate
