be a little overworked and i need the rest elizabeth dalstan look at she vis-à-vi with some renewal of she former interest she see a young man who be without doubt good-looking although he certainly have a over-tired and somewhat depressed appearance he cheek be colourless and there be little dark line under he eye as though he suffer from sleeplessness he be clean-shaven and he have the sensitive mouth of a artist he forehead be high and exceptionally good he air of breeding be unmistakable you do look a little fagged mr raymond greene observe sympathetically well these be strenuous day in business we all have to stretch out as far as we can go and keep stretch out or else some one else will get ahead of we business be good with you this fall mr romilly very fair thank you philip answer a little vaguely tell I miss dalstan he go on lean slightly towards she and with a note of curiosity in he tone i want to know you candid opinion of the last act of the play i see you in -- ` henderson 's second wife ' i make up my mind that if ever i have the privilege of meeting you i would ask you that question i know exactly why she declare with a quick little nod of appreciation listen they talk together for some time earnestly mr greene address he conversation to he neighbor lower down the table it be not until the arrival of dessert that philip and he vis-à-vi abandon they discussion tell I have you write yourself mr romilly elizabeth dalstan ask he with interest i have make a attempt at it he confess most difficult thing in the whole world to write a play mr raymond greene intervene see a opportunity to join once more in the conversation most difficult thing in the world i should say now with picture it be entirely different the slightest little happen in everyday life may give you the start and then there you be -- the whole thing unravel itself now let I give you a example he go on help himself to a little more whisky and soda only yesterday afternoon on we way up to liverpool the train get pull up somewhere in derbyshire and i sit look out of the window it be a dreary neighborhood a miserable afternoon and we happen to be cross a rather high viaduct down below be some meadow and a canal and by the side of the canal a path at a certain point -- i should think about half a mile from where the train be stand -- this path go underneath a rude bridge build of brick and cover over with turf well as i sit there i could see two man both approach the bridge along the path from opposite direction one be tall dress in light tweeds a good-looking fellow -- look like one of you country squire except that he be a little on the thin side the other be a sombre-looking person dress in dark clothes about you height and build i should say mr romilly well they both disappear under that bridge at the same moment and i do not know why but i lean forward to see they come out the train be there for quite another two minute perhaps more there be not another soul anywhere in sight and it be rain as it only can rain in england mr raymond greene pause every one at the table have be listen intently he glance around at they rapt face with satisfaction he be conscious of the artist 's dramatic touch once more it have not fail he he have excite interest in philip romilly 's eye there be something even more than interest it seem almost as though he be try to project he thought back and conjure up for himself the very scene which be be describe to he the young man be certainly in a very delicate state of health mr greene decide you be keep we in suspense sir the elderly lady complain lean forward in she place please go on what happen when they come out that mr raymond greene say impressively be the point of the story the train remain stand there as i have say for several minute -- as many minute in fact as it would have take they seconds to have traverse that tunnel notwithstanding that they neither of they appear again i sit there believe I with my eye fasten upon that path and when the train start i lean out of the window until we have round the curve and we be out of sight but i never see either of those two man again now there be the beginning of a film story for you what do you want more than that there be dramatic interest surprise a original situation after all i suppose the explanation be quite a simple one mr busby remark they be probably acquaintance and they stay to have a chat mr raymond greene shake he head doubtfully all i can say to that be that it be a queer place to choose for a little friendly conversation he pronounce they be both tall man -- about the same height i should say -- and it would have be impossible for they to have even stand upright you mention the fact do you not the lady who call herself miss pinsent observe that it be rain heavily at the time perhaps they stay under the bridge to shelter that be something i never think of mr greene admit perhaps for the reason that they both of they seem quite indifferent to the rain the young man in the dark clothes have not even a umbrella i must admit that i allow my thought to travel in another direction professional instinct you see it be a fairly broad canal and the water be nearly up to the towing-path i would lay a wager it be twelve or fifteen foot deep suppose those two man have meet on that narrow path and quarrel suppose -- do not mr raymond greene stop short he gaze in amazement at elizabeth dalstan who have suddenly clutch he hand there be something in she face which puzzle as well as startled he she have be look at she opposite neighbor but she turn back towards the narrator of this thrilling story as the monosyllable break from she lip please stop she beg you be too dramatic mr greene you really frighten I frighten you he repeat my dear miss dalstan i suppose it be very absurd of I she go on smile appealingly at he but you word be altogether too graphic i can not bear to think of what might have take place underneath that tunnel you must remember that i see it too do not go on do not talk about it any more i be go upstairs for my cigarette be you come to get my chair for I mr greene or must i rely upon the deck steward mr raymond greene be a very gallant man and he do not hesitate for a moment he spring to he foot and escort the young lady from the saloon he glance back as he leave the table to nod he adieu to the little company whom he have take under he charge philip romilly be gaze steadfastly out of the porthole kind of delicate young fellow that he remark nice face too can not help think that i have meet or see some one like he lately chapter v philip romilly find himself alone at last with the thing which he have crave -- darkness solitude the rush of the salt wind the sense of open space on the other the sheltered side of the steamer long line of passenger be stretch in wicker chair smoking and drink they coffee but where he be no one come save a occasional promenader yet even here be a disappointment he have come for peace for a brief escape from the thrall of memory which during the last few hour have become charge with undreamed-of horror -- and there be to be no peace in the shadowy darkness which rest upon the white-churned sea fly past he he see again with horrible distinctness the face the figure of the man who for those few brief minute he have hate with a desperate and passionate hatred he see the broken photograph the glass splintered into a thousand piece he see the man himself choke sink down beneath the black water hear the stifled cry from he palsied lip see the slow dawn agony of death in he distorted feature some one be play a mandolin down in the second class he hear the foot of a dancer upon the deck the little murmur of applause well after all this be life it be a rebuke of fate to he own illogical and useless vapouring man die every second whilst woman dance and no one who know life have any care save for the measure of they own day some freakish thought plead stridently he own justification he mind travel back down the gloomy avenue of he past along those last ache year of grind and undeserved poverty he remember he upbringe he widow mother a woman use to every luxury struggle to make both end meet in a suburban street in a hire cottage fill with hire furniture he remember he schoolday devoid of pocket money unable to join in the sport of other slave with melancholy perseverance for a scholarship to lighten he mother 's burden always there be the same ghastly crush penuriousness the struggle to make a living before he schoolday be well over the unbought book he have finger at the bookstall and let drop again the coarse clothes he have be compel to wear the scanty food he have eat the narrow drive way of poverty culminate in he mother 's death and he own fear -- he at the age of nineteen year -- lest the money for she funeral should not be forthcoming if there be any hell surely he have live in it this other whose flame mock he now could be no worse sin crime he remember the word of the girl who during these latter year have represent to he what there might have be of light in life he remember and it seem to he that he could meet that ghostly image which have rise from the black water without shrink almost contemptuously fate have mock he long enough it be time indeed that he help himself he swing away from the solitude to the other side of the steamer pause in a sheltered spot while he light a cigarette and pace up and down the more frequented way a soft voice from a invisible mass of fur and rug call to he mr romilly please come and talk to I my rug have slip -- thank you so much take this chair next mine for a few minute will not you mr greene have rush off to the smoking room i think he have just be tell that there be a rival cinema producer on board and he be try to run he to ground philip settle himself without

manufacturer be you not somehow or other that surprise I and I he acknowledge frankly i mean that i wonder i have persevere at it so long but you be a very young man young or old he answer i be one of those who have make a false start in life i be on my way to new thing do you think miss dalstan that you country be a good place for one to visit who seek new thing she turn in she chair a little more towards he against the background of empty space the pale softness of she face seem to gain a new attractiveness well that depend she say reflectively upon what these new thing might be which you desire for a ambitious business man america be a great country but suppose one have finish with business he persist suppose one want to develop taste and a gift for another method of life then i should say that new york be the one place in the world she tell he you be speak of yourself yes you have ambition i be sure she continue tell I be they literary i would like to call they so he admit i

they again she repeat puzzle i mean that i have leave they at home i have leave they there perhaps to a certain extent deliberately he go on you see the idea be still with I i think that i shall rewrite they when i have settle down in america i fancy that i shall find myself in a atmosphere more conducive to the sort of work i want to do i would rather not be handicap by the ghost of my old failure one 's ghost be hard sometimes to escape from she whisper he clutch nervously at the end of he rug she look up and down along the row of chair there be one or two slumbering form but most be empty there be no promenader in sight you know she ask she voice still very low why i leave the saloon a little abruptly this evening why he demand because she go on i could see the effect which mr raymond greene 's story have upon you because i also be in that train and i have better eyesight than mr greene you be one of the two man who be walk along the towpath well he mutter you have nothing to tell I nothing she wait for a moment at least you have not attempt to persuade I that you linger underneath that bridge to escape from the rain she remark if i can not tell you the truth he promise i be not go to tell you a lie but apart from that i admit nothing i do not even admit that it be i whom you see she lay she hand upon he the touch of she finger be wonderful cool and soft and somehow reassure he feel a sense of relaxation feel the strain of live suddenly grow less you know she say all my friend tell I that i be a restful person you be live at high pressure be you not try and forget it fate make queer use of all of we sometimes she send she noblest son down into the shadow and pitchfork she outcast into the high place of life those do best who learn to control themselves to live and think for the best go on talk to I he beg be it you voice i wonder that be so soothing or just what you say she smile reassuringly you be glad because you have find a friend she tell he and a friend who even if she do not understand do not wish to understand do you see i wish i feel that i deserve it he groan she laugh almost gaily what a sort up there would be of we place in life she declare if we all have just what we deserve now give I you arm i want to walk a little while we walk if you like i will try to tell you what i can about new york it may interest you they walk up and down the deck and by degree they conversation drift into a discussion of such recent play as be familiar to both of they at the far end of the ship she cling to he once or twice as the wind come boom over the freshen wave she weigh and measure he criticism of the play they speak of and in the main approve of they when at last she stop outside the companionway and bid he good night the deck be almost desert they be near one of the electric light and he see she face more distinctly than he have see it at all realize more adequately its wonderful charm the large firm mouth womanly and tender though it be be almost the mouth of a protector she smile at he as one might smile at a boy you be to sleep well she say firmly those be my order good night she give he she hand -- a woman 's soft and delicate finger yet clasp he with a almost virile strength and friendliness she leave he with just that feeling about she -- that she be expansive in she heart she sympathy even she brain and peculiar gift of apprehension she leave he too with a curious sense of restfulness as though suddenly he have become metamorphose into the woman and have find a sorely-needed guardian he abandon without a second think he intention of go to the smoking-room and sit up late the thought of he empty stateroom a horror to he a few hour ago seem suddenly almost alluring and he make he way there cheerfully he feel the sleep already upon he eye chapter vi all the physical exhilaration of he unlived youth seem to be dance in philip romilly 's vein when he awake the next morning to find a open porthole the blue sea toss away to infinity and he steward 's cheerful face at he bedside bathroom steward say if you be ready sir he can arrange for you bath now the man announce philip spring out of bed and reach for he bond street dressing-gown i 'll bring you a cup of tea when you get back sir the steward continue the bathroom be exactly opposite the sting of the salt water seem to complete he new-found light-heartedness philip dress and shave whistle softly all the time to himself he even find a queer sort of interest in examine he stock of tie and other garment the memory of elizabeth dalstan 's word be still in he brain they have become the text of he life this he tell himself be he birthday he even accept without a tremor a letter and telegram which the steward bring he these be in the rack for you sir he say i mean to bring they down last night but we have a busy start off philip take they up on deck to read he tear open the telegram first and permit himself a little start when he see the signature it be send off from detton magna -- why do you not come as promise what be i to do beatrice the envelope of the letter he open with a little more compunction it be write on the print notepaper of the dougla romilly shoe company and be of no great length -- dear mr romilly i understand that you would return to the factory this evening for a few minute before take the train to liverpool there be one or two matter upon which i should like some further information but as time be short i be write to you at the waldorf hotel at new york i see that the acceptance due next 4th be unusually heavy but i think i understand you to say that you have speak to mr henshaw at the bank concern these and in any case i presume there would be no difficulty wish you every success on the other side and a safe return i be you obedient servant jl pott there be not the slightest doubt philip say to himself as he tear both communication into piece and watch they flutter away downward that i be on my way to new york if only one know what have become of that poor half-starved art master he go down to breakfast and afterwards stroll aimlessly about the deck he sense of enjoyment be so extraordinarily keen that he find it hard to settle down to any of the usual light occupation of idle traveller he be content to stand by the rail and gaze across the sea a new wonder to he or to lie about in he steamer chair and listen with half-closed eye to the hissing of the spray and the faint music of the wind he mind turn by chance to one of those story of which he have speak a sudden new vigor of thought seem to rend it inside out almost in those first few seconds he think of the garret in which it have be write the wretched surroundings the odoriferous food the thick crockery the smoke-palled vista of roof and chimney the genius of a stevenson would have become dwarf in such surroundings a phrase a happy idea suddenly catch he fancy he itch for a pencil and paper then he look up to find the one thing want elizabeth dalstan follow by a maid carry rug and cushion have pause smile by he side you have sleep and you be better she say pleasantly now for the next few minute you must please devote yourself to make I comfortable put everything down phoebe mr romilly will look after I for a moment he pause before proceed to he task i want to look at you he confess remember i have only see you under the electric light of the saloon or in that queer violet gloom of last night why you have quite light hair and i think it be dark she laugh good-humouredly and turn slowly around here i be she announce a much bephotographed person almost plain some journalist have dare to call I but for my expression on flow line as you see because i always wear such loose clothes and yet believe I slim as a matter of fact she go on pensively i be rather proud of my figure a little journalist who have annoy I and to whom i be rude once call it ample no one have ever venture to say more the critic who love I and they most of they love I because i be so exceptionally polite to they and tell they exactly what to say about every new play allude to my physique as grecian but you eye he exclaim last night i think they be gray this morning -- why surely they be brown you see that be all accord to the light she confide if any one do try to write a description of I they generally evade the point by call they browny-grey a young man who be in love with I she sigh but that be long ago use to say that they remind he of fall leaf in a place where the sunlight sometimes be and sometimes be not and now if you please i want to be make exceedingly comfortable i want you to find the deck steward and see that i have some beef tea as quickly as possible i want my box of cigarette on one side and my vanity case on the other and i should like to listen to the plot of you play he obey she behest with scrupulous care lean back in he chair and bring into the foreground of he mind the figure of those man and woman who have tell he story find they to he dismay unexpectedly crude and unlifelike and the story itself be unhappiness so necessary after all they suddenly seem to crumble away into insignificance these man and woman of he creation in they place he could almost fancy a race of larger being a more extensive canvas a more splendid a riper and richer vocabulary nothing that i have ever do he sigh be worth talk to you about but if you be go to be my friend -- well if you be go to be my friend he go on with almost inspire conviction i shall write something different one can rebuild she murmur one can sometimes use the old piece life and chess be both like that would you help I i wonder he ask impulsively she look away from he out across the steamer rail she seem to be measure with she eye the roll of the ship as it rise and fall in the trough of the sea you be a strange person she say tell I be you in the habit of become suddenly dependent upon people not i he assure she if i be to tell you how my last ten year have be spend you would not believe I you could not if i be to speak of a tear unutterable loneliness if i be to speak of poverty -- not the poverty you know anything about but the poverty of bare wall of coarse food and little enough of it of everything cheap and miserable and soil and second-hand -- nothing fresh nothing real -- he stop abruptly but i forget he mutter i can not explain be one to understand she ask a little puzzle that you have have difficulty in you business i have never be in business he answer quickly my name be romilly but i be not romilly the manufacturer for the last eight year i have live in a garret in london teaching false art in a third-rate school some of the time do penny-a-line journalistic work when i get the chance clerk for a month or two in a brewer 's office and sack for incapacity -- those be a few of the real thread in my life at the present moment then she observe you be a impostor exactly he admit and i should probably have be repent it by now but for you word last night she smile at he and the sun shone once more it be not a ordinary smile at all it be just as though she be let he into the light of she understanding as though some one from the world entrance into which he have crave have stoop down to understand and be tell he that all be well he draw he chair a little closer to hers we be all more or less impostor she say do any one i wonder go about the world tell everybody what they really be how they really live dear I how unpleasant and uncomfortable it would be you be so wise my new friend you know the value of impulse you tell I the truth and i be you friend i do not need fact because fact count for little i judge by what lie behind and i understand do not weary I with explanation i like what you have tell I only of course you work must have suffer from surroundings like that will it be better for you now i shall land in new york he tell she with at least a thousand pound that be about as much as i have spend in ten year there be the possibility of other money concern that -- well i can not make up my mind the thousand pound of course be steal so i gather she remark do you continue may i ask to be douglas romilly the manufacturer he shake he head a little vaguely i have not think he confess but of course i do not i have risk everything for the chance of a new life i shall start it in a new way and under a new name he be suddenly conscious of she pity of a moistness in she eye as she look at he i think she say that you must have be very miserable above all thing now whatever you may have do for you liberty do not be faintheart if you be in trouble or danger you must come to I you promise if i may he assent fervently now i must hear the play as it stand in you thought when you write it she insist i have a fancy that it will sound a little gloomy be i right he laugh of course you be how could i write in any other way except through the darkened spectacles however there be a way out -- of alter it i mean i feel flash of it already listen the story expand with relation he no longer feel confine to its established line every now and then he pause to tell she that this or that be new and she nod appreciatively they walk for a time watch the seagull and bid they farewell to the irish coast you will have to re-write that play for I she say a little abruptly as she pause before the companionway i be go down to my room for a few minute before lunch now afterwards i shall bring up a pencil and paper we will make some note together philip walk on to the smoking room he could scarcely believe that the plank he tread be of solid wood raymond greene meet he at the entrance and slap he on the back : just in time for a cocktail before lunch he exclaim i be look everywhere for a pal two martini dry as you like jim he add turn round to the smoking room steward sure you will not join we lawton dare not be the laconic answer from the man whom he have address by-the-bye mr raymond greene go on let I make you two acquaint this be mr dougla romilly a english boot manufacturer -- mr paul lawton of brockton mr lawton own one of the largest boot and shoe plant in the state the introducer go on you two ought to find something to talk about philip hold out he hand without a single

word to myself to neither talk business nor think business you very good health mr raymond greene he go on drink he cocktail with relish if we meet on the other side mr lawton we 'll compare note as much as you like that be all right sir the other agree i do not know as you be not right we american do hang round we business and that be a fact still there be a little matter of last i should like to have a word or two with you about some time a little matter of what philip ask vaguely last the other repeat that be where you people and ours look different way chiefly that and a little matter of manipulation of we machinery just so philip assented swallow the rest of he cocktail what about luncheon there be nothing in the world to give you a appetite like this sea air i be with you mr raymond greene chime in you two can have you trade talk later on he take he young friend 's arm and they descend the stair together what the mischief be a last he inquire i have not the least idea philip reply carelessly something to do with boot and shoe be not it he questioner stare at he for a moment and then laugh say you be a young man of you word he remark appreciatively chapter vii philip romilly be accost late that afternoon by two young woman whose presence on board he have notice with a certain amount of disapproval they be obviously of the chorus-girl type a fact which they seem to lack the ambition to conceal after several would-be ingratiating giggle they finally pull up in front of he whilst he be promenade the deck you be mr romilly be not you one of they ask bob millet tell we you be go to be on this steamer you know bob do not you philip for a moment be take aback bob millet he repeat thoughtfully of course good old bob i do not mind confess the young woman go on that though we be all out one night together -- trocadero empire and murray 's afterwards -- i should never have recognize you seem to I you have get thinner and more serious-looking i be afraid my own memory be also at fault philip remark a little stiffly i be violet fox the young woman who have accost he continue this my friend hilda mason she be a dear girl but a little shy be not you hilda that be just because i tell she that we ought to wait until you remember we the slighter young woman with the very obvious peroxidised hair protest do not seem to be any use wait for that she friend retort briskly hilda and i be die for a cocktail mr romilly he lead they with a unwillingness of which they seem frankly unaware towards the lounge they drink two cocktail and find themselves unfortunately devoid of cigarette a misfortune which it become he privilege to remedy they be very friendly young lady if a little slangy invite he around to they stateroom and offer to show he the run around new york philip escape after about a hour and make he way to where elizabeth be recline in she deck chair that fellow romilly he declare irritably the other one i mean seem to have have the vilest taste if i be to be land with any more of he ridiculous indiscretion i think i shall have to go overboard there be a enterprising gentleman name gaye in liverpool who nearly drive I crazy then there be this mr lawton who want to talk about last and finally it seem that i dine at the trocadero and spend the evening at the empire and murray 's with the two very obvious-looking young lady who accost I just now i be begin to believe that dougla ' life be not above suspicion she smile at he tolerantly a unopened book lay by she side she seem to have be spend the last quarter of a hour in thought i be rather relieve to hear she confess that those two young people be a heritage from the other mr romilly no do not sit down she go on i want you to do something for I go into the library and on the left-hand side as you enter you will see all the wireless news read the bottom item and then come back to I he turn slowly away all he new-found buoyancy of spirit have suddenly leave he he curse the imagination which lift he foot from the white deck and drag he eye from the sparkling blue sea to the rain-soaked smut-blackened field rive by that long thread of bleak turgid water the horror of a murderous passion beat upon he brain he see himself hasten grim and blind on he devil-sped mission then the haze fade from before he eye somehow or other he accomplish he errand he be in the library standing in front of those many sheet of typewritten message pass they all over heedless of what they message might be until he come to the last and most insignificant four line almost overlap by another sheet -- strange disappearance of a london art teacher suicide fear act upon instruction receive the police be investigate a somewhat curious case of disappearance philip romilly a teacher of art in a london school visit detton magna on Friday afternoon and apparently start for a walk along the canal bank towards dusk nothing have since be hear of he or he movement and arrangement have be make to drag the canal at a certain point the letter seem to grow larger to he as he stand and read he remain in front of the message for a inordinately long time again he imagination be at work he see the whole ghastly business the police on the canal bank watch the slow progress of the man with they drag bring to the surface all the miserable refuse of the turgid water the drip black mud perhaps at last he be back again on the deck walk quite steadily yet see little he make he way to the smoking room ask almost indifferently for a brandy and soda and drain it to the last drop then he walk up the deck to where elizabeth be seat and drop into a chair by she side so i be miss he remark almost in he ordinary tone i really have no idea that i be a person of such importance fancy reading of my own disappearance within a few day of its take place in the middle of the atlantic there be probably some one there who give information she suggest there be the young lady whom i go to visit he assent she probably watch I cross the road and turn in at that gate and take the path by the canal side yes she may even have go to the station to see whether i take the only other train back to london and find that i do not she know too that i could only have have a few shilling in my pocket and that my living depend upon be in london for my school the next morning yes the whole thing be reasonable and they be go to drag the canal elizabeth say thoughtfully a difficult business he assure she it be one of the most ghastly ill-constructed filthiest strip of water you ever look upon it have be the garbage depository of the village through which it make its beastly way for generation i do not envy the man who have to handle the drag you do not believe then that they will find anything -- interesting he shrug he shoulder that type of man he continue must have a morbid mind there will be dead animal without a doubt worn-out boot filthy and decomposed article of clothing -- do not she interrupt you know what i mean do leave off painting you ghastly picture you know quite well what i mean philip romilly be here by my side what can they hope to find there in he place he evil moment for that afternoon be over he answer she almost carelessly not what they be look for have you bring the paper and pencil you speak of i have a idea -- i be get fresh idea every moment now that i picture you as my heroine it be queer be not it how naturally you fall into the role she draw a little nearer to he he be conscious of a mysterious and unfamiliar perfume perhaps from the violet half hide in she fur or be it something in she hair it remind he a little of the world the key into which he have grip -- the world of joyousness of light-hearted pleasure the sunlit world into which he have only look through other man 's eye perhaps you know that i be somewhere across the threshold she suggest do you drag you mona wholly from you brain or have she she prototype somewhere in you world he shake he head therein lie the weakness of all that i have ever write he declare there have be so few in my world from whom i could garner even the gleanings of a personality they be all my man and woman artificially make not bear twenty-three shilling a week have keep I well outside the lock door yet you know in many way she reflect mona be like I like you because she be a helper of man he assent swiftly a woman of large sympathy appeal to I i suppose because in my solitude thought of my own weakness taunt I weakness because i could not break out i mean perhaps for that reason the thought of a strong woman fascinate I a woman large in thought and way a woman to whom purpose and tendency count most i dream of a woman sweetly omnipotent strong without a shadow of masculinity that be where my mona be to be different from all other create figure chance she declare be a wonderful thing chance have pitchfork you here absolutely to my side i the one woman who could understand what you mean who could give you mona life do not think i be vain she go on i can assure you that my head be not the least turn because i have be successful i simply know listen i have few engagement in new york i should not be go back at all but to see my mother who be too delicate to travel and who be miserable when i be away for long take this pencil and paper let we leave off dream for a little time and give ourselves up to technicality i want to draft a new first act and a new last one not so very different from you version and yet with change which i want to explain as we go on bring you chair a little nearer -- so now take down these note they work until the first gong for dinner ring she sit up in she chair with a happy little laugh be not it wonderful she exclaim i never know time to pass so quickly there be not any pleasure in the world like this she add a little impulsively the pleasure of let you thought run out to meet some one else 's some one who understand take care of every line we have write my friend we might go on after dinner he suggest eagerly she shake she head i would rather not she admit my brain be too full i have a hundred fancy dancing about i even find myself as we sit here rehearse my gesture tuning myself to a new outlook oh you most disturbing person -- intellectually of course i mean she add laugh into he face take off my rug and help I up no we 'll leave they there perhaps after dinner we might walk for a little time but the whole thing be tingle in my brain he protest could not we go into the library we could find a corner by

the dissension of the press as to she appearance the supreme charm of a woman possess of a sweet and passionate temperament turn she face towards the long-wished-for sun even the greater thing catch hold of he in that moment and he feel dimly what be come do you really wish to work she ask he look away from she no he answer a little thickly we will talk if you will they neither of they move the atmosphere have suddenly become charge with a force indescribable almost numbing in the far distance they see the level line of light from a pass steamer mr raymond greene with he hand in he ulster pocket suddenly spot they and do for they what they seem to have lose the power to do hullo he exclaim i have be look for you two everywhere i do not want to hurt that smoking room steward 's feeling

talk about i have give lawton one and he be follow I about like a dog come right this way both of you steady across the gangway -- she be pitch a little why you look kind of scared mr romilly be to sleep either of you philip 's laugh be almost too long to be natural elizabeth as though by accident have drop she veil mr raymond greene bubble over with good nature and anticipation lead they towards the stair chapter viii mr raymond greene could scarcely wait until philip have take he place at the dinner table that evening to make known he latest discovery say mr romilly he exclaim lean a little forward do you happen to have see the wireless message to-day -- those tissue sheet that be stick up in the library philip set down the menu in which he have be take a unusual interest yes i look through they this afternoon he acknowledge there be a little one at the bottom look as though it have be shove in at the last moment i do not know whether you notice it it announce the mysterious disappearance of a young man of the same name as you own -- a art teacher from london i think he be i wonder whether it might have be any relation i read the message philip admit it certainly look as though it might have refer to my cousin mr raymond greene become almost impressive in he interested earnestness talk about coincidence he continue do you remember last night talk about subject for cinema play i tell you of a little incident i happen to have notice on the way from london to liverpool about the two man somewhere in derbyshire whom i have see approach a tunnel over a canal -- they neither of they come out you know all the time that the train be stand there philip help himself a little absently to whisky and soda from the bottle in front of he i remember you professional interest in the situation he confess i feel at the time mr raymond greene go on eagerly that there be something queer about the affair listen i have be put two and two together and it seem to I that one of those man might very well have be this miss mr romilly philip shake he head pensively i do not think so he venture what be that you do not think so the cinema magnate exclaim why not mr romilly it be exactly the district -- at detton magna the message say in derbyshire -- and it be a canal too one of the filthiest i ever see can not you realize the dramatic interest of the situation now that you be confront with this case of disappearance i have be ask myself ever since i stroll up into the library before dinner and read this notice -- ' _ what about the other man _ ' philip have commence a leisurely consumption of he first course and answer without undue haste well he say if this young man romilly be my cousin it would be the second or third time already that he have disappear he be a ill-balanced neurotic sort of creature at time he accept help -- even solicit it -- from he more prosperous relation and at time he will not speak to we but of one thing i be perfectly convinced and that be that there be no man in the world who would be less likely to make away with himself he have a nervous horror of death or pain of any sort and in he peculiar way he be much too fond of life ever to dream of voluntarily shorten it on the other hand he be always do eccentric thing he probably set out to walk to london -- i have know he do it before -- and will turn up there in a fortnight 's time mr raymond greene seem rather to resent have cold water pour upon he melodramatic imagining he turn to elizabeth who have remain silent during the brief colloquy what do you think miss dalstan he ask do not you think that under the circumstance i ought to give information to the british police she laugh at he quite good-naturedly and yet in such a way that a less sensitive man than mr raymond greene might well have be conscious of the note of ridicule no wonder you be such a great success in you profession she observe you carry the melodramatic instinct with you day by day you see everything through the dramatist 's spectacles that be all very well mr greene protest but you see the two man yourself and you have probably read about the case of mysterious disappearance surely you must admit that the coincidence be interesting alas she go on shake she head i be afraid i must throw cold water upon you vivid imagining you see my eyesight be better than yours and i could see the two man distinctly whilst you could only see they figure one of they the better-dressed be fair and obviously affluent and the other be a labourer neither of they could in any way have answer the description of the miss man mr raymond greene be a little dash you do not say so at the time he complain i really be not sufficiently interested she tell he besides without know anything of mr romilly 's cousin i do not think any person in the world could have have the courage to seek a exit from he trouble by means of that canal but my point mr raymond greene persist be that it be not suicide at all i maintain that the situation as i see it present all the possibility of a different sort of crime my cousin have not a enemy in the world except himself philip intervene and i would give you the film of my next play for nothing elizabeth ventured if either of those two man could possibly have be a art teacher can i have a little more oil with my salad please steward and i should like some french white wine mr raymond greene take what appear to be a positive disappointment very good-naturedly well he say i dare say you be both right and in any case i should not like to persist in a point of view which might naturally enough become distressing to we young friend here tell you what i 'll do to show my penitence i shall order a bottle of wine and we 'll drink to the welfare of the miss mr philip romilly wherever he may be pommery steward and bring some ice along philip push away he whisky and soda just in time he remark i 'll drink to poor philip 's welfare with pleasure although he have not be a unmixed blessing to he family the subject pass away with the drinking of the toast and with the necessity for a guard upon himself go philip find himself eat and drink mechanically watch all the time the woman who sit opposite to he who have now engage mr raymond greene in a animated conversation on the subject of the suitability for film of certain recent play he be try with a curious intentness to study she dispassionately to understand the nature of the charm on which dramatic critic have waste a wealth of adjective and of which he himself be humanly and personally conscious she wear a high-necked gown of some soft black material with a little lace at she throat fasten by she only article of jewellery a pearl pin she hair be arrange in coil with a simplicity and a precision which to a more experienced observer would have indicate the possession of a maid of no ordinary quality she mouth become more and more delightful every time he study it she voice even she method of speech be entirely natural and with a peculiarly fascinating inflexion at time she look and speak with the light-hearted gaiety of a child then again there be the grave and culture woman apparent in she well-balanced and thoughtful criticism when at the end of the meal she rise to leave the table he find himself surprise at she height and the slim perfection of she figure he first remark when he join she upon the stair be a almost abrupt expression of he thought tell I he exclaim why be all my first impression of you wrong to-night you be a revelation to I you

finger feel for he other hand he grip they tightly and he last impression of she face before they plunge into the darkness be of a queer softness as though she be give herself up to some unexpected but welcome emotion she eye be half close she have the air of one wrap in silence so they walk almost the whole length of the deck philip indeed have no impulse or desire for speech all he ache nerve be soothe into repose the last remnant of he ghostly fear have be sweep away they be on the windward side of the ship untenanted save now and then by the shadowy form of other promenader the whole experience even the regular throbbing of the engine the swish of the sea the rise and fall of a lantern bind to the top of a fishing smack by which they be pass the distant chant of the change watch all the night sight and sound of the seaborne hostel be unfamiliar and exhilarating and inside he hand even though give he of she great pity a woman 's finger lay in he she speak at last a little abruptly there be something i must know about she say you have only to ask he assure she do not be afraid she continue i wish to ask you nothing which might give you pain but i must know -- you see i

people be gentlefolk -- or taste i have no friend in london before whom i dare present myself no money to join a club where i might have mix with my fellow no one to talk to or exchange a single idea

a flagrant imitation of she less honest sister at night who else where be i to meet woman when i do not even know man i spend my poor holiday at detton magna we very loneliness bring beatrice and I closer together we use to walk in those ugly field around detton magna and exchange the story of we woe she be a teacher at the national school the child be not pleasant they parent be worse the drudgery be horrible and there be not any escape for she sometimes she would sob as we sit side by side she too want something out of life as i do and there seem nothing but that black wall always before we i think that we cling together because we share a common misery we talk endlessly of a way out for I what be there there be no one to rob -- i be not clever enough there be no way i could earn money honestly or dishonestly and for she bury in that derbyshire village amongst the colliery where there be scarcely a person who have not the taint of the place upon they -- what chance be there for she there be nothing she could do either i know in my heart that we be both ready for evil thing if by evil thing we could make we escape and we could not so we try to lose ourselves in the only field leave for such as we we read poetry we try to live in that unnatural world where the brain only be nourished and the body languish it be a morbid unhealthy existence but i plod along and so do she then she weekly letter become different for the first time she write I with reserve i take a day 's vacation and i go down to detton magna to see what have happen that be the day she interrupt

with ever widen finger through the darkness hear the yawn of the city as it seem to shiver and tremble before the battle of the day at twilight he have watch the light spring up one by one at first like pin prick in the distance grow and widen until the grotesque shape of the building from which they spring have fade into nothingness and there be leave only a velvet curtain of strangely-lit star at a giddy distance below he could trace the blaze of broadway the blue light flash from the electric wire as the cable car rush back and forth the red and violet glimmer of the sky sign he know it all so well by morning by noon and night in rainstorm storm which he have watch come up from oceanward in drift cloud of vapor and in sunshine clear brilliant sunshine a little hard and austere to he way of thinking and unseasonable a week he mutter she say a week tonight i will go out he look at himself in the glass he wear no longer the well-cut clothes of mr dougla romilly 's saville row tailor

the three stranger be all interested in he personality and the fact that he have no previous work to he credit it be unusual almost dramatic and for a time both elizabeth and he himself find themselves hard put to it to escape the constant wave of good-natured but very pertinent question you 'll have a dose of we newspaperman to-morrow sir mr fink promise he they 'll be buzz around you all day long they 'll want to know everything from where you get you clothes and what cigarette you smoke to how you like best to do you work and what complexion typist you prefer they be some boy i

sling the ink about some ed harri be in my room just after the second act and he show I some of he stuff i tell you he mean to boost we elizabeth lay she hand upon she manager 's arm they be delightful every one of they she agree but mr fink you have such influence with they i wonder if i dare give you just a hint mr ware have pass through some very painful time lately he be so anxious to

promise you know what the boy be though they do love a story i be not go to have mr ware 's story publish in every newspaper in new york elizabeth say firmly and the newspaper man who worm the history

at the club to-night and drop a few hint around elizabeth pat he hand and smile at he very sweetly the conversation flow back once more into its former channel become a medley of confused chaff disjointed stream of congratulation of toast-drinking and pleasant speech then mr fink suddenly rise to he foot say he exclaim we have all drunk one another 's health there be just one other friend i think we ought to take a glass of wine with gee he would give something to be with we to-night you 'll agree with I miss dalstan i know let 's empty a full glass to sylvanus power there be a curious silence for a second or two then a clamor of assent voice for a single moment philip feel a sharp pang at he heart elizabeth be gaze steadily out of the room a queer tremble at she lip a look in she eye which puzzle he a look almost of fear of some sort of apprehension the moment pass but she enthusiasm as she raise she glass be a little overdo she gaiety too easily assume why of course she declare fancy not think of sylvanus they drink he health noisily philip set down he glass empty a curious instinct keep he lip seal he crush down and stifle the memory of that sudden stab he do not even ask the one natural question say where be sylvanus power these day mr fink enquire in honolulu when last i hear elizabeth reply lightly but then one never know really where he be philip become naturally the central figure of the little gathering mr fink be anxious to arrange a little dinner to introduce he to some fellow worker noel bridge insist upon a card for the lamb club and a luncheon there philip accept gratefully everything that be offer to he it be no good do thing by half he tell himself the day of he solitude be over even when after the departure of he guest he glance for a moment into the anteroom beyond and remember those few throbbing moment of suspense they come back to he with a curious sense of unreality -- they belong surety to some other man living in some other world you be happy elizabeth murmured as she take he arm and they wait in the portico below for she automobile he have no longer any idea of tell she of that disquieting visit the touch of she hair blow against he cheek as he have help she on with she cloak something in she voice some slight diffidence a queer half expostulate look in the eye that fall with a curious uneasiness before he drive every thought of future danger out of he mind he have at least the present he answer without a moment 's hesitation for the first time in my life she give the chauffeur a whisper order as she step into the car i have tell he to go home by riverside drive she say as they glide off it be a little farther and i love the air at this time of night he clasp she finger -- suddenly feel with the lean of she body she heart beat against he with that wave of passion there be a instant and portentous change in they attitude the soft protectiveness which have sometimes seem to shine out of she face to envelop he in its warmth have disappear she be no longer the stronger she look at he almost with fear and he be electrically conscious of all the vigor and strength of he stunt manhood be master at last of he fate accept battle willing to fight whatever might come for the sake of the joy of these moment she creep into he arm almost humbly chapter iii the success of the house of sham be as immediate and complete as be the social success of its author after a few faint-hearted attempt philip and elizabeth both agree that the wisest course be to play the bold game -- to submit himself to the photographer the interviewer and to some judicious extent to the wave of hospitality which flow in upon he from all side he throw aside completely and utterly every idea of lead a more or less sheltered life he photograph be in the Sunday newspaper and the magazine it be quite easy in satisfy the appetite of journalist for copious personal detail especially after the hint drop by mr fink to keep they carefully off the subject of he immediate past there have be many other in the world who on attain fame have prefer to gloss over they earlier history it seem to be tacitly understand amongst this wonderful freemasonry of newspaper man that mr merton ware be to be humor in this way he be a man of the present character sketch of he be to be all foreground but nevertheless philip have he trial want to introduce you to one of we chief ` movie ' man noel bridge say to he one day in the smoking room of the lamb he be much interested in the play too mr raymond greene shake hand

raymond greene be stare in he face with a bewilderment which be not without its humorous side he be too much a man of the world this great picture producer to be at a loss for word to receive a introduction with any degree of clumsiness but surely he almost stammer we have meet before philip shake he head doubtfully i do not think so he say as a matter of fact i be sure we have not because you be one of the man whom i hope some day to come across over here i could not possibly have forget a meeting with you mr raymond greene 's blue eye look as though they see vision but surely he

to walk home alone that be lucky he reply because i have to be at the theater in ten minute to meet a cinema man button up you coat and have a good night 's sleep they leave the place together she turn away with a farewell nod and walk rapidly eastward he watch she cross the road a poor little waif she seem except that something have go from she face which have almost terrify he she carry herself he fancy with more buoyancy with infinitely more confidence and he draw a sigh of relief as he call for a taxi chapter iv elizabeth pause for breath at the top of the third flight of stair she lean against the iron balustrade you poor dear she exclaim how many time a day do you have to do this i do not go out very often he remind she and it be not every day that the lift be out of order it be only one more flight she look up the stair sigh and raise she smart gray tailor-made skirt a little higher over she shoe well she announce heroically lead on if they would sometimes dust these step -- but after all it do not matter to you now do it fancy that poor girl though he smile a little grimly a few flight of stair be not the worst thing she have have to face i be afraid he say i be rather terrify of she elizabeth confide support herself by she companion 's shoulder i think i know that ultra-independent type kick I if i put my foot in it be this the door philip nod and knock softly there be a sharp come in put the key down please the figure at the typewriter say as they enter the word have scarcely leave martha 's lip before she turn around conscious of some other influence in the room philip step forward miss grime he say i have bring miss dalstan in to see you she want -- he pause something in the stony expression of the girl who have rise to she foot and stand now face they she ashen paleness unrelieved by any note of color she hand hang in front of she patch and shabby frock seem to check the word upon he lip she voice be low but not soft it seem to create at once a atmosphere of anger and resentment what do you want she demand i hope you do not mind -- i be so anxious that you should do some work for I elizabeth explain when mr ware first bring I in he play i notice how nicely it be typewritten you must have be glad to find it turn out such a success i take no interest in my work when once it be type martha grime declare and i be very sorry but i do not like to receive visitor i be very busy mr ware know quite well that i like to be leave alone elizabeth smile at she delightfully but it be not always good for we be it she remind she to live exactly as we would like or to have we own way in all thing there be a moment 's rather queer silence martha grime seem to be intent upon study the appearance of she visitor the very beautiful woman familiar to nearly every one in new york perhaps at that moment america 's most popular actress she eye seem to dwell upon the little strand of fair hair that escape from beneath she smart but simple hat to take in the slightly deprecate lift of the eyebrow the very attractive half appealing smile the smart gray tailor-made gown with the bunch of violet in she waistband elizabeth be as quietly dress as it be possible for she to be but she appearance nevertheless bring a note of some other world into the shabby little apartment it be the only thing i ask of life martha say the only thing i get i want to be leave alone and i will be leave alone if there be any more work i will do it if there be not i can find some somewhere else but visitor i do not want and will not have elizabeth be adorably patient she surreptitiously draw towards she a cane chair a doubtful-looking article of furniture upon which she seat herself slowly and with great care well she continue with unabated pleasantness that be reasonable as far as it go only we do not quite understand and it be such a climb up here be not it i come to talk about some work but i must get my breath first miss dalstan think perhaps philip intervene diffidently that you might consider accept a post at the theater they always keep two stenographer there and one of they fill up she time by private work generally work for some one connect with the theater in you case you could of course go on with mine only when i have not enough for you and of course i can not compose as fast as you can type there would be something else and the salary would be regular i should like a regular post the girl admit sullenly so would any one who be out of work of course the salary elizabeth explain be twenty-five dollar a week the hour be nine to six you have quite a comfortable room there but when you have private work connect with the theater you can bring it home if you wish mr ware tell I that you work very quickly you will finish all that you have for he to-day will not you i shall have it finish in half a hour then will you be at the new york theater to-morrow morning at nine o'clock elizabeth suggest there be some part to be copy it will be very nice indeed if you like the work and i think you will the girl stand there irresolute it be obvious that she be try to bring herself to utter some form of thanks then there be a loud knock at the door which be open without wait for any reply the janitor stand there with a small key in he hand which he throw down upon a table key of number two hundred miss he say let I have it back again to-night he close the door and depart two hundred philip exclaimed why that be my old room the one up above i must see it elizabeth insist do please let we go up there i mean to ask you to show it I you be not think of move be you miss grime philip enquired she snatch at the key but he have just possess himself of it and be swing it from he forefinger i do not know she snap i be go up there anyway you can not have the key to-day why not philip ask in surprise never mind there be some thing of mine up there i -- she break off they both look at she perplexed philip shake he head good-naturedly miss grime he say you forget that the room be mine till next quarter day i promise you we will respect any of you belongings we may find there come along elizabeth we 'll see you as we come down the latter promise nod pleasantly i do not know as you will the girl retort fiercely i may not be here they climb the last two flight of stair together what a extraordinary young woman elizabeth exclaimed be there any reason for she be quite so rude to I none that i can conceive he answer she be always like that and yet you take a interest in she why not she be human sour by misfortune if you like with a immense stock of bravery and honesty underneath it all she have have a drunken father practically upon she hand and life 's be pretty sordid for she here we be he fit the key into the lock and swing the door open the clear afternoon light shone in upon the little shabby room and its worn furniture there be one or two insignificant belongings of philip 's still lie about the place and on the writing-table exactly opposite the spot where he use to sit a little blue vase in which be a bunch of violet somehow or other it be the one arrest object in the room they both of they look at it in equal amazement be any one living here elizabeth enquired not to my knowledge he reply no one could take it on without my sign a release they move over to the desk elizabeth stoop down and smell the violet lift they up and look at the cut stalk be this where you use to sit and write she ask he nod but i never have any flower here he observe gaze at they in a puzzle manner elizabeth look at the vase and set it down then she turn towards she companion and shake she head oh my dear philip she sigh you really do not know what make that girl so uncouth you mean martha of course i do not you think that she rubbish he stop short in sudden confusion elizabeth pass she arm through he she replace the vase very carefully look once more around the room and lead he to the door never mind she say it be not anything serious of course but it be wonderful philip what memory a really lonely woman will live on what she will do to keep that little natural vein of sentiment alive in she and how fiercely she will fight to conceal it you can go on down and wait for I in the hall i be go in to say good-by to miss martha grime i think that this time i shall get on better with she chapter v philip wait nearly a quarter of a hour for elizabeth when at last she return she be unusually silent they drive off together in she automobile she hold he finger under the rug philip dear she say i think it be time that you and i be marry he turn and look at she in amazement there be a smile upon she lip but rather a plaintive one he have a fancy somehow that there have be tear in she eye lately elizabeth if we be ever go to be she go on softly why should not we be marry quietly as people be sometimes and then tell every one afterwards he hold the joy away from he struggle hard for composure but a little time ago he remind she you want to wait yes she confess i too have my -- my what shall i call it -- fear -- my ghost in the background ah but not like mine he falter he voice unsteady with a surge flood of passion elizabeth if you really mean it if you be go to take the risk of find yourself the wife of the villain in a _ cause célèbre _ why -- why -- you know very well that even the thought of it can draw I up into heaven but dear -- my sweetheart -- remember we have play a bold game or rather i have with you encouragement but we be not safe yet do you know anything that i do not she ask feverishly well i suppose i do he admit it be not necessarily serious he go on quickly as he see the color fade from she cheek but on the very night that we play be produce whilst i be wait about for you all at the restaurant a man come to see I he be one of the keenest detective in new york -- edward dane he name be he know perfectly well that i be the man who have disappear from the waldorf he tell I so to my face then why do not he -- why do not he do something because he be clever enough to suspect that there be something else behind it all philip say grimly you see he would discover that i have not use any of the money he could not fit in any of my doings with the report they would have about dougla somehow or other -- i can not tell how -- another suspicion seem to have creep into the man 's brain all the time he talk to I i could see he try to read in my face whether there be not something else he would stumble across a puzzle of which the piece do not fit he have go to england -- go to detton magna -- go to see whether there be any miss piece to be find he may be back any day now but what could he discover she falter god know philip groaned there be the whole ghastly truth there if fortune help he and he be clever enough if by any devilish chance the thread come into he hand i do not think -- i do not think there be ever any fear from the other side i have all the luck but elizabeth sometimes i be terrify of this man dane i do not mean to tell you this but it be too late now do you know that i be watch day by day i pretend not to notice it -- i be even able now and then to shut it out from my own thought -- but wherever i go there be some one shadow I some one walk in my footstep i be perfectly certain that if you be to go to police headquarters here you could find out where i have spend almost every hour since i take that room in monmouth house she grip he finger fiercely philip philip he lean forward gaze with peculiar almost passionate intentness into the face of the people as they sweep along broadway look at they elizabeth he mutter look at that mob of man and woman sweep along the pavement there every kind and shape of man every nationality every age they be like the little fleck on the top of a wave i watch they when i first come and i feel almost reckless you would think a man could plunge in there and be lose would not you he can not i try it be there anywhere else in the world i wonder be there anywhere in the living world where one can throw off everything of the past where one can take up a new life and memory do not come she shake she head she be more compose now the moment of feverish excitement have pass she shrewd and level common sense have begin to reassert itself there be not any such place philip she tell he and if there be it would not be worth while you try to find it we be both a little hysterical this evening we have lose we sense of proportion you have play for you stake you must not quail if the worst should come you must brave it out i believe even then you would be safe but it will not come -- it sha not he grip she hand they be slow up now catch in a maze of heavy traffic a few block from the theater he voice be firm he have regain he self-control what a idiot i have be he exclaim scornfully never mind that be past there be just one more serious word though dear she respond immediately to the change in he manner and smile into he face well my only real problem he go on earnestly be this dare i hold you to you word elizabeth dare i for instance say ` yes ' to the wonderful suggestion of yours -- make you my wife and risk have people look at you in year to come point at you with pity and say that you marry a murderer who die a shameful death fancy how the tragedy of that would lie across you life -- you who be so wonderful and so court and so clever be not that my affair philip she ask calmly no he answer it be mine she turn and laugh at he for a moment she be she old self again you refuse I he eye glow we 'll wait he say hoarsely till dane come back from england the car have stop outside the theater hat in hand and with he face wreathe in smile the commissionaire have throw open the door the people on the pavement be nudge one another -- a famous woman be about to descend she turn back to philip come in with I she beg somehow i feel cold and lonely to-night it have not anything to do with what we be talk about but i feel as though something be go to happen that something be come out of the shadow something that threaten either you or I i be silly but come she cling to he as they cross the pavement for once she forget to smile at the little curious crowd she be absorb in herself and she feeling life be so hard sometimes she exclaim as they linger for a moment near the box office there be that poor girl philip friendless and lonely what she must suffer god help she -- god help we all i be sick with loneliness myself philip do not leave I alone come with I to my room i only want to see if there be any letter we 'll go somewhere near and dine first before i change philip what be the matter with I i do not want to go a step alone i do not want to be alone for a moment he laugh reassuringly and draw she closer to he she lead the way down the passage towards she own suite of apartment they pass one or two of the official of the theater whom she greet with something less than she usual charm of manner as they reach the manager 's office there be the sound of loud voice and the door be throw open mr fink appear and with he a somewhat remarkable figure -- a tall immensely broad ill-dressed man with a strong rugged face and a mass of gray hair a huge man who seem somehow or other to proclaim himself of a bigger and stronger type than those other amongst whom he move he have black eye and the heavy jaw of a irishman he face be curiously unwrinkled he stand there block the way he great hand suddenly thrust forward betty by the lord that love we he exclaim here 's luck i be on my way out to search for you get here on the chicago limit at four o'clock give I you hand and say that you be glad to see I if elizabeth be glad she show no sign of it she seem to have become root to the spot suddenly dumb philip by she side hear the quick indrawing of she breath sylvanus she murmur you why i think you be in china there be no place on god 's earth can hold I for long be the boisterous reply i do my business there in three day and catch a japanese boat back such a voyage and such food but new york will make up for that you have get a great play they tell I i must hear all about it shake my hand first though girl as though you be glad to see I you seem to have shrunken since i see you last -- to have grow smaller do not london agree with you the moment of shock have pass elizabeth have recover herself she give the newcomer she hand quite frankly she even seem in a measure glad to see he these unannounced coming and going of yours from the end of the earth be so upset to you friend she declare and this gentleman who be he elizabeth laugh softly i need not tell you mr ware she say turn to philip that this dear man here be a eccentric i dare say you have hear of he it be mr sylvanus power and sylvanus this be mr merton ware the author of we play -- ` the house of sham ' philip feel he hand hold in a grasp which firm though it be seem to owe its vigor rather to the long powerful finger than to any real cordiality mr sylvanus power be study he from behind he bushy eyebrow so you be merton ware he observe i have not see you play yet -- hope to to-night a englishman eh yes i be english philip assent coolly you come from the west do not you there be a moment 's silence elizabeth laugh softly oh there be no mistake about mr power she declare he bring the breezy west with he to wall street or broadway pari or london you can not shake it off or blow it away and i do not know as i be particularly anxious to either mr power pronounce be you go to you room here betty if so i 'll come along i guess mr ware will excuse you philip be instantly conscious of the antagonism in the other 's manner as yet however he feel little more than amusement he glance towards elizabeth and the look in she face startle he the color have once more leave she cheek and she eye be full of appeal if you would not mind she beg mr power be a very old friend and we have not meet for so long you need not expect to see anything more of miss dalstan to-night either of you the newcomer declare draw she hand through he arm except on the stage that be i be go to take she out and give she a little dinner directly au revoir fink i 'll see you to-night here good-day to you mr ware philip stand for a moment motionless the voice of mr sylvanus power be no small thing and he be conscious that several of the official of the place and the man in the box office have hear every word that have pass he feel somehow curiously ignore he watch the huge figure of the westerner with elizabeth by he side disappear down the corridor mr fink who have also be look after they turn towards he say that be some man sylvanus power he exclaim admiringly he be one of we multimillionaire mr ware what do you think of he so far as one can judge from a few seconds ' conversation philip remark he seem to possess all the quality essential to the production of a multimillionaire in this country mr fink grin sound a trifle sarcastic but i guess he be a new type to you he observe tolerantly absolutely philip acknowledge as he turn and make he way slowly out of the theater chapter vi philip 's disposition have be so curiously affect by the emotion of the last few month that he be not in the least surprised to find himself that evening tear by a very curious and unfamiliar spasm of jealousy after a hour or so of indecision he make he way as usual to the theater but instead of go at once to elizabeth 's room he slip in at the back of the stall the house be crowd and seat in the stage box alone and gloomy he somewhat austere demeanor intensify by the severity of he evening clothes sit sylvanus power with the air of a conqueror philip unaccountably restless leave he seat in a very few minute and make he way to the box office scribble a line to elizabeth the official to whom he hand it look at he in surprise will not you go round yourself mr ware he suggest miss dalstan have another ten minute before she be on philip shake he head i be look for a man i know he reply evasively i 'll be somewhere about here in five minute the answer come in less than that time it be just a scrawled line in pencil : forgive I dear i will explain everything in the morning if you will come to my room at eleven o'clock this evening i have a hateful duty to perform and i can not see you philip impatient of the atmosphere of the theater wander out into the street with the note in he pocket broadway be throng with people a heterogeneous slowly-moving throng the hardest crowd to apprehend to understand of any in the world he look absently into the vary stream of face stare at the whirling sky-sign the light flash from the tall building hear snatch of the music from the open door of the cafe and restaurant man and even woman elbow he unresent out of the way without the semblance of a apology it seem to he that he presence there part of the drift pandemonium of the pavement be in a sense typical of he own existence in new york he have give so much of he life into another 's hand and now the anchor be drag he be suddenly confront with the possibility of a rift in he relation with elizabeth with a sudden surge doubt not of elizabeth herself but simply a feeling of insecurity with regard to they future he only realize in those moment how much he have lean upon she how completely she seem to have extend over he and he troubled life some sort of shelter influence to which he have succumb with a effortless a almost fatalistic impulse finding there at any rate a refuge from the horror of he empty day it be all abstract and impersonal at first this jealousy which have come so suddenly to disturb the serenity of a almost too perfect day but as the hour pass it seem to he that he thought dwell more often upon the direct cause of he brief separation from elizabeth he turn in at one of the club of which he have be make a member and throw himself gloomily into a easy-chair he thought have turn towards the grim masterful personality of the man who seem to have obtrude himself upon they life what do it mean when elizabeth tell he she be engage for to-night she be sup with he somewhere -- probably at that moment seat opposite to he at a small rose-shaded table in one of the many restaurant of the city which they have visit together he sylvanus power he supplanter be occupy the place that belong to he order she supper humor she little preference perhaps share with she that little glow of relief which come with the hour of rest after the strain of the day 's work the suggestion be intolerable to-morrow he would have a explanation elizabeth belong to he the sooner the world know it the better and this man first of all he read she few line again hastily pencil and evidently write stand up there be a certain ignominy in be send about he business just because this colossus from the west have appear and claim -- what not he right -- he could have no right what then philip order a drink tear open a evening paper and try to read the letter dance before he eye the whisky and soda stand neglect at he elbow afterwards he find himself look into space there be something cynical challenging almost in the manner in which that man have take elizabeth away from he have acknowledge he introduction even have treat the author of a play a writer as some sort of a mountebank make he living by cater for the amusement of the world how do that man regard such gift as he he wonder -- sylvanus power of whom he have see it write that he be one of the conqueror of nature a hard but splendid utilitarian the builder of railway in china and bridge for the transit of he metal amid the cloud of the mountain top in the man 's absence he harshness almost uncouthness seem modify he be a rival without a doubt and to-night a favored one how well have he known elizabeth for how long be it true that rumor he have once hear -- that the first step in she fortune have be due to the caprice of a millionaire he find the room stifle but the thought of the street outside unnerved he he look about for some distraction the room be begin to fill -- actor musician a few journalist a great many man of note in the world of bohemia keep streaming in one or two of they nod to he several pause to speak hullo ware noel bridge exclaim not often you give we a look in what be you do with yourself here all alone philip turn to

from she lip and from hers only well i should think it be turn out all right he remark noel bridge shrug he shoulder the rent if it be figure out at a fair interest on the capital would be something fabulous he declare you see the place be extravagantly build -- without any regard to cost the dress room as you may have notice be wonderful and all the appointment be unique i do not fancy the old

along philip hesitated for a second and then somewhat to the other 's surprise assent he be conscious that he have be perhaps just a little unresponsive to the many courtesy which have be offer he here and at the other kindred club they have be ready to receive he with open arm this little fraternity of brain-worker and he response have be perhaps a little doubtful not from any lack of appreciation but partly from that curious diffidence so hard to understand but so fundamentally english and partly because of that queer sense of be a impostor which sometimes sweep over he a sense that he be after all only the ghost of another man live a subjective life that reason it out however he might there be something of the fraud in any personality he might adopt and yet deep down in he heart he be conscious of so earnest a desire to be really one of they this good-natured good-hearted gay-spirited little throng with they delightful intimacy they keen interest in each other 's welfare they potent almost mysterious geniality which seem to draw the stranger of kindred taste so closely under its influence philip as he sit at the long table with a dozen or so other man do he best that night to break through the fetter try hard to remember that he place amongst they after all be honest enough they be writer and actor and journalist well he too be a writer he have write a

create he be a damned good fellow after all one of they declare as at last he leave the room he be lose he britishness every day he stay here be through rough time they say another remark he be one of those a elder member pronounce take he pipe for a moment from he mouth who be never make for happiness you can always read those man you can see it behind they eye nevertheless philip walk home a saner and a better man he feel somehow warm by those few hour of companionship the senseless part of he jealousy be go he trust in elizabeth reestablish he look at the note once more as he undress at eleven o'clock on the follow morning in she room chapter vii something of he overnight 's optimism remain with philip when at eleven o'clock on the follow morning he be usher into elizabeth 's room it be a frame of mind however which do not long survive he reception from the moment of he arrival he seem to detect a different atmosphere in he surroundings -- the demeanor of phoebe he staunch ally who admit he without she usual welcome smile the unanalysable sense of something want in the dainty little room overfil with strong-smelling hothouse flower in the entrance and welcome of elizabeth herself he eye have ache for the sight of she he be so sure that he would know everything the moment she speak yet she coming bring only confusion to he sens she be different -- unexpectedly bewilderingly different she have lose that delicate serenity of manner that almost protective affection which he have grow to lean upon and expect she enter dress for the street smoking a cigarette which be in itself unusual with dark ring under she eye which seem to be look all around the room on some pretext or other but never at he be i late she ask a little breathlessly i be so sorry tell I have you anything particular to do nothing he answer i want to go out of the city -- into the country at once she tell he feverishly the car be wait i order it for a quarter to eleven let we start of course if you wish it he assent he open the door but before she pass through he lean towards she she shake she head he heart sink what could there be more ominous than this i be not well she mutter do not take any notice of anything i say or do for a little time i be like this sometimes -- temperamental i suppose all great actress be temperamental i suppose i be a great actress do you think i be philip he be follow she down-stair now he find it hard however to imitate the flippancy of she tone the critic insist upon it he observe drily evidently you audience last night share they opinion she nod i love they to applaud like that and yet -- audience do not really know do they perhaps -- she relapse into silence and they take they place in the car she settle herself down with a little sigh of content and draw the rug over she as far as you can go john she tell the man but you must get back at six o'clock the country mind -- not the shore they start off so you be there last night she murmur lean back amongst the cushion with a air of relief i be there for a few moment i write my note to you in the box office she shake the memory away and afterwards i go to one of the club down-town what do you do there she enquire gossip some of the man be very kind to I he say i have supper with noel bridge amongst other well she ask almost defiantly i do not understand she look intently at he for a moment i forget she go on you be very chivalrous be not you you would not ask question see i be go to close my eye it be too horrible here and all through brooklyn when we be in the lane i can talk this be just one of those day i wish that we be in england all we country be either suburban or too wild and restless can you be content with silence for a little time of course he assure she besides you forget that i be in a strange country everything be worth watch they pass over brooklyn bridge and for a hour or more they make slow progress through the wide-flung environs of the city at last however the endless succession of factory and small tenement dwelling lay behind they they pass house with real garden through stretch of wood whose leaf be open whose branch be fill with the sweet-smelling sap of springtime elizabeth seem to wake almost automatically from a kind of stupor she push back she veil and philip steal eager glance towards she be almost startle by some indefinable change she face seem more delicate almost the face of a invalid and she lay back there with half-closed eye the strength of she mouth seem to have dissolve and its sweetness have become almost pathetic there be sign of a great weariness about she the finger which reach out for the little speaking-tube seem to have become thinner take the turn to the left john she instruct the one to bay shore go slowly by the lake and stop where i tell you they leave the main road and travel for some distance along a lane which with its bramble-grown fence and meadow beyond be curiously reminiscent of england they pass a country house build of the wood which be still a little unfamiliar to philip but wonderfully homelike with its cluster of outbuilding its trim lawn and the turret clock over the stable entrance then through the leaf of a avenue of elm they catch occasional glimpse of the blue water of the lake which they presently skirt elizabeth 's eye travel over its placid surface idly yet with a sense of passive satisfaction in a few minute they pass into the heart of a little wood and she lean forward stop here close to the side of the road john stop you engine please and go and sit by the lake the man obey at once with the unquestioning readiness of one use to he mistress ' whim for several minute she remain silent she have the air of one drinking in with almost passionate eagerness the sedative effect of the stillness the soft spring air the musical country sound the ripple of the breeze in the tree the humming of insect the soft splash of the lake against the stony shore philip himself be awaken into a peculiar sense of pleasure by this almost he first glimpse of the country since he arrival in new york a host of half forget sensation warm he heart he feel suddenly intensely sympathetic perhaps more genuinely tender than he have ever feel before towards the woman by he side whose hour of suffer it be he hand slip under the rug and hold she finger which clutch he in instantaneous response she lip seem unlock by he slight action i come here alone two year ago she tell he and since then often sometimes to study a difficult part sometimes only to think one moment she release she finger from he draw out the hatpin from she hat unwind the veil and throw they both on to the opposite seat then she lay she hand upon she forehead as though to cool it the little breeze from the lake ripple through she hair bring they every now and then faint whiff of perfume from the border garden there she exclaim with a little murmur of content that be a man 's action be not it now i think i be get brave i have something to say to you philip he feel she finger seek he again and hold they tightly it be curious how in that moment of crisis he thought seem to wander away he be watch the little fleck of gold in she hair wonder if he have ever properly appreciate the beautiful curve of she neck even she voice seem somehow attuned to the melody of they surroundings the confused song of the bird the sighing of the lake the passing of the west wind through the tree and shrub around philip she begin cling closely to he i have bring you here to tell you a story which perhaps you will think when you have hear it might better have be tell in my dressing-room well i could not besides i want to get away it be about sylvanus power he sit a little more upright he nerve be tingle now with eagerness yes i meet he she continue eight year ago out west when i be in a travel show i accept he attention at first carelessly enough i do not realize the sort of man he be he be a great personage even in those day and i suppose my head be a little turn then he begin to follow we everywhere there be a scandal of course in the end i leave the company and come to new york he go to china where he have always have large interest when i hear that he have sail -- i remember read it in the paper -- i could have sob with joy philip move a little uneasily in he place some instinct tell he however how greatly she desire he silence -- that she want to tell she story she own way then follow three miserable year during which i see little of he i know that i have talent i be always sure of make a living but i get no further it do not seem possible to get any further nothing that i could do or say seem able to procure for I a engagement in new york think of I for a moment now philip as a woman absolutely and entirely devote to she work i love it it absorb all my thought it be just the one thing in life i care anything about i simply ache to get at new york and i could not all the time i have to play on tour and you will not quite understand this dear but there be nothing so wear in life as for any one with my craving for recognition there to be always play on the road she pause for a few minute there be a loud twittering of bird a rabbit who have steal carefully through the undergrowth scurry away a car have come through the wood and sweep past they bring with it some vague sense of disturbance it be some little time before she settle down again to she story at the end of those three year she go on sylvanus power have become richer stronger more masterful than ever i be begin to lose heart he be clever he study my every weakness he know quite well that with I there be only one way and he lay he scheme with regard to I just in the same fashion as he scheme to be a conqueror of man to build up those million we be play near new york and one day he ask I to motor in there and lunch with he i accept it be in the springtime almost on such a day as this we motor up in one of he wonderful car we lunch -- i remember how shabby i feel -- at the best restaurant in new york where i be wait upon like a queen somehow or other the man have always the knack of make himself feel wherever he go he stride the very street of new york like one of its master and the people seem to recognize it afterwards he take I into broadway and he order the car to stop outside the theater where i be now play i look at it and i remember i give a little cry of interest ` this be the new theater that every one be talk about be not it ' i ask he eagerly ` it be ' he answer ` would you like to see inside ' of course i be half crazy with curiosity the door fly open before he and he take I everywhere you know yourself what a magnificent place it be -- that marvellous stage the auditorium all in dark green satin the seat like armchair the dress room like boudoir -- the wonderful spaciousness of it it take my breath away i have never imagine such splendor when we have finish look over the whole building i clutch he arm ' i can not believe that it be not some sort of fairy palace ' i exclaimed and to think that no one know who own the place or when it be go to be open ' ` i 'll tell you all about that ' he answer ' i build it i own it and it will be open just when you accept my offer and play in it ' it all seem too amazing for a time i could not speak coherently then i remember think that whatever happen whatever price i have to pay i must stand upon the stage of that theater and win my lip be quite dry he great voice seem to have fade into a whisper ` you offer ' i repeat ` yourself ' he answer gruffly there be a silence which seem to philip interminable all the magic of the place have pass away its music seem no longer to be singing happiness into he heart then at last he realize that she be wait for he to speak he want -- to marry you he falter he have a wife already splash john be throw stone into the lake a pastime of which he be get a little tire a huge thrush be think about commence to build he nest and in the meantime sit upon a fall log across the way and sing about it a little tree-climbing bird run round and round the trunk of the nearest elm stare at they every time he appear with he tiny black eye a squirrel almost overhead who have long since come to the conclusion that they be harmless decide now that they have the queerest manners of any two young people he have ever watch from he leafy throne and finally abandon he position elizabeth have be stare down the road ever since the last word have pass she lip she turn at last and look at she companion he be once more the refugee the half-starved man fly from horror greater even than he have know she begin to tremble philip she cry say anything but speak to I like a flash he seem to pass from he own almost the hermit 's way of look out upon life from the old-fashioned standpoint of he inherent puritanism into a closer sympathy with those other the man and woman of the world into which he have so lately enter the man and woman who have welcome he so warm-heartedly human being all of they who live and love with glad heart and much kindliness the contrast be absurd the story itself suddenly so reasonable no other woman on tour would have keep sylvanus power wait for three year only elizabeth could have do that it be such a human little problem people do not live in the cloud he be not fit for the cloud himself nevertheless when he try to speak he throat be hard and dry and at the second attempt he begin instead to laugh she grip he arm philip she exclaim be reasonable say what you like but look and behave like a human be do not make that noise she almost shriek he stop at once forgive I he beg humbly i can not help it i seem to be play hide and seek with myself you have not finish the story yet -- if there be anything more to tell I she draw herself up she speak absolutely without falter i accept sylvanus power 's term she go on he place large sum of money in fink 's hand to run the theater there be a wonderful opening you be not interested then or you might have hear of it i produce a new play of clyde fitch 's it be a great triumph the house be packed sylvanus power sit in he box it be to be he night through it all i fight like a woman in a nightmare i do not know what it mean i know hundred of woman who have do in a small way what i be prepare to do magnificently in all my acquaintance i think that i scarcely know one who would have refuse to do what i be do and all the time i be in a state of fierce revolt i have moment when my life 's ambition when new york itself the mecca of my dream and that marvellous theater with its marble and silk seem suddenly to dwindle to a miserable contemptible little doll 's house and then again i play and i feel my soul as i play and the old dream sweep over I and i say that it be not anything to do with personal vanity that make I crave for the big gift of success that it be my art and that i must find myself in my art or die the blood be flow in he vein again she be come back to he he be ashamed -- he with he giant load of sin he voice tremble with tenderness go on he beg i think that the reason i play that night as though i be inspire be because of the great passionate craving at my heart for forgetfulness to shut out the memory of that man who sit almost gloomily alone in he box wait and then after it be all over the wonder and the glory of it he appear suddenly in my dressing-room elbow he way through excite journalist kick bouquet of flower from he path we stand for a moment face to face he come nearer i shrink away i be terrify he look at I in cold surprise ` three minute ' he exclaim ` to say good-by i be off to china stick at it you have do well for a start but remember a new york audience want hold choose you play carefully trust fink ' ` you be go away ' i almost shriek he glance at he watch lean over and kiss I on the forehead ` i 'll barely make that boat ' he mutter and rush out philip be breathless the strange untold passion of the whole thing be come to he in wave of wonderful suggestion finish he cry impatiently finish that be the end she say i play for two year and a half with scarcely a pause then i come to europe for a rest and travel back with you on the _ elletanium _ last night i see sylvanus power again for the first time do not speak my story be in two half that be the first the second be just one question that will come before we reach homejohn she call the man approach promptly -- he be quite weary of throw stone take we somewhere to lunch he mistress direct and get back to new york at six o'clock chapter viii it be not until they be cross brooklyn bridge on they way into the city that she ask he that question they crawl along one of a interminable tangled line of vehicle of all sort and condition the train rattle overhead and endless stream of earnest people pass along the footway below they the evening sunlight flash upon the murky water glitter from the window of the tall building and shine a little mercilessly upon the unlovely purlieus of the great human hive the wind have turn cool and elizabeth with a little shiver have draw she fur around she neck all through the day during the luncheon in a unpretentious little inn and the leisurely homeward drive she have be once more entirely herself pleasant and sympathetic ignore absolutely the intangible barrier which have grow up between they soon to be throw down for ever or to remain for all time we leave we heroine she say at a interesting crisis in she career i be wait to hear from you -- what would you have do in she place he answer she at once and he speak from the lesser height he be fiercely jealous it be not a reasonable question he declare i be not a woman i be just a man who have lead a unusually narrow and cramped life until these last few month that be scarcely fair she object you profess to have love -- to love still i hope that in itself make a man of any one then you too have sin you too be one of those who have yield to passion of a sort therefore you judgment ought to be the better worth have he wince as though he have be strike and look at she with eye momentarily wild he feel that the deliberate cruelty of she word be of intent a instinct of she brain defy for the moment she heart i do not know he falter i will not answer you question i can not you see the love you speak of be my love for you you ask I to ignore that -- i who be cling on to life by one rope you be like all man she sigh we do not blame you for it -- perhaps we love you the more -- but when a great crisis come you think only of yourselve you disappoint I a little philip i fancy that you might have think a little of I something of sylvanus power i have not you sympathy for other people he declare hoarsely no she assent sympathy be the one thing a man lack it be not you fault philip you be to be pity for it and after all it be a woman 's gift be not it there follow then a silence which seem interminable it be not until they be near the theater that he suddenly speak with a passion which startle she tell I he insist last night i can not help ask i be in hell he tell himself afterwards that there could not be any possible way of reconcile cruelty so cold-blooded with all that he know of elizabeth she behave as though he question have fall upon deaf ear the car have stop before the entrance to the theater she step out even before he could assist she hurry across the pavement and look back at he for one moment only before she plunge into the dark passage she nod and there be a utterly meaningless smile upon she lip good-by she say do you mind tell john he need not wait for I then she disappear he stand motionless upon the pavement a little dazed two or three people jostle against he a policeman glance at he curiously a lady with very yellow hair wink in he face philip pull himself together and simultaneously feel a touch upon he elbow he glance into the face of the girl who have accost he and for a moment he scarcely recognize she wish you would remember you be in new york and not one of you own sleepy old town miss grime remark brusquely you 'll have a policeman say you be drunk in a minute if you stand there let people shove you around he fall into step by she side and they walk

building in which he new room be situate they be very pleasant bachelor room with black oak wall and green hanging print upon the wall a serviceable writing-table and a deep green carpet she look around she and at the servant who have come forward at they entrance with a little sniff shall you be change to-night sir he ask not to-night philip answer quickly tell the waiter to send up a simple

waiter enter with the cocktail and begin to lay the cloth for dinner philip pace the room uneasily until he have go look here my little friend he say when at last the door be close there be a great deal of sound common sense in what you say i may be a egoist -- i dare say i be i have be through the proper training for it and i have start life again on a pretty one-sided basis perhaps but -- have you ever be jealous I jealous she repeat scornfully what of i wonder there be a suspicious glitter in she eye a queer little tremble in she tone he question however be merely perfunctory she represent little more to he at that moment than the incarnation of he own conscience very likely you have not he go on you be too independent ever to care much for any one well i have be half mad with jealousy since last night that be the truth of it there be another man want she the man who build the theater for she she tell I about he yesterday while we be out together do not you want she to be happy the girl ask bluntly of course i do then leave she alone to choose do not go about look as though you have a knife in you heart if you find she turn for a moment to some one else you do not want she to choose you do you just because you be a weakling because she great kind heart can not bear the thought of make you miserable stand on you foot like a man and take you luck can i take off my hat i can not eat in this the waiter have enter with the dinner merton open the door of he room and pace up and down for a few moment thoughtfully when she reappear she take the seat opposite philip and

but scold you never mind i be typewrite something of yours this morning -- i have forget the word but it be something about the discipline of affection you can take my scolding that way if i do not adore miss dalstan and if you have not be kind to I i should never take the trouble to make myself disagreeable he smile back at she readily fall in with she altered mood she seem to have talk the ill-humour out of she blood and during the service of the meal she tell he of the comfort of she work the charm of the other girl in the room with whom she be already discuss a plan to share a apartment when she come to speak however remotely of miss dalstan she voice seem instinctively to soften philip find himself wonder what have pass between the two woman in those few moment when elizabeth have leave he and go back to martha 's room by some strange miracle the strong sweet understanding woman have simply take possession of the friendless child the thought of she sit now in martha 's heart a obsession almost a worship perhaps that be why the sense of companionship between the two notwithstanding certain obvious disparity seem to grow stronger every moment they drink they coffee and smoked cigarette afterwards in lazy fashion suddenly martha spring up say i come here to work she exclaim and i bring you under false pretence he confess my brain 's not work i can not dictate we 'll try another evening you do not mind of course not she answer glance at the clock i 'll be go wait a little time longer he beg she resume she seat there be only one heavily shaded lamp burning on the table and through the little cloud of tobacco smoke she watch he he eye be sometimes upon the timepiece sometimes on the telephone he seem always although he attitude be one of repose to be listen wait it be half-past nine -- the middle of the second act they know quite well that for a quarter of a hour elizabeth would be in she dress room she could ring up if she wish the seconds

into that world which they have make for themselves with the help of such treasure as that cheap little volume he carry and then the last few step the open door the room its air at first of wonderful

greet the sudden change the surprise the apprehension the ghastly fear the agony he hear the low gurgle shriek of terror he look into the eye with the fear of hell before they then he hear the splash of the black filthy water there be a cry it be several seconds before he realize that it have break from he lip he look around he like a hunt creature there be another terror now -- the gloomy court

simply the outburst of a disappointed man on the whole she behave extraordinarily well you bring I out here she say to confront I with this man -- to identify he if i could as mr dougla romilly well

disappointed i tell he my whole story and that i do not know a soul in new york and we become friend that be all there be about it that so the detective observe with quiet sarcasm you seem to have a knack of make friend pretty easily miss wenderley it be not you business if i have she snap well we 'll pass that then he concede i have not quite finish with you yet though there be just one or two more point i be go to put before you -- and this gentleman who be not mr dougla romilly he add with a little bow to philip the first be this there be one fact which we can all three take for grant because i know it -- i can prove it a hundred time over -- and you both know it and that be that the mr merton ware of to-day travel from liverpool on the _ elletanium _ as mr dougla romilly occupy a room at the waldorf astorium hotel as mr dougla romilly and abscond from there leave he luggage and he identity behind he to blossom out in a attic of the monmouth tenement house as mr merton ware a young writer of play now i do not think mr dane go on lean a little further over the table that the mr dougla romilly who have disappear be ever capable of write a play i do not think he be a man of talent at all i do not think he could have write for instance ` the house of sham ' let we however leave the subject of dougla romilly for a moment let we go a little further back -- to detton magna let we say curiously enough there be another young man who disappear from that little derbyshire village about the same time who have never be hear of since he name too be romilly i gather during the course of my recent enquiry that he be a poor relation a cousin of mr dougla romilly he be drown in the canal beatrice falter he body have be find a body have be find mr dane correct but it be in a unrecognisable state it have be presume to be the body of philip romilly the poor relation a starve young art teacher in london with literary aspiration -- but i hold that that presumption be a mistake i believe the detective go on he eye fasten upon philip he voice a little raise that it be the body of dougla romilly the shoe manufacturer which be fish out from the canal and that you sir be mr philip romilly late art-school teacher of kensington who murder dougla romilly on the bank of the canal steal he money and pocketbook assume he identity in liverpool and on the _ elletanium _ and become what you be now -- mr merton ware philip throw away the cigarette which he have be smoking and lean over the box carefully select another he tap it against the table and light it mr dane he say coolly i shall always be grateful to you for you visit this morning for you have give I what be the most difficult thing in the whole world to stumble up against -- a excellent idea for a new play apart from that you seem for so intelligent a man to have waste a good deal of you time and to have come what we should call in english a cropper i will take you into my confidence so far as to admit that i be not particularly anxious to disclose my private history but if ever the necessity should arise i shall do so without hesitation until that time come you must forgive I if i choose to preserve a certain reticence as to my antecedent mr dane in the moment 's breathless silence which follow acknowledge to himself the perpetration of a rare mistake he have select philip to bear the brunt of he attack believe he to be possess of the weaker nerve beatrice who at the end of he last speech have sink into a chair white and terrify a easy victim have rally now inspire by philip 's composure you deny then that you be mr philip romilly the detective ask i never hear of the fellow in my life philip reply pleasantly but do not go mr dane you can not imagine how interesting this be to I you have send I a most charming acquaintance he add bow to beatrice and you have provide I with what i can assure you be almost pathetically scarce in these day -- a new and very dramatic idea take a seat will not you and chat with we a little longer tell we how you come to think of all this i have always hold that the workings of a criminologist 's brain must be one of the most interesting study in life mr dane smile enigmatically ah he protest you must not ask I to disclose all my secret you would not care to tell we a little about you future intention philip enquired mr dane shake he head it be very kind of you mr merton ware he confess to let I down so gently we all make mistake of course as to my future intention well i be not quite sure about they you see this be not really my job at all it be not up to I to hunt out english criminal so long as they behave themselves in this city if a extradition order or anything of that sort come my way it would of course be different why not lay this interesting theory of yours before the authority at scotland yard philip suggest i be sure they would listen with immense interest to any report from you that be some idea certainly the detective admit take up he hat from the table for the present i 'll wish you both good morning -- or shall i say a revoir we may look for the pleasure of another visit from you then philip enquired politely the detective face they from the doorway sir he say to philip i admire you nerve and i admire the nerve of you old sweetheart miss wenderley i be afraid i can not promise you however that this will be my last visit the door close behind he they hear the shrill summons of the bell the arrival of the lift the clanging of the iron gate and its subsequent descent then beatrice turn she head philip be still smoking serenely stand with he back to the mantelpiece he hand in he pocket she rise and throw she arm around he philip she cry why you be wonderful you be marvellous you make I ashamed it be only for a moment that i lose my nerve and you save we oh what idiot we be of course he mean to watch -- that be why he tell I he be go to chicago the beast he seem to have get hold of the idea all right do not he philip muttered pooh she exclaim encouragingly i know a little about the law -- so do you he have not any proof -- he never can have any proof no one will ever be able to swear that the body which they pick out of the canal be the body of dougla romilly there be not a soul who see you do it i be the only person in the world who could supply the motive and i -- i shall never be any use to they do not you see philip i shall be you wife a wife can not give evidence against she husband you 'll be safe dear -- quite safe he withdraw a little from she embrace beatrice he remind she there be another tragedy beyond the one with which dane threaten we i do not wish to marry you she suddenly blaze up because -- not because of any reason in the world he interrupt except that i love elizabeth dalstan do she want to marry you he be suddenly a altered person some of he confidence seem to desert he he shake he head doubtfully i be not sure sometimes i think that she would sometimes i fancy that it be only a great kindness of heart a immense sympathy a kind of protective sympathy which have make she so good to I she look at herself steadily for a moment in the mirror then she pull down she veil philip she say we find out the truth when we be up against thing like this i use to think i could live alone i can not whatever you may think of I i be fond of dougla it be not only for the sake of the money and the comfort he be kind and in he way he understand and then you know misery do not agree with you you be often even in those few hour we spend together very hard and cold anyway she add with a little tightening of the lip i be go to get my money now no one can stop that you stay here and think it over it would be better to marry I philip and be safe than to have the fear of that man dane always before you and wait -- wait till you see I when i come back she go on she spirit rapidly rise as she move towards the door you 'll change you mind then philip you be always so impressionable be not you a little touch of color the perfume of flower a single soft word speak at the right moment -- anything that take you fancy make such a difference well -- just wait till i come back she close the door philip hear she descend in the lift he move to the window and watch for she on the pavement she appear there in a moment or two and wait whilst the boy whistle for a taxicab she face expectantly upraise one hand rest lightly on she bosom just over the spot where she pocketbook lay chapter xvi philip be still gaze into vacancy and smoking cigarette when elizabeth arrive she seem conscious at once of the disturbed atmosphere he hand which she hold firmly in hers be as cold as ice be that girl go to be troublesome she demand anxiously not in the way we fear he reply all the same the plot have thicken so far as i be concern that fellow dane have be here go on she beg he lay a trap for we and we fall into it like the veriest simpleton he let beatrice think that he have go to chicago of course he do nothing of the sort he turn she loose to come to I and he have we watch he know that we spend last evening together as old friend she be here in my room this morning when he arrive oh philip philip she murmur well what do he suspect the truth he accuse I to my face of be philip romilly beatrice do she best but you see the position be a little absurd she deny strenuously that she have ever see I before that i be anything but a stranger to she in the face of last evening and he find she here this morning it do not sound convince what be dane go to do heaven know it be not he affair really if there be any charge against I -- well you see there would have to be a extradition order i should think he will probably lay the fact before scotland yard and let they do what they choose she make he sit down and draw a low chair herself to he side she hold he hand in hers philip she say soothingly they can not possibly prove anything they can prove he point out that i be in detton magna that afternoon i do not think any one except beatrice see I start along the canal path but they can prove that i know all about douglas romilly 's disappearance because i travel to america under he name and with he ticket and deliberately personate he they can prove all that she agree but they can not prove the crime itself beatrice be the only person who could do that she propose to marry I he announce grimly that would prevent she give evidence at all elizabeth suddenly throw she arm around he neck and hold she cheek to he she sha not marry you she declare i want you myself elizabeth yes i have make up my mind philip it be no use the other thing be fascinating and splendid in they way but they do not count they do

of comprehension break across she face with understand however come a momentary embarrassment she look a little pathetically at the great audience then laugh and glance at philip seat now well back in the box many of they follow she gaze and the applause break out again then there be silence she pause before she speak the first word of she part thank you so much she say quietly it be a queer little episode beatrice grip philip 's hand as she draw she chair back to he there be tear in she eye how they love she these people and fancy they know about it philip already you ought to have show

in the vestibule of the theater before go back to he box at the commencement of the last act he feel once more that terrible wave of depression the ghostly uprising of he old terror even in this supreme moment he look down from the panorama of flare sky-sign into the face of the passer-by along the crowded pavement he have a sudden fancy that dane be there watch he heart beat fiercely as he stand almost transfix scanning eagerly every strange face then the bell ring behind he he set he tooth and turn away in less than half a hour the play would be over they would be on they way home he find the box door open and the box itself to he surprise empty there be no sign anywhere of beatrice he wait for a little time then he ring the bell for the attendant but could hear no news of she he
