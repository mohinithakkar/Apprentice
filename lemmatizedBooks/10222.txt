the pilgrim of new england : a tale of the early american settler by mr j b webb author of `` naomus '' `` julamerk '' etc preface in the follow story a attempt have be make to illustrate the manners and habit of the earliest puritan settler in new england and the trial and difficulty to which they be subject during the first year of they residence in they adopt country all the principal incident that be weave into the narrative be strictly historical and be derive from authentic source which give a impartial picture both of the virtue and the failing of these remarkable emigrant unhappily some of these incident prove but too clearly how soon many of these exile ` for conscience sake ' forget to practice those principle of religious liberty and toleration for the preservation and enjoyment of which they have themselves abandon home and kindred and the church of they forefather and they tend to lessen the feeling of respect and admiration with which they piety and they disinterested spirit must necessarily inspire we we can not but regret to find how early in many of the puritan community that piety become tinge with fanaticism and that free spirit degenerate into bigotry and intolerance in they treatment of other who have a equal claim with themselves to a freedom of private judgement and to the adoption or rejection of any peculiar form or mode of discipline it be hope that a story found on the history of these admirable but sometimes misguided man may prove interesting to many who have hitherto be but slightly acquaint with the fate of they self - exile countryman and may tend to remove the prejudice with which in many mind they be regard : for while we remember they error and infirmity we should also remember that they fault be essentially those of the age in which they live and the education they have receive while they virtue be derive from the pure faith that they possess and which be dearer to they than aught on earth beside king 's pyon house hereford the pilgrim of new england chapter i ` the break wave dash high on a stern and rock-hound coast : and the wood against a stormy sky they giant branch tost and the heavy night hang dark the hill and water o'er when a hand of exile moor they bark on the wild new england shore ' heman it be indeed a ` stern and rock-bound coast ' beneath which the gallant little mayflower furl she tattered sail and drop she anchor on the evening of the eleventh of November in the year 1620 the shore of new england have be for several day dimly descry by she passenger through the gloomy mist that hang over the dreary and uncultivated tract of land towards which they prow be turn but the heavy sea that dash against the rock the ignorance of the captain and he crew with regard to the nature of the coast and the crazy state of the deeply-laden vessel have hitherto prevent they make the land at length the ship be safely moor in a small inlet beyond the reach of the foam breaker and the pilgrim father hasten to leave the vessel in which they have so long be imprison and with they family to set foot on the land that be henceforth to be they home cold indeed be the welcome which they receive from they adopt country and cheerless be the view that meet they gaze as they land on a massy rock of granite at the foot of a precipitous cliff and look along the barren inhospitable shore and over the dark water which they have so lately cross but hope be strong in the heart of these exile and the faith that have lead they to seek these untrodden shore have not desert they during they long and tempestuous voyage and they look upward through the gloom and dreariness that surround they and fix they trusting eye on he who have guide they in safety over the great deep and bring they at length to a resting-place they first act be to kneel down on the cold rock and offer up they prayer and praise to that god for whose sake they have give up country and friend and home and to whose service they now dedicated themselves and they child : and strikingly grand must have be that act of worship the manly voice of the sturdy pilgrim rise in deep and solemn unison follow by those of the woman and child and resound along the silent coast while the heavy urge of the recede tide keep up a hoarse and monotonous accompaniment then arise a hymn of thanksgiving -- and the rock and the neighbor hill re-echo the exult strain that seem to drown the voice of the wind and the wave and to rise unmixed to heaven it be the triumph of faith -- the holy and heartfelt expression of undying trust and confidence in god surely at that time the pilgrim be meet object for the admiring gaze of man and angel but they be not always so it be on the shore of cape cod bay that the new settler have land in the inlet now call new plymouth harbor : but this be not the place of they original destination they have intend to steer for the mouth of hudson 's river and to have fix they habitation in that less expose and inhospitable district but the dutch have already conceive the project which they afterwards accomplish of settle in that part of the new continent and it be suppose that the captain of the mayflower be bribe by they to convey the english emigrant further to the north so that the first american land which they behold be cape cod they find that the place where they have land be beyond the precinct of the territory which have be grant to they and even beyond that of the company from which they derive they right of colonization and after explore hastily the neighbor coast and find it dreary and unpromising they again embark and insist on the captain 's convey they to the district which they have first desire to reach they sail to the south and many day be lose in endeavor to find a more convenient spot for they settlement : but it be in vain the shoal and the breaker with which the coast be line present obstacle that be insurmountable at that advanced and unusually inclement season and weary and disheartened they return to the place of they first landing there they fix they abode and there they found the infant city of new plymouth it be a desolate situation and one that subject the new settler to many trial and privation for the nearest english settlement then establish be upward of five hundred mile distant winter have set in with more than common severity they feel that no more time could be waste in seek for a better spot on which to build they first american habitation sickness also have begin to show itself among the little band of man woman and child who be all unaccustomed to the hardship and confinement of a long voyage and it be necessary to disembark with all possible speed and erect hut to shelter they from the daily increase inclemency of the weather for this purpose the forest of oak pine juniper and sassafras that have grow undisturbed for century along the coast furnish they with abundant material and the wood soon echo to the unaccustomed sound of the hatchet and the saw at which all the man of every rank and condition labor unremittingly while the woman and child gather up the great muscle and other shell-fish which abound on the shore and collect dry wood for firing but before we follow the settler in the detail of they suffering and trial and of they ultimate success and prosperity it will be needful to go back a few year and consider the motive that lead these brave man to expose themselves and they family to such severe hardship and to abandon they home and they kindred a brief glance at they previous history will suffice for this purpose it be well know that the puritan be greatly dissatisfy with the state of the church in england at the time when jame the first ascend the throne of this country from he they hope for protection and encouragement but in this expectation they be grievously disappoint the conference at hampton court prove how little sympathy he entertain for they party and the convocation which be hold soon after utterly all they hope already a considerable number of these dissenter have join themselves into what they call a _ ` church estate _ pledge to walk in god 's way ' and to renounce the evil passion of the world they have protest against the episcopal form of church government and declare they approval of the discipline and the form adopt by the church of geneva and also of that establish in the netherland in order to enjoy the liberty in ecclesiastical matter which they so greatly desire they make up they mind to retire to amsterdam under they excellent and respected pastor john robinson and this project be effect by the greater number of they party though some be discover before they could embark and be detain and imprison and treat with much severity ultimately however they all escape and remain unmolested at amsterdam and the hague until the year 16o8 when they remove to leyden with they pastor where they reside for eleven year and be join by many other who flee from england during the early part of the reign of jame these man now feel that they only hope of enjoy perfect religious liberty and of establish a church accord to they own dearly - love principle lay in a voluntary exile they english prejudice make they shrink from continue to dwell among the dutch who have hitherto give they a hospitable asylum for they fear that by frequent intermarriage they should eventually lose they nationality and they resolve to seek a new home where they might find a english colony and while they follow that mode of worship which be alone consistent with they view and principle might still be subject of the english crown and keep up a intercourse with the friend they dearly love and the land where they forefather have live and die the recent discovery of the vast continent of america in several part of which the british have already begin to form colony open to they a field of enterprise as well as a quiet refuge from persecution and controversy and thither the puritan turn they eye nor be they the first who have take advantage of the unoccupied waste of the new world and seek in they a asylum from intolerant oppression already a numerous band of french huguenot have retire thither under the conduct of they celebrated calvinistic leader de mont who be invest with the government of the district lie between montreal and philadelphium by a patent from he sovereign henry the fourth no trace of this colony now remain while those plant by the english puritan have take root in the american soil and flourish so greatly that a few year ago they descendant be find to amount to 4000000 : so remarkably have the blessing of god at least in temporal matter be bestow on a enterprise which be doubtless undertake in dependence on he protection and be carry out with that fortitude and resolution which be the result of sincere piety struggle with deep adversity -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- footnote : for this account of the cause which lead to the emigration of the puritan and the manner in which they effect it the authoress be chiefly indebted to marden 's ` history of the puritan ' and talvus 's ` history of the colonization of america ' -rrb- the idea of retire to the shore of america be first suggest to he follower by they pastor john robinson whose influence over he flock be almost unexampled this influence be derive from the purity of he life and the holy consistency of he conduct he be possess of a gentle temper and the strictness of he religious principle be unite with a spirit of toleration towards other which be too little feel or practice in those day and which be not as be too often the case change into bitterness by the suffering that he have himself experience well have it be for those who profess to be guide by he example and advice and who leave the shore of europe with the sanction of he counsel and he blessing if they have carry with they the truly christian spirit of they respect minister and have suffer that spirit to guide they in the formation and during the growth of they infant church in america but as we shall presently see this be not the case : the mercy and toleration which the puritan exile have vainly ask at the hand of they brethren at home they deny to other who differ from they and consequently while they have so greatly prosper in the thing of this world in religion they have evidently decline emigration be resolve on the first step that be take by the puritan be a application to king jame for a assurance of protection and toleration in the new home which they desire to seek but this be more than the wary king would guarantee to they all that they could obtain be a vague promise that so long as they conduct themselves peaceably they should not be molest and rely on this promise they immediately commence a negotiation with the virginian company for the possession of a tract of land within the limit of the patent which have be grant to they for colonize that part of america this be easily obtain for the society have hitherto only be able to occupy a few isolate spot of they extensive territory and therefore be willing to encourage fresh settler the congregation over which robinson preside amount at the time of they intended emigration to upward of three hundred in number but they resource be inadequate to the expense of move all together and it be therefore arrange that only a part of the flock should sail at first under the guidance of william brewster while the rest should remain at leyden under the care of they pastor and wait for the report of they friend before they follow they to they choose place of exile the name of the vessel which be engage to convey the pilgrim from the shore of europe be the mayflower and the speedwell -- name still cherish by heir descendant when they be ready for sea the whole congregation assemble themselves together and observe a solemn fast which conclude with prayer and robinson preach to they from ezra viii 21 : ` then i proclaim a fast there at the river of ahava that we might afflict ourselves before we god to seek of he a right way for we and for we little one and for all we substance ' he afterwards address they in a deeply impressive speech in which he earnestly deprecate all party spirit and bigotry and exhort they to be guide only by the pure doctrine of god 's word ' i charge you ' say this truly christian and evangelical minister ` that you follow I no further than you have see I follow the lord jesus christ the lord have more truth yet to break forth out of he holy word i can not sufficiently bewail the condition of the reform church which be come to a period in religion and will go at present no further than the instrument of they reformation luther and calvin be great and shine light in they time yet they penetrate not into the whole counsel of god the lutheran can not be draw to go beyond what luther saw and the calvinist you see stick fast where they be leave by that great man of god -lrb- \* -rrb- i beseech you remember it -- ` tis a article of you church covenant -- that you shall be ready to receive whatever truth shall be make know to you from the word of god ' -lrb- footnote : see ` remark on the danger of the church ' by rev edward bickersteth -rrb- the congregation then repair to the house of they pastor and partook of a farewell repast together after which they proceed to delft harbor and there the pilgrim embark again they minister offer up fervent prayer in behalf of this portion of he flock who be about to encounter the danger of a long voyage and to seek a home in a almost unknown land -- and then in deep silence they part ` no cheer or noisy acclamation resound along the shore for such demonstration be little in accordance with the usual serious habit of the puritan and still less so with the feeling of sadness which now oppress they heart but a volley of small shot and three piece of ordnance ' write winslow one of the emigrant ` announce to those on shore the hearty courage and affectionate adieus of those on board and so lift up we hand to one another and we heart to the lord we depart ' thus the pilgrim set sail with mingled feeling of hope for the future and regret for what they leave behind and greatly would they sorrow have be increase have they know that they would never again behold on earth the countenance of they much-loved pastor they fully anticipate he follow they with the rest of they brethren as soon as they should have find a suitable place of settlement for the whole congregation but poverty and other obstacle detain he in europe and he terminate he useful and exemplary life at leyden the emigrant have not proceed far on they voyage when it be discover that the mayflower command by captain jone be in need of some repair and the two vessel put into dartmouth -- not to sail together again the captain of the speedwell declare that he be afraid to encounter the voyage and from this or some other motive he positively refuse to proceed any further several of the passenger also have already begin to feel disheartened and they return with he to london and abandon the enterprise altogether doubtless the pilgrim bad no cause to lament the departure of these faint-hearted comrade but it occasion they much present inconvenience for not be able to procure another vessel to convey the remainder of the passenger who have embark in the speedwell they be all oblige to be crowd into the mayflower which sail again on the sixth of September 1620 with considerably upward of a hundred man woman and child on she narrow deck in addition to she own crew of seaman after a very tedious and tempestuous voyage they come in sight of the american shore on the eighth of November and as we have already see they land three day afterwards in cape cod bay and eventually found the city of new plymouth at the place of they disembarkation a portion of the granite rock on which the pilgrim father first set foot have since be remove from the coast and place in front of ' ` the pilgrim 's hall ' enclose in a iron railing and the anniversary of they landing afterwards call forefather 's - day have ever since be observe by they descendant as a day of solemn festivity in remembrance of the mercy of providence which lead they safely through so many difficulty and danger and permit they to find a new home and a new country and to bring they enterprise to such a prosperous issue it be with the first period of they establishment on the uncultivated shore of north america that we story commence and it be connect with the suffering and privation which be so patiently endure and the difficulty which be so resolutely overcome by these devoted man before they have take root in they new settlement or gather around themselves and they family the comfort which they have abandon in they own land for conscience sake many trial await they ere prosperity become they portion and ere they could feel either rest or security in the wild region where they have seek a refuge : and these trial will be bring more distinctly to we mind if we view they in connection with some of the individual of the expedition and follow the fortune of one family more particularly this family we will call by the name of maitland and endeavor in they somewhat imaginary history to describe the mode of life and some of the joy and sorrow -- the difficulty and success -- of the pilgrim father owe to the many delay which the emigrant have experience a severe winter have set in before they land and have fix a spot for they permanent abode and they find themselves expose to the inclemency of a north climate with no other shelter than a few tent besides that which the vessel continue to afford in haste they fell the tree of the neighbor forest and in haste they construct the village of log hut which be to be they present abode and which ultimately grow into the flourish and wealthy city of new plymouth in the erection of this hamlet no head be so fertile in plan and expedient and no arm be so strong to execute they as those of rodolph maitland the head of the family in whom we be specially interested he be a younger member of a very respectable family in the north of england and have pass he youth and early manhood in the service of he country as a soldier this profession however become distasteful to he when the religious dissension which trouble the land call on he at time to obey he commander in carry out scheme of oppression which be contrary both to he feeling and he principle he marriage with helen seatown the daughter of a nonconforming minister increase he repugnance to bear arm which might be turn against the party to which he be now so closely connected and he throw up he commission and soon afterwards accompany he father-in-law to holland and join the congregation of the respect robinson at leyden here he continue to reside until the resolution to emigrate be form by the puritan refugee when he be among the first to embrace the proposition of the pastor and to lend all the aid which he comparative wealth and the influence of he connection in england enable he to offer in furtherance of the enterprise he father-in - law have die soon after he arrival at leyden but he amiable and devoted wife be most willing to follow he in he voluntary exile and to take she child to the new world where she hope to bring they up in the same principle of pure evangelical religion which she have learn from she own parent and which be dearer to she than home or friend or aught on earth besides at the time when the pilgrim reach america the maitland 's family consist of two son henrich and ludovico the elder of whom be sixteen year of age and the younger about seven and one little girl between ten and eleven name edith in the thoughtful seriousness of he eldest boy which be unite with great intelligence and spirit and a manly resolution beyond he year rodolph see he own character again depict and helen proudly hope that she henrich would one day manifest all those quality of mind and person by which he father have first win she admiration and love and by which he have since gain the esteem and affection of all who be in any way connect with he henrich be now old enough to understand and almost to appreciate the motive which have induce he parent and they companion to become exile from home : and he young heart exult in the resolution that free he from the cold formality of dutch manners and open to he adventurous spirit a prospect of liberty and enterprise far better suit to he inclination and character religious freedom he desire because he have be teach that it be he rightful privilege and that the want of it have occasion those trouble which first drive he parent and friend from they native land but personal freedom he yearn for with he whole soul and the wild shore of new england and the depths of the unexplored forest that now meet he eager gaze fill he ardent mind with anticipation of adventurous joy hitherto unknown to he these anticipation be destine to be fulfil ere long in a manner which he neither foresaw nor desire he brother ludovico be a playful child too young to share all the feeling of the earnest henrich who always act as he guide and protector during they sport and ramble but in the gentle little edith he find a kindred spirit and a heart that could sympathize in all he joy and sorrow young as she be edith feel the influence of she brother 's character and she look up to he with feeling of devoted love and admiring pride she be he constant companion and he ever-ready assistant in all he difficulty this have be very much the case during they residence in holland but on they arrival in new england edith be leave still more to she brother 's guidance they parent be necessarily too much occupy with the care end anxiety which they new situation bring upon they to devote much time to they child and when the light labor in which henrich and edith be able to render any assistance be over they and ludovico amuse themselves by wander along the shore in search of shell and seaweed or else they follow the wood-cutter into the forest to seek for such flowering plant as still be to be find in the more sheltered spot and to transplant they to the garden that be to surround and embellish they rude dwelling as soon as a tolerable shelter have be obtain by the erection of a sufficient number of log-hut to contain the family of the settler it be resolve that a party of man should go on a explore expedition and endeavor to ascertain the nature and resource of the coast on which they have land and also whether it be inhabit by any tribe of native indian hitherto they have see no human being and they have remain undisturbed possessor of the soil but they could hardly expect that this state of thing would long continue and they be anxious if possible to discover the native inhabitant and natural possessor of the country and to establish friendly relation with they sixteen of the pilgrim volunteer for this expedition head by rodolph maitland whose military experience and superior intelligence well fit he to be the leader of the party the rest of the man remain to protect they family and to complete the village which already present a very respectable appearance and promise to afford a tolerably comfortable residence to the new settler until they should have leisure and mean to erect dwelling more in accordance with they previous habit of life the government of the little colony be unanimously confide to john carver who be elect president for one year but he do not live long to exercise he authority or to enjoy the confidence repose in he by he fellow-settler during the short period however that he be spare to they he exert himself successfully to promote the welfare of the community and to preserve peace and unanimity among the member of which it be compose and before the departure of the explore party he call on all the pilgrim father to sign a covenant which have be draw up during the voyage and which contain a statement of the peculiar religious principle of the congregation and also of the mode of civil government that they propose to establish in the colony this government be not to be independent of the mother country for the pilgrim regard themselves as still be the subject of king jame and the patent which they have procure to enable they to settle in new england be grant by the company to whom the king have assign the right of colonize that part of north america they therefore intend to be govern mainly by english law and to keep up a constant and intimate connection with they english brethren it may be well here to mention that they plan of civil government consist in the election of a governor or president by general vote and of seven counselor to assist he the only privilege grant to the president be that he vote count double this state of thing continue for eighteen year after which time the growth of the colony render a change expedient and each new town that be found send delegate to a general court it would however be useless here to follow the political change of these early settler as it be only with they first form of government that we story be concerned accord to the habitual custom of the pilgrim the sabbath which precede the send forth this band of spy to search the land be observe with the utmost solemnity for no press of occupation -- no necessity for haste -- ever induce they to neglect this duty for the liberty of practice they own mode of worship they have seek these shore and have be permit safely to reach they they use that liberty and be never unmindful of they religious privilege every sabbath be a day of sacred rest and every undertaking be sanctify by prayer sometimes even as we shall have occasion to observe when the undertaking be such as could hardly be suppose to deserve the blessing of god still there be every reason to believe that they piety as a body be sincere and while we condemn the sternness and severity into which they be too frequently betray we must yield we heartfelt approbation to the self-denying resolution and unflinching faith that be they govern principle and they ever - actuate motive well have these principle and motive be describe by a late well-known poet and well may we conclude this introductory chapter with the last verse of that exquisite song with the first of which we commence it : ` what seek they thus afar bright jewel of the mine the wealth of sea the spoil of war they seek a faith 's pure shrine aye -- call it holy ground the soil where first they tread they have leave unstain would what there they find -- freedom to worship god ' chiapter ii ` in much patience in affliction in necessity in distress ... as have nothing and yet possess all thing ' -- 2 cor vi 4 10 ` be it not much that i may worship he with naught my spirit 's breathing to control and feel he presence in the vast and dim and whisper wood where die thunder roll from the far cat ` ract ' heman with some anxiety the settlers see the explore party set out on they hazardous enterprise the season be far advance and drift snowstorm give warning of the inclement winter that be rapidly set in still it be deem necessary to make some investigation into the nature of the country and to endeavor to obtain if possible a supply of provision before the increase severity of the weather should render it impracticable to do so but above all it be desirable to ascertain what native tribe dwell in the vicinity of the settlement and to use every means to establish friendly relation with they not only because such a course would be most in accordance with the principle of the gospel which the emigrant profess to hold and to practice but also because in the present state of the infant colony they be altogether unprepared to resist any attack that might be make on they by a large body of indian maitland lead he party inland at first and for two day they see no trace or human inhabitant but on the afternoon of the third day as they be look about for a convenient spot on which to encamp for the night some large and apparently artificial mound of earth be observe scatter over a open glade in the forest at the first glance they appear like dwelling place and know something of the habit of the indian rodolph and two of he companion approach they warily fear to surprise and irritate the inhabitant but after make a circuit and ascertain that these suppose hut have no doorway they go up to they and find they to be solid mound at the foot of which neatly plait basket fill with ear of maize be place these be eagerly seize upon and a further search be make several warlike and agricultural implement be discover bury beneath the surface of the earth it be evident that these mound be native grave and that they have recently be visit by the tribe to which they belong who most probably reside in the neighborhood therefore to avoid exciting they displeasure and jealousy rodolph cause all the weapon and other tool to be restore to they place and in exchange for the corn which be too much need to be leave behind he put into the basket several string of bead and other trifle with which he be provide for the purpose of barter or as present to the native it do not appear either safe or desirable to remain near a spot so sacred to the indian the party therefore move further into the depth of the forest where they erect they tent which consist merely of blanket support on pole and lighting large fire they sleep by turn while half they number keep a vigilant watch they rest be however undisturbed either by lurk indian or by prowl beast of prey and at day-break they resume they march in the hope of discover the native camp but they search be in vain and rodolph determine to leave the forest and return to the settlement along the shore hope there to find some trace of the native before he and he comrade leave the shelter of the wood they fire they musket at the small game which abound in every direction partly with a view to supply themselves with food and partly to attract the notice of any straggle indian who might be wander near and who would conduct they to they wigwam but the echo be the only sound that answer they report and it be clear that no native camp be within hear the place where maitland and he little band reach the coast be nearly twenty league from the settlement towards the north and have since be know by the name of angoum here they find two empty hut contain all the curiously-worked utensil use by the indian of that district -- bowl tray and dish form of calabash and carve wood or bark and beautiful basket construct of crabshell ingeniously work together with well-woven mat of grass and bulrush dye of various brilliant color the inhabitant have probably go on a fishing expedition and would return in a few day as they have leave behind they a considerable quantity of dry acorn which at that period form a common article of food with these child of the forest rodolph suffer nothing to be take from the hut but proceed along the coast in a southerly direction and at length he perceive two canoe at a considerable distance from the shore contain several indian who take no notice of the signal they make but row rapidly away on a opposite course find it useless to linger any longer in this part of the bay maitland lead he party back to the settlement at new plymouth take accurate observation of the line of coast and communicate to president carver all the information that he have be able to collect this be not very satisfactory and the governor resolve to send out a second party well arm who should proceed in the shallop to the southern part of cape cod bay this expedition be place under the command of captain standish who be regard as the military chief of the settler and maitland again form one of the number on this occasion he obtain permission to take henrich with he as he wish the boy to become early inure to the hardship and privation which it would probably be he lot to bear for many year and also to acquire habit of courage and vigilance that might be of service to he hereafter henrich be delighted with this arrangement which gratify he desire for adventure and also prove that he father now place some confidence in he and no longer regard he as a mere child he astonishment be great when first he behold the whale those huge and fearful-looking monster of the ocean lift they gigantic head above the wave and lash the surface to foam with they powerful tail or eject vast spout of water like fountain from they upraised head these and many other strange object attract he attention as the boat move down the bay but all be forget in the absorb interest with which he regard for the first time the wild red man that meet he view as the boat near the shore at a spot about eight league from new plymouth call by the pilgrim _ thievish harbor _ several of these savage in they strange attire of skin and feather and weave grass show themselves among the rock that stand above the landing-place but regardless of the peaceful sign that be make to they by captain standish and he crew they hastily retreat and when the party disembark not a indian be to be see with much circumspection the captain advance at the head of he resolute band who all hold they musket ready for action if self-defense should compel they to use they but with a positive order from they commander to refrain from any act of hostility so long as it be possible to do so this command could not however be long obey for as the party proceed through the rock and stunt tree that line the coast they come in sight of a burial ground similar to that which have be discover in the first expedition except that in this case the mound of earth be enclose by a strong palisade of upright pole bind together firmly at the top through the interstice of these pole standish and he man see the glittering eye of the savage watch they approach and before they could decide whether to advance or retreat a shower of arrow be discharge several of which take effect though not mortally this wanton aggression rouse the spirit of the sturdy englishman and regardless of the effort which captain standish make to restrain they a volley of musket ball instantly reply to the challenge of the red man and the wild cry that arise from the cemetery plainly tell that they have not speed in vain even rodolph maitland be surprise out of he usual calm resolution and presence of mind for he see he son fall bleed to the ground pierce through the leg by a arrow and almost involuntarily he fire off he musket at a indian whose body be more expose than the rest and whose greater profusion of ornament show he to be one of they chief warrior rodolph see he fall from the palisade on which he have climb to take a better aim at the white man and instantly a gate be open in the enclosure and with a hideous yell the savage rush forth brandish they spear and battle-axis and shout they war-cry ` woach woach ha ha hach woach ' they number appear to be about thirty man and standish know that he party several of whom be already slightly wound could not resist the fury of they attack he therefore give the word for a instant retreat to the boat as the only means of safety he gallant band would gladly have press on and meet the savage in close combat but they have promise to obey they leader and reluctantly they follow he to the shore the path by which they have emerge on the burial-place be narrow and wind and they be soon hide from the sight of the indian but they hear they wild whoop among the rock and bush and know that they be in eager pursuit maitland have catch up he wounded boy in he arm and now bear he rapidly forward but the weight of he burden and the roughness of the way retard he step and powerful as he be he could not keep up with he comrade who be unconscious that he have fall behind they he think of he wife -- of henrich 's mother -- and he pat forth he utmost strength still the war cry come nearer and nearer and henrich who have hitherto utter no sound of pain or word of complaint exclaim wildly -- ` father i see they there -- there -- they have enter the thicket and one have climb the rock and will soon overtake we o father fly for he battle-axe be lift up and he eye glare terribly ' maitland 's heart beat furiously he could not pause or turn to look at the come foe but he quick and ready mind be active in devise some means of save the life of he child ` load my gun henrich ' he exclaim ' i can not long continue this speed be steady and be quick : we life depend upon it ' the gallant boy instantly obey the difficult command and the instant it be do rodolph drop on one knee support he bleeding son on the other and take a deliberate aim at the indian who be prepare to leap from the rock into the path behind they he fire the upraised arm of the savage fall powerless -- the heavy axe drop from he hand -- and fall forward over the rock he lay expire in the narrow pathway the feathery coronet of several of he comrade be see above the bush at some distance : and again the father raise he son who now hang fainting in he arm and hurry with renew speed towards the shore as he near it he meet two of he companion who have reach the boat have miss he and henrich and hasten back to secure they retreat it be a seasonable reinforcement for rodolph 's strength be fail he he give he boy into the arm of one of he friend and load he gun he stand with the other to defend the passage to the shore the savage come on and the white man fire and retreat load as they fall back and again firing until they pursuer either wound or dishearten come to a stand still and contented themselves with yell they discordant war-cry and shooting arrow which happily miss they aim the whole party embark safely and be soon beyond the reach of the missile which the indian continue to discharge and maitland have the joy of see young henrich speedily recover he sens and he spirit too it be evident that the arrow use by the red man on this occasion be not poison and no great or permanent evil be likely to arise from any of the wound receive but a spirit of hostility have be establish between the settler and the nausett tribe to which they assailant belong and rodolph be a marked man and a object of determine revenge to all who have share in the conflict the spot where it take place be name _ the first encounter _ in memory of the event and long retain that name : and the consequence of this first combat prove to be equally calamitous to the savage and to they more civilized foe for many subsequent year the explore party return to they settlement as speedily as possible be anxious to obtain medical relief for the wound helen maitland and she child be wander on the shore when the boat first come in sight and for several evening the desolate coast have be she constant haunt after the necessary labor of the day be complete it have be with much reluctance that she have consent to she husband 's wish of take henrich on the hazardous expedition and he being of the party have greatly increase the anxiety and uneasiness which rodolph 's absence always cause she as the day pass on this anxiety become greater and vision of fatal encounter with the savage beset she naturally timid mind daily therefore she leave she hut and wrap in the mantle of fur with which she husband have provide she before he bring she to brave a north american winter she pace backwards and forwards on the beach look out over the dark water and lift she heart in prayer for the safe and speedy return of the wanderer edith and ludovico accompany she but they could not share she anxiety they look indeed with eagerness for the expect boat which be to bring back they much-loved father and brother but they soon forget the object of they search and amuse themselves by climb the rock and gather the shell which the wintry wave now cast up in abundance they be thus engage when edith happen to glance to the south and see the long desire come round a little promontory that conceal it from she mother as she walk below in a instant the treasure of shell and seaweed be forget and little edith be bound down to the beach follow by ludovico ` the boat mother the boat ' she eagerly exclaim as she point in the direction in which it be approach and in another moment she and she little brother be at helen 's side and all hasten to the landing-place -- that very granite rock on which they have first disembark on the american shore the boat come rear and as soon as the crew perceive helen and the child on the rock they raise a hearty cheer to tell she that all be well she see she husband standing on the prow and she heart bound with joy but she look for henrich and she do not see he and fear mingle with she joy a few more stroke of the oar and the boat glide up to the rock and rodolph leap on shore and embrace he wife and child ` heaven be praise you be safe my rodolph ' exclaim helen ` but where be henrich -- where be my boy ' ` he also be safe helen he life be preserved but he be wound and unable to come from the boat to meet you bear up ' he add see that she tremble violently while the tear flow down she blanched cheek ` you need not fear : the brave boy be maim indeed but i trust not seriously injured he be weak from loss of blood and must not be agitate therefore meet he cheerfully and then hasten to make the arrangement for he comfort that you scanty means will permit ' helen dry she tear and force a smile to greet she wounded child who be now be lift from the bottom of the boat and gently carry on shore by two of the man he pallid countenance and blood - stain garment strike a chill to she heart but she conceal she grief and silence the sob and exclamation of the warm-hearted little edith and she terrify brother and then have affectionately welcome the almost faint boy she hurry away with the child to prepare for he reception in the comfortless log-hut assist by janet -- the faithful servant who have nurse she child and follow she from england to holland and from holland to america -- she soon arrange a bed for they patient and henrich smile cheerfully though languidly when he find himself again beneath the humble roof that be now he home and surround by all whom he love he wound prove to be a severe one -- more so than he father have imagine and the loss of blood have be so considerable that he be reduce to extreme weakness now it be that helen feel the absence of all the comfort and even luxury to which she have be accustom from childhood but of whose loss she have hitherto never complain henrich 's illness prove a very long and painful one and notwithstanding the kindness of all she friend and the attention pay by the rest of the settler to the young patient -- who be a general favorite -- it be difficult to procure for he either the food or the medical attendance that he case require : and frequently he parent fear that a foreign grave would soon be all that would remain to they of they dearly-loved child to add to they anxiety and distress a epidemic disease of which some sign have appear in the settlement before the explore party set out now increase to a fearful degree the store which have be bring out in the crowded mayflower be nearly expend except such a stock as captain jone consider necessary for the voyage back to england : and a great scarcity of bread begin to be feel the animal which they procure by the gun and the chase be not sufficient to supply the want of the settler and famine -- actual famine -- stare they in the face and increase the violence of the pestilence many sink beneath the accumulate evil of hardship privation and sickness and the number of the little settlement be sadly reduce during the inclement month of January and February the constant care which be bestow on henrich at length prove effectual in heal he wound and partially restore he strength and he parent have eventually the happiness of see that the a anger be past and they son be restore to they they also have cause to acknowledge with gratitude that the affliction have be bless to he as well as to themselves the elder of the community who act as the pastor of the infant colony be unwearied in they attention to they weaker and more distressed brethren they be indeed the physician both of they body and soul and henrich be not neglect by they the excellent and venerable william brewster be the intimate and value friend of rodolph maitland and he wife he have be both they friend and adviser for many year of comparative peace and prosperity and now that he share they trouble and adversity he ready sympathy and active kindness render he dearer to they than ever brewster be a man whose character and position in life naturally give he great influence with the pilgrim father he have receive a liberal education and possess a far greater knowledge of the world than the generality of he companion in exile have be bring up as a diplomatist under davison when he be secretary of state to queen elisabeth he be devote to the cause of religious liberty and it be he who have assist he friend john robinson in withdraw he congregation from the persecution that threaten they in england to a peaceful asylum in holland at the time of the emigration to america he be already in the decline of life but he energy be in no degree weaken and he zeal for the glory of god and the good of he fellow christian be unabated he desire to spend all he remain year in promote the welfare of the colony and in proclaim the gospel to the heathen and while he be ever mindful of the want both spiritual and temporal of the flock ever whom he be appoint to preside until they pastor robinson could join they he never forget the grand object of he voluntary exile or cease to pray that the lord would be please to open ' a great door and effectual ' before he and enable he to bring many of the savage and ignorant native into the fold of christ in all these plan he be warmly second by edward winslow but hitherto no such opening have appear and the sickness and distress which prevail in the settlement give full occupation to they and to they brother elder during all the period of henrich 's tedious illness not a day pass in which brewster do not visit the suffering boy to cheer he to soothe he and above all to prepare he for that better world to which he then believe he be surely hasten to these visit henrich look forward with delight and often when domestic business call away he mother and janet the minister would remain with he for hour seat on a low stool by of he bed and read to he or talk to he in a strain so holy and yet so cheerful that edith would leave she work and softly seat herself on henrich 's couch that she might catch he every word while little ludovico would cease from he noisy sport and creep up on the good man 's knee and fix he large soft eye on he sweet and noble countenance these hour be not unimproved by henrich he character be form and he principle be fix and he mind and spirit grow strong and ripe beyond he year never be these hour of peaceful happiness forget and often amid the strange and stir scene which it be he lot in after-life to witness and to share do he bless the over - rule providence of god which have lay he on a bed of pain and weakness that he might learn lesson of piety and of usefulness which otherwise he would never have acquire it be while they be thus happily engage one afternoon when henrich be slowly recover he strength that the elder and he young audience be startle by wild and discordant sound mingle with cry of fear which proceed from the outskirts of the straggle village and seem to be approach henrich raise himself on he bed and a look of terror overspread he countenance as he exclaim : ` it be the war cry of the savage o i know it well go mr brewster fly save my mother i will follow you ' and the brave boy try to leap from the couch and reach he father 's sword which hang against the wooden wall of he chamber but it be in vain the wounded leg refuse to bear he weight and he be force to relinquish he design brewster however snatch the sword and draw it rush from the hut leave edith and ludovico cling with tremble hand around they brother henrich 's fear prove but too true no sooner have the elder traverse the enclosure that surround maitland 's dwelling than he behold helen and several of the other woman who have go out to assist they husband in the lighter part of they agricultural labor fly in terror and confusion to they hut while the man be engage in close combat with a party of native indian the same war-cry which have ring on they ear in the first encounter tell rodolph and he comrade that these savage be of the same tribe and probably the same individual from whom they have escape with such difficulty on that occasion they be right for it be indeed a band of the nausett who head by they chief have come to seek revenge for the loss they have sustain at they former meeting the warrior whom rodolph 's musket have lay low be tekoa the only son of the nausett chief and he be resolve that the white man 's blood should flow to expiate the deed he know that the son of the stranger who have slay he young warrior have be wound and as he hope mortally but that do not suffice for he revenge and he have either suddenly attack the settlement in the hope of secure either rudolph himself or some of he comrade that he might shed the white man 's blood on the grave of he son and tear off they scalp as trophy of victory the settler who now contend with the savage be but few in number for many of the man lay sick and many have die and they be mostly unarmed except with they agricultural implement rudolph and a few other have short sword or dirk attach to they girdle and with these they deal blow that tell with deadly effect on the half-naked body of they foe and the good broad-sword that brewster quickly place in maitland 's hand be not long in discomfiting several of the indian who have single he out at the command of they chief as the special object of they attack meanwhile many of the woman and such of the invalid as have power to rise have again leave the hut and bear to they husband and friend the arm which have be leave in they dwelling and in spite of the arrow and dart of the indian by which several of they be wound they continue to load the gun for the combatant while the conflict last happily this be not long the _ fire-breathing _ musket strike terror into the ignorant savage and when two or three of they number have fall they turn to fly first however catch up the body of they comrade which they carry off to ensure they honorable burial and to save they from the indignity which they suppose the pale-face would heap on the dead in vain they chief endeavor to rally they and compel they to return to the conflict in vain he wave he battle-axe on high and shout he war-whoop woach woach ha ha hach woach ' a panic have seize he follower and they flee precipitately into the forest from they have issue so suddenly and so fiercely to the attack one warrior stand alone by the chief he be young and handsome but he countenance be dark and sinister and a expression of cunning be strongly mark in he glitter deep-set eye and overhang brow he see that it be hopeless to contend any longer with the powerful stranger and by word and action he be evidently persuade the chief to retire the settler have cease to fire the moment that they enemy flee and there be a deep silence while every eye be fix on the striking figure of the enraged chief whose every feature be distort by excited passion he stand with he tomahawk uplift and he tall and muscular figure in a attitude of command and defiance while in a loud and distinct voice he utter a vow of vengeance the word of which be unintelligible to the settler though the meaning could easily be guess from he look and gesture then he hang he battle-axe to he gaudy belt and point he hand at rodolph he retire slowly and majestically like a lion discomfited but not subdue to seek he people and to upbraid they with they cowardice this attack of the indian effectually destroy all feeling of security in the mind of the settler henceforth they be oblige like the jew of old to go to they labor every man with he sword gird to he side and continually to hold themselves in readiness for a sudden assault the pestilence continue to rage and the scarcity of food increase to such a degree that for several week no bread be to be be in the settlement the governor mr carver exert himself with zeal and benevolence to lesser the misery of he people but with so little effect that when the spring at length set in and the captain of the mayflower prepare to return to england the little band of settler be find to be reduce to one half the original number and these be weaken by illness and by want of proper nourishment but great as be they difficulty and suffering they faith and resolution never fail and when the mayflower again set sail for england not one of the fifty emigrant who remain express a desire to return chapter iii ` what man be they of dark-brown color with sunny redness wild of eye they tinged brow so smooth as never yet anxiety nor busy thought have make a furrow there soon the courteous guise of man not purport nor fear ill win confidence : they wild distrustful look assume a milder meaning madoc we have say that the band of the exile be reduce to half the number that have six month before leave the shore of europe so full of hope and of holy resolution and still in spite of all they outward trial and difficulty the hope and the resolution of the survivor be as high and as firm as ever they trust in the god whom they have serve so faithfully and they know that in he own good time he would give they deliverance but they day of darkness be not yet over the inclemency of the winter have indeed pass away and the face of nature begin to smile upon they yet sickness still prevail and the many grave that rise on the spot which they have choose for a burial ground daily remind they of the loss that almost every family have already sustain the grief that have thus be bring upon they by death be also greatly aggravate by the harass attack of the indian who be evidently still lurk in the neighbor wood and who now frequently come in small party and commit depredation of every kind that lay in they power they real but conceal object be to capture rodolph either alive or dead for nothing short of he destruction or at least that of some member of he family could satisfy the bereaved chief for the loss of he son he therefore leave a party of he bravest and most subtle warrior in a encampment about a day 's journey from the christian village with order to make frequent visit to the settlement and leave no means untried which either force or cunning could suggest that might lead to the full gratification of he revenge the old chief himself return to he wigwam which lay some distance from new plymouth near the burial ground where the ` first encounter ` have take place the detachment be leave under the command end guidance of coubitant the young warrior who have stand by he to the last in the conflict at the village and who be since the death of tisquantum 's son regard as the most distinguish of the young brave of that part of the tribe over which the sachem rule he cunning and he ferocious courage well fit he for the task assign to he and as the young warrior who fall at ` the first encounter ' have be he choose friend and companion in arm he own desire for vengeance be only second to that of the chief and the malignant gaze which he have fix on rodolph when he lead tisquantum from the field well express the feeling and the determination of he heart that glance have be see by janet who on that occasion have display a courage and resolution hardly to be expect at she advanced age she have easily induce she tremble mistress to remain in the house whither they have both flee at the first attack of the indian but she have herself return to the place of conflict bearing rodolph 's musket and ammunition and she bad remain by the side of brewster to whose ready hand she transfer it until all danger be over then she have fix she attention on the chief and he companion and the fine form and handsome feature of the young indian warrior appear like a statue of bronze while he stand motionless by tisquantum but when he turn to follow he chief the expression with which he look at rodolph transform he countenance into that of a demoniac janet never forget that look the state of continual watchfulness and suspense in which the emigrant be keep by they wary and active foe be extremely harass to they weakened force so much so that the president resolve to make another attempt to establish a friendly intercourse with some other native tribe who might possibly assist they in drive of ' the nausett and whose friendship would also be useful to they in various way a opportunity for this attempt soon present itself for a party of the settler in follow the winding of a brook that flow through they new town into the sea in pursuit of wild fowl come upon two large and beautiful lake about three mile inland the shore of these lake be adorn with clump of lofty and majestic tree and the grass be spangled with wild flower and stud with graceful shrub and underwood among the bush they descry several fallow deer and the surface of the water be animated by flock of water fowl among which the brilliant and graceful wood duck be conspicuous but the object that chiefly attract the notice of the sportsman be several wigwam that stand on the further side of the lake beneath the shade of some overhang tree in front of these hut the hall-naked child be play while the woman be pursue they domestic occupation some be weave basket and mat and other wash they fishing net in the lake but no man be to be see and rodolph who as usual lead the hunting party determine to approach the wigwam in order to show he peaceful intention be give he musket to one of he companion and invite he friend winslow to do the same and to accompany he he proceed round the lake as soon as the woman perceive they they utter wild cry of fear and snatch up they child attempt to escape into the thicket behind they hut rodolph and winslow then start in pursuit and succeed in capture one little copper-colored fellow who be endeavor to keep pace with he mother she could not carry he for she have already a infant in she arm and she know not that he be in the power of they dreaded pursuer until she reach the thicket and look back for she boy he be struggle violently in maitland 's hand but not a cry escape he lip and when he find all he effort to free himself be vain he give up the attempt and stand motionless with a look of proud endurance that be highly characteristic of he race he mother have less fortitude she utter a shriek that pierce the heart of rodolph and lay she infant on the grass she almost forget she own fear and in a implore attitude creep forward towards she imaginary foe while she eloquent eye plead for she child 's release more than any word could have do maitland could not resist that appeal he only detain the boy until he have hang round he neck several string of gaily-colored bead with which the hunter be always provide and then he set he at liberty in a instant the child be in he mother 's arm and when she passionate caress have express she joy she wave with a graceful salutation to the englishman and bent to the ground in token of gratitude then she look at the bead and she white tooth glitter as she smile a sunny smile of delight and admiration at what seem to she such priceless treasure rodolph draw from the pouch which hang at he leathern belt a string of bead more brilliant still and hold they towards the woman she gaze at they and then at the frank and open countenance of the stranger and fear give way to the desire of possess the offer gift she slowly approach hold she child by the hand and suffer rodolph to suspend the gaudy necklace round she graceful and slender throat then she motion to he to remain and run swiftly to the thicket to bring back she companion who have pause in they flight and be now watch with eager eye the action of the white man she persuasion and the sight of she newly-acquired ornament soon overcome the remain fear of she auditor and all return in a body smile and extend they hand in the hope of receive similar gift maitland and winslow who have now join he divide all they store of trinket among the eager applicant and then in return make sign request to be permit to enter the wigwam this request be accede to and apannow -- for that be the name of the female who have first approach the stranger -- lead the way to the hut in the center of the village which be larger and better appoint than any one of the rest it be evidently the dwelling of the chief of the tribe and the beautifully carve implement which hang to the wall and the skull and scalp that adorn the roof show that its possessor be a distinguished warrior apannow bring forth the best refreshment that she hut afford and place it with a native grace before she guest invite they to partake of it and first tasting of each article herself to show that it be harmless she gentle and intelligent manners greatly interested rudolph and he companion and by degree they succeed in obtain from she and the other woman who crowd the wigwam such information as they chiefly desire by expressive sign and gesture they be make to understand that all the red man be go on a fishing expedition to the head of the further lake and would not return until the morrow they afterwards learn also that the village have only be occupy for a few day as it be merely the summer residence of a part of the tribe of the wampanoge indian who with they chief annually repair to that beautiful station for the purpose of fishing in the extensive lake the rest of the tribe be located in various place to the west occupy the district since know as the state of rhode island maitland and winslow take leave of they new friend intimate that they would return and seek a interview with the chief in two day and bear with they a supply of fish and dry maize which they receive from apannow as a pledge of amity and which they know would be most welcome to the invalid who be still suffer from disease at the settlement they quickly rejoin the rest of they comrade who have remain at a distance for fear of alarming the timid indian female and all return to new plymouth the intelligence they bring and the seasonable refreshment they bear to the sick be joyfully welcome by the whole community and the spirit of the settler rise at the prospect of secure indian friend and ally who might under they present distressing circumstance afford they such essential help and security the necessity for such aid have lately become more urgent than ever for a party of they untiring enemy the nausett have very recently invade the enclosure within which lay the loved remain of all who bad perish since they arrival in america the grave be sadly numerous and the sorrowing survivor have reverently deck the mound that cover they with shrub and green bough from the evergreen that abound in the neighbor wood as emblem of they abide grief and also of they immortal hope these mark of affectionate regard the savage have rudely tear away and not content with this they have even in some instance remove the fresh-laid turf and dig up the earth so as to expose the coffin that lay beneath no other injury or outrage could have so deeply wound the feeling or arouse the indignation of the emigrant as this desecration of the home of the dead and they earnestly desire to form some alliance with another tribe which might enable they to punish and to prevent such gross and wanton indignity in the meantime in the hope of avoid a recurrence of so distressing a calamity the colonist plough over the whole surface of they cemetery and sow it with corn thus conceal what be to they so sacred from the eye of they wild and ruthless foe the day after maitland 's visit to the wigwam the emigrant be astonish at the appearance of a fine athletic indian arm with a bow and arrow who walk up to the common hall near the center of the village and salute the governor and those who be with he in the word ` welcome englishman ' in reply to they eager inquiry he inform they that he name be samoset and that he be ' a sagamore of a northern tribe of indian dwelling near the coast of maine where he have acquire a slight knowledge of the english language from the fisherman who frequent the island of monhiggon near that shore he have be for several month reside among the wampanoge and on the return of the chief and he follower to the wigwam he have hear from the squaw-sachem that two stranger who from she account he conclude to be englishman have visit the encampment and propose to do so again in two day he have therefore by desire of the chief mooanam come over to the british settlement to assure the emigrant of a friendly reception and to conduct the embassy to the presence of the sagamore he kind office be gratefully and joyfully accept by the governor and samoset remain that day as he guest although the indian 's knowledge of english be very limit the pilgrim father learn from he the name and something of the history of they inveterate foe the nausett and also that the commencement of they enmity to the settler arise not merely from they be intruder on they domain but from the remembrance of a injury which they have receive some year previously from a english captain of the name of hunt who when cruise on these shore have allure a number of native on board he ship and have then treacherously carry they off and sell the greater part of they at malaga as slave two he take with he to england and they at length get back to cape cod bay in a vessel belong to the plymouth company this scandalous action have fill the nausett and pokanokit -lrb- \* -rrb- who be the injured tribe with bitter hatred against the white man and five year afterwards they would have sacrifice the life of captain dermer when he be skirt these shore have he not be save by squanto one of the kidnap pokanokit whom he have bring back in he vessel and who have become attach to the english -lrb- footnote : the pokanokit dwelt on the peninsula which form the bay of cape cod and on a small pert or rhode island the rest be occupy by the wampanoge of whom masasoyt be grand sagamore -rrb- the feeling of animosity thus engender have be aggravate by the slaughter of tisquantum 's only son and little hope could be entertain of establish a friendly intercourse with a tribe who feel that they have so much to revenge against the white race in two day accord to the intimation of rodolph to the indian woman a deputation of the settler head by captain standish and accompany by maitland repair to the indian village under the guidance of samoset they be expect by the inhabitant and as soon as they be perceive approach round the margin of the lake two young man come forth to meet they and accompany they to the tent of the chief mooanam be prepare for they reception and attire in he gala costume of fur and feather with he most elaborately work battle-axe hang to he side and a long and slender spear tip with bone in he hand he rise from he seat on the ground at the entrance of the stranger and greet they courteously while he wife the squaw-sachem apannow and he lively little son nepea stand by he side and smile a welcome to rodolph point at the same time significantly to the bead which adorn they neck and arm standish have now a interpreter though a very imperfect one and by he means a sort of friendly compact be form and gift be exchange as the pledge of its sincerity a invitation be then give to the young chief and to he brother quadequina -- who be one of those who have conduct the white man to they presence -- to return the visit of the settler by come the follow day to they town the invitation be accept and the deputation return to they home escort a great part of the by many of they indian ally great preparation be make at new plymouth for the reception of the red chief and he attendant in such a manner as to impress they with the wealth and power of emigrant the large wooden building which be intend as a sort of council chamber and public hall be hung inside with cloth and linen of various color and ornament with sword and musket and pistol that the colony could produce a elevated seat be place for the governor at the upper end of the apartment and table compose of long plank be lay down on each side on which be arrange such viand as the settler could produce the repast be humble but helen and she female friend arrange it with taste and the child gather the bright wild flower that so early enliven the grove and meadow when a american winter have pass away to deck the table and form garland along the wall a strange contrast do these bud and blossom of spring form to the implement of war and death with which they be mingle : but the effect of the whole be gay and appear very impose to the simple child of the wilderness as they enter the wide portal and pass up the hall to meet the puritan governor john carver and he attendant be clothe in the dark-colored and sober garment which be usually adopt by they sect and they long beard and grave countenance strike a feeling of awe and reverence into they savage guest but the red man betray no embarrassment or timidity they advance with a step at once bold and graceful and even control they natural feeling of curiosity so far as to cast no wander glance at the novelty that surround they they keep they eye steadily fix on the governor and return he salutation with a courteous dignity that do credit to they native breeding and then the chief and quadequina seat themselves on the high-backed chair that be place for they on each side of the seat of the president such a mode of sit be certainly altogether new to these son of the forest and they find it both awkward and disagreeable yet they show no discomposure or restraint and not a smile betray they surprise either at this or any other of the strange custom of they host after a few rather amusing effort to carry on a communication with he guest through the intervention of samoset carver invite they to table and again have occasion to admire the readiness and the natural grace with which they accommodate themselves to custom so new and so wonderful as those of the white man when the repast be conclude the president lead mooanam and he party round the village and show they everything that be worthy of attention and so intelligent do he find they that he have no difficulty in make they comprehend the use of many european implement and many of the invention and contrivance of civilized life with much satisfaction the good pastor brewster mark the sparkling eye and speak countenance of these gentle savage for he there hope he see encouragement to he ardent hope of ere long bring they to a knowledge of the simple and save truth of the gospel with the governor 's permission he lead they to the plain and unadorned edifice which be the emigrant ' place of worship and easily make they understand that it be dedicate to the service of the one great spirit who reign over all and from thence they be conduct to the cemetery and show by expressive sign the insult that have be offer to the dead by man of they own race some war - like implement that have be pick up after one of the recent skirmish be show to mooanam and he brother when they instantly exclaim ` nausett ' and knit they brow and put themselves into a attitude of defiance they plainly intimate that the tribe be one with which they be at enmity they point in the direction where the nausett dwelt and seem to invite the settler to join they in assault they encampment but ignorance of they language and of they habit prevent the president from assent to what appear to be they earnest wish as the sickness that have so long rage in the colony have now nearly disappear and the advance of the season promise soon to open source of plentiful provision in the and the field and stream brewster feel that he could be spare for a time from the settlement and he propose to mr carver that he should return with mooanam to he village and endeavor to acquire such a knowledge of the native language as should enable hint to act as a interpreter and also give he the means of impart to the red man the spiritual knowledge that he so ardently desire to bestow the governor willingly consent to this proposal and when it be explain to the indian chief he give the most cordial and ready assent the mild yet dignified countenance of the elder have win he respect and confidence and he hope to gain as great advantage from a more intimate connection with the white man as they expect from he alliance and support henrich be now able to leave he couch and again to join edith and he young companion out of door but he still look delicate and he former strength and activity have not fully return he be however able to walk with the assistance of a crutch that he father have make for he and he form one of the group that follow the indian in they procession through the village and also escort they as far as the confines of the wood in whose depths they village lay the chief remark the boy and show sympathy for he lameness which he be give to understand be owe to a aggression of the nausett and he eye flash and he nostril dilate and he whole countenance be change from its habitual expression of gentle dignity to one of fierce hostility it be evident that in these wampanoge the settler have secure ally who would be zealous and persevere in protect they from the attack of they harass enemy the nausett and who would when the proper time should arrive assist they in flee the district of such troublesome inhabitant the indian return to they wigwam and the elder accompany they and become a inmate of mooanam 's lodge he soon begin to acquire some knowledge of the language of he host and also to instruct he and he wife in many english word and phrase in which they aptitude to learn astonished he a constant communication be keep up between the indian village and that of the settler and a real regard and esteem spring up between they as the spring advance henrich be able to throw aside he crutch and to accompany he father and mother in they frequent visit to the wigwam and much of he leisure time be pass in the company of the young indian of he own age whose activity and address in all they sport and game he admire and emulate the presence of he friend brewster in the wampanoge village also give it increase attraction in the eye of henrich the good man be still he friend and preceptor and with he assistance he make considerable progress in the acquirement of the native language as well as in every other kind of knowledge that brewster be able to impart but all the elder 's instruction be make subservient to that best of all knowledge -- the knowledge of god and of he reveal word and in this he pupil advance and grow in a manner that both surprised and delighted he the boy 's naturally thoughtful character have become mature during he long and painful illness and he have learn to feel the value of heavenly thing and the comparative littleness of all ` those thing which be see and be temporal ' he enter warmly into all the elder 's benevolent desire and intention for the conversion of the dark heathen among whom they lot be cast and he already look forward to be he assistant in the holy work brewster regard he as destine to become both a pastor and a zealous and successful missionary when he should arrive at a proper age and he frequently speak of he as he own appoint

friend and useful interpreter chapter iv ` in you patience possess ye you soul ' luke xxi 19 one evening about the time that helen begin to expect the return of the embassy from packanokick henrich be unusually busy in the garden arrange the flower-bed and beautify edith 's bower in which he and he sister have plan a little fte to welcome they father home they mother have learn to feel that while they be thus employ and within the precinct of they own domain they be safe from every danger the nausett have not attempt any depredation for a unusual length of time and a feeling of security and peace have take the place of that constant watchfulness and anxiety which have long prove so harass to the settler they begin to flatter themselves that they foe have retire from the neighborhood and would no more return to molest they now that they know the emigrant to be on such friendly term with they powerful rival the wampanoge but false be this appearance of security and vain be every hope that the nausett would forego they design of vengeance or cease to devise scheme of mischief against those by whom they think themselves injure they do not indeed continue to attack the settlement openly for they have be teach to dread the british fire-arm and the british courage but they still continue to lurk in the neighboring forest and to keep a vigilant watch over all that take place at the settlement often be the keen eye of coubitant and he most trusty follower fix with a malignant gaze on the dwelling of rodolph and often be he movement and those of he family carefully note by these sagacious savage when no suspicion of they presence exist in the mind of the settler they would climb by night to the summit of some lofty tree that overlook the village and there remain all day unseen to obtain a knowledge of the habit and proceedings of they hate enemy and to devise plan for turn this knowledge to account the departure of the embassy to packanokick be consequently well know to coubitant and he resolve to take advantage of the absence of so considerable a part of the british force to execute if possible he scheme of vengeance what they be and how he attempt they accomplishment will be presently see edith 's bower look gay with its spring blossom and luxuriant creeper but henrich be not quite satisfied with its appearance and he wish to place at its entrance a graceful climbing plant which he have observe during he last walk to the wampanoge village and have neglect to secure it on he return it have be the desire of he parent that he should not go into the forest which border they grounds except in the company of he father or some of he friend but the apparent departure of the nausett have cause this injunction to be neglect of late and he and even he younger brother and sister have frequently stray unmolested a short distance into the wood in search of flower and fruit and even helen have cease to feel alarm ` edith ' say henrich on the evening of which we be speak ' i think my father will return tonight or tomorrow at the farthest and i must complete my task before he arrive you bower still require a few plant to adorn the entrance and the seat of moss be scarcely finish let we go into the wood and procure what we want before the sun set and we mother come out to see what progress we have make ' ` no henrich ' reply he sister ` do not go this evening i know not why but the wood look dark and gloomy there be no sunlight on the path and the shadow be so deep that i could fancy every low bush be a crouching indian i can not go into the wood tonight ' ` you be timid dear edith you never fear to go with I before and why should you fear this evening see the sun be still high in the horizon and the darkness be all in you own fancy come and see that lovely creeper i tell you of and when you have admire it hang from the decayed trunk of the old tree that support it you shall help I to remove it to you bower where it will be the fairest flower that grow except the little fairy queen herself ' henrich catch he sister 's hand and kiss she playfully attempt to draw she from the bower but she look sad and anxious and reply -- ' o henrich do not ask I my bower be fair enough and i would not go as far as that old tree tonight for all the flower that grow in the forest stay with I henrich dear we mother will join we soon and she will be alarm if you be not here ' the boy look at he sister 's pensive face with a affectionate smile : but he be not to be divert from he scheme ` stay here then edith ' he reply ` and tell my mother that i shall return in little more than ten minute come ludovico ' he add call he little brother who be always ready to follow where henrich lead ` come ludovico you be not afraid of the shadow bring you basket and you shall gather moss while i dig up my creeper when edith see its drooping white flower she will forgive I for laugh at she unusual fear ' edith say no more she be sure that henrich know best and she silently watch he leave the garden and enter the shade of the thick forest accompany by she joyous little brother be she fear indeed the mere creation of she own young fancy i or be they occasion by one of those strange and unaccountable presentiment which have be feel so frequently as to justify the old proverb ` coming event cast they shadow before they ' edith sit on the mossy seat that henrich have form in she bower it look towards the wood and the commanding situation which it occupy on a rise ground towards the center of the garden enable she to overlook the green fence that enclose the grounds and to watch the receding form of she brother until they be hide from she sight by the wind of the path through the underwood still she gaze and she heart grow sad and tear which she could not check roll down she cheek do she again fancy and do she tearful eye now convert the bush into the figure of two dark indian in the costume of the dreaded nausett surely those be human form that move so swiftly and so silently from the dark stem of a gigantic oak and cross the forest path be instantly again conceal edith wipe she glistening eye she hold she breath and fear to move but the beating of she young heart be audible no sound meet she listening ear -- no movement again be detect by she strain eye -- and she begin to think that she own fear have conjure up those terrible form but what be that distant cry that sound from the wood in the direction in which she brother have go and why do she now behold ludovico run wildly and alone down the path with terror depict in he countenance edith fly to meet he but ere she reach he the dreadful truth be make know to she by he agonized cry ' o my brother my brother they have take he edith they be drag he away they will kill he ' he shriek aloud as he throw himself into edith 's arm almost choke with the violence of he feeling and the speed with which he have flee what could edith do she dare not leave he to be carry off perhaps by some other prowl savage who might still be linger near and she could not carry he home slowly she draw he on while every moment seem a hour that delay she from give the alarm and send friend to the rescue of she darling brother ` o why do he leave I ' she murmur ` why do he go when i know that danger be near ' as soon as she have bring the panting and terrify ludovico within the precinct of the garden she leave he and run towards the house call loudly on she mother who rush out on hear she voice of terror and be instantly make acquaint with the appalling fact that have occur who shall tell the agony of she feeling or describe the suffering of that mother 's heart when she know that she child be in the power of the savage and relentless enemy of the white man she be indeed ignorant of the peculiar vengeance that they desire to wreak on she husband and all he race but the malevolent character of the nausett have be sufficiently manifest in they repeat and destructive attack on the settlement and they willful desecration of the grave of the exile to awaken the most poignant fear in she breast rodolph too be absent and brewster be still at the wampanoge village and where should she seek for succor or for counsel hastily call janet who be the only domestic at home she commit ludovico to she care and take edith by the hand she hurry from the garden scarcely know whither she bent she step but in the vague hope of meet some of the settler return from they labor in the field and induce they to go to the rescue of she boy onward she flee along the skirt of the forest towards the field of she husband 's friend winslow who she well know would aid she with all he power : but she find he not and no human being appear in sight to listen to she appeal for succor the sun be set and all have return to the village what then could helen do to retrace she step and seek she friend and neighbor in they home would be to lose precious moment on which the life and liberty of she henrich might depend to strike into the depths of the forest and cross the belt of wood that divide the settlement from mooanam 's encampment would be the quickest plan and probably the most effectual as she wampanoge friend would know far better than the settler how to follow in the train of the fugitive and how either to persuade or to compel they to release they prisoner helen have never dare to enter the wood except under the protection of she husband even in the broad light of day and now the gloom of evening be gather around she and the path that lead into the wood be obscure by the shadow of the thick foliage above bat where be all she fear and apprehension she be unconscious of such feeling now the timid woman 's heart be nerve to the occasion and no danger could now make she shrink she turn rapidly into the narrow path and pursue she way with a firmness and decision of which at any other time when she be trust to the arm and guidance of rodolph she would have believe herself incapable she know the direction in which the indian village lay and the slanting ray of the decline sun occasionally penetrate the thick wood and cast bright streak of light on the mossy ground and the bole of the giant tree around but soon they fade away and a deep gloom overspread she path ` mother ' say the tremble little edith as she cling to helen 's hand and exert she utmost strength to keep up with she rapid step ` mother do you not fear to pass through this forest now shall we not meet more of those dreadful savage who have take away my brother oh henrich henrich ' she cry -- while tear burst afresh from she eye at the recollection of she brother 's fate -- ` why do you venture into this wood to seek plant for my bower ' and the child sob convulsively from mingled grief and fear ` cease edith cease ' reply the deeply distressed but now firm and courageous helen : ' i fear nothing while i be seek aid for henrich god will protect we my child ' she add : and she raise she glistening eye to heaven and gaze hopefully and trustingly on one bright star that shine upon she between the summit of the lofty tree she heart be strengthen by she pious confidence in she heavenly father she remember also that edith look to she for protection and all personal fear be absorb by that generous and elevate feeling of self-devotion which be share even by the lower and weaker animal when they offspring be in danger so helen forget herself and feel strong to guard she child and strong to seek and obtain aid for he whose peril be more real and urgent onward she press in silence but she soul be plead eloquently with god soon edith check she suddenly and exclaim as she stumble over something in the pathway ` oh mother here be henrich 's tool and there i see ludovico 's basket full of moss this be the spot to which my brother be come and yonder be the old tree with the white flower hang on it that henrich wish to plant by my bower it must have be here that the indian seize he while he be at work ' that part of the wood be more light and open than the rest of they way have be and helen hastily survey it that she might be able to guide the wampanoge thither and point out to they where to commence the pursuit again she resume she way and regardless of fatigue she never pause again until she reach the border of the quiet and lonely lake on which the rise moon be now shine in all she silvery splendor the hut of the friendly native stand out clear and dark on the level shore of the lake and helen and she weary child soon reach they and hasten to mooanam 's lodge there they find the chief and he interesting young wife and child sit on the mat floor listen with deep attention to the word of life and salvation which brewster be read and interpret to they from the holy scripture the hurry entrance of helen startle and alarm they for she countenance plainly tell they that some calamity have occasion she unlooked-for appearance at such a unwonted time with breathless haste she tell she sad errand and brewster quickly explain she word to the chief mooanam seize he arm and rush from the lodge call in a loud and commanding voice on he people to arm themselves and accompany he in the pursuit of the cruel and vindictive nausett all be hurry and excitement throughout the village and every swarthy warrior press forward and desire to share in the expedition to save they young english favorite it be necessary however to leave a strong party at the village to guard it from any act of treachery or violence on the part of they malicious rival who it be now evident be still lurk in the neighborhood and while mooanam be select he party and arrange he plan a clear shrill voice be hear from the margin of the lake cry ` the canoe the canoe quadequina be return ' ` the canoe the canoe ' resound through the crowd and helen 's heart hound with joy and gratitude rodolph be near and all would yet be well little nepea have lead edith to the shore while the warrior be discuss they plan and in a strange mixture of english and indian word the child be converse on the recent sad event the quick ear of the young savage have detect the splash of oar at the farther side of the lake and he instantly discover the three canoe that be leave the opposite coast and emerge from the deep shadow of the overhang tree he have raise that joyful cry and now all the inhabitant of the village rush down to the shore to welcome they brethren and to tell the startling news nearest to the brink stand helen and she little girl closely attend by mooanam and the squaw-sachem apannow who share she impatient anxiety for the return of the embassy that they might have the benefit of maitland 's counsel and also obtain a addition to they force the elder brewster be deeply move at the misfortune that have befall he young friend henrich but he know that not a moment be to be lose and while all other be crowd down to the lake side he busy he self in arrange the volunteer for the pursuit and see that he own musket be in a proper state for active service the canoe speed swiftly across the moonlit water and as they near the shore rodolph perceive the form of he wife and daughter surround by the dark indian and ready to receive he but he feel only pleasure at this unexpected and welcome meeting no feeling of alarm cross he breast until he draw near enough to distinguish helen 's countenance and then he know that she have come with evil tiding he spring from the canoe eager to hear the truth : but all the firmness and courage which have so wonderfully sustain he wife while she be oblige to act for herself forsake she the moment she feel herself support by she rodolph 's arm and faintly exclaim ' o my son my son ' she faint while little edith burst into tear and sob out she brother 's name ` tell I in the name of heaven what all this mean ' exclaim maitland turn a look of eager inquiry on mooanam who stand with characteristic silence and apparent composure wait the proper moment to speak ` tell I ' cry the distract father again ` what dire calamity have befall my boy ' ` my heart be dark for you ' reply the sachem in a voice of perfect calmness though a tear glisten in he coal black eye and he brow be cloud by anxiety ` my heart be very dark for you and for you young warrior -- for boy as he be he be a brave at heart ' mooanam speak in he native tongue intermix with english word and phrase which he have learn from brewster and the other settler but the father 's heart comprehend all he say and need no interpreter ` be my son dead then ' he exclaim ` have accident or violence quench he young spirit ' ` worse than dead ' slowly reply the sachem and he look pityingly at helen who now begin to recover she sens ` leave you wife to the care of the squaw ' he add ` and come with I to the wise man yonder and he will tell you all ' he lead rodolph to where brewster be occupy in make preparation and soon the afflict father be make acquaint with the fate of he son he feel indeed that death -- a calm and peaceful death beneath he own accustomed roof and with those he dearly love around he -- would have be a far happier lot for henrich than that to which he now fear he might be doom -- than that which possibly he darling boy be at that moment endure at the hand of he cruel and malignant enemy the thought be maddening but there be still a hope of save he by speed and resolution and he urge the sachem to depart instantly one moment he give to visit and endeavor to cheer he wife who now lay powerless and weep in apannow 's lodge and then he join the chief who with brewster and a band of pick man be ready to accompany he the pastor have already learn from edith all that she could tell relative to the spot where she brother have be capture and to that spot the pursue party hurry and soon discover the basket and the tool that tell where the boy have be so rudely interrupt in they work quickly the trodden grass and the broken branch of the thick underwood show in what direction the boy have be drag by he captor and on the track the wampanoge warrior follow like hound in the chase but alas the nausett have have a fearful start of they and little hope exist in the breast of mooanam that they could overtake they in time to avert the dreadful fate that he have fear for henrich the sachem be himself a indian and he well know the indian desire for retaliation and vengeance he be indeed a man of a mild and generous nature and he belong to a tribe less distinguish by cruelty than the nausett but still he feel that accord to the savage code of the native blood must atone for blood and he believe that already the life of henrich have probably be sacrifice in expiation of he father 's have slay the son of the nausett chief still he lead he warrior on and neither pause nor speak until the party emerge from the thick wood upon a little opening that be light up brilliantly by the moon-beam here where it be evident a small temporary encampment have exist and have only be very recently and hastily remove he stop and look earnestly around the pole still stand erect which lie support the tent of the nausett the fire be still burn and many article of domestic use lay scatter about which the hasty departure of the inhabitant have probably prevent they remove rudolph hurry through the camp in search of some sign of he son and he eager eye fall on the well-known tunic that henrich be accustom to wear he snatch it up hastily and then with a deep groan let it fall again upon the ground the breast of the tunic be pierce through in several place and the whole dress be stain with blood -- blood that be newly shed maitland point to this evidence of he son 's death and when the sachem have examine it he set he tooth together and draw in he breath with a oppressed hissing sound as of severe pain ` it be over my friend ' he say in a low deep voice to rodolph -- ` it be over and we be too late naught now remain but to take revenge -- full ample revenge let we follow the miscreant ' rudolph turn and look at he he fix on he such a search gaze -- a gaze so full of gentle reproof and of deep settle grief-that the warm-hearted chief stand silent and almost abashed before he christian friend ` be it thus you have learn of brewster ' say the sorrowing father ` be it thus that you be teach in that book which the great spirit have dictate the father of we all have declare vengeance be mine i will repay and since we be too late to save my son we will not commit deed of blood which he now happy and ransom spirit would abhor ' mooanam be silence but not convinced inwardly he vow vengeance against those who have deal so cruelly with the unoffending boy though under similar circumstance he would probably have act with the same spirit but the chief bad ally himself with the white man he love and reverence they and he be resolve to avenge the wrong of maitland as if they have be he own sadly and silently the party return to the indian village where they arrive at the break of day we will not attempt to describe the mother 's anguish when she be make acquaint with the dreaded fate of she son but helen be a christian and while she heart be bow down with crush grief she spirit strive to hush its rebellious questioning and to submit itself to the will of god ` it be the lord ' she meekly exclaim : ` let he do what seemeth he good ' that morning she return with she husband and edith to the settlement and they be accompany by brewster whose pious exhortation and sympathize kindness be invaluable to the bereaved and afflict parent the grief of edith be less capable of be suppress and it break out afresh when little ludovico come to meet they and inquire for he brother from the child they learn that while he and henrich be busily engage in they several occupation in the wood two indian have suddenly rush from the thick brushwood and seize on he brother before he have time to fly ludovico be gather moss at some distance but he see what pass and utter a cry that attract the attention of the savage and one of they east a spear at he with such violence that miss its intended mark it stick firmly in a tree close behind he see this he noble and courageous brother call out to he to hide among the bush and make he way home as quickly as possible and the indian eager to secure the prize they have so long be watch for hurry away through the forest drag henrich with they the murderous attempt make by these savage against the life of ludovico prove but too clearly that the destruction of rodolph 's child be they object and banish every hope that linger in helen 's breast and this conviction of they cruel intention be still further confirm by janet 's account of the look and gesture of the warrior who attend he chief when the nausett first assail the settlement rodolph have see and understand the action and as he have also learn through he wampanoge friend that tekoa the son of the nausett chief have fall in the first encounter he know enough of indian custom to be aware that he as the slayer be a marked object of they vengeance he have however always conceal he suspicion from helen and the only effect they have produce on he be cause he at that time to prohibit he child from venture unguarded into the wood more strictly than he would otherwise have do chapter v ` surely the wrath of man shall praise thee : the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain ' psa lxxvi10 we will now for a time leave the settlement -- where the sad news of the capture and suppose death of henrich have spread a general gloom and consternation -- and follow the subject of they pity grief from the time that he be seize and make a prisoner in the hand of the savage they do not slay he for the lord have work and service in store for the young missionary and he suffer not a hair of he head to be hurt coubitant -- for he be one of those whose patient vigilance have at length be crown by success -- and he companion have hurry he at they greatest speed through the wood to the spot where they temporary camp be pitch and where several other of they tribe await they return a few minute suffice to remove the matting that form they tent and to collect they arm and utensil but coubitant well know that the child who have escape he cruelty would soon alarm the settler and that a instant pursuit would follow he therefore devise plan to deceive and perhaps altogether to check the white man at least for a time by make they believe that the death of the captive have already take place he would have instantly gratify the feeling of he cruel and revengeful heart and have shed the innocent blood of rodolph 's son to atone for the death of he friend but that he fear to disappoint he chief who so earnestly desire to imbrue he own hand in the blood of the slayer he therefore resolve on the stratagem we have describe he strip off the captive 's tunic and after pierce it several time with he dagger he open a vein in he own arm with the same weapon and let the hot blood flow freely over the tear vesture this do he smile a demon 's smile as he cast the tunic on the ground and think with malignant pleasure of the anguish that its discovery would occasion to he hate foe henrich gaze in tremble wonder at this act and when coubitant again approach he to bind he hand he believe that he be about to plunge that blood-stained knife into he beat heart he be young and life be new and precious to he and for a moment he shrink back while the blood curdle in he vein but young as he be he be also a child of god and he know that all event be govern by he almighty power and over-rule by he wisdom and love so he be enable to lift up he eye and he trusting heart to heaven and to await he expected fate with calmness coubitant see he firmness and he wonder and admire he place the dagger in he belt and hastily tie the captive 's hand behind he back he motion to he companion to follow and strike into a narrow and almost undistinguishable path force henrich to go before he while he hold the rope of twisted grass that bind he hand he follow close behind and place he foot in each print that the prisoner make so as to destroy the impression of the boy 's european shoe the other indian do the same as exactly do they tread in one another 's step that when all have pass it seem as if only one solitary traveler have leave he track on the soft ground thus ` in indian file ' they traverse a belt of wood till they come out on a dry and sun-burnt plain where they step leave no impression coubitant then advance to the side of he prisoner and take he arm in he powerful grasp he compel he to advance at a almost breathless speed across the plain in the wood on the other side he allow a short pause and give henrich some water from a bottle make of a dry gourd which hang about he neck and thus they travel on with slight refreshment and little rest until the sun arise in all he splendor and display to henrich 's admire gaze the wild and magnificent woodland scenery through which he be travel under other circumstance he would keenly have enjoy the novelty and the beauty of the object that meet he eye so different from the luxuriant but flat and monotonous field and garden and canal that he so well remember in holland here all be wild and varied and all be on a scale of grandeur that inspire he with a feeling of awe and solemnity heighten no doubt by the fearful uncertainty of he fate and the thought that perhaps this be the last time that he should look upon these glorious hill and ancient forest and wide rush river -- the handiwork and the visible teacher of god 's power something of american scenery he have become acquaint with in he ramble round the indian village but only enough to make he long to see more and have he now be travel by the side of he father or he friend brewster the elastic morning air and the splendid and ever-varying view would have make he young heart bind with joy and health as it be the silent beauty of nature be not without its influence on the captive boy he seem to feel more strongly the presence and the goodness of he heavenly father and he young spirit be cheer to endure he present desolate situation and strengthen to meet whatever future trial might await he he have learn from brewster to make himself understand in the wampanoge language and he resolve to try whether he nausett guide would reply to he question in that tongue he therefore beseech he to tell he whither he be lead he and for what purpose but coubitant deign he no reply he understand he -- for the nausett language be but another dialect of the wampanoge -- but he do not choose to inform the boy of he destination at present and he preserve a profound silence and a expression of sullen gravity it be not until the evening of the fourth day that the party reach the nausett village which as we have already observe be situate near the site of the ` first encounter ' and to which tisquantum and the greater part of he warrior have return when coubitant and a few pick associate be leave to carry out he scheme of vengeance henrich be instantly conduct to the lodge of the old chief and brightly do tisquantum 's dark eye glitter when he behold the son of he enemy in he power he praise the skill and the perseverance by which coubitant have thus procure he the means of revenge and take off he own brilliant coronet of feather he place it on the head of the proud and successful warrior as a distinguished mark of he approbation coubitant be highly gratified but he desire for vengeance be stronger than he vanity and forget the honor that have be confer upon he he entreat the chief to allow he instantly to drive he spear into the boy 's heart or else with he own weapon to take the life of the slayer 's child ` not yet ' reply tisquantum -- and henrich comprehend the full purport of he word -- ` not today coubitant i would pour out the blood of the white youth with pomp and ceremony as a offering to the spirit of my murder son let the boy be feed and refresh : tomorrow at break of day he shall die go i have say it ' ` and will the sachem give he into my charge until the morning dawn ' inquire coubitant tisquantum fix he piercing eye on the savage and read he malevolent feeling and he calmly answer ` no : the victim shall bleed because he father 's blood flow in he vein but he shall not be tortured for he be not the hand that deprive I of my son the boy shall remain in my own lodge and sleep securely for this night beneath the same roof that shelter my last remain child -- my lovely oriana ' have the chief observe henrich 's change countenance he would have perceive that all he say be understand by the intended sufferer but he mark he not and the boy command himself and keep silence determine to await coubitant 's departure before he make one effort to move the chief to pity he have however no opportunity of try the effect of he earnest appeal for tisquantum order one of he attendant to remove he at once to the inner division of the lodge and to secure he there for the night : and then motion coubitant to retire and resume he pipe he proceed to ` drink smoke ' as composedly as if he evening repose have not be interrupted but notwithstanding he outward composure the nausett chief be not unmoved by the event that have just occur the sight of the son of he whose hand have slay he young tekoa bring back the image of he brave young warrior as he stand beside he at the fatal burial-ground full of youthful ardor to combat the invader of he land and the suppose enemy of he race he recall he daring look as he mount the palisade and place in he unerring bow the arrow that wound the english boy and then he seem to hear again the sharp report of the white man 's musket and to behold once more the sudden fall of he son bleeding and expire to the ground tisquantum think on that hour of anguish when he duty as a chief and a warrior have forbid all expression of he grief and he think of he return to he lodge where only oriana remain to welcome he -- for the mother of he child whom he have love with unusual affection be dead -- and tear gather in the sachem 's eye oriana have deeply mourn she brother 's death for since she have lose she mother she have be permit to enjoy much more of he society than have previously be allow she and she father also have seem to transfer to she much of the love that be have bear towards he wife now he daughter be he only domestic tie and he chief object in life be to give she in marriage to a warrior as brave as she young brother and who would supply to he the place of he depart son at present this prospect be not immediate for oriana be only in she fourteenth year but the sachem be resolve that she should be worthy of the hand of the greatest warrior of she tribe and he take pain to have she instruct in every art that be consider valuable or ornamental to a indian female already she could perform the most elaborate pattern in native embroidery on she father 's pouch and moccasin and she own garment be also delicately and fancifully adorn in the same manner with feather and shell and color grass besides this accomplishment she skill in indian cookery be very great and she could also use a bow and arrow or cast a light javelin or swim across a rapid river with a grace and activity that delight she proud father oriana too be gentle -- as gentle as she mother and she influence over tisquantum bid fair to equal that which he much-cherished and deeply regret wife have exercise over he that influence have ever be employ in the cause of mercy and many a enemy and many a subject have live to bless the name of the squaw-sachem oriana when she have quell the wrath of the offended chief and turn aside he intended vengeance it be to the inner apartment of he spacious lodge where he daughter and she attendant be busily engage in they domestic occupation that henrich bad be lead he arm be still tie behind he back and the end of the rope that bind they be secure to a post in the wall the indian who at he chief 's command conduct he thither briefly inform oriana that he be a prisoner and desire she woman to look to he security : and then he leave the captive to he strange and inquisitive jailer when tisquantum have empty he long pipe he bethink himself of the young captive 's position and proceed to he daughter 's apartment to give order for he hospitable entertainment that evening and he safe lodgment for the night -- that night which he be resolve should be he last as he approach the thick curtain of deer-skin that hang over the aperture between the two apartment he think he hear a strange sweet voice speak the indian language with a foreign accent and hastily draw aside the heavy drapery he be astonish to see he prisoner and intended victim liberate from the cord that have bind he and recline on the fur and cushion that form oriana 's usual resting-place while he gentle indian child kneel beside he and offer he the food of which he be so much in need henrich be gratefully thank she and as the sachem enter he hear he exclaim in mournful accent -- ` but why do you thus so kindly treat I it be better to let I die of hunger and fatigue for i know that to-morrow my blood be to be shed : the cold knife be to pierce my heart ' ` it shall not be ' reply oriana fervently ' i have say that i will save you ' and then she raise she sparkling eye as she hear she father 's entrance and spring on she foot she dart forward and catch he arm ` father ' she cry -- and now she speak so rapidly and energetically that henrich could only guess the purport of she word and read it in she sweet expressive countenance -- ` father do not slay the white boy he say that he be doom to die because he father cause my brother 's death but surely tekoa 's generous spirit do not ask the blood of a child my brother be now happy in the great hunting grounds where we father dwell he feel no wrath against he slayer 's son : he never would have seek revenge against a innocent boy give I the captive o my father and let he grow up in we lodge and be to I a playfellow and a brother ' tisquantum gaze at he child in wonder and he countenance soften she see that he be move and hastily turn from he she approach henrich who have rise from the couch and now stand a earnest spectator of the scene on the issue of which he life or death humanly speak depend she take he band and lead he to she father and again plead earnestly and passionately for he life while the touching expression of he own deep blue eye and the beauty of he fair young face add greatly to the power of she appeal i have a little sister at home ' say henrich -- and the soft indian language sound sweetly from he foreign lip -- ` and she will weep for I as oriana have weep for she brother let I return to patupet and she and my parent will bless you ' at the mention of he parent tisquantum 's brow grow dark again he think of rodolph as the destroyer of he son and he turn away from the two youthful suppliant whose silent eloquence he feel he could not long resist ` you father kill my young tekoa ' he reply ` he fire weapon quench the light of my lodge and take from I the support of my old age should i have pity on he son ' ` but let he dwell in we lodge and fill my brother 's vacant place ' exclaim oriana ` do not send he back to the white man and he father and he mother and he little sister will still weep for he and believe he dead ' the same idea have cross tisquantum 's breast he look again at the boy and think how much oriana 's life would be cheer by such a companion he desire of revenge on rodolph would also be gratify by detain he child and bring he up as a indian so long as he parent believe that he have meet with a bloody death and possibly he feel a time might come when the possession of a english captive might prove advantageous to himself and he tribe all fear of the boy 's escape to he friend be remove from he mind for he be about to retire from that part of the country to a wild district far to the west and to join he ally the pequodee in a hunting expedition to some distant prairie the portion of he tribe over which he be sachem or chief be willing to accompany he and he have no intention of return again to the neighborhood of the english intruder who he clearly foresee would ere long make themselves master of the soil and who have already secure to themselves such powerful ally in the wampanoge -- the enemy and rival of the nausett tisquantum weigh all these consideration in he mind and he resolve to spare the life of he young captive but he would not at once announce that he have relent from he bloody purpose and yield to he child 's solicitation he therefore maintain the severe gravity that usually mark he countenance and reply -- ` but what can the white boy do that he should fill the place of a indian chieftain 's son can he cast the spear or draw the bow or wrestle with we brave youth ' revive hope have fill the heart of henrich with courage and he look boldly up into the sachem 's face and merely answer ` try I ' the brevity and the calmness of the reply please the red chief and he determine to take he at he word ' i will ' he say ` to-morrow you shall show what skill you possess and you fate shall depend on you success but how have you learn anything of indian sport or of the indian tongue ' ' i have be much in mooanam 's lodge and have play with the youth of he village ' reply henrich ` and the sachem be well pleased to see I use a bow and arrow in he wood and from he and my young companion i learn to speak they tongue ' ` it be good ' say the old chief thoughtfully then fix he penetrate eye on henrich again he hastily inquire : ` and can you use the fire-breathing weapon of you countryman and can you teach I to make they ' i can use they ' answer the boy ` but i can not make they they come from my father 's land beyond the great sea but ' he add -- while a stronger hope of life and liberty beam in he bright blue eye and flushing face -- ` send I back to my countryman and they will give you musket for my ransom ' ` no no ' say the sachem : and the dark cloud again pass over he countenance ` never will i restore you to you father till he can give I back my son you shall live if you can use we indian weapon but you shall live and die as a indian ' he turn and leave the apartment and the heart of henrich sink within he be he then take for ever from he parent and he brother and sister should he behold he friend and he teacher no more and must he dwell with savage and lead a savage life death he think would be preferable to such a lot and he half resolve to conceal he skill and dexterity in indian exercise that tisquantum might cast he off and slay he as unfit to dwell among he tribe but hope soon revive and he trust in the providential mercy of god restore he spirit and enable he even to look upon a lengthen captivity among the red man with composure plan for escape out of they hand and make he way back to the settlement fill he mind and a short residence among the wild man even appear to offer some attraction to he enterprising spirit so he turn to oriana who stand gaze on he change and expressive countenance with the deepest interest and again resume the conversation which have be interrupt by the entrance of the chief many question do those young stranger ask each other relative to they respective home and native custom and henrich learn with much dismay that the nausett under tisquantum 's rule be so soon to change they place of residence he hope of escape become less strong but they be not destroy : and when he be summon to pass the night in the sachem 's apartment he be able to lift up he heart to god in prayer and to lie down to sleep on the rude couch prepare for he with a calm trust in he almighty power and goodness and a hope that he would see fit to shorten he trial and restore he to he friend the chief watch he as he kneel in prayer and when he rise and prepare to lie down to sleep he abruptly ask he why he have thus remain on he knee so long ' i be pray to my god to protect I ' answer henrich and a tear rise to he eye as he remember how he have kneel every evening with he own beloved family and think how he absence and they probable belief in he death would sadden the act of worship that would that night be perform in he father 's house ` do you pray to the great spirit ' ask tisquantum ' i do ' reply the young christian ' i pray to the great spirit who be the god and father of all man and i pray to he son jesus christ who be the friend and savior of all who love he ' ` it be good ' say the chief ` we know the great spirit but we know nothing of the other god of the white man sleep now for you strength and activity will be try to-morrow ' and henrich lay down and sleep long and peacefully he be awaken the next morning by the gentle voice of oriana who stand beside he and say ` you must rise now and eat with I before you go out to try you strength and skill come to my apartment ' henrich open he eye and gaze around he in wonder but quickly the whole sad reality of he situation come over he and he feel that he must nerve himself for the come trial soon he follow oriana to she inner room where a slight indian repast of maize and fruit have be prepare by the young squaw-sachem and she attendant tisquantum have leave the lodge and be now occupy in prepare a spot for the exercise of the white boy 's skill at he side stand coubitant silent and gloomy he indignation at the chief 's merciful intention towards the intended victim be great and strongly have he urge he to the immediate slaughter of the captive but tisquantum be not to be lightly move either to good or evil he have say that the boy should live if he prove himself worthy to bear indian arm and all the cruel suggestion and argument that coubitant could bring forward only make he more resolve to keep he word the young savage then forbore to speak for he see that it be useless and he fear to displease he chief whose favor be the highest object of he ambition since the untimely death of he son coubitant have be constantly he companion and attendant until he have be leave near the english settlement to carry out he scheme of revenge he success in this enterprise a raise he still higher in tisquantum 's estimation and vision of become the son-in-law of the chief and eventually succeed he in he office already float in the brain of coubitant in a few year oriana 's hand would be give to some fortunate warrior and who could have so strong a claim to it as the man who have risk he own life to procure vengeance for she brother 's death therefore coubitant hold he peace and check the expression of he deadly and malignant feeling towards the young prisoner soon henrich be summon to the ground where he fate be to be decide and he be direct to try he power with several indian boy of he own age in shooting with the bow and arrow he could not by any means rival they skill and accuracy of aim but in cast the spear and wield the tomahawk he show himself they equal and when he be make to wrestle with he swarthy and half-naked competitor the superior height and muscular power of the british lad enable he to gain the victory in almost every instance tisquantum be satisfied he pronounce he worthy to live and notwithstanding the opposition of coubitant which be once more cautiously manifest he present henrich with the arm that he know so well how to use and inform he that he should henceforth dwell in he lodge among he brave and should no more inhabit the apartment of the woman to a young and generous mind success and approbation be always grateful and henrich 's eye kindle and he cheek burn as he listen to the praise of the chief and feel that he owe he life under providence to he own effort and when he little friend oriana come bound up to he with joy and exultation in she intelligent countenance and playfully fling a wreath of flower across he shoulder in token of victory he feel that even among these child of the wilderness -- these dreaded nausett indian -- he could find something to love in coubitant he instinctively feel that he have also something to dread but the savage try to conceal he feeling and even to please the chief and oriana by pretend a interest in they young favorite which for a long time deceive they as to he real sentiment the bustle of preparation for the intended removal of the encampment begin that day -- for tisquantum be now more eager than ever to get beyond the reach of the settler -- and before sunset all be ready the next morning the march commence at daybreak and continue for many day uninterruptedly until the chief and he follower reach the residence of he pequodee ally when he consider himself safe from pursuit even if the settler should attempt it he therefore halt he party and take up he abode among he friend to wait until they be prepare to set out on they hunting expedition to the western prairie a period of repose be also very needful for the woman and child for the march have be a most fatiguing one not only have the sachem dread the pursuit of the injured settler and therefore hurry he party to they utmost speed but the country through which they have travel be inhabit by the narragansett tribe the ancient and hereditary foe of the pequodee it be consequently desirable for the nausett as ally of the latter to spend as little time as possible in the territory of they enemy and little rest ad be permit to the traveler until they have pass the boundary of the friendly pequodee chapter vi ` the wood -- oh solemn be the boundless wood of the great western world when day decline and louder sound the roll of distant flood more deep the rustling of the ancient pine when dimness gather on the stilly air and mystery seem o'er every leaf to brood awful be it for human heart to bear the might and burden of the solitude ' heman many week elapse after the nausett party have join the friendly pequodee ere any preparation be make for journey to the west and these day be chiefly employ by henrich in improve he knowledge of the indian language and especially of the nausett dialect by converse with oriana and she young companion both male and female he also endeavor to learn as much as possible of the habit and the idea of the simple people among whom he lot be now cast for he hope at some future time when he have succeed in return to he own countryman that such a knowledge might prove useful both to himself and they he be treat with much kindness by tisquantum and he favor with the chief ensure the respect and attention of all he dependant and follower from the day that the white boy have be spare from a cruel and violent death and establish as a regular inmate of tisquantum 's dwelling it seem as if he have regard he as a son and have adopt he to fill the place of he whose death he so deeply deplored and oriana already look on he as a brother and take the greatest delight in he society no apprehension be now feel of he escape to the settlement for the distance which they have travel through wood and over hill and plain to reach the pequodee encampment be so great that it be utterly impossible for any one but a indian well accustomed to the country to traverse it alone henrich be therefore allow to enjoy perfect liberty and to ramble unmolested around the camp and it be he greatest pleasure to climb to the summit of a neighbor hill which be crown by a few ancient and majestic pine and there to look in wonder and admiration at the scenery around he to the west a vast and trackless forest spread as far as the eye could reach unbroken save by some distant lake that shine like clear mirror in they dark green setting tree of gigantic growth rise high above they brethren of the wood but wild luxuriant creeper many of they bear cluster of bright blossom have climb ambitiously to they summit seek the light of day and the warmth of the sunbeam which could not penetrate the thick underwood that be they birth-place it be a sea of varied and undulating foliage beautiful and striking but almost oppressive to the spirit and henrich gaze sadly over the interminable forest and thought of the week and month -- and possibly the year that this wilderness be to be he home escape under present circumstance he feel to be impossible and he endeavor to reconcile himself to he fate and to look forward with hope to a dim and uncertain future could he parent and edith but have be assure of he safety he think he could have bear he captivity more cheerfully but to feel that they be mourn he as dead and that perhaps they would never know that he blood have not be cruelly shed by he captor be hard for the affectionate boy to endure to oriana alone could he tell he feeling and pour out he grief and anxiety and edith herself could not have listen to he with more attention and sympathy than be show by the young indian girl when she domestic duty be accomplish she would accompany she new friend to he favorite retreat on the hill-top and there seat by he side beneath the tall pine she would hold he hand and gaze into he sorrowful countenance and listen to he fond regret for he distant home and all its dearly-loved inmate till tear would gather in she soft black eye and she almost wish that she could restore he to he countryman but this she be powerless to do even if she could have make up she mind to the sacrifice of she ` white brother ' as she call he she have indeed work upon she father so far as to save he life and have he adopt into they tribe and family but she well know that nothing would ever induce he to give up he possession of rodolph 's son or suffer he parent to know that he live all this she tell to henrich and he spirit sanguine as it be sicken at the prospect of a lengthen captivity among uncivilized and heathen being he gaze mournfully to the east he look over the wide expanse of country that he have lately traverse and he eye seem to pierce the rise hill and lofty forest that lay between he and he cherish home and in the word of the psalmist he cry ` oh that i have wing as a dive for then would i flee away and be at rest ' would you leave I my brother ' say oriana in reply to this unconscious utterance of he feeling ` would you leave I again alone to mourn the brother i have lose ' the sachem love you and i love you too and you may be happy in we lodge and become a brave like we young man ' ` yes oriana you and you father be kind to I and i have never know any other mode of life i might be happy in you lodge but i can not forget my parent and I dear edith who love I so fondly and my little brother also and then i have a friend -- a kind friend and full of wisdom and goodness -- who use to teach I all kind of knowledge and above all the knowledge of the way to heaven how can i think that i may perhaps never see all these again and not be sad ' and henrich bury he face in he hand and weep without restraint oriana gaze at he affectionately and tear of sympathy fill she large eye also but she draw away henrich 's hand and kiss it and try to cheer he in the best way that she simple mind could suggest ` my brother must not weep ' she say ` for he be not a child and we indian youth be ashamed of tear henrich will be a brave some day and he will delight in hunting and in war as we red warrior do and he will i know excel they all in strength and courage what can he desire more than to be a nausett warrior ' ` oh oriana ' reply the boy -- as he wipe away he tear and almost smile at she attempt to console he by such a future prospect -- ' i desire to return to my home and my friend and the worship of my god among you people none know anything of the true god and none believe in he son i have no one to speak to I as my parent and my venerable teacher use to do and no one to kneel with I in prayer to the almighty ' ` do not you worship the great mahneto -- the mighty spirit from whom every good gift come ' ask oriana with surprise ` he be the one true god and all the red man know and worship he ' ` yes oriana i do worship the one great spirit the god and father of all man of every color and of every clime but the christian 's god be far more wise and good and merciful than the indian 's mahneto : and he have tell he servant what he be and how they ought to serve he ' ` do you mahneto speak to you ' ask the indian girl ` could i hear he speak ' ` he have speak to we father long age ago ' reply henrich ` and we have he word write in a book oh that i have that bless book with I how it would comfort I to read it now ' ` and you would read it to I my brother but tell I some of you mahneto 's word and tell I why you say he be greater and better than the good spirit who protect the red man ' ' i will gladly tell you all i know of the god whom i have be teach to love and worship ever since i be a little child i wish i could make you love he too oriana and teach you to pray to he and to believe in he son as you friend and savior ' ' i will believe all you tell I dear henrich ' answer the ingenuous girl ` for i be sure you would never say the thing that be not -lrb- \* -rrb- but what do you mean by a savior be it some one who will save you from the power of the evil spirit hobbamock -- the enemy of the red man ' -lrb- footnote : the indian expression for speak a falsehood -rrb- then henrich tell she of jesus the merciful -- he who come to save a world that be lose and ruin through sin and to die for those who deserve nothing but wrath and condemnation long the youthful teacher and he attentive pupil converse and many and strange be the question that oriana ask and that henrich be enable by the help of the spirit to answer the dark search eye of the intelligent young indian be fix on he and she glossy black hair be throw back over she shoulder while she listen in wonder and admiration to every word that fall from the lip of she ' white brother ' that evening a new and awaken source of interest be open to the young captive and the dreariness of he life seem almost to have pass away the affection of oriana have hitherto be he only solace and comfort and now the hope of repay that affection by become the humble means of lead she out of the darkness of heathenism and point out to she the way of eternal salvation raise he spirit and almost reconcile he to he present banishment from home and all its cherish joy and comfort more deeply than ever do he now regret that he be deprive of all access to the word of life from which he might have read and translate the story of mercy to he young disciple and have teach she the gracious promise of god but henrich have be well teach at home he truly pious parent have early store he mind with numerous passage of scripture and the effort he now make to recall to he memory all the most interesting story and most striking text that he have learn from the word of god be the means of fix they indelibly on he own heart he never in after life forget what he now teach to oriana the instruction be as be generally the case quite as much bless to the teacher as to the learner and henrich be himself surprise to find how readily he could call to mind the very passage he want and how easily he could convey its import to oriana in she own melodious language frequently be these interesting conversation renew and never without henrich 's perceive with thankfulness that oriana be make progress in spiritual knowledge and also in quickness of understanding and general intelligence for it may truly be say that no kind of learn awaken the dormant power of the intellect or quicken the growth of the mind so effectually as the knowledge of the one true god who create the spirit and of he son who die to redeem it from the ignominious and degrading bondage of sin and satan henrich have at first imagine that it would be utterly impossible for he to find a intelligent companion among the savage race into whose hand he bad fall and he have deeply feel that sense of loneliness which a cultivate mind however young must experience in the society of those whose idea and feeling be altogether beneath its own and who can in no way sympathize with any of its hope and fear and aspiration but now the well-informed english boy begin to perceive that the superiority of the white man over the dark aborigine of america might possibly arise much more from difference of education than from difference of race and color he remember also how ardently he have desire to share with the pious brewster and winslow in they project plan for the conversion of the native and he hope that young and comparatively ignorant as he know himself to be it might perhaps please god to make he the instrument of bestow spiritual blessing on some at least of the heathen among whom he dwell he therefore resolve to employ all ` he power of argument and persuasion to convince the mind and touch the heart of the young squaw-sachem not only for the sake of she own immortal soul but also in the hope that she influence if she become a sincere christian might greatly tend to the conversion of she father and he tribe since the night when tisquantum have see he young captive kneel in prayer and have question he as to the object of he worship he have never speak to he on the subject of he religion and henrich have fear to address the stern old chief or to introduce a theme which though constantly present to he own mind and the source of all he consolation would probably he reject with scorn and contempt by the sachem the more the christian boy become acquaint with the character of tisquantum the stronger become this fear and the more he despair of any influence prove sufficiently strong to break the chain of error and superstition that bind he to heathenism the chief be a distinguished powow or conjuror and be regard by he own people and even by many other tribe as possess great super natural power he pretension be great and fully accredit by he subject who believe that he could control the power of the subordinate evil spirit and even exercise a certain influence on hobbamock himself he be call a mahneto or priest as be the servant or deputy of the great mahneto and permit by he to cure disease by a word or a charm to bring down rain on the thirsty land and to foretell the issue of event such as the result of war or negotiation the influence which these acknowledge power give he over other tribe besides he own be very gratifying to he pride and ambition and could henrich hope that he a young and inexperienced boy could have wisdom or eloquence sufficient to ` bring down the high thought ' that exalt he and to persuade he to ` become a disciple of the meek and lowly jesus no he know that such a hope be humanly speak vain : but he know also that ` with god all thing be possible ' and he cease not to pray that the spirit of light and truth might enter the soul of the heathen chief and banish the spirit of evil that now reign so triumphantly there henrich 's desire to see the sachem become a christian be increase in the same measure that he hope of its accomplishment become less for the more intimately he become acquaint with he the more he find in he natural character that be interesting and even estimable tisquantum be brave and he be also generous and sincere far beyond the generality of he race we have say that the influence of he wife whom he have love to a unusual degree for a indian have tend to soften he temper and disposition and he regret for she loss and he anxiety that he only daughter should resemble she have make he more domestic in he habit than most of he brother chief he be kind also when not rouse to harshness and cruelty by either revenge or superstition and he be capable of strong attachment where he have once take a prepossession in favor of any individual such a prepossession he have form for he english captive on the evening when he child have plead for he life and when he own ingenuous and beautiful countenance have join so eloquently in she supplication no insidious effort of the wily coubitant have avail to change the sachem 's sentiment and he continue to treat henrich as a adopted son and to allow he all the privilege and indulgence that have once be bestow on he beloved tekoa the white boy be permit to enjoy full and unrestricted liberty now that he be beyond all possible reach of he countryman he be encourage to hunt and sport and practice all athletic game and exercise with the nausett and pequodee youth and he be present with such of the arm and ornament of the lose tekoa as be deem suitable to he use and he unusually tall and muscular figure often when adorn with these strange and curious specimen of indian art and ingenuity do haunch smile to think how edith and ludovico would wonder and admire if they could see he thus attire : and then he would sigh as he remember that month and year must probably elapse -- and possibly even he life might come to a end -- ere he could hope to see they loved countenance or to excite they surprise and interest by a relation of all he peril and adventure to oriana alone could he unburden he mind on such subject and from she he always meet with deep attention and heartfelt sympathy but every day she feel he presence to be more necessary to she happiness and she dread of he escape to he own people to become greater not only do she shrink from the idea of parting with she ` white brother ' -- she newly-found and delightful friend and companion -- but daily as she grow in the knowledge of henrich 's religion and learn to know and love the christian 's god and savior more sincerely do she fear the possibility of lose she zealous young teacher and be deprive of all intercourse with the only civilized and enlighten be whom she have ever know she therefore rejoice when the time arrive for leave the pequodee village and pursue the intended route to the west for in spite of the distance and the many difficulty and obstacle that divide henrich from the british settlement she have live in continual fear and expectation of either see a band of the mighty stranger come to demand he restitution or revenge he suppose death or else of he escape from the camp and brave every danger in the attempt to return to he happy christian home henrich often assure she with sincerity that he have no idea of venture on so hopeless a attempt but whenever the indian girl see he eye fix sadly on the eastern horizon and dim as they often be by tear of sad remembrance she feel she fear again arise and long more earnestly to leave the spot and plunge into the trackless forest that lay between the pequodee encampment and she propose hunting grounds the summer have pass away and autumn be begin to tinge the varied foliage of the forest with all its gaudy hue of yellow and scarlet and purple when the nausett and such of they pequodee friend as desire to share in they hunting expedition set forth from the village many woman and girl accompany the caravan the greater part on foot and bearing on they shoulder either the younger child or a large pack of baggage while they husband and father and brother march before they encumber only with they arm and hunting accoutrements such be and still be the custom among the uncivilized tribe of america where woman have ever be regard as be very little more exulted than the beast that perish and have be accustom to meet with scarcely more attention and respect but there be exception to this as to every other rule and where woman have possess unusual strength of mind or power of influence they condition have be proportionately better such have be the ease with tisquantum 's wife : and he have ever treat she with gentleness and respect and have never impose on she any of those servile duty that commonly fall to the lot of indian squaw even though they may be the wife and daughter of the most exalted chief to he daughter the sachem be equally considerate and none but the lightest toil of domestic indian life be ever require from she nor be any burden more weighty than she own bow and quiver ever lay upon she slender and graceful shoulder when she follow she father in he frequent wanderings on the present occasion as the journey promise to be unusually long and uninterrupted tisquantum obtain for she a small and active horse of the wild breed that abound in the western wood and plain and of which valuable animal the pequodee possess a moderate number which they have procure by barter from the neighbor cree indian the purchase of this steed give henrich the first opportunity of remark the indian mode of buying and selling and the article that form they medium of commerce and be employ as money this consist of square and highly-polished piece of a peculiar kind of a peculiar muscle-shell call quahock in each of which a hole be bore to enable it to be string on a slender cord the general name for this native money be wampum or white from the color of those shell most esteemed but a dark-colored species be call lukus or black and both be use of various form and size as ornament by the warrior and they copper-colored wife and child several string of wampum both white and purple be silently offer by the sachem for the horse which he select as most suitable for he daughter 's use and after a pause be as silently reject by the possessor another pause ensue and tisquantum add a fresh string of the precious shell to the small heap that lay before he and the same scene be repeat until the owner of the horse be satisfy when he place the halter in the hand of the purchaser gather up he treasure and with a look of mournful affection at the faithful creature whom he be resign to the power of another master hurry away to he wigwam the next day the march begin and proud and happy be oriana as she closely follow she father 's step mount on she new palfrey and lead by she adopt brother while by she side bound a favorite young dog of the celebrated breed now call newfoundland which have be give to she brother as a puppy just before he melancholy death and have be she only playfellow and love companion until henrich have arrive to rival the faithful creature in she affection at he request the dog receive the name of rodolph in memory of he father and henrich be never tire of caress he and teach he to fetch and carry and to plunge into he favorite element and bring from the foamy torrent or the placid lake any object which he direct he to seize he be a noble fellow and return the care and kindness of he new friend with all the ardor and faithfulness of he nature it be he duty to accompany henrich in all he expedition in pursuit of game and to bring to he foot every bird or small animal that he increase skill in archery enable he to pierce with he light and bone-pointed arrow during he residence in the pequodee village he have generally go on such expedition in company with several other man and boy and oriana have consequently enjoy little opportunity of perceive how much he have improve in dexterity since he have make he first trial before he captor but now as they traverse the wood together he frequently aim at she desire at some brilliant bird or bound squirrel and the young maiden exult at he success and at the sagacity and obedience of rodolph in bring she the game the constant occupation and the change of scene that henrich enjoy during this journey tend greatly to raise he spirit and even to reconcile he to he new mode of life he do not forget he friend and he home -- he do not even cease to think of they with the same regret and affection but it be with soften feeling and with a settle hope of eventually return to they after a certain period of wander and adventure the kind of life which he have often long to try be now he lot and he enjoy it under peculiarly favorable circumstance for he partake of its wildness and excitement without endure any of its hardship no wonder then that a high-spirited and active-minded youth of henrich 's age should often forget that he wanderings be compulsory and should feel cheerful and even exhilarate as he roam through the boundless primeval forest or cross the summit of the range of lofty hill that occasionally lift they barren crag above the otherwise unbroken sea of foliage pitch the camp for the night be always a season of excitement and pleasure to the young traveler and he lively companion oriana the selection of a open glade and the procure wood and water and erect temporary hut be all delightful from they novelty and then when all be do and fire be kindle and the frugal evening meal be finish it be pleasant to sit with oriana beneath the lofty tree whose smooth straight trunk rise like stately column and to watch the glance beam of the setting sun as they shine on the varied foliage now tint with all the hue of autumn and listen to the sighing of the evening breeze that make solemn music while it sweep through the forest these be happy and tranquil hour for then henrich would resume the interesting topic to which he dusky pupil be never weary of listen he would tell she -- but no longer with tear -- of he home and all its occupation and joy he would repeat the holy instruction that he have himself receive and when far remove from the observation of other eye and ear he would teach she to kneel by he side as edith use to do and to join he in supplication to ` the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity ' but who yet listen to the humblest prayer that be address to he in sincerity and hear every petition that be offer up in the name of he beloved son the heart of oriana be touch and with a beautiful child-like simplicity she receive all the bless truth that she ` white brother ' teach she she affection be strongly draw towards the character of jesus the merciful as she always call the savior and she become sensitively alive to the guilt of every sin as show ingratitude to the benefactor who have lay down he life for he creature oriana be in fact a christian -- a young and a weak one it be true : but she possess that faith which alone can constitute any one ' a branch in the true vine ' and henrich now feel that lie have find a sister indeed as the young indian grow in grace she grow also in sweetness of manner and refinement of taste and behavior she be no longer a savage either in mind or in conduct and henrich often look at she in wonder and admiration when she have make she simple toilette by the side of a clear stream and have deck she glossy raven hair with one of the magnificent water lily that be have gather for she on its brink : and he wish that he mother and he fair young sister could behold he little indian beauty for he know that they would love she and would forget that she have a dusky skin and be bear of a savage and heathen race chapter vii ` we see thee o stranger and weep we look for the youth of the sunny glance whose step be the fleetest in chase or dance the light of he eye be a joy to see the path of he arrow a storm to flee but there come a voice from a distant shore he be call would -- he he find ` midst he tribe no more he be not in he place when the night fire burn but we look for he still -- he will yet return he brother sit with a droop brow in the gloom of the shadow cypress bough we rouse he -- we bid he no longer pine for we hear a step -- but that step be thine ' heman ` what be that cry of joy oriana ' exclaim henrich as one evening during they journey he and he companion have stray a little from they party who be seek a resting-place for the night ` what be that cry of joy : and who be this indian youth who have spring from the ground so eagerly and be now hurry towards we from that group of overhang tree be he a friend of yours ' ` i know he not ' reply oriana ' i never pass through this forest before : but i have hear that it be inhabit by the cree they be friendly to we ally the pequodee so we need not fear to meet they ' as she speak the young stranger rapidly approach they with a expression of hope and expectation on he animated countenance but this change as quickly to a look of deep despondence and grief when he have advance within a few pace and fix he search eye en henrich 's face ` no ' he murmur in a low and mournful voice and clasp he hand in bitterness of disappointment ` no it be not unca it be not my brother of the fleet foot and the steady hand why do he yet tarry so long four moon have come and have wane away again since he begin he journey to the land of spirit and i have sit by he grave and supply he with food and water and watch and weep for he return and yet he do not come o unca my brother when shall i hear thy step and see thy bright glance eye i will go back and wait and hope again ' and the young indian turn away too much absorb in he own feeling to take any further notice of henrich and oriana who both surprised and affect at he word and manner follow he silently several other indian of the cree tribe now make they appearance among the tree and hasten towards the traveler but a look of disappointment be visible on every countenance : and the young traveler wonder greatly -lrb- 1 and 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ` j' be pass moi-mme chez une peuplade indienne qui se prenat a pleurer  la vue d'un voyageur parce qu'il lui rappelait des amis partis pour la contre des ames et depuis long-temps en voyage ' -- chateaubriand -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : ` they fancy they deceased friend and relative to be only go on a journey and be in constant expectation of they return look for they vainly amongst foreign traveler ' -- picart -rrb- but though evidently grieve at not meet the be they look for so earnestly the elder cree do not forget the duty of hospitality with simple courtesy they invite henrich and he companion to accompany they to they wigwam which be situate in a beautiful glade close by and be only conceal by the luxuriant growth of underwood that form a sort of verdant and flowering screen around they the invitation be gratefully accept for the countenance of the cree inspire confidence and oriana know that she father intend to visit a settlement of these friendly people in the district they be now traverse she also feel she curiosity strongly excite by what have just occur and she long for a explanation of the conduct of the interesting young savage who have first accost they she therefore request one of they new acquaintance to go in search of the main body of they party and to inform the sachem that she and henrich have precede they to the wigwam and then -- with a dignity and composure that be astonishing in one so young and accustomed to so wild a life -- she guide she palfrey into the narrow path that wind through the undergrowth of evergreen while henrich walk by she side and rodolph bound before she they come to the spot where the young indian sit by a grave and tear be fall from he eye as he gaze at the grass-covered mound around which wear arrange several highly-carved and ornamented weapon and article of attire and also a small quantity of firewood and food and tobacco intend for the use of the depart on he long journey to the land of spirit this be a well-known custom of most of the north american tribe but the cree have several superstition peculiar to themselves especially that melancholy one to which we have just allude and which subject they to such lengthen sorrow and disappointment for they watch and look for the return of they lose and lament friend who can never come again to gladden they eye on earth o that they be teach to place they hope of a bless reunion with those they love on the only sure foundation for such hope -- even on he who be ` the resurrection and the life ' then they need never be disappoint it be this strange expectation of the reappearance in human form of the lately dead that occasion the incident we have just relate a epidemic disease have be prevalent in the cree village and among those who have fall victim to it unca the eldest orphan son of the principal man of the village be the most deeply regret and he return be the most anxiously desire especially be this vain hope cherish by he younger brother jyanough to whom he have be a object of the fondest love and most unbounded admiration and who daily as the evening close take fresh food and water to the grave and sit there till night close in call on unca and listen for he come footstep then he retire sadly to he wigwam to lament he brother 's continued absence and to hope for better success the follow evening during each night the dog of the village or the wild animal of the forest devour the food design for unca but jyanough believe it have be use by he brother 's spirit and continue still to renew the store and to hope that at length the depart would show himself and would return to dwell in he wigwam when haunch approach the grave lead oriana 's pony the mourner look up and gaze in he face again with that sad and inquire look but now it do not change to disappointment for he know that the stranger be not uncas there be even pleasure in he countenance as the clear glance of the english boy 's deep blue eye meet he own and he rise from he seat at the head of the grave and go up to henrich gently take he hand and say -- ` will the white stranger be jyanough 's brother he step be free and he eye be bright and he glance go deep into jyanough 's heart will the pale-face be the friend of he who have now no friend for four moon be guile and unca do not answer to my call ' henrich and jyanough be stranger : they be altogether different in race in education and in they mode of thinking and feeling yet there be one ground of sympathy between they of which the young indian seem instinctively conscious both have recently know deep sorrow and both have feel that sickening sense of loneliness that fall on the young heart when suddenly divide from all it most dearly love by death or other circumstance jyanough and he elder brother unca have be deprive of both they parent not many month before the fatal disease break out which have carry off so many victim amongst the cree the orphan youth have then become all-in-all to each other and they mutual attachment have excite the respect and admiration of the whole village of which at he father 's death unca become the lead man have he live he brother would have assist he in the government and direction of that portion of the tribe but when he fall before the desolating pestilence jyanough be too young and inexperienced to be make sachem and the title be confer on a warrior who be deem more capable of support the dignity of the community thenceforth the youth be alone in he wigwam he have no sister to under take its domestic duty and no friend with whom it please he to dwell he see something in henrich 's countenance that promise sympathy and he frankly demand he friendship and the open-hearted english boy do not refuse to bestow it on the young indian he speak to he in he own tongue and jyanough 's black eye sparkle with joy as he hear word of kindness from the lip of the pale-faced stranger henrich 's height and manly figure make he appear much older than he really be and as he and he new friend walk together towards the village he seem to be jyanough 's equal in age and strength although the young savage be several year he senior as they enter the glade that be surround by lofty tree and stud with wigwam tisquantum and the rest of the party approach by a path on the other side and they all meet in the center of the open space and be welcome by the friendly cree wigwam be appoint to the sachem and he daughter and the most distinguish of the nausett and they pequodee ally while the inferior indian of both tribe be direct to form hut for themselves beneath the neigh boring tree and all be invite to partake freely of the hospitality of they host and to rest at the cree settlement for several day before they resume they journey jyanough conduct he english friend to he own wigwam which be neatly furnish and adorn with native tool and weapon he bid he repose he tired limb on unca ' desert couch and while henrich lay on the bed of soft grass cover with deer skin that occupy one corner of the hut the indian youth busy himself in prepare a evening repast for he guest the chief article of this simple supper consist of _ nokake _ a kind of meal make of parched maize or indian corn which jyanough mixed with water in a calabash bowl and have well knead it make it into small cake and baked they on the ember of he wood-fire the nokake in its raw state constitute the only food of many indian tribe when on a journey they carry it in a bag or a hollow leathern girdle and when they reach a brook or pond they take a spoonful of the dry meal and then one of water to prevent its choke they three or four spoonful be sufficient for a meal for these hardy and abstemious people and with a few dry shellfish or a morsel of deer 's flesh they will subsist on it for month such viand with the addition of some wild fruit from the forest be all that jyanough have to offer to he guest but henrich have know privation at home and he have become accustomed to indian fare the kindness also and the courtesy of the untutored savage as he warmly express he pleasure at receive he into have wigwam be so engaging that the young traveler would cheerfully have put up with worse accommodation from jyanough he now hear the story of he sorrow which deeply interested he and in return he tell he host all that he could remember of he own past life from he residence in holland and he removal to america even till the moment when he and oriana have approach the cree village that evening the red man listen with profound attention and constantly interrupt the narrator with intelligent question on every subject that be interesting to he but especially be he curiosity awaken when henrich in speaking of he grief at be tear from all he friend and relation and he horror when he have anticipate a sudden and violent death allude to he trust in god as the only thing that have then support he under he trial and suffering and still enable he to hope for the future the young christian be not slow in answer all he inquiry as to the nature of the white man 's mahneto and explain to he why the true believer can endure even with cheerfulness affliction and bereavement that be most try to flesh and blood in the confident hope that god will over-rule every event to he people 's good and will eventually restore all that they have lose ` then if i worship you _ keechee-mahneto _ -lrb- \* -rrb- eagerly ask jyanough will he give back to I my brother unca i have call on my mahneto for four long moon in vain i have offer he the best of my weapon and the chief of my prey in hunting and i have promise to pour on unca ' grave the blood of the first prisoner i capture in war or the first of we enemy that i can take by subtlety still mahneto do not hear I tell I then pale-face would you god hear I ' -lrb- footnote : _ keechee-mahneto _ or great master of life be the name give by the cree to they notion of the supreme be maatche-mahneto be the great spirit of evil -rrb- henrich be much move at the impassioned eagerness of the indian whose naturally mild and pensive expression be now change for one of bitter disappointment and even of ferocity and then again animated with a look of anxious hope and inquiry ` yes jyanough ' he reply with earnest solemnity ` my god will hear you but he will not give you back you brother in this world if you learn to believe in he and to serve he and to pray to he in sincerity he will guide you to that bless land where after death all he people meet together and where there be neither sorrow nor separation ' ` but be uncas there ' cry the young savage ` be my brother there for i will serve no mahneto who will not restore I to he ' we young theologian be disconcert for a moment at this puzzling question which have excite doubt and difficulty in wiser head than he end to which scripture give no direct reply he pause awhile and then he remember that passage in the second chapter of the epistle to the roman where the apostle be speak of the requirement of the law and go on to say ` when the gentile which have not the law do by nature the thing contain in the law these have not the law be a law unto themselves : which show the work of the law write in they heart they conscience also bear witness and they thought the mean while accuse or else excuse one another ' ` if st paul could say this of the severe and uncompromising law surely ' think henrich ` the gospel of love and mercy must hold out equal hope for those heathen who perish in involuntary ignorance but who have act up to that law of conscience which be they only guide ' he also recollect that jesus himself when on earth declare that ` he that _ know not _ and do commit thing worthy of stripe shall be beat with few stripe ' : and therefore he feel justified in permit the young indian to hope that hereafter he might again behold that brother whose virtue and whose affection be the object of he pride and he regret ' i believe ' he reply ` that you brother -- who you say be always kind and just and upright while he live on earth -- be now through the mercy of god in a state of happiness : and i believe that if you also act up to what you know to be right you will join he there and dwell with he for ever but i can tell you how to attain a more perfect happiness and to share the highest joy of heaven in the kingdom that god have prepare for he own son i can tell you what he have declare to be he will with regard to all he human creature even that they should love that son and look to he as they savior and they king o jyanough ask oriana if she be not happier since she learn to love and worship the god of the christian -- the only god who can be just and yet most merciful ' in the vehemence of he feeling henrich bad rather outstrip he companion 's power of follow and comprehend he he see this in jyanough 's wander and incredulous eye and he carefully and patiently proceed to explain to he the first rudiment of religion as he have do to oriana : and to reply to all he doubt and question accord to the ability that god give he a willing learner be generally a quick one and henrich be well please with he second pupil if he be not ready to relinquish he old idea and superstition he be at least well inclined to listen to the doctrine of he new friend and even to receive they in connection with many of he heathen opinion time and the grace of god henrich know could only cause these to give place to a purer belief and entirely banish the _ ` unclean bird ' _ that dwelt in the ` cage ' of the young indian 's mind but the fallow ground have already be in a manner break up and some good seed scatter on the surface : and henrich lay down to rest with a fervent prayer that the dew of the spirit might fall upon it and cause it to grow and to bring forth fruit from the time of henrich 's captivity he bad endeavor to keep up in he own mind a remembrance of the sabbath or the lord 's day -lrb- as it be always call by the puritan -rrb- and as far as it be in he power to do so he observe it as a day of rest from common occupation and amusement on that day he invariably decline join any hunting or fishing party and he also select it as the time for he longest spiritual conversation with oriana as he desire that she also should learn to attach a peculiar feeling of reverence to a day that must be sacred to every christian but which be always observe with remarkable strictness by the sect to which henrich belong in this as in all other custom that the young pale-face wish to follow he be unopposed by tisquantum who seem entirely indifferent as to the religious feeling or social habit of he adopted son so long as he acquire a skill in the art of war and hunting : and in these respects henrich 's progress fully answer he expectation he be like most youth of he age extremely fond of every kind of sport and he strength and activity -- which have greatly increase since he have adopt the wild life of the indian -- render every active exercise easy and delightful to he he consequently grow rapidly in the sachem 's favor and in that of all he companion who learn to love he kind and courteous manners as much as they admire he courage and address one only of the red man envy he the esteem that he gain and hate he for it this be coubitant -- the aspirant for the chief place in tisquantum 's favor and for the honor of one day become he son-in-law from the moment that the captor 's life have be spare by the sachem and he have be disappoint of he expected vengeance for the death of he friend tekoa the savage have harbor in he breast a feeling of hatred towards the son of the slayer and have burn with a malicious desire for henrich s destruction this feeling he be compel as we have observe to conceal from tisquantum but it only gain strength by the restraint impose on its outward expression and many be the scheme that he devise for its gratification at present however he find it impossible to execute any of they and the object of he hate and jealousy be happily unconscious that he have so deadly a enemy continually near he a instinctive feeling have indeed cause henrich to shun the fierce young indian and to be less at ease in he company than in that of the other red warrior but he own generous and forgiving nature forbid he suspect the real sentiment entertain towards he by coubitant or even suppose that he expression of approval and encouragement be all feign to suit he own evil purpose oriana have never like he and time only strengthen the prejudice she feel against he she know that he hope eventually to make she he wife -- or rather he slave -- for coubitant be not a man to relax from any of the domestic tyranny of he race and the more she see of she ` white brother ' and the more she hear from he of the habit and manners of he countryman and of they treatment of they woman the more she feel the usual life of a indian squaw to be intolerable even the companionship of the young female of she own race become distasteful to she for they ignorance and utter want of civilization strike painfully on she now partially cultivate and awaken mind and make she feel ashamed of the coarseness of taste and manners occasionally display by she former friend and associate in the christian captive alone have she find since she mother 's death a companion who could sympathize in she taste and feeling which have ever be above the standard of any other with whom she be acquaint and henrich could do more than sympathize in she aspiration -- he could instruct she how they might be fully realize in the attainment of divine knowledge and the experience of christian love no wonder then that henrich hold already the first place in she heart and imagination and be endow by she lively fancy with every quality and every perfection both of mind and body that she could conceive to herself the simple-minded girl make no concealment of she preference for the young stranger whom she regard as a brother -- but a brother in every way immeasurably she superior -- and she father never check she grow attachment the youth of both party the position that henrich occupy in he family as he adopted son and the difference of race and color prevent he from even anticipate that a warmer sentiment than fraternal affection could arise between they and he fully regard he daughter as the future inmate and mistress of a indian warrior 's lodge -- whether that of coubitant or of some other brave would he consider entirely depend on the comparative prowess in war and hunting and the value of the present that would be the offering of those who claim she hand that she should exercise any choice in the matter never occur to he and probably have he foresee that such would be the case and that the choice would fill on the son of a stranger -- on the pale-faced captive whose father have slay she only brother -- he would have remove she from such dangerous influence but he think not of such consequence result from the intimacy of henrich and oriana : he only see that he child be happy and that she daily improve in grace and intelligence and in the skilful and punctual performance of all she domestic duty and he be well satisfied that he have not shed the blood of the christian youth on the grave of he lose tekoa he own esteem and affection for he adopted son also continue to increase and young as henrich be the influence of he superior cultivation of mind and rectitude of principle be feel even by the aged chief and cause he to treat he at time with a degree of respect that add bitterness to coubitant 's malicious feeling he see how fondly oriana regard she adopt brother and personal jealousy make he more clear-sighted as to the possibility of she affection ripen into love than she father have as yet become and gladly would the rival of the unsuspecting henrich have blacken he in the eye of the chieftain and cause he to be banish from the lodge have he be able to find any accusation against he but in this he invariably fail for the pale-face be brave honest and truthful to a degree that baffle the ingenuity of he wily foe : and coubitant find that instead of lower henrich in the regard of the sachem he only excite he to take he part still more and also run a great risk of lose all the favor which he have himself attain in tisquantum 's eye the sudden friendship that the young jyanough have conceive for the white stranger and the consequent favor with which he be look upon by oriana tend still more to irritate the malignant savage and when a few day after the arrival of tisquantum 's party at the cree village he see the three young friend seat amicably together beneath a shadow tree and evidently engage in earnest conversation he could not resist steal silently behind they and lurk in the underwood that form a thick background to they position in order to listen to the subject of they discourse how astonished and how indignant be he to find that henrich be reasoning eloquently against the cruel and ridiculous superstition of the indian tribe and point out to he attentive hearer the infinite superiority of the christian 's belief and the christian 's practice the acquiescence that oriana express to the simple but forcible argument of the pale-face add to he exasperation and he be also angry as well as astonished to perceive that the young cree although he be yet unconvinced be still a willing listener and a anxious inquirer as to the creed of he white friend madden with rage and excite also by the hope of at length arouse the anger of the sachem against the christian youth he forget he former caution and hurry away with quick and noiseless step to the wigwam occupy by tisquantum and break unceremoniously upon he repose as he sit in a half-dreaming state on the soft mat that cover the floor and ` drink smoke ' from he long clay pipe with vehement gesture coubitant explain to the sachem the cause of he sudden interruption and implore he to listen to the counsel of he most faithful friend and subject and to lose no time in banish from he favor and presence one who show himself unworthy of all the benefit he have heap upon he and who employ the life that have be so unduly spare in pervert the mind of he benefactor 's only child in vain he eloquence -- in vain he wrath tisquantum regard he calmly until he have exhaust he torrent of passionate expostulation and then quietly remove the pipe from he lip he reply with he and decision -- ` my brother be angry he zeal for the honor of mahneto have make he forget he respect for the sachem and the sachem 's adopted son the life of the white stranger be spare that he might bring joy to the mournful eye of oriana he have do so my daughter smile again and it be well coubitant may go ' he then resume he pipe and close he eye again give himself up to the drowsy contemplation which the entrance of coubitant have interrupted and the disappointed warrior retire with a scowl on he dark brow and aggravate malice in he still darker heart chapter viii ` they proceed from evil to evil and they know not I saith the lord ' jer ix 3 the indifference of tisquantum on the subject of the religious opinion that he daughter might imbibe from she christian companion may seem strange but the sachem though a heathen be in fact no fanatic he believe -- or profess to believe -- that he be himself in the possession of supernatural power and so long as these pretension be acknowledge and he continue to enjoy the confidence and veneration of he ignorant countryman he be perfectly satisfied henrich have also on they first acquaintance distinctly profess he faith in the existence and the power of the great mahneto or _ master of life _ and this be all the _ religion _ -- properly so call -- of which tisquantum have any idea he do not therefore give himself any concern as to the other object of he adopted son 's belief or worship neither do he care to prevent oriana from listen to the doctrine of the pale-face so long as she continue obedient and gentle and neglect none of the duty of a indian squaw the feeling of coubitant be different not only do he burn with a eager desire to deprive he rival of the sachem 's love and esteem but he also entertain a strong abhorrence of the religion of the white man as he have see it practice and know it be disseminate by the spanish settler in mexico whither he have travel in he early youth in he eye these christian be base idolater for such be the impression make on he by the image and crucifix that he behold and the mark of veneration that be pay to these idol of wood and stone by the superstitious and degenerate spaniard of that district when therefore he hear henrich endeavor to inculcate the worship of jesus as the son of god on oriana and jyanough he not unnaturally regard he as a believer in all the deity whose image he have see associate with that of jesus and receive equal homage such unhappily have too often be the impression make on the mind of the heathen in every quarter of the globe by the vain and superstitious observance of the roman church when she minister have propose to they acceptance so corrupt a form of christianity instead of the pure and holy doctrine of unadulterated scripture to those nation already give over to idolatry it have appear that they civilized teacher be only offer they another kind of image - worship but to the indian of north america -- who make use of no image of they deity and generally acknowledge but one great spirit of universal power and beneficence and one spirit of evil -- the carve and paint figure of the spanish invader naturally give the idea of a multitude of god and in some of they excited unbounded indignation and hatred this be the case with coubitant who though totally uninfluenced by any love or fear of the great mahneto whom he profess to worship be yet -- like many other bigot of various country and creed -- keenly jealous of any innovation in the religion of he nation and ready to oppose and even to exterminate all who attempt to subvert it he now regard henrich as such a aggressor on the national faith and practice and he consequently hate he with a redoubled hatred and cease not to plot in secret he ultimate destruction meanwhile he intended victim be pass he time in considerable enjoyment and with a sense of perfect security among the cree this tribe be at that time remarkable for hospitality and likewise for courage and integrity these good quality have sadly degenerate since they intercourse with european have enable they to gratify the passion of all savage for intoxicate liquor : but at the period of which we be speak they be a singularly fine race of indian and they renown as warrior enable they to extend protection to such of the neighbor tribe as enter into alliance with they disease have indeed recently reduce they number in many of the village that be situate in the dense forest and be thus deprive of a free circulation of air and the wigwam at which tisquantum 's party have arrive be among those that have suffer most severely several of the lodge have be altogether desert in consequence of the death of the proprietor in which case the indian frequently strip off the thick mat which form the outer covering of the wigwam and leave the bare pole a perishing monument of desolation this be only do when the head of the family die the property of which he have not otherwise dispose during he life be then bury with he and he friend continue for a long period to revisit the grave and make offering of food arm and cooking utensil these article be deem sacred to the spirit of the depart and no indian would think of take they away unless he replace they with something of equal value this be permit and the custom must often afford relief to the hungry traveler through the forest who come unexpectedly upon the burial grounds of some of he race and find the grave amply supply with maize and tobacco -- more useful to the living than to the dead many such grave besides that of unca be to be see in the vicinity of the cree village : and it seem likely that they number would be still augmented for the disease which have already prove so fatal have not leave the wigwam although its violence have considerably abate old terah the uncle of jyanough and the chief of the present sachem 's council lay dangerously ill and all the charm and all the barbarous remedy usually resort to in such case have be employ by the cree powow in vain terah be one of the pince or pniese -- a dignity confer only on man of approve courage and wisdom -- and many a successful incursion have he lead into the great plain of saskatchawan where dwell the stone indian with whom the cree have long be at enmity -- and many a prisoner have he bring back to he village and slay as a offering to maatche-mahneto while he hang the scalp that he have tear from the quiver victim on the wall of he lodge as its proudest ornament terah be also as wise in counsel as he be valiant in war and although he age prevent he assume the office of sachem or ruler of the village -lrb- \* -rrb- on the death of he brother yet he wisdom and experience give he great influence with chingook the present chief and cause he life to be regard as of peculiar value by the whole community -lrb- footnote : almost every considerable village have its sachem or chief who be subordinate to the great sachem or sagamore of the whole tribe -rrb- the arrival of so celebrate a powow as tisquantum during a time of sickness-and especially when the death of so important a personage as terah be apprehend -- be hail with great joy by the whole village and present of food clothing and arm pour into the lodge that form he temporary abode from such of the cree as desire to secure he medical and supernatural aid for the relief of they suffering relative all day he be occupy in visit the wigwam of the sick and employ charm or incantation to drive away the evil spirit from he patient sometimes also administer violent emetic and other drug from he _ obee-bag _ or medicine-pouch which contain a multitude of heterogeneous article such as herb bone shell serpent ' tooth and pebble -- all necessary to the art and practice of a powow on the venerable terah he skill and patience be principally exercise and many be the torment that he inflict on the die old savage and which be bear by the pince with all the calm endurance that become he dignity and reputation terah like all other of he exalted rank have attain to the honor of be a pince by serve a hard apprenticeship to suffer and privation in he early youth he have pass through the ordeal triumphantly -- and he who have run barefoot through sharp and tear thorn -- who have endure to have he shin beat with a hard and heavy mallet and he flesh burn with red hot spear -- and have not even betray a sense of pain -- in order to attain the rank of a great counselor and the privilege of attend the sachem as one of he guard of honor -- do not shrink when he barbarous physician burn a blister on he chest with red-hot ash and scarify the horny sole of he foot till the blood flow plentifully those and strong emetic herb which he force he patient to repeat until he faint away constitute the medical treatment of tisquantum : but much greater benefit be expect -- and such be the power of imagination in these ignorant savage that it be often attain -- from the practice of he charm and conjuration as soon as tisquantum see he noble patient reduce to a state of unconsciousness by he physical treatment he commence a course of spiritual incantation in a fierce and unnatural voice he call on hobbamock or satan who he declare be visible to he in one of he many form of a eagle a deer a fawn and sometimes a gigantic human be he then adjure the evil spirit and command he to remove the disease promising in return to offer to he skin and hatchet and even the scalp of he foe if any sign of return consciousness appear the powow speedily banish they by a repetition of he wild howl which he continue for hour at the same time throw himself about with wild and unnatural gesture and striking he hand violently on he leg until he become as much exhaust as he unlucky patient it be during one of these awful exhibition of heathen cruelty and superstition that henrich one evening draw nigh to the lodge of terah accompany by oriana and pause at the open entrance in amazement and horror at the scene he behold the die man lay stretch on the ground in the center of the outer room of the hut where he have be place that he might enjoy the full benefit of the great powow 's skill he eye be close and he gray hair hang matted end disorder on the ground while he emaciated feature appear to be fix in death a frightful wound be on he breast and blood be trickle from he lacerated foot while the involuntary contraction of he limb alone denote that he be yet alive and sensible to suffer which he be now unable to make any effort to conceal around the wall of the hut stand many of he relative and dependant whose countenance express anxiety and hope mingle with fear of the priestly sachem among the bystander henrich instantly recognize he friend jyanough and he shudder to see the ingenious and inquire youth assist at such satanic rite but the figure that chiefly attract he attention and to which he eye become rivet be that of tisquantum -- the father of he gentle and beloved oriana there stand the sachem : he whose countenance he have seldom see disturb from he usual expression of gravity and composure and whose dignity of manner have hitherto always command he respect there he now stand -- a victim to satanic influence he tall figure be dilate to its utmost height by excitement and violent muscular effort as he stand by the side of the sick man he eye be fix with a fearful and unmeaning glare on the darkest corner of the hut and seem to be start from they socket while he hand stiff and motionless be extend over the body of terah as if to guard he from the assault of some demon visible to the conjuror alone in this statue-like posture he remain for some moment while he breast heave convulsively and foam gather on he parted lip then suddenly he utter a yell -- so loud and so unearthly that henrich start with surprise and terror : and oriana catch he hand and try to draw he away from a scene that now fill she soul with shame and sorrow but henrich do not move : he do not heed the beseech voice and the gentle violence of he companion whose wish be generally command to she white brother that yell have recall the patient to partial consciousness and he roll he blood-shot eye around he as if endeavor to collect he wander sens and then he haggard countenance again resume the expression of imperturbable composure and firm endurance that a indian warrior think it a disgrace to lose even in the extremity of suffer then tisquantum sink on one knee beside he and burst forth into a passionate address to he deity -- the power of good and evil -- whom he regard as almost equally mighty to decide the fate of the patient ' o mahneto ' he exclaim in a hoarse and howling voice ' o richtan-mahneto -lrb- 1 -rrb- who create the first man and woman out of a stone and place they in these forest to be the parent of thy red child be it thy will that terah shall leave he brethren to mourn he depart goodness and wisdom and go on that long and toilsome journey that lead to the hunting-grounds of we forefather surely when he spirit _ knock at the door _ it will be open to he and the warrior of we tribe will welcome he while he foe will be drive away with the awful sentence _ quachet _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- yes terah the wise in counsel and the fearless in war shall surely dwell in the field of happiness and again strike the prey with the renew strength and skill of he youth but not yet mahneto o

weettako around he -lrb- 3 -rrb- but tisquantum 's charm be too strong for he : he can not approach the sick man now ha maatche - mahneto ' he cry -- and again he fix he glaring eye on the dark space in the far corner of the hut from which the spectator have shrink tremble away -- ' ha spirit of evil i behold thee -- and i defy thee terah be not thine and my power have compel thee to send the _ ashkook _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- with he healing tongue to lick my brother 's wound and _ wobsacuck _ with eagle beak to devour the venom that clog he vein and make he breath come short and thick i feel they

powow to work good instead of evil -rrb- tisquantum close he wild oration with another loud and prolonged yell to which all the spectator who crowd the side of the hut reply by a short and yelping cry : and the powow sink on the ground by the side of he patient faint and exhaust by the violent and sustained exertion to which both he mind and body have be subject for several hour without intermission the attendant among whom jyanough be foremost hasten to he assistance and administer to he some needful refreshment and henrich turn away grieve and disgust and fall of sympathy for he once heathen companion who he now remember be stand by he side and witness the wild and degrading extravagance of a father whom she both loved and respect he look into she deep expressive eye and see that they be fill with tear of humiliation and mental agony how could it be otherwise how could she -- who have learn to love a god of mercy and to believe in a meek and lowly savior -- bear to see she father thus the slave of satan and the minister of cruel and heathen superstition especially how could she bear that so degrading a scene should he witness by he from whom she have derive all she know of the gospel of joy and peace and whose esteem be more precious to she than the opinion of all the world beside silently she walk by henrich 's side for neither of they be incline to speak the thought that fill they mind and silently they would have proceed to oriana 's dwelling where she white brother propose to leave she with she attendant and then to return and seek he deluded friend jyanough but ere they reach tisquantum 's lodge they be overtake by the indian youth jyanough have be too much engross by the exciting scene that take place in terah 's dwelling -- and too eagerly watch for some favorable appearance that might encourage he to hope for the life of he only survive relative -- to observe that henrich be also a spectator of these heathen rite until all be conclude and the patient and he physician be alike overpower by heat and exhaustion then he have glance towards the door and have see the saddened expression that cloud the open feature of the christian youth and the look of anguish that oriana cast on she degraded father and then all the truth that henrich have endeavor so simply and so patiently to impress upon he mind -- all the argument that he white friend have employ to win he from heathen darkness and guide he into divine truth -- rush at once upon he memory he feel ashamed of the remain superstition that have lead he to take part in such vain ceremony and to deem that they could conduce to he uncle 's recovery after he have hear and even assent to the holy belief of the christian in the universal power of almighty god and the victory of he son jesus christ over the devil and all he angel and he be grieve also that he kind and anxious young teacher should regard he as a ungrateful and possibly even as a deceitful hearer he therefore hasten after henrich and oriana and overtake they as they approach the lodge appropriate to the nausett sachem ` be you angry with you red brother ' he inquire earnestly as he lay he hand on henrich 's shoulder and look sadly in he face ` do you think that jyanough be a deceiver and that he have listen to the teaching of the white stranger only to gain he friendship and then to forsake he and betray he and return to the religion of he own people o no jyanough 's heart be open and clear before the eye of he friend and he will gladly listen again to all the good thing that henrich tell he for he heart say that they be true but he soul be still very dark and when he see terah ready to die and feel that when he be go there would be none to love he among all he tribe the cloud grow thicker and thicker and maatche-mahneto seem to look out of the midst of the deep gloom with wrathful eye of fire and beckon he to follow to terah 's lodge and join in the worship which the great powow be about to offer will you mahneto forgive he henrich the heart of the christian boy be penetrate with joy and thankfulness at this frank confession of the young indian he clearly see that the struggle -- the universal and enduring struggle -- between the power of good and evil have already commence in the soul of the red man and he have full confidence in the bless declaration that ` he who have begin a good work of grace in the immortal spirit will surely perfect it unto the end ' therefore he reply without hesitation ` he will certainly forgive you jyanough and if you desire he help to make you soul light and strong and joyful and ask for that help in sincerity and truth he will most assuredly give it to you let we enter the lodge and there unite we prayer to the great spirit who be the god and father of all he creature that he will graciously shed he light and he truth into all we heart and especially that he will remove all the doubt and fear that still lie sadly and heavily on we brother 's spirit ' the three young friend do so : and in the desert chamber of the great heathen powow tisquantum the voice of christian supplication ascend to the throne of a prayer-answering god could it ascend unheeded or fail to bring down in he own good time a answer of peace chapter ix ` the dark place of the earth be full of the habitation of cruelty ' psa lxxiv 20 the night that follow this conversation jyanough pass in terah 's lodge and he nurse he suffering relative with gentle patience but he see no sign of recovery although the woman and the cree powow assure he that the fatal disease be drive away by tisquantum 's powerful incantation and that when the sun rise he would see the spirit of terah revive so have the conjuror declare and so these misguided heathen believe but when the first beam of open day enter the door of the lodge which be set open to receive they and fall on the dark and pallid feature of the aged sufferer jyanough could no longer be deceive into hope he see that he revered uncle be die and he hasten to inform henrich of the fact and to entreat he to return with he to terah 's wigwam and to prey to the great spirit in he behalf henrich readily comply : and he too be convince by the first glance at the die indian that no human aid however skilful could long retain that once powerful spirit in its worn and waste tenement of clay he kneel down by the side of terah 's couch and jyanough knelt with he and regardless of the wonder gaze of the ignorant attendant he offer up a short and simple prayer to god for the soul of the depart warrior the cree powow who have watch the sick man during the night have leave the lodge as soon as daylight set in to collect material for a great burnt offering they deign to make as a last resource in front of the pince 's dwelling as henrich and jyanough rise from they knee the heathen priest enter bear string of wampum article of furniture of clothing food tobacco and everything of any value that they have be able to obtain from the friend of terah all these various article be display before the dim eye of the invalid for whose benefit they be to be reduce to a heap of useless ash and a faint smile of satisfaction pass over terah 's countenance : but he speak not jyanough then bent down and press he lip to the cold brow of he almost unconscious uncle and hurry with henrich from the lodge for he could not bear again to witness any repetition of the heathen ceremony that have cause he so much shame the precede day : neither could he endure to see he last relative leave the world surround by a spiritual darkness which it be not in he power to dispel the young friend take they way into the forest that they might be beyond the sight and the sound of those rite that be about to be perform for the recovery of one who have already begin to travel through ` the valley of the shadow of death ' they have not however go far in a westerly direction before they chance they intention and resolve to return to the village the cause of this change of purpose be they meeting with a band of cree warrior who have go out some week previously on a expedition against a settlement of they enemy the stone indian and be now return from the plain of the saskatchawan laden with spoil many of the cree bear scalp suspend from they belt as bloody trophy of victory and all have arm and skin and ornament that they have carry away from the pillage wigwam of they foe henrich could not help gaze with admiration at the party of warrior as they approach the greater part of they be mount on beautiful and spirited horse of the wild breed of the western prairie which they ride with a ease and grace that astonish the young englishman they wear no cover on they head and they black hair be cut short except one long scalp-lock hang behind so that they fine countenance which be rather of the roman cast be fully expose to view they dress consist of a large blanket wrap gracefully round the waist and confine by a belt so as to leave the bust and arm bare and so perfect and muscular be they figure that they have the appearance of noble bronze statue they native weapon consist of spear and bow with highly ornamented quiver suspend from they shoulder and battle-axis hang to they belt add much to they martial and picturesque effect behind the horseman follow a band on foot who carry the steal treasure of the waste village and henrich look with curiosity at the various and beautifully decorate article of dress and hunting equipment that have form the pride and the wealth of the defeat stone indian but the part of the spoil that interested and distressed both henrich and he companion more than all the rest be a young indian warrior who with he wife and she infant have be bring away as prisoner to add to the triumph and probably to glut the vengeance of they conqueror there be a unextinguished fire in the eye of the captive and a expression of fearless indignation in the proud bearing with which he stride by the side of he captor that clearly tell how bravely he would sell he life but for the cord that tightly bind he wrist behind he and be hold by a powerful cree on each side behind he walk he wife with downcast feature and falter step and at she back hang she little infant suspend in a bag or pouch of deer skin half fill with the soft bog-moss so much use by indian squaw to form the bed -- and indeed the only covering -- of they child during the first year of they existence the eye of the captive young mother be fix tearfully on the majestic form of she husband who be too proud -- perhaps also too sad -- to turn and meet she gaze while the eye of he foe be upon he to detect he slightest weakness even the low wail cry of she child be unheed by this broken hearted wife in that sad hour for she well know the custom of indian warfare and she have no hope for the life of she warrior even if she own should be spare henrich gaze on the little group in pity for be instinctively read they story and they coming fate in they countenance and in the cruel glance that fall on they from they guard he look at jyanough and in he expressive feature he see a fell confirmation of he worst fear ` they will sacrifice they to maatche-mahneto in the vain hope of lengthen terah 's life ' he softly whisper in henrich 's ear ` let we go back and seek oriana perhaps for she sake tisquantum may ask the life of the squaw and she young child and as chingook 's honor guest they would be grant to he but there be no hope for the warrior he blood will surely be shed to appease maatche-mahneto and to atone for the death of several of the cree brave who have fall this year by the hand of the stone tribe ' hastily henrich turn and follow by jyanough take a by-path well know to they and enter the village before the arrival of the warrior and they unhappy prisoner a brief explanation be sufficient to enlist all the kindly feeling and all the christian spirit of oriana in favor of they project and she lose no time in seek she father who have again repair to terah 's hut to superintend the costly sacrifice that be be offer in he behalf she find he exult in a partial improvement in he patient whose sens have again return with a brief and deceitful brilliance and attribute what he call the aged pince 's recovery to the potency of he own spell this be no time for oriana to argue with the elated powow on the fallacy of he pretension she therefore listen patiently to he boasting and then with much feeling and natural eloquence tell he the cause of she interrupt he at such a moment and besought he to exert all he great influence with the cree to induce they to spare the life of the stone captive tisquantum listen with attention to she story and she petition for he be always gentle to oriana but he give she little hope of that fall success which she warm young heart desire and anticipate ` my child ' he say ' i will do what you ask so far as to request that the woman and child may be place at you disposal but the warrior 's life i can not demand for it would be a insult to the brave cree to suppose that they would suffer a enemy to escape and tell he tribe that they be woman-hearted no he must die and if the soul of he ancestor dwell in he he will exult in the opportunity of show how even a stone indian can meet death ' oriana be repulse but not defeat by this reply ` nay my father ' she again begin ` either save all or let all perish do not take the brave young warrior from he wife and child and leave they in poverty and sorrow but plead for mercy to be show to he also -- and so may mercy be show to he conqueror and to you he deliverer when -- ' ` peace child ' interrupt the sachem with more asperity than he usually show to oriana ` these be the notion you have learn from you white brother and i desire not to hear they tisquantum know he duty i will demand the life of the woman and child of whom you speak but the warrior must abide he fate and think you that he would not scorn to live when honor be go i go ' -- he add more gently as he see the sorrow that dim she eye -- ` go and tell jyanough to meet I at the sachem 's lodge terah may yet be save -- this victim come at s happy moment and surely mahneto demand he life as at offer for that of the venerable pince ' oriana shudder at what she see to be she father 's meaning once she would have feel as he do and have believe that they god could be propitiate by blood and agony but now she know that all such cruel sacrifice be worse than vain and deeply she regret she own inability to bring she countryman and especially she own beloved father to a knowledge of the gospel of mercy and peace and thus save they from imbrue they hand in the blood of they fellow man and think that they do good service to the great spirit she hurry back to she companion and weep tell they of she partial success it be all and more than all that jyanough expect and he immediately go to meet tisquantum at the lodge of the cree sachem chingook where he find the war party and they prisoner assemble after a few word to jyanough tisquantum commence a long speech to he brother sachem in which he dilate on the friendship that subsist between they and the joy that he have feel in exercise he skill for the benefit of the brave and hospitable cree he then speak of terah 's perilous condition and he fear that even he power have be baffle by the spirit of evil and that the pince would yet be take from they unless some offering could be find more precious than all that be now pile before he dwelling and only wait for the auspicious moment to be wrap inflame we a sacrifice to the offended deity who have bring the pestilence ` and have we not such a offering here ' he add point to the captive warrior who stand with head erect await the sentence that he know would be pronounced ` have we not here a victim send by mahneto himself at the very moment when terah 's life seem hang on a breath lead he then to the sacred pile and as he soul go forth the soul of terah shall revive this speech be receive with acclamation by the cree and already the warrior be hurry away they captive while he wife follow as if mechanically to share she husband 's fate bat here tisquantum interpose and in he daughter 's name request the life of the woman and she child he request be readily grant by chingook for of what value be a squaw in the eye of these indian brave the daughter of we friend and benefactor shall be deny nothing that she ask ' reply the cree chief ` take the woman to oriana 's lodge and let she be she slave ' jyanough approach to lead away the unhappy woman but she turn on he a look of despairing misery and lay she band on she husband 's arm say quickly ' i will see my lincoya die and then i will follow you where you will for mailah have no home ' jyanough do not oppose she for he heart be touch by she sorrow and she fortitude and the captive warrior turn he head and bent on she sad countenance one look of tenderness and approbation that tell how deeply he be sensible of she devotion he do not speak -- perchance he could not trust he voice in that try moment -- but he follow he guard and he eye be again steadfast and he step be firm henrich and oriana wait anxiously for the return of jyanough : but he come not and they almost fear that tisquantum 's request have be too coldly urge to prove successful it be a calm autumnal day and as the sun rise high in the heaven he beam be shroud by heavy thunder cloud while a low and distant murmur foretell a approach storm and add to the gloom that weigh heavily on oriana 's spirit all the sin and degradation of the faith of she countryman seem to strike upon she mind with a force hitherto unknown and to bow she down in shame and sadness even to henrich -- to she loved christian friend and teacher -- she could not now utter she feeling and when to divert she thought and remove she from the village where he know so cruel a scene would soon be enact he lead she towards the forest she follow he silently they seat themselves beneath a overshadow tree and for some time no sound break the oppressive silence save the soft rustling of the leaf that seem to be move by the spirit of the air-for no wind be stir presently a shriek -- one single cry of agony -- arise from the village : and all be still again ` it be a woman 's voice ' exclaim oriana in a tone of deep suffering ' o henrich they murder the helpless and the innocent and my father consent to the deed ' henrich do not reply he have no comfort to offer but they both gaze towards the village as if hope to discover through the impervious wood that surround it some indication of what be go on in those ` habitation of cruelty ' soon a dense cloud of smoke rise high in the still at and flame shoot up above the intervene tree and then burst forth a mingled din of wild unearthly sound that tell of sated vengeance and malignant joy and demoniac worship fiercely the war cry of the cree ring in the air while above it rise the shrill sound of clash spear and tomahawk and oriana know that the savage be dance round a death - fire and call on mahneto to accept they bloody offering but now the threatening storm break suddenly on that dark place of the earth and it seem to oriana 's troubled spirit that the wrath of heaven be pour upon she benighted race peal after peal resound in quick succession and reverberate from the distant kill while flash of fork lightning follow one another rapidly and dispel for a moment the unnatural darkness the young indian clung tremble and terrify to she companion and hide she face on he shoulder to shut out the fearful scene while henrich speak to she word of comfort and encouragement and at length succeed in calming she agitation the rain pour down in torrent but so dense be the foliage that hang over oriana and she companion that it could not penetrate they place of refuge and they remain await its cessation and watch the curl smoke that seem to die away as the fall torrent extinguish the fire but as it disappear another cloud arise near the same spot and wider and fiercer flame spring up that defy the rain and continue to burn with more and more strength whence could they arise surely the wigwam be on fire henrich communicate this fear to oriana and they arise and hurry together towards the village where a appalling scene meet they eye in front of terah 's dwelling be the smolder remains of the sacrificial fire on which -- still uphold by the stake to which he have be bind -- the burnt and blacken form of a man be visible while close by the ash lay a woman so motionless that she seem as totally deprive of life as the wretched victim himself and a child be recline on she shoulder whose faint wail cry show that it yet live and suffer none heed the melancholy group for the warrior whose wild song and frantic dance have be interrupt by the sudden violence of the storm be all now engage in fruitless effort to extinguish the flame that be rapidly consume the lodge of terah the lightning have strike it and ignite its roof of reed and so rapidly have the whole dwelling become a prey to the dreadful element that even the removal of the die sage have be despair of but jyanough who have be a silent spectator of all the previous scene of cruelty be not to be daunt by the smoke and flame that burst through the entrance and drive from the chamber of death all the attendant of the sufferer boldly he rush into terah 's dwelling and just as henrich and oriana enter the open space in front of it they behold he issue forth blacken with smoke and scorch with fire and bend beneath the weight of he uncle 's corpse yes terah be already a corpse all the charm and incantation of the powow bad fail to banish the disease that be send to summon he away all the treasure that have be destroy and the precious life - blood that have be spill to propitiate false deity could not for one moment arrest the fiat of the true ` master of life ' or detain the spirit which be recall by ` he who give it ' that spirit have pass away amidst the noise of the tempest and when henrich spring forward and assist he friend to lay the body gently on the earth they see that the spark of life have flee all further attempt at extinguish the fire be now abandon and the cree gather round they depart friend to condole with jyanough who be he nearest relative and to commence that dismal howling by which they express they grief on such occasion all the property of the dead man be already consume but the best mat and skin that jyanough 's wigwam contain be bring to wrap the corpse in and when the site of he former dwelling could be clear of ash and rubbish a grave be speedily dig in the center of it and the body lay by the simple sepulchre around which the friend of the venerated pince seat themselves and howl and weep and detail the virtue and the wisdom of the dead jyanough be expect to act the part of chief mourner in these ceremony and the real affection he have entertain for he uncle induce he to comply and to remain all that day and all the follow night at the grate but he refuse to cover he face with soot -- as be customary on such occasion of domestic sorrow -- or to join the powow in they frantic cry and exorcism to drive off the weettako from suck the dead man 's blood the presence of henrich seem to annoy and irritate these priest of satan and he be glad to retire from a scene so repugnant to he better feeling and to return to oriana by whose care and direction the unhappy mailah and she infant have be promptly remove from the place of death and desolation and convey to she own apartment in tisquantum 's lodge she kind effort have restore the poor young widow to consciousness and she now sit on the floor with she child on she knee listen with a calmness that almost seem apathy to the word of comfort that be utter by the gentle squaw-sachem mailah be very young scarcely sixteen summer have pass over she head and yet -- such be indian life -- she have already be a wife and a mother and now alas she be a widow she grief have be passionate at the last and have burst forth in that one wild cry that have startle oriana 's ear in the forest but that be over now and she seem resign to she hard fate and willing to endure it perhaps this be for she infant 's sake and perhaps she sensibility be blunt by the life she have lead in common with the rest of she race and sex -- a life in which the best feeling and sympathy of we nature be almost unknown it be not until oriana lead she to speak of she past life and the home of she youth -- now desolate and in ruin -- that tear of natural grief flow from she eye then she seem rouse to a full sense of all she have lose end break out into mournful lamentation for she murder lincoya whose noble quality and high lineage she eloquently extol while she sadly contrast she present lonely and desolate position with she happiness as the squaw of so distinguish a warrior and so successful a hunter oriana say all she could to console she and assure she of she protection and friendship and of a home in she lodge when they return to they own country where she should live as she sister and bring up she little lincoya to emulate he father 's courage and virtue : and ere long the simple young savage again grow calm say lift up she soft black eye and smile gratefully at she new friend and benefactor she say she bad no wish to return to she own tribe for all she family and friend have be destroy in the recent massacre and the village where she have spend such happy day be reduce to ash she therefore be well content to remain with the youthful squaw-sachem to whose intercession she know she owe she own life and that of she child and in whose service she profess she willingness to live and die she manner and appearance greatly interested henrich for they be mark by much greater refinement than he have see in any of the indian female except oriana this be to be account for by she noble birth for in those day the indian chieftain pride themselves on the purity and nobility of they lineage and no member of a sachem 's family be allow to marry one of a inferior race a certain air of dignity generally distinguish the privileged class even among the female although they life be not exempt from much of hardship and servitude and they be regard as altogether the inferior of they lord and master to oriana the arrival of the young mother and she playful child be a source of much pleasure and comfort for she have begin to feel the want of female society and the woman who accompany tisquantum 's party and assist she in the domestic duty of the family be no companion to she in mailah she see that she could find a friend and she kindness and sympathy soon attach the lonely young squaw to she and even restore she to cheerfulness and activity it be only when she visit the grave in which henrich and jyanough have lay the murder lincoya and deck it with flower and green bough that the widow seem to feel the greatness of she affliction then she would weep bitterly and with passionate gesture lament she brave warrior but at other time she be fully occupy with the care of she little lincoya or in assist oriana in the light household duty that devolve upon she and she sweet voice be often hear singing to the child which generally hang at she back nestle in its soft bed of moss chapter x ` the noble courser break away and bound o'er the plain the desert echo to he tread as high he toss would he graceful head and shake he flow name king of the western desert thou art still untam would and free ne'er shall that crest he force to bow beneath the yoke of drudgery low : but still in freedom shalt thou roam the boundless field that form thy home thy native prairie ' anon the camp of the indian hunter look cheerful and picturesque as oriana and mailah approach it one evening on they return from a ramble in the forest where they have be to seek the wild fruit that now abound there and pause at the skirt of the wood to admire the scene before they the propose hunting-ground have be reach the precede day and already the temporary hut be complete and the tent of the sachem pitch beneath a grove of lofty oak and walnut free from underwood and on the border of a clear and ripple stream the nausett and pequodee hunter have purchase a considerable number of horse from they cree friend and therefore the journey from chingook 's village to the prairie in which the encampment now stand have be perform with much ease and expedition and the hardy animal be so little fatigued by they march through the forest that several of the younger indian have mount again the morning after they arrival and go off on a reconnoiter expedition to discover what prospect there be of find much game in that neighborhood henrich -- proud and happy in the possession of a spirited horse with which tisquantum have present he -- insist on be one of the party end he be accompany also by jyanough who have leave he native village now render sad and gloomy in he eye to follow he white friend and share he society at least for a time this arrangement give henrich the greatest satisfaction for the young cree be the only indian of he own sex in whom he have be able to find a companion or who have peculiarly attach himself to the stranger : and the more he see of jyanough the more he find in he to win he esteem and friendship oriana and mailah seat themselves on the luxuriant grass to rest and the young indian mother remove she child from the strange cradle in which she always carry it and lay it on she knee and then after gaze at it for a few moment she begin to sing a wild sweet song to hush it to sleep in a soft monotonous cadence she sing the sad story of its little life -- its birth -- its captivity -- and the death of its murder father whom she exhort it to imitate and live to equal in courage and in skill and thus she sing : ` child of the slay lincoya sleep in peace thy mother wake to guard thee but where be he whose smile once fall on thee as sunshine -- thy father lincoya he be go to the far distant hunting-grounds and there again he cast the spear and there he draw the unerring bow and there he quaff the cup of immortality with the spirit of the good and brave o lincoya thy voice be to I as a sweet song or as the summer breeze among the tall cypress tree -- why didst thou leave I thy step be swift and graceful as the roe upon the mountain -- why didst thou leave I but i will follow thee my warrior the death-bird have call I and i come to thee thy child shall live for mahneto have give he friend and a home he shall grow up like thee and oriana shill be o mother to he when i be go : and the blue-eyed stranger whom she love as i love thee shall guide he hand in war and in the chase lincoya i come to thee ' oriana listen to the mournful chant of the young widow with much interest and sympathy but when she speak of she love for she white brother in term so new and strange she almost feel offended she do not however remark on she friend 's allusion to herself but turn the discourse to mailah 's sad prophecy of she own early death which she know could only be ground on one of the wild superstition of she race ` why do you talk of die mailah ' she ask ` you be young and strong and you may again be happy why do you say you will leave you child and go to the land of spirit ' ` the death-bird -lrb- \* -rrb- call to I last night as i sit at the open door of the hut and look at the moon and think how its soft light be guide my lincoya on long long journey to the everlasting hunting field of he father cheepai-peethee call I twice from the tree that hang over the lodge but when i call to it again and whistle clearly it make no answer i hear it the day before the cree destroy we village it call my husband then and would not answer he and in two day he be slay the death-bird be never mistake ' -lrb- footnote : a small owl call _ cheepai-peethee _ or the _ death-bird _ which the indian attach the superstition here allude to and believe if it do not answer to they whistle it denote they speedy death -rrb- ` o mailah ' reply the young christian squaw ` say not so surely it be not thus that the great mahneto call he child to come to he once i believe all these indian story but now i know that they be false and vain i know that we life and all thing that befall we be in the hand of the wise and good god -- the mahneto of the christian and of the red man too and now i have no fear of any of those strange sound that use to make I sad and terrify I with thought of come evil i most teach you to believe as i do now : or rather my _ white brother _ shall teach you for he know the word of mahneto himself see mailah there my brother come -- let we go to meet he ' a flush of joy mount to the clear olive cheek of oriana as she say these word and she spring to she foot with the lightness of a fawn mailah rise more gently and replace she infant in the pouch sling it over she shoulder and follow she friend softly whisper in she ear ` the white stranger be you lincoya ' the indian beauty smile and blush more deeply : but she do not bind across the glade to meet henrich as she have purpose do she draw she slender figure to its full height and stand still and as henrich gallop across the green meadow and alight full of animation to tell she of he success in he first essay at hunting the elk he wonder why she greet he so coldly the fact be that oriana be begin to find that the blue-eyed stranger possess even more interest in she eye than she have ever feel for she own dark brother tekon and when mailah have openly allude to this sentiment -- which she think unknown to all but herself -- she natural and instinctive delicacy be wound but the feeling quickly wear away and as henrich and jyanough detail the exciting sport of the day she forget all but the pleasure of listen to he voice and gaze at he fine countenance and bright sweet smile she be happy and she though not of the future and henrich be happy too he have now find companion whom he could love and the life of the indian hunter be all that he have ever picture to himself of freedom and adventure the beauty of the scenery -- the clearness of the sky -- and the glow of health and excitement that animated he whole frame when he join in the chase with he savage friend be all so entirely different to the life he have lead in damp and foggy holland that it be no wonder he enjoy it and that he youthful spirit enable he to subdue the oft-recurring grief that he feel at each remembrance of he family and he home hope be strong in he breast and he trust once again to meet all whom he love so dearly : and the present be so bright and inspiring that he could not desire to change it yet for many week the camp remain pitch in the same lovely situation and the time of the hunter be fully occupy in the discovery and pursuit of the various wild animal that abound in the uncultivated but richly verdant prairie of these the elk and the buffalo be the most common victim to the spear and arrow of the indian and every evening large quantity of meat be bring into the camp and give to the care of the squaw to dry and cure for winter consumption these larger animal be too heavy to be transport whole to the hut end therefore the hunter always skin they and cut off the flesh where they fall and leave the carcass to the wolf and the bird of prey that be ever ready at hand but the smaller animal and the wild turkey and other bird that be kill in great number be bring in and throw down by the blaze camp fire that light up the glade every night and be speedily prepared and cook for the supper of the hungry hunter as the leader of the expedition tisquantum be always present with the choicest of the game and it be oriana 's task to superintend the curing of the elk and buffalo meat and the cooking that be require for she father 's lodge in all these household care she be greatly assist by mailah who be both active and skilful in all the duty of a indian squaw : and eager also to evince she gratitude for the kindness and protection that be afford to herself and she child by the nausett chief by do all that she could to lighten oriana 's labor time and occupation do not fail to have they usual effect on one so young and naturally so light-hearted as mailah and animated cheerfulness take the place of the mournful expression that have hitherto so frequently sit on she countenance she do not forget lincoya but she forget the call of the death-bird : and when she sing she child to sleep it be no longer with the same sad cadence as at first sorrow could not strike very deep or abide very long in the heart of a be so gay and with a mind and feeling so utterly uncultivated as those of the young stone indian neither could she live so much in the society of the white stranger and he two choose companion without imbibe something of they intelligence and become sensible of they superiority of mind to all other with whom she have ever associate : and she grow more and more attach to they and learn to regret less the friend and companion among whom she youth have be spend she be a high-spirited and courageous creature : she would have follow she husband unhesitatingly to death have she be call on to do so or she would have die to save he if she life could have avail to purchase he but now that he be go and she could not even weep over he grave and deck it with flower and gift she lively spirit rise again and lead she to seek amusement and occupation in everything within she reach the account which henrich and jyanough continually give to she and oriana of they exciting adventure in the prairie have arouse in both of they a strong desire to be spectator of the sport and they seek and obtain tisquantum 's permission to accompany the hunter one morning to the buffalo ground that lay nearest to the camp and there to witness the pursuit and capture of some of those magnificent animal a short ride through the forest bring the party out upon a vast and glorious prairie on which the rich autumnal sun be shine in all he strength on a rise ground that partially overlook the plain oriana and she companion take up they position beneath the shade of a grove of pine and they watch the hunter as they examine the foot - print on the dewy turf or follow the track of the elk and buffalo through the long prairie-grass in order to make they arrangement for enclose the game and drive the animal into a open and central situation in the course of this examination the recent track of a number of wild horse be discover and fresh excitement be feel by the whole party for all be desirous to attempt the capture of these most valuable animal and they resolve on this occasion to make they the chief object of they pursuit a ring be therefore form by the numerous company of horseman enclose a very large space of the beautiful park-like ground which be stud with tree either single or in group while underneath they in the distance could be see many buffalo lie down or grazing the scene have the appearance of a wide extent of finely-cultivated pasture ornament with timber of every kind end it forcibly recall to henrich 's memory the field and the cattle that have surround he european home but the size of the tree the extent of the natural meadow and above all the wild aspect of the red hunter with they spear and bow and tomahawk soon destroy the fancy resemblance while the eagerness and excitement of the novel sport banish all the sad recollection to which it have give rise a desire also to distinguish himself in the presence of oriana and show she that a pale-face could equal she own dark race in courage and dexterity inspire he with peculiar ardor and he gallop to the station appoint he by tisquantum with a heart that bound with pride and pleasure the hunter be each provide with a long coil of grass rope with a noose at the end -- now call a _ lariat _ or _ lasso _ -- use by the indian for cast over the horn of the elk and buffalo or the neck of the wild horse that they desire to capture these they carry in such a manner as to be ready to throw they off in a instant to they whole length if necessary but much practice be require to do this with precision and henrich do not yet hope for success in the difficult art he only chance of capture a wild courser lay in he skill in cast the spear which might enable he to pierce the animal through the upper part of the neck and thus produce a temporary insensibility during which time he might be secure without any permanent injury this also require great precision and address but henrich have become a adept in the use of the light lance and he feel sanguine of success if the opportunity should he afford he the string of horseman slowly and warily draw in towards the open spot that be intend to be the scene of they operation and of which oriana and mailah have a good view from they safe and elevated position and soon a troop of wild horse be disturb by one of the hunter and burst forth from a thick grove of tree that have previously conceal they they rush madly over the plain mingle with the affrighted buffalo and american deer that have not hitherto perceive the stealthy approach of they foe at every point where they attempt to escape from the enclosure they be meet by a mount huntsman and be drive back with shout and cry towards the center all other game be now forget and each hunter single out for he own object of pursuit the steed that please he best and of which he think he could most easily gain possession but one there be -- the leader of the troop -- on which many eye be fix with eager desire he be a noble creature of perfect form and proportion and as he prance before he companion with neck erect and throw he head from side to side as if to reconnoiter he assailant -- while he mane and tail float in the breeze and he glossy coal-black skin give back the ray of the morning sun -- he look like the king of the prairie go forth in the pride of perfect freedom the ring grow smaller and smaller and every hand be steady and every eye be fix for the moment of trial : and soon the headlong pursuit commence at the first scattering of the wild troop several of the younger and more feeble horse be secure and some of the hunter who despair of nobler game contented themselves with capture or slaying either elk or buffalo but the finest horse escape the first assault and break through the circle ring into the boundless meadow where they be follow at mad speed by the hunter poise they spear and swing they noose round they head ready for a cast henrich and jyanough and several other of the best mount indian have join in the chase of the black leader and dash furiously after he over the plain the horse that the english boy ride be strong and fleet and the light weight of he rider enable he to keep with the foremost of the red hunter ' steed and at length to come almost alongside the noble courser the spear be poise in henrich 's hand and be just about to fly when suddenly he horse fall to the ground and roll over on the turf leave he rider prostrate but uninjured except be stunned for a moment by the shock when he open he eye and spring to he foot he see the king of the desert gallop up a rise ground over which he quickly disappear still hotly pursue by coubitant and several of the hunter jyanough and the rest of he companion have dismount to assist they fall friend and to form conjecture as to the probable cause of the unlucky accident for some time none could be perceive but on carefully examine he horse henrich at length discover a small wound in the hind leg and find that the creature be lame how or by whom the wound have be give he could not even surmise for in the eagerness of the chase he have not observe that coubitant ride close behind he : and that he have pass he at full speed the moment he horse stumble and fall but jyanough have remark it and from what he have already see of the wily indian he feel convinced that prompt by malicious jealousy he have thus seek to deprive he rival of he hoped-for success and perhaps even to inflict on he some grievous personal injury the young indian have however the good sense to conceal he suspicion from henrich at present and to allow he to regard the whole affair as accidental but he determine to keep a strict watch over the conduct of coubitant for the future and if possible to guard he friend from all he evil machination soon the nausett and the rest of the hunter return from they fruitless chase and report the escape of the noble wild courser and when jyanough hear the regret that coubitant express for the accident that have befall henrich and the condolence he offer on he have thus miss the object which otherwise he skill most surely have attain he could scarcely contain he indignation at such hypocrisy or refrain from open the eye of the unsuspicious young englishman they all return together at a slow pace to the main body of the hunter for henrich 's horse be too lame to be mount and as soon as the adventure be make known much sympathy and interest be show for the disappointment of the pale-face in which oriana 's countenance and manner show she partake so warmly that coubitant turn aside to conceal he anger and vexation and heartily wish that he well-aimed blow have not only deprive henrich of the glory of that day 's hunting but have also put a stop for ever to the success for which he both hate and envy he the sport continue after this interruption as actively as before but neither henrich nor he horse could take any further share in it and he remain with oriana and mailah enjoy the beauty of the scenery and gathering flower and fruit for he companion and for the little lincoya who free from the restraint of he moss-lined bed now roll on the turf with rodolph and play with the gentle and intelligent animal how happy be oriana that day she be proud of the gallant bearing of she ` white brother ' among the red warrior of she own wild race and she have exult at the praise which she have hear bestow on he address as a hunter and he shill in horsemanship by tisquantum and the elder indian and now though she regret he accident and the disappointment which it have cause he she do not suspect that it have be effect by the malice of a deadly enemy and she rejoice that it have give she the pleasure of he society for the rest of the day -- a pleasure which she have but seldom enjoy since they arrival in the prairie at the close of the day the game be collect and after due preparation be carry back to the camp where the squaw have already light the evening fire and make every necessary arrangement for cook the expect supper around these fire the hunter sit in group and discuss the event of the day among which the accident that have befall the pale-face excited much interest and conjecture jyanough listen to the probable and improbable cause that be assign by all the speaker especially by coubitant to account for so strange a circumstance but he hold he peace for in he inmost soul he be only more and more convinced that the subtle and dark - brew savage be the perpetrator of the malicious deed in this suspicion he be the more strongly confirm by a event that occur a few day afterwards it have be discover that the stream that run so gently by the side of the encampment fall at some distance to the west into a river of considerable size and depth which then run on over a descend and rocky bed form alternately smooth broad sheet of water and noisy broken fall until it precipitate itself over a sudden precipice of great depth and fall dashing and foam into the basin which its continual fall have worn in the rock below the distant roar of this cataract have frequently be hear in the camp when the wind come from that direction and when the stillness of the night -- break only by the occasional howl of wild beast seek they prey or the melancholy cry of the goat-sucker -lrb- \* -rrb- -- succeed to the sound of labor or idleness that generally keep the temporary village alive by day but hitherto no one have have leisure or inclination to leave the excitement and novelty of hunting to explore the river or ascertain its capability for fishing -lrb- footnote : this mournful sound be believe by the indian to be the moaning of the depart spirit of woman who have commit infanticide and who be consequently exclude by mahneto from the happy mountain which be the abode of the bless -rrb- now however coubitant bring in a report one evening that the great stream abound in fish and propose in to henrich that as he be for the present unable to join in the more active business of the chase he should assist he in form a light canoe in which they could go out and spear the game that lay beneath the clear blue water in the smooth reach of the river to this proposal henrich readily assent for the sport be one of which he have beard he indian friend speak with great pleasure and he greatly wish to enjoy it the canoe be immediately commence and as it merely consist of the trunk of a straight tulip-tree hollow out by means of fire and shape with a hatchet it be complete in a couple of day the light spear that be to pierce the fish be prepared and long slender line of twisted grass be fasten to they shaft for the purpose of draw in they prey and the follow morning when the hunter be ready to set out on they usual expedition coubitant desire henrich to accompany he to the river side where they little bark lay ready to receive they why on hear this proposal do jyanough still linger when all the rest of the hunter be mount and he own steed be paw the ground impatient of he master 's delay and why after gaze a few moment at coubitant 's dark countenance do he declare he wish to join the fishing party and request the nausett to allow he to take a place in the canoe do he see treachery in that eye of fire jyanough could lend he horse to the pale-face if he should happen to wish to hunt he request be however negatived decidedly by coubitant who assure he with assume courtesy that he regret the size of the boat be too small to admit of its carry a third sportsman with safety but invite he to join he in the same sport the follow day when he add -- with that smile that oriana hate -- jyanough could lend he horse to the pale-face if he should happen to wish to hunt the young cree be baffle he would gladly have pre vent he friend from accompany coubitant on the expedition but be have no means of do so or even of put he on he guard against any possible evil design on the part of he companion so he spring upon he eager horse and gallop after the hunter hope that he fear and suspicion be unfounded oriana and mailah attend by they faithful companion rodolph walk down to the edge of the river to see the fisherman embark in they frail vessel and for some time they watch the sport with considerable interest and admire the skill with which coubitant pierced and bring up several large fish these he attract towards the canoe by means of some preparation that he scatter on the surface of the water and when the fish appear within reach of he spear he dart it with unerr aim and draw in he struggle victim with the line that be attach to it henrich be also provide with weapon but as the sport be entirely new to he he find it difficult to take a steady aim and he success be slight coubitant however have soon secure a considerable stock of fish and he row to the shore and request oriana and she companion to convey they to the sachem 's lodge add in a careless tone that it would not be worth they while to return to the river as he be go to a reach at some distance down the stream towards the head of the cataract where he expect to show henrich excellent sport the two young woman return to the camp and have commit the fine fish to the care of the inferior squaw they agree to go again towards the river and take this opportunity of visit the fall which they much desire to see and near which they should probably again meet the fisherman they ramble through the wood take a direct course towards the cataract the sound of whose water soon become sufficiently audible to guide they in they unknown way sometimes they come in sight of the river and again they see the little canoe either standing motionless on the smooth surface of the water where the stream be wide and unbroken or else pass under the skilful guidance of coubitant between the rock that occasionally disturb its course and form foam rapid down which the little bark dart with fearful velocity the last reach of the broad river be as calm and smooth as a lake it seem as if the collect mass of water which have gather there from many a broken and troubled stream and have struggle through many winding and many difficulty be repose there and gain strength for its last great leap over the dark precipice as oriana and mailah approach the verge of the scattered forest and stand to gaze on the magnificent scene before they they perceive the canoe descend a narrow rapid and then take up a position below a elevated mass of rock where the water be perfectly still and where the fisherman could quietly pursue they occupation they evidently do not perceive they female friend and the roar of the cataract be now so loud as to prevent all possibility of they hear they voice for a short time oriana and she friend watch they movement and see several fish capture and then proceed along the steep and rocky bank in order to obtain a still better view of the waterfall it be a beautiful scene on which those two young indian look and they feel its power and grandeur and stand silent and motionless the cataract be beneath they and its roar come up like thunder from the dark deep basin into which its weight of water fall and throw up a cloud of foam and spray and then it rush away again as if in gladness at its safe descent and free course until the shine stream be hide by the rock and overhang tree that mark its wind course the natural platform on which oriana and mailah stand command a view not only of the wild cataract and the lower stretch of the river but also of the bold steep rock on the opposite side and the dark forest that stretch away to the distant mountain that bound the horizon it likewise enable they to perceive the small canoe lie motionless on the water in the shadow of the project rock by and by the boat be row into the center of the river and coubitant appear to be seek for a good fishing spot as he point in different direction and once or twice dart he spear into the water and draw it out again without any success meanwhile the canoe float slowly down the stream but its motion gradually increase as it approach the fall and oriana gaze at it expect every moment that coubitant who have now take the oar in he powerful grasp would turn its course and either draw towards the shore or else row back again up the river and land below the first rapid to she surprise and somewhat to she anxiety he still continue however to allow the canoe to proceed and she see henrich take a dart in he hand and stand erect as if to strike at something beneath the surface to which coubitant pointed with the paddle another instant and she white brother be in the water and struggle to catch the side of the canoe breathlessly she gaze and she distinctly see the paddle which coubitant hold extend towards the uplifted hand of henrich still he do not grasp it o why be this and then the boat which bad already float perilously near to the fall be suddenly turn and she behold coubitant make violent effort to overcome the force of the current and row to the opposite and nearest shore he be alone and where be henrich where be the brave young stranger battle desperately with the rapid stream which be carry he onward to destruction he rise and sink rise again and the current bear he on with resistless force for a moment oriana clasp she hand over she eye to shut out the dreadful sight and then as if inspire by a gleam of supernatural hope she dart forward call rodolph and point to the stream the intelligent creature have see the form of henrich in the water and only wait he mistress 's command to risk he life in the attempt to save he but he sagacity teach he that it be useless to enter the river above the fall and he bound down the steep bank that lead to its foot and stand eager and panting on a point of rock that overhang the basin oriana be quickly on the same spot follow by mailah but ere they reach it the dog have plunge into the foam water and now appear uphold the inanimate form of henrich and struggle fearfully to drag he from the whirlpool o it be a sickening sight and oriana 's heart stand still in the agony of suspense she could not aid she brother she could not cope with that mad whirl of water but she leap down the steep rock and stand on the narrow ledge of shore below to wait the moment for action at length -- after what appear almost a hopeless conflict with the dash water -- rodolph appear through the cloud of foam and slowly and feebly swim towards the shore still support the lifeless burden that seem almost to drag he beneath the surface now be the time for the indian girl to prove she skill and courage lightly she spring into the water and in a moment she be at rodolph 's side and with one arm sustain the drooping head of henrich while with the other she dexterously swim back to the spot where mailah stand ready to assist she with much difficulty they lift the senseless form of henrich on the shore and proceed to adopt every means in they power to restore suspend animation while rodolph -- the faithful devoted rodolph -- lay down panting and exhaust but still keep a watchful eye on he whom he have so daringly rescue long the two young indian labor in silence and almost in despair for no color return to those pallid lip and no warmth be perceptible in the chill and stiffen hand that fall powerless by he side still they persevere : and no tear no lamentation betray the anguish that wring the heart of oriana while she believe that all be in vain but she soul be lift up in prayer to the one true god in whom she have be teach to put she trust by she beloved ` white brother ' : and in he mercy be she only hope nor be that hope in vain the warm beam of the mid-day sun fall powerfully on that sheltered spot where the little group be gather and combine with the continue friction that oriana and mailah employ at length bring back the life-blood to henrich 's cheek and lip and he anxious nurse have the joy of perceive that he breathe a few minute more and he open he deep blue eye and look wildly around he and speak some english word that oriana hear amid the din of the fall water and know be of he home and he kindred and then he utter she own name and attempt to rise but fall back again into she arm and smile sweetly and gratefully when she eye meet he and he see that she be watch over he there be joy -- deep joy and gratitude -- in those young heart at that moment but henrich 's weakness and the noise of the roar cataract prevent they from communicate they feeling in word and oriana forbore to ask any question of henrich relative to the cause of he perilous adventure after some time he seem greatly to recover and rise from the ground he slowly mount the bank support by oriana and she friend but it be evident that he be quite unable to proceed on foot to the camp and it be agree that mailah should return as quickly as possible and bring such assistance as she could procure from thence while henrich and oriana should advance as far as he enfeebled state would admit of mailah 's light form soon disappear in the wood and it be not long ere she reach the camp and hasten to the tent of tisquantum who on that day have not join the hunting party she tell she story in which the old chief show the deepest interest and she observe a dark frown on he brow while she relate the unsuccessful attempt of coubitant to draw henrich from the water with he paddle but he make no remark the hunter be still absent and few man remain in the camp these be all engage in felling wood and other laborious employment and tisquantum prepare to lead he own horse out to meet he adopted son but just as he and mailah be leave the camp for this purpose coubitant come rapidly up from the river 's brink and hurry towards they begin to relate with expression of grief and consternation the sad fate which he believe to have befall the young stranger and the exertion that he have make to save he life but which have unhappily prove unavailing to avert the calamity the sorrow of the nausett indian seem excessive and tisquantum probably consider it so for he listen with perfect calmness to he recital and then merely reply ` happily the youth be safe mahneto have succore he and i go to bring he back to the camp ' coubitant start : and he look embarrassed for a moment when he catch the penetrate eye of mailah fix on he countenance but he quickly recover he self-possession and manifest such joy at the escape of the white stranger from a watery grave that mailah almost chid herself for she dreadful suspicion coubitant accompany she and the sachem on they way through the forest and when they meet henrich and oriana he again assume such a appearance of pleasure and so warmly congratulate the former on he miraculous deliverance that the generous english youth strive to banish from he mind the fearful thought that have arise there while he struggle for life close to the canoe and wonder at the want of skill and strength display by he companion in he abortive attempt to save he oriana coldly receive he greet she have long suspect that he regard henrich with hatred and jealousy and she worst suspicion have that day receive a strong confirmation still she resolve to conceal they -- at least at present -- from all but jyanough whose friendship for henrich would she know render he peculiarly alive to all that concerned he safety she have not long to wait for the hunter soon return and she observe that when jyanough hear the story of the day 's adventure he cast a glance on coubitant that make the conscious savage quail but when she relate to the young cree all that she and mailah have observe he could restrain he feeling no longer and plainly tell she that he be convince that coubitant be the author of the calamity and that it be not the first attempt he have make at henrich 's life they resolve that he should communicate all he suspicion to the sachem the follow morning and urge he to take measure for the safety of he adopted son : but what be jyanough 's surprise when he open the subject to tisquantum at be inform that coubitant have already leave the camp with the pequodee jyanough know that it be they intention that morning at day-break to set off on they return to they own wood and plain and he find that the wily nausett have express a desire to accompany they and join in the war that be go on between they tribe and some of they neighbor in order to distinguish himself as a warrior it be not the sachem 's intention to rejoin he tribe for a considerable time he be fond of wander and propose to travel towards the north when the hunting season should be over and he also feel a reluctance to take he now greatly beloved captive back to that part of the country where it be possible he might gain intelligence of he friend or perhaps even make he escape to they he have therefore consent to coubitant 's request and evidently feel a undefined satisfaction in he absence this be the case and the departure of coubitant have remove all present danger to henrich from he malicious scheme jyanough forbore to express all he feel to the old sachem and he return to oriana with the pleasant intelligence that the enemy of she white brother have depart to the young squaw-sachem this news impart infinite relief and even henrich could not regret it although he find it difficult to believe that all the suspicion of he friend be well-founded still the event of the precede day be quite sufficient to make he doubt more than ever the sincerity of coubitant 's profess regard and he feel that he should be happier now that the dark-browed savage be go to he pleasant life of freedom we will now leave he and return to new plymouth where many event -- deeply interesting to the settler -- have occur since he involuntary departure and suppose death chapter xi ` there go a dirge through the forest 's gloom ... a exile be bear to a lonely tomb `` brother '' -- so the chant be sing in the slumberer 's native tongue -- `` friend and brother not for thee shall the sound of weep be ''' heman sadly and slowly the pilgrim father pass along the scatter village of log hut which be they home in they voluntary

earthly home the chief and the most respect of they community the governor carver -- he who have preside over they council and direct all they movement since the memorable day of they landing and have

for the future have set in it be but a few day after henrich 's capture that this heavy affliction befall the colony and add greatly to the gloom which the loss of young maitland have already cast over the whole village the departure also of the vessel in which the pilgrim have come out to america occur at the same time and although not one of the exile desire to return to the land of they birth and to abandon the enterprise on which they have enter so devotedly yet it be a melancholy hour when they bid adieu to the captain and he crew and see the mayflower sail away towards they still much-loved country the scurvy and other disease -- combine with the hardship and privation to which they have be expose during the winter and early spring -- have fearfully reduce the number of the ship 's company and of those who remain the greater part be weaken by illness and dispirit by the loss of so many of they brave comrade whose grave they have dig on the bleak shore of new england the return of spring and the supply of provision that the settler be able to obtain from the friendly indian have check the progress of the fatal complaint that have so fearfully ravage the colony during the severity of winter and have restore the survivor of the ship 's crew to comparative health and strength the captain be therefore glad to seize the first opportunity of abandon a shore which have present to he so cheerless and melancholy a aspect and of leave the steadfast and devoted exile to the fate which they have choose and which they be resolve to abide in faith and hope on the very day that the mayflower set sail and while its white sail could still be distinguish in the eastern horizon the governor -- who take a active part in every occupation and even every labor that engage the settler -- be busily employ in sowing corn in the field that be consider as the common property of the colony in direct and superintend this work he be greatly assist by the skill and experience of

pilgrim and sob and lamentation break forth from the woman and child after he remains be lay in they resting-place a fervent prayer be offer up by brewster -lrb- whose age and character cause he to be regard as the pastor of the colony although he have never be call to the ministry after the custom of the puritan -rrb- and then a hymn be sing by the unite voice of the whole congregation when this simple ceremony be over and the grave of the depart president be close and lay level with the surround ground -- in order to conceal it from the prowl indian -- the assembly repair to the fort or store-house that stand on the summit of the hill and which also serve the purpose of a meeting-house or chapel its rude end unadorned simplicity suit the peculiar idea of the puritan who in they zeal to escape from the elaborate ornament and pompous ceremonial employ by the papist have rush into the opposite extreme and desire that both they place of worship and they mode of perform it should be divest of every external decoration and every prescribed form the more they place of meeting for prayer resemble a ordinary habitation the better they consider it suit to the sacred purpose and they be therefore perfectly satisfy to possess no other church than the rude fort build of log and post and use indifferently as a granary for the public store and as a fortress for the defense of the colony from any incursion of the hostile tribe in this primitive chapel brewster be accustom to lead the devotions of the pilgrim and they family every ` lord 's day ' morning and afternoon -lrb- \* -rrb- and also on any other occasion of they assemble together but as they be in continual expectation of the arrival of the venerated john robinson to resume he office of regular pastor of the flock

of scripture which be sometimes undertake by any member of the congregation who feel equal to it be call _ ` prophesy ' _ these be the only mode of spiritual instruction employ by the first settler until they procure clergyman from england or appoint minister from among they own elder and these means be highly value by the settler who have abandon home and kindred and the comfort of civilized life for no other motive than to secure to themselves the privilege of worship god accord to they own idea of what be good and profitable to they soul the talent and the elevated piety of william brewster render he both a very valuable teacher and also in the eye of the puritan a efficient substitute for they expect pastor -lrb- footnote : the puritan never use the name _ Sunday _ or _ sabbath _ they object be the first as savor of paganism and to the second as pertain to judaism and yet they enforce the observance of the christian 's day of rest with almost mosaic strictness -rrb- on the present mournful occasion he address the congregation in a very impressive manner on the heavy loss they have sustain in the death of they value president and exhort they to remember and to imitate he piety he charity and he exemplary patience and self - denial under the try circumstance that have mark the period of he brief government these circumstance have become less painful it be true since they friendly intercourse with the wampanoge and the genial change in the weather but still the trial of the pilgrim be by no means over and they need of faith in the good providence of god and of persevere resolution in the path which they have choose for themselves remain as great as ever deeply be the less of they first president feel by the colony for every individual mourn he as a private friend as well as a wise end benevolent ruler but the blow fall with more crush power on she who have share he checkered life of joy and sorrow for many year in europe and have accompany he into exile with the devoted feeling that he presence would make the wilderness a home he sudden removal and the cheerless blank that succeed be more than the strength of he afflict widow could endure and in six week she follow he the grave from that time it appear as if the severity of the scourge that have ravage the infant settlement be exhaust for scarcely any more death occur during that year and many who have hitherto suffer from the effect of disease regain they usual strength and live to a remarkably advanced age william bradford be the individual select by the community to fill the arduous and responsible office that have be hold so few month by carver and the choice be a most judicious one for he be a man well suit to be the leader of a colony expose to the peculiar difficulty that surround the puritan exile he uncommon sagacity and penetration of character and he undaunted resolution in time of danger cause he to be regard as the very prop and support of the settlement and he worth be so generally acknowledge and so highly appreciate that he continue to be annually elect governor for twelve succeed year : and never do he disappoint the confidence thus repose in he he treatment of the indian be one point on which he show both the correctness of he judgement and the right feeling of he heart he ever act towards they with true christian benevolence and equity and at the same he preserve that authority and superiority over they which be necessary to the safety and well - be of the colony and he also carefully keep from they those european weapon the possession of which might render they dangerous to the settler and aggravate the frequent hostility among they own rival tribe unhappily a different course be afterwards pursue by the leader of the colony of massachusett and the evil con sequence of such short-sighted policy be soon but too apparent and tend to involve not only the new settler but also the original colony of new plymouth in quarrel and disturbance with the native this however do not occur for some time after the period of which we be now speak and for the present bradford succeed in maintain the best possible relation with the already friendly wampanoge william bradford have be originally bring up as a husbandman and although he have abandon this call to devote himself to the study of the scripture and the writings of the father -- for which purpose he have acquire the latin greek and hebrew language -- he still retain such a know ledge of agriculture as proved extremely useful to he as the leader of a young colony whose support be to be mainly derive from the land of which they have take possession he also speak french and dutch fluently and the diary and letter that he have leave to posterity show he to have be both a well inform and a truly pious man when the puritan leave amsterdam under they pastor john robinson and settle at leyden bradford be scarcely twenty year of age he there learn the art of dye silk in order to support himself while he pursue he theological study and also perform the part of historian to the community of which he have become a member and he remain with the congregation during all the year of they residence in holland and attach himself with the most affectionate reverence to they generally beloved and respected minister one of the first act of he administration as governor of new plymouth be to send another embassy to masasoyt the great sagamore of the whole wampanoge tribe in order to strengthen and confirm he present amicable feeling towards the white man by means of present and other mark of friendship squanto as usual accompany the party as interpreter and nothing could be more satisfactory than the interview prove to all party especially to the indian chief who be make both proud and happy by the gift of a red military coat adorn with silver lace this he immediately put on over the paint and other savage ornament in which he be decorate for the state occasion and he greatly divert the member of the embassy by the increase air of dignity that he assume and the grandiloquous manner in which he begin to extol he own power and glory ` be i not ' he exclaim in a loud voice ` masasoyt the great king be i not lord of all the people of the lowson and of such and such place and he enumerate nearly thirty uncouth indian name of place over which he claim sovereignty he wild subject utter a yell of joy and exultation in answer to each word he utter the savage monarch then proceed to ratify and augment the agreement into which he have already cater with edward winslow and promise to guarantee to the english settler a exclusive trade with he tribe at the same time entreat they to prevent he powerful enemy the narragansett from carry on a commercial intercourse with the french colonist notwithstanding the boast power of this ` chief of chief ' the scarcity of provision be so great in he village of packanokick at the time of this embassy that he be only able to offer he white friend one meal during they visit to he which last a day and two night and this solitary display of regal hospitality consist of two large fish just catch in a neighbor lake and which be divide amongst forty hungry person in spite of this temporary distress he press the deputation to remain longer with he but the object of they mission have be attain they be glad to leave the residence of the sagamore which possess far less of comfort and civilization than be to be find in the picturesque summer camp of he son and inferior sachem mooanam this lovely spot continue to be much frequent by the settler between whom and they copper-colored neighbor a strong feeling of mutual regard become established and this friendship prove a great advantage to both party in a social as well as a political point of view the wampanoge find the benefit of they alliance with the mighty english during the autumn of that year when the dread which they name and power have inspire prove a safeguard to the friendly indian tribe and preserve they from a combined attack of several other tribe who have by some mysterious means be instigate to unite for they destruction the intelligence of this conspiracy reach the settler when a party of they be on the peninsula of cape cod whither they have go to bring back a young english boy name franci billington who have lose himself in the forest some time previously and after have subsist for several day on wild fruit and berry have reach a camp of the nausett indian hitherto so adverse to the pilgrim this seem a good opportunity for endeavor to establish more friendly relation with the tribe and bradford send off ten man in the shallop to negotiate for the boy 's restoration and to offer gift to the nausett who happily be not so cruel and blood-thirsty a party as those who have kidnap henrich maitland the overture of the settler be well receive and they present the chief of the village with a pair of knife and also return to the native a quantity of corn more than equal to that which they have take from the grave and hut that they have discover on they first landing and which belong to the nausett this act of justice gain for the settler the esteem and confidence of the indian and as these original possessor of the soil do not dispute the title of the newcomer to the portion of the american soil on which they have establish themselves they consider henceforth that they claim be valid and that they could stand before the native on term of equality the lose child be safely restore to rodolph who as usual share the conduct of the expedition with edward winslow the joy and gratitude of the boy 's father at be permit to convey he home uninjured may be better imagine than describe and while maitland sympathize in he feeling he could not help sadly contrast the fate of he own lose henrich with that of the more fortunate franci billington but he believe that he son 's earthly career have close for ever and both he and helen have submit to the bereavement with christian piety and resignation and have teach they wounded heart to restrain every impulse to repine and even to feel thankful that they beloved boy have be spare any protracted suffering and trial and have be permit so speedily to enter into he rest have they know he actual late and condition how much of painful anxiety would have mingle with the sorrow of separation from which they be now exempt the restoration of the little wanderer have be effect and a good understanding have be establish with the nausett of cape cod the negotiate party lose no time in return to new plymouth and communicate to governor bradford the intelligence of the conspiracy against masasoyt to which allusion have already be make and of which they have be inform by the nausett sachem the news be startling to bradford and to he council who all feel the imperative necessity of use immediate effort for the assistance of the friendly wampanoge they be impel to this resolution not only in consideration of the alliance that have be form between themselves and the sagamore masasoyt but also from a conviction that the safety and welfare of the infant colony depend essentially upon they possess the friendship and the protection of some powerful tribe like the wampanoge whose number and warlike character cause they to be both fear and respect by they weaker neighbor it could only be by a combination of several tribe that any important defeat of the wampanoge could possibly be effect : and such a combination the nausett declare they know to have be already form though by what means and with what motive remain at present a mystery the indian interpreter squanto be therefore send off to masasoyt 's residence at lowam in order to ascertain the grounds of the quarrel and to effect if possible a reconciliation without the necessity of the pilgrim have recourse to arm in defense of they ally the interpreter be also accompany by hobomak a subject of the wampanoge chieftain 's who have lately leave he own wigwam and settle among the english and who have already attach himself to the white man with a uncommon degree of devotion but ere the swarthy ambassador reach the village of packanokick they be suddenly attack by a small party of narragansett warrior who lay in ambush near they path through the forest and be convey away captive to the presence of a fierce look indian who appear to be a man of power and authority and who be evidently await they arrival in a small temporary encampment at a little distance no sooner have hobomak glance at this dark chieftain than he recognize coubitant the bitter foe of the settler and the captor of henrich maitland coubitant have originally be a subject of the sachem masasoyt but some offence either real or imaginary have convert he from a friend into a bitter foe and then it be that he have wander towards the spanish settlement and obtain that prejudiced notion of christianity to which we have formerly allude when tire of he wild roam life he have unite himself to that portion of the nausett tribe which be under the guidance of tisquantum and he attachment to the sachem 's son tekoa have induce he to remain a member of the tribe during he life and to devote himself to the object of reveng he death after that event have occur at the first encounter with the white settlers hitherto that object have be frustrate by what appear to he tisquantum 's incomprehensible partiality fur henrich which have so entirely prevent he wreak he vengeance on the innocent son of the slayer but he be not a revenge that could expire unsatiated or change to friendship and expend itself in act of kindness as that of tisquantum have do no : the thirst for blood remain as strong in the breast of coubitant as it be on that very hour when he behold he brother-in-arm fall bleeding and die beneath the mysterious firearm of the white man and he hope still to pour forth the white man 's blood as a oblation to the spirit of he friend therefore it be that when he find himself foiled in all he malicious scheme for henrich 's destruction and also perceive that he be himself become a object of suspicion to jyanough and to the sachem he have resolve on quit the nausett and return with the pequodee into the neighborhood of the english settlement he hope to stir up several smaller tribe to join with the narragansett and to make war against the wampanoge -- the ally of the pilgrim -- and thus to deprive the hate whites of they aid and protection and possibly also to engage the settler in the quarrel and then to find a opportunity of take one or more of they captive and slake the desire of he vindictive spirit in the agony that he would inflict on he victim truly ` the dark place ' of he heart be ` full of the habitation of cruelty ' these deep-laid scheme of the wily savage have hitherto meet with full success and by means of deceit and misrepresentation he have rouse up and irritated the feeling of several sachem and they dependant and induce they to agree to coalesce for the destruction of the wampanoge and then to turn they arm against the settler with the view of expel they altogether from the country he spy have discover the intended embassy of squanto and hobomak to the village of the great sagamore of lowam and he have consequently take effectual means to intercept it as he fear its have a favorable aspect on the captive be bring before he he scornfully reproach they as the dastardly tool of the white man and as traitor to they own nation and he declare he intention of detain squanto as a prisoner and as a hostage also in order to ensure the return of hobomak to new plymouth with the message that be design for the governor this message consist of a threat -- which hobomak well know he would execute -- that if on be liberate he proceed to packanokick instead of return to the settlement he would flay the unhappy squanto alive and send he skin and scalp to the white-hearted english to show they that the red man scorn they interference and know how to punish it hobomak depart and reluctantly leave he companion in the hand of the cruel coubitant but he have no power to liberate he and he only hope of obtain any effectual succor for he be in hasten to new plymouth and persuade the governor to send a well-armed force to cut off the retreat of the narragansett and they leader and attempt the rescue of they cake interpreter hobomak be fleet of foot and he rest not until he have arrive in bradford 's presence and tell he of the fate that have befall squanto weak as the colonist be and sincerely desirous as they also feel to preserve peace with the native they yet deem it incumbent on they to show the indian that they would not tamely submit to any insult or injury captain standish be therefore immediately dispatch with a body of fourteen man well arm and discipline who be at that time nearly all the man capable of bear arm of whom the colony could boast lead by hobomak they rapidly traverse the forest and come upon coubitant 's party soon after they have leave they encampment the indian leader have anticipate and desire this result of he conduct and he heart swell with malignant joy when he behold the hate rodolph among the foremost of the assailant now he deem the evil spirit whom he worship be about to repay he for all he abortive scheme and disappointed effort by throw the very object of he vengeful hatred into he power forward he spring whirling he heavy tomahawk round he head as if it have be a child 's toy and prepare to bring it down on the white man 's skull with a force that must have cleave it in two but standish see the impending blow and quick as think he draw a pistol from he belt and fire it at the savage the ball pass through he arm and the tomahawk fall bloodless to the ground have it but drunk the life-blood of rodolph coubitant would have be content to die but he foe still live unharmed and quickly he see that three of he own follower be also severely wound and that he party of naked warrior be altogether incapable of resist the fierce and well - sustained attack of they civilized assailant he only chance of safety and of future vengeance lay in flight and to that last resource of a brave spirit he betake himself he be quickly follow by all he band who be dismay at the sound and the fatal effect of the british fire-arm and leave squanto behind they they be soon conceal from view by the thick underwood of the forest the object of the expedition have be attain standish do not pursue the fugitive but return in triumph to the settlement well satisfy that he have give the indian a salutary impression of the decisive conduct and the powerful measure that would ever be adopt by the white man when they honor be insult in the slightest degree that such a impression have be make on the red man be soon evident from the anxiety which be manifest by several of the neighbor tribe to be admit into the semblance at least of a alliance with the mighty stranger nine sachem intimate they desire to acknowledge themselves the subject of the white man 's king who dwell on the other side of ` the great water ' and a paper be accordingly draw up by captain standish to that effect and subscribe with the uncouth autograph of the copper-colored chieftain among these -- strange to say -- the mark of coubitant who have be raise to the rank of sachem by the narragansett be to be see but the sincerity of he friendly profession will be show hereafter at present it suit he to unite with the other chief in they pledge of allegiance to king jame and of amity towards he british subject but he never openly approach they settlement or make the slightest advance towards become better acquaint with they he evil design sleep indeed but they have not expire they only wait the fitting opportunity to be as actively pursue as ever chapter xii ` calm on the bosom of thy god young spirit rest thee now e ` en while with we thy footstep tread he seat be on thy brow dust to its narrow house beneath soul to its place on high they that have see thy look in death no more may fear to die lone be the path and sad the bower whence thy meek smile be go but oh a brighter bear than ours in heaven be now thine own ' heman we have observe that very few death take place in the colony of new plymouth during the second year of they exile and after the fatal stroke that deprive they of they president but among those few there be one that carry grief and desolation into the heart of the family with whom we story be chiefly connect and who be already deeply afflict by the loss of the first-born ludovico maitland have always be a delicate child and on he consequently the care and attention of he mother have be principally bestow helen have watch and tend he through all the severity of the first winter in the new world and many have be the privation that she have voluntarily endure unknown even to rodolph who would not have suffer she thus to risk she own health in order to add to the comfort of she youngest and most helpless child when the bless springtime come and all nature begin again to smile she hope that ludovico would also be renovate and bloom again like the flower he love so well and she hope appear to be realize : for the sweet playful child resume he sport and the bright color again glow on he soft cheek and he parent deem it the hue of health at the time when henrich be steal away the little fellow have be remarkably well and even helen 's fear for he have almost subside but whether it be the effect of the shock that he sustain when he see he brother seize by the fierce savage and tear away from he and when he flee so breathlessly to tell the fearful tiding or whether it be merely the result of he own delicate constitution which could no longer bear up against the change of climate and food -- from that time he visibly decline it be true he never complain and he cheerful spirit be unaltered but the watchful eye of affection could trace the insidious step of disease in the change color and the too frequently brilliant eye since edith have lose she constant friend and companion henrich she naturally devoted herself more to she younger brother and little ludovico become not only she lively play-fellow but also she intelligent pupil and the occupation which she find in the care of the engaging child serve to divert she mind from the first real grief she have ever know she mother 's sorrow though bear with the most perfect resignation have greatly affect she health and as she have entire confidence in edith 's steadiness she be glad to leave the care of ludovico principally to she especially when she observe the good effect which the new responsibility have on she spirit the two child be therefore leave much to themselves and with they mother 's sanction they pass a great portion of they time at the camp of mooanam where they be always most kindly receive and where they make rapid progress in acquire the language and also many of the useful and ingenious art of they swarthy friend the departure of coubitant and he savage band after they cruel design against the peace of rodolph 's family have be accomplish remove all fear of injury or molestation from the mind of the settler for no hostile indian now remain in they immediate neighborhood and the path from new plymouth to the village of the friendly wampanoge become a beaten and frequented track so that edith and she little charge could go to and fro in safety under the protection of fingal a magnificent dog belong to they father and they constant companion and playfellow and frequently they be accompany on they return to the british village by the chieftain 's wife apannow and she little boy nepea who be the darling of both edith and ludovico a strong attachment also spring up between apannow and helen for the squaw-sachem be possess of much natural gentleness of disposition and be most ready to adopt all those habit of civilized life that she see practice among she english friend and that it be possible for she to transplant to she indian home she be likewise willing to listen to the doctrine and precept of the gospel and to admit they beauty and they holiness although it be long -- very long -- ere she or any of the adult of she tribe be so far convert to the christian truth as to be either desirous or fit to be baptize but there be no bigotry or opposition in the mind of apannow and she become a kind and sympathize friend to helen and to she child rodolph be necessarily much engage in agricultural occupation and also in the business of the government as he be one of the council who be appoint to assist the president and to share the labor and responsibility of he frequently very difficult office the gradual change in little ludovico 's health be therefore not so soon observe by he father as by helen and edith and when he return to he much - love home after the toil and care of the day he wife forbore to arouse fresh anxiety in he breast by tell he of she own fear on the contrary she rejoice to see the pleasure and animation that light up the sweet child 's expressive countenance as he run to meet he father and the happiness of both as they play under the wide - spread tree that shaded they now luxuriant garden at such time while listen to ludovico 's ringing laugh and watch he light footstep as he chase he father and edith from tree to tree she flatter herself that all must be well with the joyous child and that she apprehension be unfounded but again when the follow day find he pale and exhaust and all the more so for the excitement and exercise of the previous evening these foreboding fear would return and she heart would sink heavily at the prospect of the come woe the short summer of north america attain its height and as the heat increase so do ludovico 's young life wane away and he strength become daily less rudolph now see as plainly as he afflict wife that they only remain son be soon to be take from they and he strive to arm both himself and she with the only power that could support they under such a aggravate calamity he constantly lead she to look only to he who ` give ' and who also ` take away ' and without whom ` not a sparrow falleth to the ground ' and to trust he even in the depth of sorrow : and he have the satisfaction of see she become more and more resigned and more and more strong in faith to meet the come trial slowly and gently it come but it come at last : and though he parent and he sister have long give up all hope of retain they loved ludovico on earth and have endeavor to resign he into the hand of he heavenly father yet when the blow come they feel it sudden and find how little they be prepare for it one warm summer evening the sweet child be carry by rodolph to edith 's bower that he might look once more at the flower he have help to plant and to tend and he soft eye seem to take a last farewell of every cherish object and to follow the setting sun with a fix gaze that say those eye would never see it set again but there be no sadness -- no regret -- in the gentle countenance and the infantine lip still smile as they whisper the evening prayer that he have so often repeat with edith young as he be ludovico have learn to love he redeemer and to feel that to ` depart and be with christ be far better than to abide on earth and the ` valley of the shadow or death ' which the lord so mercifully make easy to he flesh have no terror for he young spirit could he parent then -- could even he broken-hearted sister -- bear to disturb he angelic calmness by any display of they own grief no : they restrain it and even try to smile again as they reply to he touching remark and speak of the happy day when they should all meet again in heaven and dwell for ever in the presence of that gracious savior who be new take he as they believe to join he dear brother henrich as twilight come on he father bear he back to the house and lay he again on he little couch and ere the glorious sun arise to lighten the earth once more he spirit have pass away into that realm of perfect light where they ` have no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god do lighten it and the lamb be the light thereof ' and many tear be shed for he when the sight of the grief of those he love so dearly could no longer disturb he peace or check the willing spirit in its heavenward flight the sorrow of the maitland -- thus renew and aggravate -- excite the warmest sympathy throughout the colony for they be universally respect and beloved and they calm and pious resignation draw forth the admiration of the whole community of puritan who deem any strong expression of grief to be altogether unsuitable to christian but rodolph and helen do not the less feel they chastisement because they forbear to express they feeling to any other than to god and to they revered friend and minister brewster on edith this second blow fall even more heavily than the first for since henrich 's loss she have devote herself to she younger brother and feel for he almost a mother 's love : and now she pupil she playfellow -- the sunshine of she life -- be take away from she truly the lord be prepare she in the furnace of affliction for the future lot to which he have appoint she and sorrow do net visit she in vain she character be strengthen and mature and she mind be teach to find resource in itself that prove hereafter of inestimable value to she and to those most nearly connect with she the thought and attention of she parent -- and indeed of the whole colony -- be at this time divert greatly from they own private care and interest by a event of much importance to the settlement this be the arrival of a vessel call the fortune from the mother - country bring out to the colony a new and more comprehensive charter obtain for they by the society of plymouth and also twenty - five fresh settler who be chiefly friend and relative of those already establish in new england how welcome these familiar countenance that recall day of happiness long pass but not forget be to the heart and memory of they brethren none but exile can tell the new comer be indeed joyfully receive and hospitably entertain by the pilgrim father who invite they to take up they quarter in they rude but comfortable dwelling and to share they scanty store unfortunately the new settler be unable to contribute any thing to these store for all they own provision be already consume on the voyage this accession to they number therefore add greatly to the inconvenience of the colony and occasion such a scarcity of food that the governor be oblige to put the whole community upon a daily allowance a arrangement to which they all submit without a murmur and not only do the original settler thus consent to endure privation for the sake of they newly - arrive friend and relative but they also contribute more liberally than they narrow means could well afford to provision the fortune for she voyage home this be the occasion of the first mercantile adventure of the pilgrim who take the opportunity of the return of the ship to england to send to the society with which they be connect a quantity of fur and timber to the value of five hundred pound but success do not attend they speculation for the vessel fall into the hand of the french and all they hope of profit be for the present blast it be needless to dwell on all the continue and various hardship that these brave man and they family have to endure for several ensue winter a few circumstance that more especially exemplify they manners and mode of life will be sufficient for the purpose of we narrative the course of which must necessarily be somewhat interrupt by these detail some knowledge of the habit of the adventurer and of the event that befall they at this early period of they history be however needful for the illustration of the story and they shall be briefly give before we take up the thread of the narrative a few year subsequent to the period of which we be now speak for some time the friendly relation with the wampanoge which have be establish by carver and further cement by bradford remain undisturbed and no sign of hostility be show by any other of the neighbor indian tribe this be probably owe in a great degree to the wholesome example of decide measure that have be give to the native on the occasion of the capture of hobomak and squanto and also to the efficient means of defense that be now adopt by the settler on they first arrival in new england they have plant they gun on the hill which command the rise city of new plymouth and which afterwards receive the name of ` the bury hill ' there as we have see the remains of the venerable carver be deposit and there the infant form of ludovico maitland be lay in its last narrow resting-place and shaded by shrub and plant that edith and the faithful servant janet delighted to place there and to tend and water with untiring care and watchfulness this hill be convert during the first year of the pilgrim 's residence in new england into a kind of irregular fortification the storehouse -- which be also the chapel and the council hall -- stand on the summit and this be surround by a strong wall of timber well furnished with battery on which a watch be keep night and day to look out for the approach of any hostile party of indian at a considerable distance from this building run a strong wooden palisade that enclose the height entirely and be divide into four portion the entrance to which be securely fasten every night and the able - body man of the colony under the command of mile standish be arrange in four squadron to the care of each of which one quarter be entrust the occupation which this charge entail on the limited number of man who be capable of undertake it in addition to they necessary labor and employment in build they dwelling cultivate they field and procure provision by hunting and fishing be both heavy and incessant but disease have nearly leave the colony and want though occasionally feel to a painful degree be not always they portion and the pilgrim father be cheerfully contented with they lot still it be a lot that involve much of hardship and personal privation as a drawback to the liberty both religious and political that have be obtain by emigration the harvest be scanty and not nearly sufficient to provide bread for the increase community and also seed for the following year and the supplies that be occasionally procure from the wampanoge and they ally be very uncertain at one time every species of grain become so scarce that the settler have recourse to pig-nut as a substitute for bread and the last pint of corn that remain to the colony after the field be sow be count out among the whole community when _ five grain _ fall to the share of each person and these be look upon as a rare treat and eat as a particular dainty cattle be as yet unknown in the colony and they chief subsistence consist of game wild fowl and fish of which the supply be frequently both scanty and precarious ` often ' we be tell in the diary of the governor bradford ` we do not know in the evening where we shall get a meal next morning but yet we bear we want with joy and trust in providence ' and strong indeed must have be the faith and patience of these pilgrim father which sustain they spirit amidst such long-continued trial and enable they to meet and overcome such complicated difficulty without hesitation and without a murmur at one period they only food be fish and occasionally merely shellfish but never be this miserable fare partaken of by the emigrant who assemble to receive they respective portion without a blessing be ask and thanks be offer by the pious brewster who with a spirit of gratitude too often unknown to those who revel in abundance praise god for have permit they ` to suck out of the fullness of the sea and for the treasure sink in the sand ' while such a example of holy trust and patient submission to the will of god be set by the lead man of this suffer colony -- man who be both loved and respect -- not a complain word be utter by the rest all feel that they be bind to emulate the faith and piety of they high-souled governor and they venerated elder and truly they have need of every motive and of every aid -- both human and divine -- that could keep they soul in peace when actual famine at length stare they in the face the second winter have be endure and in spite of cold and privation the health of the colony have improve and spring again bring brighter hope and better prospects of the summer 's harvest but before the grain be well grow up a drought come on that threaten the utter destruction of the crop for six long week not one drop of rain fall on the thirsty land ` the sky be as brass ' to the faint emigrant and ` the earth be as iron ' to they yet these man of god do not despair they be accustom to regard every dispensation of providence whether prosperous or afflictive either as a special blessing from the hand of god to support and encourage he believe people or as a fatherly chastisement to punish they iniquity and excite they to greater piety and watchfulness ` it pleased god ' say edward winslow in speaking of this inflict ion ` to send a great dearth for we further punishment ' under this conviction the congregation be call on by the governor and the elder to set apart a day for special humiliation and prayer in order to entreat the lord to remove from they he chastening hand and to ` send a gracious rain upon he inheritance ' the call be universally obey and man woman and child assemble themselves together fast on ` the bury hill ' to listen to the solemn address deliver by brewster and to unite in fervent prayer and humble confession to they god and father the sky that morning be clear and bright as ever and the sun walk in unclouded brilliance and majesty through the deep blue vault of heaven for eight hour the devotions of the assembly continue almost without interruption and it seem as if ` none regard neither be there any that answer ' but as the sun be sink towards the western horizon a cloud ` as it be a man 's hand ' be see to rise as if to meet the glowing orb and ere he sink he ray be obscure by a heavy bank of cloud joy and gratitude now fill the breast of the suppliant and the dim and anxious eye of many a mother who have watch the decline form of she little one in silent anguish be light up with hope and glisten with a tear of thankfulness such indeed have be the suffering of the younger child although the greatest sacrifice have be make by they parent in order to provide they with the food so necessary to they existence that helen have frequently pour forth she heartfelt thanksgiving to she heavenly father that he have see fit to remove she gentle and idolize ludovico from a scene of so much distress and have call he away to a land where want as well as sorrow be unknown in a manner and at a time which allow she to ensure he ease and comfort to the last to have see she darling pine for food which she could not procure for he -- to have watch that fondly-cherished child sink into he grave from the actual want of proper nourishment and to know that in the land they have abandon all that be need to prolong he precious life be teem in profusion -- would she weakly think have be more than she faith could have endure but helen err in that doubt thought she be a _ christian : _ and have she lord and savior see fit thus to try she he would also have give she grace to meet the trial as a _ christian _ for he promise to each one of he people be sure : ` as thy day be so shall thy strength be ' edith she only remain child be strong and energetic in mind and body and she be no burden to she mother cheerfully she have bear she share of privation and uncomplainingly she have assist helen and janet in seek for root and berry hour after hour in the forest when no other food be to be obtain now on this day of fasting and prayer she stand beside she mother and rodolph and lift up she young voice in prayer for heavenly succor and in praise when the first signal of come aid be see in the crimson west the whole congregation have rise from they posture of supplication and be gaze with deep interest and emotion at the gathering cloud when they be startle at observe a large party of indian emerge from the thicket below and advance towards the palisade that form they outer fortification at first they imagine they to be a hostile body of narragansett or pequodee who have discover the manner in which that day be be spend among the pale-face and have resolve upon break the recently-formed treaty and attempt they destruction while they be thus assemble together and unarmed but these apprehension be soon remove by the appearance of they friend mooanam who advance from the rest of he party and hurry forward hold in he hand a fine fish and call on he ally to open they gate and admit he and he follower into the fortress for that he have bring they food joyfully he summons be answer and the generous red man enter the enclosure and lay before the governor a quantity of fish sufficient to supply the whole community with several wholesome and acceptable meal the kindness of this offering be highly estimate by the settler for they well know that they indian friend have long be suffer privation little less than what they have themselves endure and that they prospects for the future be hardly more cheer than they own the native and untaught courtesy also with which the seasonable gift be offer add not a little to its value ` behold ' say mooanam to the president when he and he attendant have place the fresh spoil of they lake in order before he -- ` behold what the good mahneto have give to he child in they day of distress and the red man could not eat and be in plenty while they know that the face of they white brethren be pale with want and they little child be cry for food take this my brother and let the heart of you people be glad and bless mahneto while they eat i and my young man will return to the supper that we squaw be prepare ' ` we do bless mahneto who be the god and father both of the red and white man ' reply bradford with solemnity for he be deeply impress by the pious feeling of the sachem and touch by he considerate kindness ` we do bless mahneto and we bless you also we faithful and generous friend who have thus so promptly share with we the produce of you labor instead of reserve it for you own future want but here be enough for you and we and you and you young man must abide tonight in we village and partake with we of the abundance that you have provide we leave the future in the bountiful hand of he who have thus make you he instrument to provide for we a table in the wilderness ' ` we will remain ' say mooanam ` and to-morrow some of you people shall go with we to we lake and fish in we canoe the cloud be rise and we shall perhaps have even better success than we have meet with today but tell I my white brother ' he continue -- while he look inquiringly at bradford -- ` tell I why you village be desert this evening and why no sound of labor meet we ear as we pass through the silent street this be not the white man 's day of rest and the white man do not leave they work to sleep or dance as the red man too often do why then be you and you people -- even you squaw and you little one -- assemble here today and what cause that joyful song that die away as we come to the foot hill ' ` we have spend the day in fasting and prayer ' reply the president ` we know that we great father have send this long drought upon we to chasten we for we sin : and we have meet to humble ourselves before he and implore he to send we the fruitful shower from heaven before we crop be altogether wither in the ground he alone can command the cloud to drop fatness and when he see that he punishment have do its appoint work he surely will take it away even now while we be make we prayer and supplication unto he and confess we sin he have send a token that he have hear we cry and will grant we request look at those cloud that be rise over the western hill and gradually spread like a curtain across the sky for six weary week those cloud have be withhold and we have be humble and at time we faith have well nigh fail but the faithfulness of we god never fail and now we be confident that ere long he blessing will descend upon we ' mooanam make no reply but he gaze intently on the gathering cloud and then look searchingly into bradford 's fine expressive countenance as if to be assure that he have hear and understand aright squanto stand beside he and he aid have be several time require by both party in order to the carry out the above discourse : and now the sachem draw he aside and converse earnestly with he in a low voice he be make he repeat in he own tongue the word of the white man and bradford hear he say to the interpreter as he turn away to rejoin he ` now we shall see whether the great spirit really hear the prayer of the white man ' the president understand this remark and fervently he lift up he own heart to the lord and pray that the hope of he suffering and trust people might now be fulfil not only for they own relief but also that the mind of the dark heathen might be impressed and that they might see and feel the power and the goodness of the christian ' covenant god while mooanam and the governor be engage in conversation the assembly have disperse to they own home each family carry with they they respective portion of the food so liberally offer by they indian friend and eager to partake of the first plentiful meal that they have enjoy for several week the hope of coming rain also cheer the heart of the pilgrim and there be joy and gratitude throughout the village that evening the sachem and he people be gladly receive and entertain in the dwelling of the governor and principal inhabitant and when mooanam lay down to rest he long gaze through the opening in the wooden wall of the chamber that form its only window and watch the heavy cloud as they speed across the sky and observe the face of the glimmer moon that look out so calmly and brightly between they dark move mass the soul of the sachem be deeply impressed and he think of all that bradford have say to he and wonder whether the god of the white man be indeed the god of the indian also chapter xiii ` it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they be yet speak i will hear ' isa lxv 24 mooanam awake from he sleep soon after the dawn of day appear he look up at the open window and a strange feeling of awe come over he soul as he behold the rain fall gently and steadily from the dull gray sky he spring to he foot and hurry into the next apartment where he find the president and he family already assemble and gaze at the descend shower in silent admiration the sachem catch the hand of bradford in both he own and while a tear of deep emotion glisten in he dark eye he exclaim -- ` now i see that you god love you when the red man ask for rain and use they conjure art to induce the great spirit to hear they wild cry he give it it be true but he give it with hail and thunder which make the evil still greater you rain be of the right kind it will restore the drooping corn now we see that you god hear you and care for you ' the same impression to a certain degree be make on all the indian who be teach to regard this seasonable rain as the settler themselves regard it -- as a special interposition of providence for they relief and be they wrong in thus look upon it as a answer to they prayer from a prayer-hearing god and be it vain superstition that lead they to rejoice as much in this proof of the goodness and benevolence of the god whom they serve and of he guide and protect hand be outstretch for they succor as in the prospect of come plenty that be thus afford to they surely not they faith and love and confidence in god be all animated and strengthen by they conviction that the relief thus seasonably receive come directly from he who have promise in he faithful word that _ ` all thing ' _ whether joyous or grievous ` shall work together for good to they that love he to they that be call accord to he purpose ' so deeply be hobomak the wampanoge interpreter impress by this instance of the pious trust of he white friend in the providence of they god and of the protection they enjoy under he guidance and government that he give himself up to a serious consideration of they religion and so sincere be he desire for spiritual knowledge and so humble and teachable do he show himself that after a time he be judge fit to be admit into the pale of the christian church he be baptize as the first fruit of the settler ' effort to evangelize the heathen among whom they have cast they lot : and he live a firm friend of the white man and die after reside many year among they ` leave a good-hope that he soul go to rest ' the welcome rain continue to fall for several hour without intermission on the morning that succeed the pilgrim 's day of prayer and humiliation and mooanam send he young man home to fish in the lake while he remain with he white friend intend to follow they in the afternoon with a party of the settler to share they sport as the day advance the cloud break and warm sunshine interrupt by frequent refreshing shower succeed to the settled rain of the morning so favorable altogether be the change that winslow gratefully remark : ` it be difficult to say whether we withered corn or we depressed spirit be most refreshed and quicken so great be the benevolence and goodness of we god ' the pilgrim have pray for rain and when they prayer be grant they do not neglect the equally incumbent christian duty of thanksgiving again the congregation ascend ` the bury hill ' and again they unite voice rise to heaven in prayer and song of praise mooanam form one of the assembly and he listen with deep and reverent attention to the devotions of he friend frequently apply to hobomak who stand at he side to explain to he the word and sentence that he do not comprehend the service conclude and the woman and child be descend the hill by the path that lead to the village leave the governor and he council to discuss some public business and the other man to arrange themselves as usual into company for the manning of they fortification and other necessary employment just at that moment a native attired in the costume and equipment of a narragansett be see to approach the foot of the hill bear a bundle of strange appearance in he hand with a quick and decide step he mount the height and glance fiercely at the female and they child whom he pass in the wind path and who all involuntarily shrink from the gaze of he pierce and singularly expressive eye in the breast of janet that glance strike a chill of horror for she have once before encounter it and never could she forget or mistake it again it seem that fingal recognize it also and know the evil that it forebode he be bound down the hill by edith 's side and with expressive look and action invite the pensive child to join in he gambol when the savage approach instantly he pause and take he stand close to he young mistress as if to guard she from some apprehend danger and as the red warrior pass and bent he eye on edith the sagacious creature utter a low deep growl and seem ready to spring at he throat if the hand and voice of he young companion have not restrain he fingal be a noble specimen of the st bernard breed of dog whose sagacity be such as frequently to appear like human reason and he intelligence be not inferior to that of the best of he race in this instance it do not mislead he the dark warrior stride on without one sign of courtesy and pause not until he have enter the group of elder and councilor who stand around the president prepare to attend he to the public hall the white man make way for he to approach the governor and as he do so he keen eye meet that of rodolph maitland and instantly kindle with a deeper fire and gleam with a expression of almost diabolical vengeance which be see by rodolph and understand by he for he too could not fail to recognize in the narragansett warrior that same coubitant who have fight so well at ` the first encounter ' and who have afterwards attend the nausett chief tisquantum when he and he people be repulse in they attack on new plymouth it be evident to maitland that this savage entertain towards he and he race a peculiar sentiment of hatred but the cause of this feeling be unknown to he the idea however that henrich 's loss be in some way connect with this man -- or that he could give he some information respect the nature of he son 's death and the place where he remains have be deposit -- come forcibly to he mind and regardless of the cold malignant gaze that coubitant fix on he he hastily approach he and exclaim in the indian tongue -- ` surely you be the nausett warrior whom i see with the sachem of that tribe if so you can tell I the fate of my son -- the boy who be carry off and i fear cruelly slay when tisquantum and he people retire from these wood o tell I how my boy be murder and where he dear remain be lay ' rodolph 's fine countenance be light up with eager animation a tear of fond regret and affection glisten in he eye and he could have grasp the hand of the swarthy savage and almost have bless he if he would have tell he that he darling henrich have die by a single blow and that he body have be lay unmolested to rest but coubitant draw back and with a smile of fierce mockery and infernal triumph reply briefly -- ` ha you find he bloody coat then may you heart 's blood soon flow forth as he do and may my eye see you body equally mangled and defaced ' at the same moment he place the bundle that he carry on the ground before the president say ` this come from the chief of the narragansett ' and turn away hastily descend the hill and be lose to view among the tree of the skirt wood before the council have time to resolve on the course they should pursue respect he detention or rodolph have recover the shock that he cruel word have inflict the curiosity of the governor and he friend be now direct to the strange-looking package that lay on the ground on examination they find the envelope to be compose of a dry snakeskin which be quickly open and disclose several indian arrow squanto gaze on these with a significant look and on be question by bradford as to the meaning of so singular a offering he inform he that it be the native mode of declare war the well-known enmity of the narragansett towards the wampanoge -- the friend and ally of the settler -- render this hostile declaration no surprise to the governor and he council but the fact of its be convey by coubitant who have so lately in the character of a subordinate narragansett chieftain subscribe the write acknowledgement of king jame 's supremacy excite no small astonishment it be a source also of regret as it prove how little dependence could be place in the profession of the native to enter on a war with the numerous and powerful tribe of the narragansett be likewise far from be desirable in any point of view for the pilgrim be little prepared either to meet such formidable antagonist 's in the field or to resist the continual attack and aggression 's that constitute the greatest share of indian warfare a consultation be therefore hold as to the best method of reply to the challenge of the narragansett sachem and it be finally determine that the most prudent and effectual course would be to show a resolute appearance and give no cause to the native 's to suppose that they dread they enmity a bold acceptance of the challenge might it be urge both by squanto and hobomak strike terror into the savage and deter they from prosecute they present hostile intention bradford therefore adopt the indian method of communicate this reply by expressive sign and take the arrow -- which appear to be poison -- from the snakeskin he place some gunpowder and ball in the significant wrapper he then inquire who among he trusty warrior 's would volunteer to take the packet to the dwelling of cundincus -lrb- \* -rrb- the chief of the narragansett several offer they service and among those none be so eager to be employ as rodolph maitland he feel a earnest desire to see and speak with coubitant once more : and no fear of the personal risk that he might incur in the expedition could deter he from thus make another attempt to obtain some certain information respect he lost son -lrb- footnote : afterwards call by the settler ` canonicus ' -rrb- have the president know how much reason there be to fear that treachery might be exercise towards maitland he would surely not have suffer he thus to risk he valuable life rut he be ignorant of all the peculiar circumstance that have occur to show that he be a special mark for the vengeance of coubitant : and the confidence he feel in he courage and ability lead he -- on this occasion as on many other -- to select he as he ambassador two companion be assign to he and squanto be desire to attend the party as interpreter when helen hear that she husband be appoint to convey a reply to the war-like message of the dark savage whom she have meet on the hill and whose aspect have fill she with terror she feel a involuntary dread and gladly would she have dissuade he from accept the office of ambassador -- which she know not he have so earnestly solicit -- have she not be well aware that all such attempt would be useless rodolph be not a man to shrink from any service that be require of he for the public good and least of all from any service that involve danger and difficulty he however conceal from he anxious wife the fact that he have recognize in the narragansett messenger a deadly and determine foe know how greatly -- and perhaps how justly -- she fear would be increase if she suspect that the indian champion be one of those who have plan and execute the capture of she eldest son but janet have as we have see remember the swarthy savage and the scene with which he countenance be associate in she mind and when she have a opportunity of speak to she master in private she implore he to resign the embassy into other hand and not thus rashly to encounter a foe whose public conduct have prove he to be unworthy of confidence and whose expression of countenance betoken both cruelty and treachery but all she argument be unavailing maitland have undertake the charge of the expedition at he own request and he would have feel himself dishonor in now decline it from any personal motive even have he be in the least degree incline to do so on the contrary he spirit be rouse and excite by the very peril he be conscious he might have to encounter and he desire to obtain and convey to helen some intelligence of henrich -- even if that intelligence should still for ever the doubt end hope that in spite of every past circumstance would sometimes arise in he own heart and that of he own wife -- be so great that nothing could have turn he from he purpose he therefore desire the faithful janet to preserve the same silence on the subject of coubitant that she have already so judiciously adopt towards she mistress and assure she that he would neglect no precaution that might preserve he from the treacherous intention of the indian should any such be actually entertain by he the next morning rodolph start at break of day to convey the reply of the governor to the narragansett sachem whose tribe inhabit the district now call rhode island lie to the south-west of new plymouth he be accompany by two friend and likewise by the interpreter squanto he faithful dog fingal also show such a strong desire to follow he master that although it be maitland 's usual custom to leave he at home as a guard during any of he occasional absence when he service in hunting be not require he could not in this instance resist he eager pleading helen also assure he that she should feel no apprehension at be deprive of she usual protector as no danger be likely to menace she dwelling and the increase in the population of the village from the arrival of the new settler have add a inmate to the family in the person of claude felton a stout young labor man who have become the useful assistant of maitland in he agricultural occupation and prove a good and faithful servant to he protection and watchful care rodolph maitland commit he little family and take a cheerful farewell of he wife and edith he commence he journey through the wild and almost trackless wood guide by squanto the party reach the village of cundineus and be receive into the presence of the sachem and he nephew miantonomo who share with he the care and the dignity of he chieftainship with the assistance of the interpreter rodolph inform the chief that he be the bearer of the reply of the mighty stranger to the bold challenge that have be send to they on the part of cundineus and miantonomo and he invite they to open the packet which he lay before they in order that they might fully understand the nature of that reply and judge whether the subject of the powerful king of great britain be terrify at the audacity of the red man probably squanto make some addition of he own to the harangue of the ambassador for a very ludicrous change of expression appear on the countenance of the savage chieftain the look of fierce defiance with which they have receive the embassy give way to anxious and timid glance which they hastily cast at the ominous snake-skin while they involuntarily draw back as if they fear it would explode and punish they rash temerity rodolph see the effect of squanto 's version of he speech and resolve to increase it he understand enough of the native tongue to perceive that the interpreter have allude to the potent and deadly property of the contents of the snake-skin and he desire he to inform the chief that the musket which he carry in he hand contain a very small portion of the same substance and he would give they proof of its power he then glance for a moment into the lofty tree that surround the place of audience and perceive a monkey that be cling to one of the wide-spreading branch nod chatter angrily at the intrusive foreigner he take a deliberate aim and in another instant the creature lay lifeless and motionless on the ground the indian be startle at the report and amaze at the effect of the invisible messenger of death they hasten to examine the dead animal but one drop of blood issue from its skull be the only indication that some missile have pierce its brain and the veneration of the narragansett and they chief for the prowess of the white man evidently rise in a great degree but there be one among they who do not share the wonder or the awe of the assembly he stand silent and motionless at a little distance from the group with he eye intently fix on rodolph 's countenance and a smile of malignant scorn and triumph on he own dark feature he arm be fold across he scar and paint breast and he right hand grasp the handle of a long knife that be stick into he deerskin belt the action seem to be involuntary and without any present purpose for he remain in the same position unobserved by rodolph until he and he attendant have retire to the hut appoint they by cundineus to rest and refresh themselves end await the reply of the chief rodolph then desire squanto to make inquiry for coubitant and if possible to bring he to the hut but the sagacious interpreter have see and recognize the white man 's face and he earnestly entreat maitland not to give he any opportunity of execute the vengeance which be evidently burn at he heart and ready to break forth in some deed of fatal violence rodolph 's english friend also join so warmly in these entreaty that he at length consent that squanto should seek the savage and endeavor to draw from he all the information that he could give respect henrich 's death he do so and a long conversation take place that evening the result of which be that he assure rodolph that he son have indeed be murder in the wood as he have always suppose and that he scalp have be tear off even before life be extinct whilst he body have be convey to the next encampment and burn with many heathen rite to appease the troubled spirit of tisquantum 's son tekoa the father shudder and turn away to hide the rise tear as he listen to this harrowing but false account he however fully believe it and feel that henceforth it would be vain to cherish any hope concern he son except that bless hope which be the privilege of the christian -- the sure and certain hope of meeting hereafter in the presence of the god and savior in whom he have teach he child to place he trust he say no more he do not even question squanto as to the cause of he have spend so long a time in confer with coubitant when all the information he have obtain amount merely to the sad assurance that he son have suffer a dreadful death have he do so the interpreter might have find it difficult to account for he conduct as he have profess a strong dislike to coubitant and a distrust of all he motive and action the fact be that the wily savage have discover squanto 's love of importance and he desire to be suppose to possess the confidence of the white man and by flattering he vanity he have draw from he all the information he could give with respect to the strength of the settler and they capability of resist a attack of the native squanto take care to exaggerate the number and the power of he employer but still it appear to coubitant that if he could once more induce the neighbor tribe to combine and invade they territory there be every probability of they be utterly exterminate and nothing short of this could satisfy the feeling of hatred that he entertain towards the whole race of the stranger by way of exalt the might of the settler in the mind of the native squanto assure coubitant that the white man keep the plague of which the indian well know the desolating effect imprison in a cellar where they also stow they gunpowder and that they could let it loose upon they foe at they pleasure this strange evidence be hear also by miantonomo whom coubitant call to join the conference as he know that he already hate the english and he desire to strengthen that feeling to the utmost for the furtherance of he own plan from coubitant squanto also receive some intelligence which in the mind both of the superstitious interpreter and he heathen informant be of vital importance to the settler and calculate to inspire they with dread this be the awful fact that a short time previous several of the neighbor tribe have meet in the adjacent forest and that the powow of the whole district have pass three day and night in cursing the stranger and utter against they the most horrible imprecation the effect of this diabolical proceeding in cause the defeat of they foe coubitant do not do not and in spite of he veneration for the english and he conviction that they deity be more powerful than the indian demon squanto be fill with apprehension on they account he communicate the circumstance to rodolph and be surprised and almost offend at the smile of indifference and contempt with which the christian listen to he but he find it impossible to make he attach any importance to what seem to he so serious a calamity and by degree he own fear subside and he mind be reassure by the argument and the cool composure of maitland rodolph and he companion lay down to rest for the night in the indian hut across the entrance of which squanto place several strong bough and spread a cloak of deer-skin over they this be do ostensibly for the purpose of keep out the cold night wind but really to serve as a screen from the prying eye of coubitant whose intention he much mistrust and also as a obstacle to any attempt he might possibly make to violate the law of honor and hospitality by a secret attack on the person of the ambassador whether the savage actually meditate any such act of treachery be not know but if he approach the hut with a murderous purpose he be probably deter more by the fierce growling of fingal -- who lay at the entrance but scarcely sleep that night -- than by the barrier of bough and deerskin several time be the party awaken by the trusty watch-dog 's angry bark and once when rodolph hasten to the entrance and draw aside the curtain he think he could descry more than one retreat figure in the uncertain darkness the continue uneasiness of fingal prevent he master from again give way to sleep until after day have dawn when he faithful guard become tranquil and he likewise seek the repose which he greatly need before recommence he fatiguing journey ere he set out on he homeward way rodolph again repair with squanto to the presence of the chief to demand he message to the british governor and he be inform by cundincus that he have already dispatch a messenger to restore the dreaded packet and to deprecate the wrath of the pale-faced chieftain this be all the ambassador could desire and take a courteous leave of the sachem he and he attendant resume they journey without further delay for a considerable distance they path lay through the forest and the underwood be so close and thick that the road consist of a narrow track scarcely wider than would admit of two person pass one another along it and only calculate for travel in ` indian file ' which be so much practice by the native in this manner we party proceed rodolph lead the way and he attendant follow singly while fingal who seem rejoice to have leave the village bound along at he master 's side ever and anon leap up to express he joy by lick he face and hand ` down fingal ' say he master kindly pat he favorite 's head and stroke he thick shaggy mane ` down my good fellow you joy be too boisterous for this narrow thorny path you shall expend you superfluous strength and spirit on the plain yonder for i think i detect some game scud across the green meadow before we ' rodolph pause to adjust he gun and the sagacious dog cease he wild demonstration end pause also until the task be complete then as he master rise to proceed he once more spring up to he shoulder end he intelligent eye ask leave to dash through the covert and drive out the expect game but why do that bind of pleasure change instantaneously into a convulsion of agony and why do the noble creature fall by he master 's side and look so earnestly up into he face surely in the midst of he own death struggle he seek to tell he with that mute eloquence of love that danger be near rodolph know that it be so but no danger could then have compel he to leave he die friend -- the friend whose life be now ebb away as a sacrifice for he own yes the shaft that have pierce through the neck of fingal be design for rodolph 's breast and he who cast it deem that it have find its intended mark when through the bush he see the white man 's form bend quickly and suddenly to the ground then coubitant flee exultingly and he savage heart beat high with joy and triumph but rodolph think not of he or of he malice he only see he faithful dog expire at he side and know that he have no power to aid he it be evident that the arrow be poison for the wound otherwise appear too slight to be mortal and the foam that gather on fingal 's jaw and the convulsive struggle that shake he form show too plainly that he suffering would soon be over the companion of rodolph urge he to join they in instant flight for they feel the peril of they present situation where the surround thicket give such ample opportunity to they lurk foe to take a deadly aim while at the same time it prevent they from either discover or pursue they assailant but all they argument and all they entreaty be unavailing so long as fingal continue to lick he master 's caress hand and to reply to he well-known voice by look of intelligent affection soon however he head sink powerless on rodolph 's knee and the bright glance of he eye fade away and life and motion cease be it unmanly in he master to brush a tear from he eye as he rise from the ground and turn away one moment from the lifeless form of he favorite ` i will not leave he here ' he say ` the savage shall not mangle he body as they would gladly have mangled mine he death have save my life and all that remain of he shall be carry to a place of safety and bury beyond the reach of those who slew he ' ` yes ' reply squanto readily -- for he desire the removal of the dog from that spot for other reason beside the gratification of maitland 's feeling -- ' yes we will carry he away and hide he from coubitant 's eye doubtless he will return here as soon as all be quiet to see the success of he murderous attempt and when he find the path thus stain with blood he will be satisfied and pursue we no further than to see whether we bury we dead companion in the forest or bear he to he home we must therefore carry fingal all the way to new plymouth lest he should follow on we trail and discover that he have only slay a dog ' rodolph 's english companion concur in this view and willingly lend they aid to convey the body of fingal from the place of he death a couple of pole be cut hastily and a rude light litter be form for squanto wish that coubitant should find trace of such preparation as they would help to convince he that they have thus bear away the wound or dead form of the ambassador ` now ' say he when all be ready ` not another moment must be lose even now the keen eye of the foe may be upon we and we stratagem may be in vain two of you must bear the litter and must carefully place you foot in the same spot so as to form but one track and lead we pursuer to believe that only three man have pass along and there throw that bloody handkerchief on the path and coubitant will take it as a trophy of success ` stay ' he exclaim as rodolph and one of he friend be about to raise the lifeless form of fingal from the ground ` stay one moment and i will completely deceive that deceiver ' he smile as he speak for he feel it a pleasure and a triumph to outwit the wily coubitant then while the body of the dog be support he carefully press he foot on the soft path so as to leave a distinct impression and convince any who should examine the trail that it be not the dog who have be wound this

again until they have strike deeply into the forest that succeed to the undulating reach of meadowland the way seem long to rodolph he desire to reach he cherish home and yet he dread to return and sadden the heart of he little edith with the story of fingal 's death and the sight of the inanimate form of she last and much-loved playfellow have it not be for this catastrophe he would have keep from he wife and child the knowledge of the cruel attempt that have be make on he life as such knowledge could only distress they and cause they needless anxiety and alarm in future but the death of fingal must be account for and let the consequence be what it might it must be account for truly and without prevarication therefore it be that rodolph dreaded meeting those whose presence be the joy and the sunlight of he life he reach he home and silently enter he bloom garden and with squanto 's assistance lay the body of fingal now cold and stiff beneath the venerable tree that shaded edith 's bower then he enter he dwelling and find its inmate busily employ at they usual domestic occupation and overjoy at he sudden and unexpected arrival but in spite of he own pleasure a shade of sadness and anxiety be on he brow which he could not hide from the quick eye of helen and she eagerly inquire the cause sadly rodolph tell he story and joy and deep gratitude for the preservation of she beloved husband so fill and engross the heart of helen as for a time to overpower every feeling of regret for the loss of the faithful animal who seem to have be providentially direct to accompany he master and save he life at the sacrifice of he own but edith keenly feel the loss she have sustain she be thankful -- very thankful -- that she father have be restore to they home in safety but she do not the less deplore the death of she dear companion : and unable to restrain she tear she hurry from the house and run to hide she grief in she lonely bower for some time she parent do not perceive she absence for they be occupy with they own feeling of pious gratitude but presently rodolph remark that she have leave the room and remember where he have deposit the body of she favorite he rise and go towards the spot accompany by helen and tear of sorrowful sympathy arise in the eye of both as they behold the desolate child lie on the ground by fingal 's side with she arm around he neck and she long wave hair hanging over he inanimate face that have never before meet she gaze without a answering look of intelligence and affection gently they raise she and speak to she word of love and comfort but she long refuse to be comfort and though at length she become calm and resigned and never be hear to utter one murmur at this fresh stroke of sorrow yet she pensive sadness become more confirm and plainly show that she mourn for fingal not only as she lose companion but also as a connect link between she own heart and the memory of she lament brother poor edith she early life be one of trial and disappointment but ` it be good for she to be afflict ' chapter xiv ' o christian warrior wherefore do you thus forget the precept of you lord and chief and lend yourselve to deed of guilt and blood do ye not know -- or know do not heed -- those solemn word of he when death be nigh and he bequeath a _ legacy of peace _ to he disciple `` they that take the sword shall perish with the sword '' o well it be if ye who leave you native land and seek a desert for the liberty of faith have act more accord to that faith and seek to win the soul you rashly send to meet they god and yours ' anon yes well indeed lie it be if the settler have be able and willing to preserve unbroken the friendly relation with the indian which after the first natural distrust feel by the native towards the white stranger have subside they be in several instance able to establish but such be not the case they receive many provocation from the native even from those who profess to be most friendly towards they and also from the settler who follow they from the mother-country and they do not always meet these provocation in the truly christian spirit which it must be allow generally pervade they council and actuate they public and private proceedings with the wild tribe by whom they be surround even masasoyt -- they friend and ally -- be about this time nearly estrange from they and on the point of join the narragansett in a project for they destruction this change in he sentiment be the result of the machination of coubitant assist by the foolish pretension and love of interference which render squanto almost as dangerous as he be useful to he employer he boast tale about the power of the english settler to imprison and to let loose the desolating plague at they will and pleasure have be tell to the sagamore of the wampanoge as well as to coubitant and miantonomo and suspicion have arise in the breast of masasoyt which he vainly strive to infuse into he more enlighten and trustworthy son mooanam nothing that he father could say have any effect in weaken the friendship entertain by the young sachem and he brother quadequina towards the emigrant and it be owe to this steady friendship that they be make acquaint with the altered feeling of the sagamore in time to prevent they ripening into open hostility mooanam communicate to the president the doubt and suspicion that have take possession of he father 's mind and advise he immediately to send the faithful and devoted hobomak to packanokick to endeavor to remove the evil impression and restore he confidence in the pilgrim father he also convince both bradford and he council that the conspiracy which squanto have represent as already form and only wait the concurrence of masasoyt to be carry into deadly effect be as yet in its infancy and might by judicious management be altogether break up the pokanokit interpreter have greatly exaggerate in he report to the governor all that he have hear from coubitant while at the narragansett village and have persuade he in spite of the opinion express by rodolph to believe not only that he and he people have be curse by the powow but also that the tribe to which these satanic conjuror belong be unite for the common purpose of attack and destroy the british settlement all this be do by squanto with no serious intention of injure he new friend but from a vain desire to make himself important and show the extent of he knowledge and sagacity he vanity be however very near prove fatal to he : for when the trusty hobomak have explain to the sagamore the real motive and intention of the settler towards the native and have convince he that all the strange and mysterious story that squanto delighted to tell be either pure invention or gross exaggeration a second change be effect in the old chief 's feeling and he send to demand that the faithless interpreter should be immediately deliver up to he the governor be extremely reluctant to comply with this demand as he well know how cruel and how summary be the judgement of the native chief and he as well as the whole of the colony feel a regard for squanto notwithstanding he folly and he error nevertheless the pokanokit be a subject of the sagamore who have make a express stipulation in he treaty with the settler that any of he people who might take up they abode in the colony should be give up to he whenever he require it and therefore bradford feel himself compel to abandon squanto to he fate the messenger who accompany hobomak on he return to new plymouth be load with a quantity of valuable beaver-skin which they lay in a pile at the governor 's foot as a bribe to induce he to comply with masasoyt 's demand these the governor reject with indignant scorn observe that no man 's life could be purchase from the english and that if he resign the interpreter into the power of he native sovereign it be only because truth and justice require it and not from any base motive either of fear or advantage then the messenger approach the wretched man who stand calmly await the decision of the governor and he see one of they draw from he belt the knife that masasoyt have command he to plunge into the culprit 's heart but squanto do not tremble all the native fortitude so characteristic of he race be manifest in this awful moment and the bystander feel a respect for the pokanokit that he have never before inspired gladly would each individual have interpose to save he and breathlessly they watch the movement of the president whose signal be to fix the moment of squanto 's death bradford hesitate : the word tremble on he lip when suddenly look towards the sea from the summit of ` the bury hill ' on which the assembly stand he espy a shallop bound over the wave and advance directly towards the shore beneath he make this a pretext -- certainly not a very well ground one -- for delay the execution of squanto 's sentence and declare that he would not give the fatal signal until he have ascertain the object and the contents of the approach vessel this falter on the part of the governor excited great wrath in the messenger of masasoyt and without any farther parley they take up they beaver skin and depart to they home squanto 's forfeit life be thus providentially spare and the conduct of bradford be through mooanam 's good office overlook b the sagamore but that life be not greatly prolonged very soon after this event he be seize with i virulent fever while on a short journey with the governor and in spite of all the care and attention that be bestow on he he die much regret by the whole colony the boat whose seasonable approach have be the means of arrest the fatal stroke be find to have be send from some english fishing vessel many of which now constantly frequent the shore of new england it convey to the colony a addition of several able-bodied man who be joyfully welcome by the settler as laborer be just then much want both in the field and in the increase town these man be send out by a english merchant name weston who have long endeavor to encourage the colonization of new england but from very different motive to those which have actuate the pilgrim father and lead they to forsake the comfort of a european home for the toil and uncertainty of a american wilderness a desire for profit appear to have be the ruling principle in weston 's mind he be therefore very indifferent as to the moral character of the man whom he send out to join the emigrant and be only solicitous to secure a quick return of the money that he have expend : and find that the prospect of gain from a connection with the new plymouther be doubtful and tardy he have resolve to find a colony himself for this purpose he have some time previously obtain a grant of a portion of land in massachusett and send over sixty man to cultivate it in two ship which he place under the command of he brother-in - law the arrival of this fresh band of emigrant have prove a fruitful source of trouble and annoyance to the first settler for they be chiefly idle and profligate vagabond who have no settle occupation at home and no character to sustain weston himself describe they in a letter to bradford as ` tolerably rude and profane ' and a friend of the pilgrim write from england to warn they against have any connection with the new colony : and recommend they to have it distinctly explain to the indian that they be a new and independent society for whose conduct and good faith they could in no way be responsible notwithstanding all these warning and the very unprepossessing appearance of the new emigrant the plymouther have show more kindness and hospitality than they have prudence and caution : and have receive they countryman into they own settlement on they arrival in america they have even permit on half of they number to reside at new plymouth during the whole summer while the strongest and healthiest have proceed to massachusett to fix on a spot for they settlement and prepare habitation they have decide on a place call wessagussett -lrb- \* -rrb- a little to the south of boston and thither they be afterwards follow by they companion from new plymouth the long residence of these man among the pious and high-minded pilgrim have not however make any salutary impression on they mind : and all the kindness and hospitality they have receive be most ungratefully forget -lrb- footnote : new weymouth -rrb- in various way the new colony vex and annoy the man of plymouth but in no way more seriously than by they conduct towards the native which be so different to the just and upright dealings of the pilgrim that the indian begin to lose they confidence in the white man and to suspect deceit and imposition where hitherto they have only find truth and justice weston 's colony be indeed scarcely settle at wessagussett before complaint be send by the indian to they friend at plymouth of the repeat depredation that be commit by the new settler who be continually carry off they store of corn and other property : and these accusation be by no means surprising to bradford and he council as they have already detect they in many act of theft during they stay at new plymouth the harvest of this year be poor and scanty and the great accession to they number cause by the visit of weston 's settler have entirely consume the store of the plymouther and reduce they again to actual want joyfully therefore they hail the arrival of two ship from the mother country laden with knife bead and various other article that would be acceptable to the indian in the way of barter and enable the settler to purchase from they the necessary supply of provision for which they have hitherto be compel to pay very dear in skin and fur meanwhile the colony of wessagussett be in a still worse condition they have quickly consume all the food with which the generous plymouther have supply they and have then steal everything on which they could lay they hand they have also sell almost all they clothes and bedding and even they weapon and be bring to such extreme necessity that they do not refuse to do the meanest service for the indian who dwell near they settlement in return for such means of subsistence as the red man be able to furnish they with for this condescension -- so unlike the dignified yet kind deportment of the plymouther -- the native despise they and treat they with contempt and even violence thus early be the british name bring into disrepute with the indian when man bear that name come among they for mere purpose of speculation and profit and ware not govern by the christian principle of humanity and justice that distinguish the earliest settler in new england from all those who follow they nor do the evil consequence of they ill conduct rest with themselves they fall also on the peaceably-disposed colony of plymouth and be the means of involve they in hostility with the native which have hitherto be ward off by the kind and judicious management of the governor and he assistant the general state of peace which have up to this period be maintain with the indian be greatly to be attribute to the bold and decisive measure that be always adopt by mile standish the military chief of the little community and the leader of every warlike expedition he well know how to impress the native with a due respect for he never tolerate the slightest injury or insult and yet he never permit he man to be guilty of any act of injustice or oppression towards the red man since the arrival of weston 's disorderly colony captain standish have show himself even more decide in maintain the rights and the dignity of the plymouther and have endeavor to show the native that they be not to identify the new comer with those whom they have already learn to know and to respect but at length in spite of all these judicious measure the pilgrim be draw into the quarrel that subsist between they countryman of wessagussett and the native and have draw the sword they certainly forget the principle of mercy and humanity that have hitherto guide they active measure be undoubtedly call for but cruelty and stratagem be unworthy of these christian warrior the continued marauding expedition of the man of wessagussett have exasperate the neighbor tribe to the last degree and the state of weakness to which they be reduce by they own thoughtless and improvident conduct lead the native to suppose that they would fall a easy prey to they combined force they therefore again form a combination to attack and utterly destroy these oppressive intruder into they country probably the council of chief who meet in the depths of the forest to arrange they plan of operation would have contented themselves with contrive the destruction of the new and offend colony which they might easily have effect have they confine they project operation to that object alone but there be one in the council who could not rest satisfied with such a partial vengeance on the white stranger and he fiery eloquence and false assertion and insinuation prevail over the rest of the chief to disregard every treaty and every obligation that ought to have bind they to the settler of new plymouth and to include they also in they savage scheme of massacre and plunder the argument by which he finally overcome the scruple of those chief who have ally themselves with the first emigrant and have acquire a regard and respect for they be one of self-preservation he boldly assert that the man of new plymouth would never either pardon or forget the destruction of they countryman of wessagussett but would immediately lay aside the mask of kindness and forbearance with which they have hitherto conceal they undoubted project of acquire the dominion of the whole country and gradually destroy the red man and would call forth all they supernatural power and blast they with fire and plague unless they be take by surprise and annihilate at one fall swoop all the superstitious fear of the ignorant native be thus arouse and if there be any in the assembly who be too well acquaint with the white man to credit all that coubitant assert they think it either unsafe or unwise to express they opinion any further happily for the settler one such faithful and friendly spirit be there to watch for they interest and provide for they preservation masasoyt have resume all he kindly feeling towards he english ally since the misunderstanding occasion by squanto 's meddle propensity have be explain away by the trusty hobomak he have also recently be visit by edward winslow when he be afflict with a severe illness and the christian soldier have minister to he relief in a way that have excite both the wonder and the lively gratitude of the sagamore when therefore he obey the summons of coubitant to join the general council of chief he have no intention of consent to any hostile measure be undertake against he powerful and beneficent friend weston 's wild and disorderly crew have excite he anger in common with that of all the other neighbor sachem and he be quite willing to combine with he red brethren for they chastisement -- perhaps even for they utter destruction : but he do not confound the pilgrim father who have never fail in truth and honesty with the deceitful and marauding vagabond who wear white face and call themselves christian subject of king jame while they act like heathen savage at first masasoyt meet the malignant argument and false assertion of coubitant with a open and generous statement of the upright conduct of the stranger towards himself and he tribe during the three year of they residence in new england and urge the assemble chief to beware how they attempt to molest man whose power to resist and punish any such attempt be only equal by they willingness and ability to benefit those who treat they with confidence and integrity but he soon perceive that he argument in favor of mercy and justice be powerless when oppose to the fierce and crafty harangue of coubitant and he therefore forbear to make any further reply and even appear to acquiesce in the decision of the council that the only means of secure the safety and independence of the indian tribe be utterly to exterminate the invader the propose plan for accomplish this barbarous project be first to surround and fall on the miserable and sickly colony of wessagussett and then before the news of the massacre could reach new plymouth to hasten thither and wreak on its unsuspecting and unprepared inhabitant the same fierce vengeance the day and hour be fix and every necessary preliminary be minutely arrange and then the council break up and the chief return to they respective dwelling to collect and fully arm they follower and prepare to meet again at the appoint time and place with both hand and heart read to execute the bloody deed masasoyt retire like the rest and attend by the little band of warrior who form he bodyguard be take the forest path that lead to he dwelling at packanokick but he do not long pursue that path when he have proceed such a distance through the forest as to feel sure that he should not by turn to the right cross the route of any of the other chief he dismiss all he follower except two of the most trusty and confidential the rest he desire to proceed immediately to packanokick and inform he people that they must prepare for a warlike expedition and that he be go to visit he son mooanam in order to give he direction to join in the enterprise with that portion of the tribe that be under he authority this be very far from be the truth but the indian sagamore consider that every falsehood and stratagem be allowable and even meritorious that could further a desire object especially if that object be so undoubtedly good in itself as that which now engross he thought and wish he do not know that it be sin to ` do evil that good may come ' and therefore we must judge he by he generous motive and not by he heathen practice have thus free himself from those on whose discretion and fidelity he could not fully rely he change he course and travel straight towards new plymouth there be no beaten track through the tangled wood in that direction but the position of the sun and the appearance of the tree be sufficient guide for the sagacious indian chief and in spite of he advanced age he pursue he way with vigor and activity frequently he path be obstruct by the luxuriant growth of underwood or by the cable-like creeper that hang in every direction cross each other like the rigging of a ship and present obstacle that nothing but the tomahawk that hang from the girdle of the native enable they to overcome with these weapon -- ever ready in the hand of a indian either to cut he way through the forest to fall the timber for he wigwam or he canoe to slay the game that he arrow have bring to the ground or to cleave the skull of he enemy -- do old masasoyt and he devoted follower divide the large tough climbing plant that obstruct they passage sometimes also when the sun be totally obscure and the necessary winding in they course would hive render they uncertain whether they be follow the right direction these useful tomahawk enable they to consult the indian compass the manner in which these child of the wilderness supply to themselves the want of that invaluable instrument be both curious and ingenious and it prove of essential use to the wampanoge chief on this occasion whenever he find himself at fault from the absence of the sun or any other direct indication of the proper course he raise he battle-axe and strike a heavy blow at some neighboring pine or birch tree on each side of which he cut a deep notch and then by examine the grain of the wood he could tell which be the north and which the south side -- the former be easily ascertain by the greater closeness of the concentric ring and consequent hardness of the fiber the sap be more draw to the south side by the action of the sun cause the ring on that side to swell more and this operation of nature have be observe by nature 's child and employ by they as a sure guide in they long wanderings through the pathless forest where they find a home the journey to new plymouth be rather a long one but the sagamore and he companion be each provide with a small quantity of they usual travel food _ nokake _ -- or meal make of parched maize -- which they carry in true indian fashion in they hollow leathern girdle when they come to a pond or brook they pause to eat a few handsful of this simple provision which be so dry that it can only be swallow when either water or snow be at hand ready to wash down each mouthful and consequently in summer the native have sometimes to travel long distance before they can avail themselves of the food that be already in they hand immediately on he arrival at new plymouth the sagamore repair to the dwelling of bradford and request a private interview -- at which no one be allow to be present except the wampanoge interpreter hobomak -- he inform he of the conspiracy of the native and warn he to be well prepare for the intended attack could he have give this warning and ensure the safety of he ally without betray the whole of the conspirator ' project he would gladly have do so for he both despise and hate the man of wessagussett and he be willing that they should he treat as they seem disposed to treat such of he race as they could get into they power he even make a attempt to persuade bradford to leave they to the fate they so well deserve and to connive at they destruction which would remove a increase evil from the first colony but the president soon convinced he that such a course would be altogether at variance with the precept and principle of that religion in which he glory and which it be he chief aim and that of all he christian brethren to exalt and make honorable in the eye of the native : and that therefore no selfish consideration could induce they to abandon they countryman to destruction notwithstanding they ingratitude towards themselves and they ill conduct towards the indian with this decision masasoyt be extremely dissatisfied : but he could not now withdraw the information he have impart even if he desire it and he also feel it to be most politic to secure the friendship of the white man even if it should involve the sacrifice of the life of some of he own countryman and interfere with they project of vengeance on they foe this be most likely to be the case in the present instance for the governor be excite to great indignation by the intelligence f this second conspiracy in which several of the chief who have sign the treaty with captain standish be concerned and he immediately summon the gallant soldier and the rest of he council to deliberate on the best means of defeat it it now only want three day of the time appoint for the gathering of the red warrior and the attack on wessagussett no time be therefore to be lose and it be soon determine that standish with a band of eight man should march the follow morning at day-break and come stealthily upon the savage before they could he fully prepare for the assault it be a bold -- perhaps a rash -- measure for so small a party to go forth and encounter the native force thus combine but standish though a man of prudence and discretion be a stranger to fear and he and he follower have already learn the power of order and discipline in compensate for any disadvantage of number it be therefore with cheerful confidence that the military force of the settlement prepare for they march and they plainly show on what that confidence be found by request the prayer of the congregation for they success a great part of the night be accordingly spend in prayer and the blessing of the god of truth and mercy be solemnly ask upon a enterprise that the leader well know be about to be carry out by fraud and cruelty at sunrise the soldier meet on ` the bury hill ' and the staff of office be give with much solemnity to captain standish by the pious and venerable brewster they have already take leave of they wife and family who do not altogether share the cheerful exultation display by the puritan warrior and who be not permit to be present at this final ceremony lest they anxious fear should disturb the composure of they husband and father notwithstanding this characteristic prohibition helen and she younger daughter edith have venture to station themselves in the path that lead down ` the bury hill ' in the direction in which standish and he man be to march that they might take one more farewell of rodolph before he leave they on a expedition which to they mind seem fraught with danger and uncertainty and where they fear he might again be expose to the vengeance of he untiring foe the gallant little band march down the hill and come where edith and she child stand wait beneath a tree for what might be they last look on one most dearly love and when rodolph see they he forget the strictness of discipline and order require by he commander and leave the rank to indulge the feeling of he heart by again embrace he weep wife and child the stern captain instantly recall he and when he see a tear glisten in the eye of the husband and father a slight expression of wonder and contempt pass over he countenance he marvel that so brave a soldier and so strict a puritan as rodolph maitland should still remain subject to so much worldly weakness but standish be not at that time a married man and he be very deeply imbue with all the severe and unbending principle of he sect which even go so far as to demand the suppression of all natural feeling -- make it a fault for a mother to kiss she child on the lord 's day -- and inflict actual punishment on the captain of a ship for have embrace he wife on 5 Sunday when after a long separation she hurry to meet he as he land from the vessel to such puerile littleness will even great mind descend rodolph be unmoved by the commander 's contemptuous glance he know he own unflinching puritan principle and he own undaunted courage and he know he value in the eye of standish the captain know it also for he never like to go on any enterprise that require bravery and cool judgement without secure the aid of maitland and although the tenderness of he friend 's feeling and the warmth of he domestic attachment -- so different to the coolness and apathy which be so prevalent in the community -- be a continual subject of surprise and pity to the iron-hearted leader yet he highly respect he and even love he as much as such a gentle feeling as love of any kind could find admittance to he breast they journey on then -- that stern captain who have no tie to life and deem it a privilege to die with ` the sword of the lord and of gideon ' in he hand fight for the cause of he own peculiar sect in which alone he think salvation could be find and that warm-hearted husband and father who feel that he have leave behind he what be far dearer than life itself -- those who alone make life precious to him-and who yet be willing to sacrifice all if honor and duty demand it which be the braver man of the two both be brave but standish be the most unscrupulous he consider that any stratagem be lawful which could place he heathen enemy in he power and no argument of the high-minded and truthful maitland could convince he that deceit and treachery even towards they infidel foe be unworthy of christian warrior mile standish be resolve to use some device to get the chief of the conspiracy off they guard and by destroy they to break up the hostile confederacy altogether : and as maitland be bind to obey he order and also know the utter impossibility either of change the resolve of he captain or of desert the enterprise he be compel to join in proceedings that he could not approve when the little band have arrive at the spot indicate by masasoyt and within a short distance of the indian place of rendezvous standish command he man to halt for rest and refreshment for the last time before the expect encounter with the army of savage who be assemble for they destruction this halting-place be situate on the summit of a considerable elevation well cover with tree and bush and overlook a plain on the further side of which the indian camp be form the advantageous position in which the emigrant be post enable they to obtain a full view of they enemy without be perceive by they and captain standish resolve to remain there quietly that night in order to recruit the strength of he man after they rapid and toilsome journey and to mature he plan for subdue the horde of native before he with so small a band as now surround he and who wait but he order to rush on to the most desperate enterprise the wampanoge interpreter hobomak accompany the party at he own desire and that also of he sovereign masasoyt standish be glad of he assistance in he capacity of interpreter : he have already show such devoted attachment to the english that they entertain no fear of he either betray or desert they cause and on this occasion he fully justify they confidence early in the morning the leader announce he intention of go himself to the indian camp to make overture of peace and to invite the chief to a conference and he desire he man to construct a strong and spacious wigwam for they reception and to make a door to it which could be close and fasten securely he do not then explain he project more clearly but rudolph understand it and he soul revolt from the treachery he suspect ` now ' say the captain have finish he direction to he well-disciplined follower ` who will volunteer to go down with I and hobomak to the heathen camp and to carry the flag of truce before I it may be a service of danger to enter that hornet 's nest and no one who have leave he soldier 's heart at home with he wife or he child have better attempt it ' rudolph feel the sarcasm though it be utter good humoredly and he instantly reply -- ' i be ready my chief to attend you wherever you may go and if i have leave my heart 's affection at new plymouth you shall see that i have bring with I none the less of courage and fidelity to my leader and my countryman the dearer my home the more energetic shall be my effort to preserve it from desolation besides ' he add in a undertone so that only standish should hear : ' i much prefer go boldly into the midst of the enemy even at the risk of my life to remain here to assist in construct a trap for they destruction ' ` you be a brave fellow maitland ' say the captain grasp he hand with warmth and energy ` but you have bring some peculiar prejudice over from europe with you and do not yet perceive the difference of war on equal term with civilized troops -- as you be accustom to do in you youth -- and contend with a horde of savage who know nothing of the law of honor and who be even now combine to destroy we all without either challenge or preparation come along with I and leave the rest to do as i have direct necessity have no law and if we do not meet those cunning native with equal cunning we shall have no chance against they ' ` truth and sincerity appear to I the strongest necessity and the god of truth will order the result as he please ' answer rodolph ` but i have swear to obey you order and you need not fear the constancy of either my heart or hand i know my duty as a soldier and i will do it ' ' i know you will maitland ' reply he commander and he respect for he conscientious friend rise higher than ever while a slight misgiving as to the righteousness of he own project plan pass through he breast it do not abide there however for he be really satisfied that he be act in conformity to the will of god and that he be fully justified in ask for he blessing to crown he murderous scheme with success maitland take the flag of truce which consist of a long spear with a white handkerchief attach to the summit and precede the captain who follow in full uniform attend by he swarthy interpreter as soon as they emerge from the wood that cover the halting-place and enter the open plain they be espy by the keen and watchful eye of the native and a messenger be dispatch to meet they and bring they to the presence of the indian leader wattawamat who be regard as the chief of the conspirator captain standish assume a pacific air and desire hobomak to advance before he and inform the chief that he come to propose term of reconciliation and peace he then himself approach they and with the aid of the interpreter make to they a rather lengthy harangue on the benefit that would accrue to they from preserve peace with the white man and he sorrow and that of he employer on have accidentally discover that the tribe of massachusett entertain feeling of enmity towards the british settler at wessagussett ever and anon during the translation of the various paragraph of this speech rodolph observe the keen eye of the captain as they carefully survey the surround force and examine the individual who appear to be they leader and once when he own eye follow the direction of he commander 's he glance encounter one that instantly rivet it and excite in he breast some sensation -- not of _ fear _ for rodolph know not the feeling -- but of inquietude and distrust yes coubitant be there gaze at he suppose victim with amazement and hatred and half inclined to believe that some supernatural power must belong to the man who could have be wound with he deadly arrow and yet survive to confront he once more there he stand -- with disappointed vengeance in he heart and fury flash from that eye of fire but while he keep a continual watch on every movement of rodolph 's he quick ear lose not one word of the speech that hobomak be render into he native tongue he hear when in standish 's name he invite the chief to meet he in the wigwam that he man be construct on the border of the thicket and where he say he would smoke with they the pipe of peace and give to they the present that the governor have send as pledge of he friendly intention the moment this invitation have be deliver coubitant approach wattawamat and whisper a few word in he ear to which the chieftain give a sign of acquiescence and then the nansett leave the assembly and disappear among the tree and bush that bound the plain on every side wattawamat give no immediate reply to the proposal of the english chief but as be not unusual with the indian keep up a long discourse and contrived to lengthen the audience for a considerable time another indian then approach the sachem and again whisper to he some word that give he evident satisfaction for he smile grimly and display he fine row of ivory tooth for a moment as he nod approbation to the messenger then resume he wonted gravity of demeanor he reply to captain standish that he be satisfy by he assurance of the good faith of the white man and that he and he brother chief would avail themselves of he invitation and meet in the wigwam a little before sunset where he hope so to arrange all the little disagreement that have occur between the red man and the mighty stranger as to be able to establish between they and all he countryman the same friendship and alliance that appear to exist with the wampanoge tribe whose chief he observe with a slight curl of he lip have fail in he promise to attend they meeting that day the cause of this favorable decision on the part of wattawamat be the report that coubitant have just send he of the insignificant force of the english which that crafty and swift-footed warrior have contrived to ascertain by run round the border of the weed to the place where standish 's man be at work and take a accurate and unobserved survey of they number he feel convinced that it would be easy for the chief and such of they attendant as might be allow to follow they to the place of conference to overpower and destroy every one of the little band of whites and then to prosecute they original intention of carry fire and slaughter into both the british settlement in all this scheme there be nothing so grateful to the ruthless heart of coubitant as the idea of rodolph 's death and that too as he trust by he own hand o how he pant for the devilish joy of tear off he scalp and carry it back to throw it triumphantly at henrich 's foot we shall see whether such joy be accord to he standish and he companion take they leave and return to the hill where they find great progress have be make in build the wigwam and two hour before sunset it be completely wattled round leave only a small aperture near the top to admit light and a narrow place of entrance to which a strong door be affix the captain then explain he plan which be approve by all but maitland and he forbore to urge any further opposition which he feel would now be useless a temperate meal be partake of and a hymn sing by the undaunted little company and pipe and tobacco have be plentifully place in the hut the side of which be decorate with piece of gay color calico and a few knife and trinket as pretended gift to the chief nothing remain but to await the arrival of the victim soon the indian chief deck in all they bravery of feather and embroidered skin come march a cross the plain follow by a few attendant less richly adorn standish and he party go to meet they and conduct they with much courtesy to the wigwam which be soon obscure by the cloud of smoke that issue from the pipe of the grave and silent assembly but this silent gravity do not long continue captain standish address the chief and strove to speak kindly to man whose death he be compass all the while : but whether he resolution somewhat fail as the moment for the execution of he bloody purpose draw on or whether he be disconcert by the absence of rodolph who refuse to enter the wigwam and assist at the slaughter so it be that he manifest evident sign of weakness and indecision the chief be embolden by this and they be trouble by no qualm of conscience on the subject of shed the white man 's blood they rise from they seat on the ground and begin to taunt the captain with he want of eloquence and also with the smallness of he stature which be despicable in they eye then grow still bolder as they become excited they draw they knife and whet they before the eye of they host : flourish they round they head and boast how they have already shed the blood of many white man in the distant european settlement it be a fearful scene : but the real peril of he situation instantly restore the commander to he wonted resolution and firmness he call on he man to be ready and not to allow one of the chief to escape from the wigwam and with he hand on he pistol he wait the proper moment for action the indian continue to pour forth the most abusive epithet : but they do not begin the expect attack and it be evident that they be a little intimidate by the undaunted bearing of the white man one of they however seem actuate by some desperate purpose and to be regardless of aught else from the moment of he entrance into the wigwam he eye have seek some object that they do not find : and now in all the excitement of the approach conflict he only aim seem to be to make he way through the entrance in search of some person on whom he desire to wreak he fury it be rodolph whom coubitant seek and who be now providentially out of he reach and wait the result of the deed against which he have vainly protest at length the wrath of standish break loose he give the appoint signal and the door be close -- shut in friend and foe in one small field of battle or rather of carnage the scene in the dimly - light wigwam be terrific and the yell of the infuriate native break with a sickening effect on the ear of rodolph maitland who could not consent to share in what he consider a murderous conflict and not a honorable war and who yet feel as if he be desert he countryman by thus remain inactive but if he feel undecided as to he proper course of action that indecision do not last long in a few moment the door of the wigwam be violently burst open and the combatant rush out struggle and bleed from the den of slaughter all the white man come forth for though many of they be wound not one have fall but three of the indian lay dead and die on the floor of the hut one of they be the mangled body of wattawamat who be slay by standish with he own knife -- that very knife which the savage have sharpen for the purpose of plunge it into the heart of the white chief where be rodolph now in the midst of the fray fight desperately and successfully the moment he see the battle rage in open field and behold the blood flow from the wound of he countryman he forget all else except that he strong right arm wield a trusty blade and its skilful stroke soon bring another of the red warrior to the ground and chase away those who seek to secure they wound comrade the indian see that they be overmatch and that nothing but flight could save the remainder of they party they therefore utter they wild war-cry once more and commence a rapid retreat down the hill pause several time to send back a volley of arrow on they victorious foe which however fall harmless to the earth though more than one be aim at rodolph by the strong and skilful hand of coubitant but rest be not to be afford to the little conquer band while they be secure the wounded indian and bind up they own wound they discover a movement in the body of savage on the other side of the plain and truly surmise that they be prepare to attack they in greater number standish instantly give order that the indian whom rodolph have bring to the ground should be hang to a neighbor tree which be as instantly execute and he re-enter the tent to make sure that no life remain in those three who lay on its bloody floor all be dead : and standish approach the body of the chieftain wattawamat raise he good broad sword and at one blow sever the head from the trunk then seize the gory head by the long scalp-lock he carry it forth as a trophy and desire one of he man to secure it and carry it back to new plymouth no time remain for further parley a band of indian be approach across the plain and standish disdain to fly even before such superior number every musket and pistol be hastily load and the undaunted party march down the hill to meet the come foe they meet : and in spite of the furious onset of the savage they be again make to feel that they undisciplined horde be no match for the well - aim fire-arm of the white man and have no power to break the order of they steady rank once more they flee leave another of they number dead on the field and they return no more to the charge during all this affair hobomak have remain a quiet spectator of the combat and of the defeat of he countryman and now he approach the english captain and complacently praise he bravery and military prowess and he remain as devote as ever to he christian friend the triumphant soldier return to new plymouth and be receive with joyful exultation by the governor and the inhabitant who feel deeply grateful for the deliverance that have be accord to they and the safety of the brave man who have fight in they defense all the little band have be preserve from serious personal injury but rodolph maitland have also be preserve from blood-guiltiness and that be more to he than life and safety and to he christian and devoted wife also the head of wattawamat be bring to new plymouth and the dreadful trophy be conspicuously place over the entrance to the fortress as a warn to the native against any future conspiracy for the destruction of the white man so great indeed be the terror inspire by the power and the severity of the settler that many of the native -- who be conscious of have be engage in the conspiracy though undiscovered -- leave they wigwam and flee into the wood or conceal themselves in reedy morass where a great number of they perish from hunger and disease the settler be much distressed at this result of they proceedings which at the same time they consider to have be perfectly justify by the necessity of self - preservation but when they venerate pastor robinson -- to whom they have ever since they emigration look for guidance and sympathy -- hear of these sad event he express the deepest sorrow and beg they never again to be lead away by the fiery temper of they leader add these touch and

about three year previous to the time at which we narrative have now arrive -- he have indulge himself in a almost total cessation from business and from every active employment and have resign the government of he follower into the able and energetic hand of he son-in-law henrich be now regard as chieftain of that branch of the nausett tribe over which tisquantum hold authority and so much have he make himself both loved and respect during he residence among the red man that all jealousy of he english origin and foreign complexion have gradually die away and he guidance in war or in council be always promptly and implicitly follow and henrich be happy -- very happy -- in he wild and wander life he have pass from boyhood to manhood amid the scenery and the inhabitant of the wilderness and though he heart and he memory would still frequently revert to the home of he parent and all that he have love and prize of the connection and the habit of civilized life yet he now hardly wish to resume those habit indeed have such a resumption imply the abandon he wife and child and he venerable father-in - law no consideration would ever have induce he to think of it he have likewise as tisquantum say on obtain he consent to he marriage with oriana solemnly promise never to take she away from he while he live therefore at present he entertain no intention of again rejoin he

thunder of water ' be the indian name for these magnificent fall -rrb- he have cross the mighty river of america that seem to european eye to be arm of the sea and have pass in light and frail canoe over those vast lake that be themselves like inland ocean and in the high latitudes to which the restless and apprehensive spirit of tisquantum have lead he he have travel over boundless field of snow in the sledge of the diminutive esquimaux and lodge in they strange winter-dwelling of frozen snow that look as if they be build of the purest alabaster with window of ice as clear as crystal and marvelously beautiful those dwelling be in henrich 's eye as be pass along the many room with they cold wall glitter with the lamp-light or glowing from the reflection of the fire of pine branch that burn so brightly in the center on a hearth of stone well and warmly too have he sleep on the bedstead of snow that these small northern man find so comfortable when they have strew they with a thick

fancy the spirit of edith have pass into she form and have come to share he exile certainly the mind and feeling of the indian girl do ripen and expand with wonderful rapidity and as she grow to womanhood she gentle gracefulness of manner and she devoted affection towards henrich confirm the attachment that have be gradually form in he heart ever since he have be she adopt brother and make he resolve to ask she of the sachem as he wife since the conduct of coubitant have excite -- as we see in a former chapter -- the suspicion of tisquantum and have so evidently increase the dislike of oriana the chieftain have abandon all idea of bestow he daughter 's hand on he or of make he he successor in he official situation and the departure of the cruel and wily savage have be to he as well as to oriana and henrich a great satisfaction and relief none of they wish to see he dark countenance again or to be expose to he evil machination and all be fully aware that the marriage of the white stranger to the sachem 's lovely daughter be a circumstance that would arouse all he jealousy and all he vengeance nevertheless this apprehension do not deter the old chief from give a joyful consent to the proposal of henrich to become he son in fact as he have long be in name and affection and the summer of the year 1627 have see the nuptials celebrate in indian fashion on the same day also the young widow mailah become the wife of henrich 's choose friend and companion jyanough who have never leave the nausett since first he join they but have follow he brother-in - arm in all he various wanderings it be a joyful day to the tribe when this double marriage take place and great be the feast beneath the tree on the shore of the mighty lake ontario where they camp be pitch game be roasted in abundance and much tobacco be consume in honor of the happy couple who be all beloved by they simple follower and for whom fresh wigwam be build and strew with sweet spray of pine and fir and furnish with all that indian want demand and indian art could furnish with some difficulty henrich prevail on the sachem to permit he daughter to forego the native custom of cut off she hair on the day of she marriage and wear a uncouth head-dress until it grow again but at length he be successful on the plea that oriana be a christian and about to unite herself to a christian also could not be bind to observe the superstitious and barbarous ceremony of she race she fine black lock be therefore spare but mailah be a second time rob of hers and appear for many month afterwards with she head closely shroud in the prescribe cover much do henrich wish that he and he bride could have receive the blessing of a minister of the gospel as a sacred sanction of they union but this could not be : and he endeavor to supply the deficiency and to give a holy and christian character to what he feel to be the most solemn act of he life by unite in earnest prayer with oriana mailah and jyanough that the blessing of god might rest upon they all and enable they to fulfil they new and relative duty faithfully and affectionately and ` as unto the lord ' three year have elapse since that day and no event have occur to interrupt the domestic happiness of those young couple or to disturb the perfect friendship and unanimity that reign between they they be a little christian community -- small indeed but faithful and sincere and likely to increase in time for little lincoya be carefully instruct in the bless doctrine which he mother and he step-father have receive and when henrich 's own son be bear he baptize he in the name of the holy trinity and give he the christian name of he own loved brother ludovico and earnestly he ask a blessing on he child and pray that he might be enable to bring he up a christian not in name only but in deed and in truth chapter xvi ` wrath be cruel and anger be outrageous but who be able to stand before envy ` open rebuke be better than secret love

silently watch the peaceful slumber of they venerable parent and the playful sport of they child who be again roil on the soft green turf at they foot and busily engage in deck the shaggy head and neck of a magnificent dog with the gay flower that be scatter around he it be rodolph -- the faithful rodolph -- who have once save henrich 's life from the treacherous design of coubitant and who have often since prove he guard and he watchful protector in many season of peril and difficulty he devotion to he master be as strong as ever and he strength and swiftness be still unabated whether in the flood or the field but year have somewhat subdue the former restless activity of he spirit and now that he have dwell so long in a settle home he manners have become so domestic that he seem to think he chief duty consist in amusing the little ludovico and carry he about on he bread shaggy shoulder where he look like the infant hercule mount on he lion they be indeed a picturesque pair and no wonder that the young parent of the beautiful child smile as they watch he wreathe he little hand in the long curl mane of the good-tempered animal and lay he soft rosy cheek on he back such be the group that occupy the small cultivate spot in front of the chief lodge of the village : and thus happy and tranquil might they have remain until the fading light have warn oriana that it be time to lay she child to rest in he mossy bed and to prepare the usual meal for she husband and she father but they be interrupt by the approach of jyanough and mailah accompany by the young lincoya and also by a stranger whose form seem familiar to they but whose feature the shadow of the over-hanging tree prevent they at first from recognize but as the party approach a chill strike into the heart of oriana and she instinctively cling closer to she husband 's arm as if she feel that some danger threaten he while the open manly brow of henrich contract for a instant and be cross by a look of doubt and suspicion that be seldom see to darken it and could not rest there long in a moment that cloud have pass away and he rise to greet the stranger with a frank and dignified courtesy that show he feel suspicion and distrust to be unworthy of he rodolph also seem to be affect by the same kind of unpleasant sensation that be feel by he more intellectual but not more sagacious fellow-creature no sooner do the stranger advance beyond the shadow of tree and thus afford the dog a full view of he very peculiar and striking countenance than he utter a low deep growl of anger and slowly rise from the ground place himself between he little charge and the suppose enemy on whom he keep he keen eye immovably fix while he strong white tooth be display in a very formidable row coubitant -- for it could be no other than he -- see clearly the impression that he appearance have excite on the assemble party of he old acquaintance but he be a adept in dissimulation and he entirely conceal he feeling under the garb of pleasure at this reunion after so long a separation the candid disposition of henrich render he liable to be deceive by these false profession of he former rival and he readily believe that coubitant have during he absence of so many year forget and lay aside all those feeling of envy and jealousy that once appear to fill he breast and to actuate he to deed of enmity towards the white stranger whose father have slay he choose friend and companion but be it so have the cruel and wily savage indeed become the friend of he who have he deem supplant he -- not only in the favor of he chief but also in the good grace of he intended bride -- and who be now as he have learn from jyanough the husband of oriana and the virtual sachem of tisquantum 's subject warrior no : ` jealousy be cruel as the grave the coal thereof be coal of fire which have a most vehement flame ' and in the soul of coubitant there dwell no gentle principle of mercy and forgiveness to quench this fiery flame he be a heathen : and in he eye revenge be a virtue and the gratification of it a deep joy : and in the hope of attain this joy he be willing to endure year of difficulty and disappointment and to forego all that he know of home and of comfort therefore have he leave the tribe of he adoption and the friend of he choice and dwelt for so many winter and summer among the narragansett until he have acquire influence in they council and win for himself rank in they tribe and all this rank and influence he have as we have see exert to procure the destruction of the white man because one of they number have cause the death of he friend and he have vow to be revenge on the race he hate the pale-face and he hate they religion and they peaceable disposition which he consider to be merely superstition and cowardice and now that he have fail in all he deep-laid scheme for they annihilation all he hatred be concentrate against henrich and he resolve once more to seek he out and by again unite himself to the band of nausett under tisquantum to find a opportunity of rid himself of one who seem bear to cross he path and blight he prospects in life until coubitant have trace he old associate through many forest and over many plain and have at length find the place of they present abode he know not that all he former hope of become the sachem 's son-in law and succeed to he dignity be already blast by the marriage of oriana to henrich and the association of the latter in the care and the honor of the chieftainship for some year after he abrupt departure from the nausett -- and while he be strive for distinction as well as for revenge among the narragansett -- he have contrived from time to time to obtain information of the proceedings of those whom he have think it politic to leave for a time and as he find that no step be take towards connect the pale-faced stranger with the family of the sachem by marriage after he have attain the age at which indian youth generally take wife and it be even report that tisquantum design to unite he to the widow of lincoya -- he jealous fear be hush to sleep and he still hope to succeed ultimately in he long-cherished plan it be not that he love oriana he heart be incapable of that sentiment which alone be worthy of the name but he have set he mind on obtain she because she be in every way superior to the rest of she young companion and because such a union would aggrandize he in the estimation of the tribe and tend to further he view of become they chief after the failure of he scheme for the utter destruction of the british settlement and all he malicious design against rodolph in particular he personal view with regard to oriana and henrich and he desire to rule in tisquantum 's stead return to he mind with unabated force and he resolve again to join the sachem and endeavor to regain he former influence over he and the consideration in which he have once be hold by he subject-warrior but the removal of the tribe to the north and they frequent journeying from place to place have for a great length of time baffle he search and when at last he be successful and a nausett hunter -- who have be dispatch from paomet on a errand to tisquantum -- meet he and guide he to the encampment it be only to have all he hope dash for ever to the ground and he soul more inflamed with wrath and malice than ever on reach the nausett village coubitant have meet jyanough and be conduct by he to he hut where he learn from he and mailah all that have happen to themselves and they friend since he have lose sight of they and it have require all the red-man 's habitual self - command and habit of dissimulation to enable he to conceal he fury and disappointment he do conceal they however and so effectually that both the cree and he wife be deceive and though that the narrative excite in he no deeper interest than former intimacy would naturally create but this be far from be the case oriana and the chieftainship be lose to he at present it be true but revenge might still be he -- that prize that satan hold out to he slave to tempt they on to further guilt and ruin to win that prize -- and possibly even more than that -- be worth some further effort : and deceit be no great effort to coubitant so he smile in return to henrich 's greet and try to draw oriana into friendly conversation by notice she lovely boy who however receive he advance with a very bad grace he also address tisquantum with all that respectful deference that be expect by a aged indian -- more especially a sachem -- from the younger member of he race and at length he succeed in banish from the mind of almost all he former acquaintance those doubt and suspicion that he conduct have once arouse and he be again admit to the same term of intimacy with the chief and he family that he have enjoy in year long go by still there be one who could not put confidence in coubitant 's friendly manner or believe that the feeling of enmity he once so evidently entertain towards henrich be altogether banish from he mind this be jyanough whose devoted attachment to the white stranger have first lead he to mistrust he rival and who still resolve to watch he movement with jealous care and if possible to guard he friend from any evil that might be design against he for some time he could detect nothing in coubitant 's manner or action that could in any way confirm he suspicion which he do not communicate to any one but mailah for he feel it would be ungenerous to fill the mind of other with the doubt that he could not banish from he own the summer advance and become one of extreme heat the wind stream that flow through the meadow -- on the skirt of which the nausett encampment be form -- gradually decrease from the failure of the spring that supply it until at length its shallow water be reduce to a ripple brook -- so narrow that young lincoya could leap over it and rodolph could carry he little charge across without any risk of wet he foot the long grass and beautiful lily and other wild flower that have grow so luxuriantly along the river 's brink now fade for want of moisture and the fresh verdure of the meadow be change to a dry and dusky yellow day by day the brook dry up and it become necessary for the camp to be remove to some more favored spot where the inhabitant and they cattle could still find a sufficient supply of water for this purpose it be resolve to migrate southwards to the bank of the broad missourus which no drought could sensibly affect and there to remain until the summer heat have pass away and the season for travel have arrive then tisquantum purpose to bend he step once more towards the land of he birth that he might end he day in he native paomet and behold the home of he father before he death to this plan henrich give a glad assent for he surely hope that when he reach a district that border so nearly on the british territory he should be able to obtain some information respect he relative and perhaps even to see they and oriana no longer dreaded return to the dwelling of she childhood for she feel assure -- notwithstanding the occasional misgiving that trouble she anxious heart -- that henrich love she far too well ever to desert she and that he love truth too well ever to take she from she aged father let the temptation be never so great all therefore look forward with satisfaction to the autumn when the long journey towards the east be to commence : but they well know that its accomplishment would occupy several season for the movement of so large a party of every age and sex and the transport of all they baggage across a district of many hundred of mile in extent must necessarily be extremely slow and interrupted by many pause for rest as well as by the heat or the inclemency of the weather coubitant also express he pleasure at the proposed change which would afford occupation and excitement to he restless spirit and which likewise promise he better opportunity for carry out he ultimate scheme than he could hope for in he present tranquil mode of life he constant attention to tisquantum and he assiduous care to consult he every wish and desire have win upon the old man 's feeling and he again regard he rather as the proved friend of he lose tekoa than as the suspect foe of he adopted son henrich he frequently employ he in execute any affair in which he still take a active interest and he soon come to be look upon by the tribe as a sort of coadjutor to they white sachem and the confidential friend of the old chieftain this be just what coubitant desire and he lose no opportunity of strengthen he influence over the nausett warrior and make he presence agreeable and necessary to tisquantum the time appoint for the break up of the encampment draw near and both henrich and oriana feel much regret at the prospect of leave the peaceful home where they have spend so many happy day and where they little ludovico have be bear they comfortable and substantial lodge shaded with the plant that decorate it so profusely and so gaily have be the most permanent dwelling that they have ever know since they childhood : and though they hope eventually to enjoy a still more settled home they could not look on this work of they own labor and taste without affection or leave it for ever without sorrow in order to lessen the fatigue of tisquantum it be arrange at the suggestion of coubitant that he should precede the old sachem and he immediate family and attendant to the place of they intended encampment and should select a suitable situation on the bank of the missourus where he and the nansett warrior could fall timber and prepare temporary hut for they reception this part of the country be familiar to he as he have travel through it and dwelt among its plain and its wood in the day of he wander youth : and he give henrich minute direction as to the route he must take in order to follow he to the river which he say lay about three day ' journey to the southward to the south of the present encampment arise a considerable eminence that be thickly wood to the summit on the side that overlook the nausett village and partially sheltered it from the heat of the summer sun on the other side it be break into steep precipice and its bank be scantily clothe with shrub and grass which the unusual drought have now render dry and wither a wind and narrow path round the foot of this hill be the only road that lead immediately into the plain below and by this path coubitant propose to conduct the tribe in order to avoid a long detour to the west where a more easy road would have be find he describe it to henrich who have often be to the summit of the range of hill that overlook it in pursuit of game but who be ignorant of the propose route into the missourus district and after some conversation on the subject he propose that the young sachem should accompany he the follow morning to the brow of the mountain from whence he could point out to he the road he must take through the broken and undulating ground that lay at the bottom of the hill and the exact direction he must follow after he reach the wide and trackless prairie that intervene between that range and the hill that border the missourus at break of day the march of the tribe be to commence but as several of the nausett be acquaint with the intricate path round the base of the hill it be not necessary for coubitant to lead they that part of they journey in person he therefore propose after point out to henrich all the necessary land-mark which could be so well observe from the summit to find he own way down the steep side of the rugged precipice and rejoin the party in the plain this plan be agree to and coubitant invite oriana to accompany she husband that she also might see and admire the extensive view that be visible from the height and observe the track that she countryman would follow through the valley beneath oriana readily accede to this proposal not only because she love to go by henrich 's side wherever she could be he companion but also because -- in spite of the present friendly term to which coubitant be admit by she father and henrich -- she never feel quite easy when the latter be alone with the dark-browed warrior the morning be clear and bright and before the sun have rise far above the horizon and ere the sultry heat of the day have commence coubitant come to henrich 's lodge and summon he and he wife to they early walk up the mountain with light and active step they take they way through the wood and rodolph follow close behind they -- not now bound and hark with joy but at a measure pace and with he keen bright eye ever fix on coubitant in pass through the scatter village of hut the dwelling of jyanough lay near the path coubitant cease to speak as he and he companion approach it and oriana think he quicken he pace and glance anxiously at the dwelling as if desirous to pass it unobserved by its inmate if such be he wish he be however disappoint for just as the party be leave it behind they they hear the short sharp bark of rodolph at the wigwam door and immediately afterwards the answer voice of jyanough ` rodolph my old fellow be it you ' exclaim the cree as he come forth from he hut and look anxiously at he friend who now to coubitant 's inward vexation stand to greet he ` where be you off to so early ' he inquire of henrich and why be coubitant not lead we warrior on they way ' ` we be but go to the brow of the hill ' reply henrich ` that coubitant may point out to I the path by which we be to follow he he will then join he party in the plain and i will quickly return to accompany you on we project hunting scheme we must add to we stock of provision before we commence we journey ' ' i will ascend the hill with you ' say jyanough and coubitant see that he take a spear in he hand from the door of the wigwam force a smile he observe as if carelessly -- ` it be needless my friend henrich 's eye be so good that he will readily understand all the direction that i shall give he do you doubt the skill of we young sachem to lead he people through the wood and the savanna be as great as he prowess in war and he dexterity in hunting let he show that he be a indian indeed and want no aid in perform a indian 's duty ' ` be it so ' answer jyanough and he lay aside the spear and reenter the hut rather to henrich 's surprise and oriana 's disappointment but much to the satisfaction of coubitant rodolph seem displeased at this change in the apparent intention of he friend and he linger a few moment at the door of the lodge look wistfully at its master but jyanough bid he go and a call from henrich soon bring he again to he former position and he watchful observation of every movement of coubitant the brow of the hill be gain : and so grand and extensive be the view to the south and west that oriana stand for some time contemplate it with a refined pleasure and forget every feeling that could interrupt the pure and lofty enjoyment beneath the precipitous hill on which she stand a plain or wide savanna stretch away for many mile cover with the tall prairie-grass now dry and yellow and wave gracefully in the morning breeze its flat monotony be only break by a few clump of tree and shrub that almost look like distant vessel cross the wide trackless sea but to the west this plain be bound by a range of hill on which the rise sun shed a brilliant glow mark they clear outline against the deep blue sky behind and nearer to the hill from which she look the character of the view be different but not less interesting it seem as if some mighty convulsion of nature have tear away the side of the hill and strew the fragment in huge end break mass in the valley beneath over these crag the hand of nature have spread a partial covering of moss and creep plant and many tree have grow up amongst they strike they root deeply into the crevice and adorn they rough surface by they wave and pendant bough through the rock-strewn valley a narrow and intricate path have be worn by the foot of the wander native and by the constant migration of the herd of wild animal that inhabit the prairie in search of water or of fresher herbage during the parching heat of a indian summer along this difficult path the nausett warrior and they family be now slowly wind they way many of they on horseback follow by they squaw and they child on foot and other less barbarous lead the steed on which the woman and infant be place on the summit of a pile of baggage and carry they own bow and quiver and long and slender spear it be a picturesque scene : and the low chant song of the distant indian -- to which they march keep time -- sound sweetly though mournfully as it rise on the breeze to the elevated position occupy by oriana and she two companion the latter seem fully occupy -- the one in point out and the other in observe the route of the traveler but the eye of henrich be not unobservant of the beauty of the prospect and that of coubitant be restlessly rove to and fro with quick and furtive glance that seem to indicate some secret purpose and to be watch for the moment to effect it some of the nausett in the path below look upward and observe they young sachem and he companion they raise a shout of recognition that cause the rock to echo and also make the brow of coubitant to contract he see that he must delay he purpose until the traveler be out of sight : and this chafe he spirit : but he control it and propose to henrich and oriana to seat themselves on the verge of the precipice and watch the course of the traveler while he go to reconnoiter the steep path by which he design to join they they do so and the hush that grow to the edge of the steep declivity shaded the spot and hide they from the retreat form of coubitant for some time they sit together admire the beauty of the scene before they and watch the long procession in the defile below as it wind ` in indian file ' between the rock and tangled bush that cumber the vale until it be almost out of sight rudolph lay beside they apparently asleep but the slumber of a faithful watch-dog be always light and rodolph be one of the most vigilant of he race why do he now utter a low uneasy moan as if he dream of danger it be so low that if henrich hear it he do not pay any heed to it and continue talk to oriana of they approach journey and of they plan for the future in perfect security but they conversation be suddenly and painfully interrupt a fierce bark from rodolph as he spring on some one in the bush close beside henrich and the grasp of a powerful hand upon he shoulder at the same instant cause the young sachem to glance round he find himself hold to the ground by coubitant who be endeavor to force he over the precipice and would from the suddenness and strength of the attack have undoubtedly succeed but for the timely aid of rodolph who have seize on he left arm and hold it back in he powerful jaw he be however unable to displace the savage or release he master from the perilous situation in which he be place and owe to the manner in which henrich have seat himself on the extreme verge of the rock that overhang the precipice it be out of he power to spring to he foot or offer any effectual resistance the slender but not feeble arm of oriana as she cling frantically to she husband and strove to draw he back to safety be apparently the only human power that now preserve he from instant destruction not a sound be utter by one of the struggle group scarcely a breath be draw -- so intense be the mental emotion and the muscular effort that nerve every fiber during these awfully protracted moment but help be nigh he in whose hand be the life of he creature send aid when aid be so needful a loud cry be hear in the thicket and as coubitant make one more desperate effort to hurl he detested rival from the rock and almost succeed in fling the whole group together into the depths below -- he feel himself encircle by arm as muscular as he own and suddenly drag backwards henrich spring on the firm ground and behold he faithful friend jyanough in fierce conflict with the treacherous coubitant and powerfully assist by rodolph who have loose the murderer 's arm but continue to assail and wind he as he struggle to draw he new antagonist to the brink and seem resolve to have one victim even if he share the same dreadful fate himself henrich fly to the aid of he friend leave oriana motionless and almost breathless on the spot where she have endure such agony of mind and such violent bodily exertion for once she strength and spirit fail she for the trial have be too great and faintness overcome she as she see she husband again approach he deadly and now undisguised foe coubitant see she sink to the ground and with a mighty effort he shake off the grasp of jyanough and dart towards oriana he have think to carry she off a living prize after the murder of she husband but now he only hope be vengeance and she destruction would be vengeance indeed on henrich but love be stronger even than hate the arm of henrich snatch he unconscious wife from the threaten peril and as he bear she away from the scene of conflict jyanough again close on the villain and the deadly struggle be resume it be brief but awful the strength of coubitant be become exhaust -- he grasp begin to loosen and he foot to falter ` spare he ' cry henrich as he see the combatant on the verge of the craggy platform and fear they would fall together on the rock beneath ` spare he and secure he for the judgement of tisquantum ' and again he lay oriana on the ground and rush to save alike he friend and foe ` he die ' exclaimed jyanough ` let he meet the fate he merit ' and spring backwards himself he dash he antagonist over the rock one moment henrich see he fall form and meet the still fiery glance of that matchless eye -- the next he hear the crash of break branch and listen for the last fatal sound of the expire body on the rock below but the depth be too great : a awful stillness follow and though henrich strove to look downward and ascertain the fate of he depart foe the bough and creeper that clothe the perpendicular face of the rock entirely prevent he do so ` he be go ' he exclaim and not in a voice of either joy or triumph for he soul be move within he at the appalling fate of such a man as coubitant and at such a moment ` he be go to he last account : and o what fearful passion be in he heart thank god he do not drag you with he to death my faithful jyanough but tell I ' he add -- as they return together to where oriana lay still unconscious of the dreadful tragedy that have just be enact so near she -- ' tell I my friend how it be that you be so near at hand when danger which i could not repel hung over I and you hand be interpose to save I ' ` my mind misgave I that some treachery be intend ' reply jyanough ` when i see that wily serpent lead you to the mountain 's brow and my suspicion be confirm by he evident reluctance to my join the party rodolph 's expressive countenance tell I too that there be danger to be fear and no red man can excel rodolph in sagacity so i resolve to be at hand if succor should be need and have wait till you be all fairly out of sight and hearing i follow slowly and stealthily and reach the verge of the thicket just in time to hear the warning cry of you noble dog and see that dastardly villain spring upon you from the bush the rest you know : and now you will believe I when i own my conviction that you destruction have be he object since the time i join you camp : and that to accomplish it and obtain possession of oriana he return to tisquantum 's tribe and have wear the mask of friendship for so many month my soul be relieve of a burden by he death and forgive I henrich if i own that i glory in have execute on he the vengeance he deserve and have devote he to the fate he design for you ' henrich could not regret the death however dreadful of one who seem to have be so bent on the destruction of he happiness and he life but the thought of all the guilt that lay on coubitant 's soul unrepented of and unatoned saddened and solemnize he spirit and he only reply to jyanough 's exult word by a kindly pressure of he friend 's hand as they approach oriana she sens bad return and with they a painful sense of danger and of dread and she look anxiously and almost wildly around she as henrich kneel beside she and gently raise she from the ground ` where be he ' she exclaim ` where be that fearful form and those eye of unearthly fire that glare on I just now you be safe my henrich ' she add and as she look up in he face tear of joy and gratitude burst from she large expressive eye and relieved she bursting heart you be safe my henrich : and oh that that dark form of dread and evil might never never cross my path again ' ` fear not oriana ' reply jyanough ` he never more will darken you way through life he have meet the death he design for henrich and let we think of he no more it be time to return to the camp and you husband and i will support you down the hill ' ' i be well quite well now ' cry oriana and she rise from the ground and clung to henrich 's arm as if to assure herself of he presence and safety ' i could walk through the world thus support and thus guard too ' she add as she stroke the head of the joyous rodolph who now bound round she and henrich with all he wonted spirit ' i owe much to my two trusty friend for but for they care and watchfulness what would now have be my dreadful fate let we leave this spot -- so beautiful but now so full of fearful image ' chapter xvii ` hither and thither hither and thither madly they fly whither o whither whither o whither - ` tis but to die fire be behind they : fire be around they : black be the sky horror pursue they anguish have find they : destruction be nigh and where be refuge where be safety now father of mercy none can save but thou ' anon ` what be that distant cloud henrich ' inquire oriana as they ride by tisquantum 's side on the evening of the day of they journey towards the missourus ` it seem like the smoke of a encampment as i see it over the tall wave grass : but it must be too near to be the camp of we people unless indeed they have tarry there wait the arrival of coubitant who never will rejoin they more ' ' i see the cloud you speak of oriana and i have be watch it with some anxiety for several minute it can not be what you suggest for you know you father receive a message from the trusty salon -- next in command to coubitant -- to tell he that they leader not have join the party as he promise a search have be make and he mangled body find at the foot of the rock where it be suppose he must have fall in attempt the sleep descent salon 's messenger further state that have bury the corpse where it lay he have lead the people on and should pursue the path point out by coubitant and hasten to prepare the necessary hut for we reception i dispatch the messenger again with further direction to salon and ere this no doubt the encampment be form on the shore of the great river to which we be journey ` father ' he add as he turn towards tisquantum ` you eye be dim but you sagacity be as keen as ever can you discern that rise smoke and tell we its cause ' the aged sachem have be ride silently and abstractedly along the tall dry grass -- now ripe and shed its seed on every side -- rise frequently above he head for he be mount on a low strong horse and he have not observe the cloud that have attract the attention of the younger traveler he now pause and look earnestly to the south in which direction the smoke appear right before the advance party and from whence a strong and sultry wind be blow as the prairie grass rise and fall in undulate wave the old man obtain a distinct view of the smoke which now seem to have spread considerably to the right and leave and also to be approach towards the traveler the narrow zigzag track of the deer and the buffalo be the only beaten path through the prairie and this could only be travel by two or three horseman abreast the old sachem and henrich and oriana lead the party and jyanough and mailah and young lincoya all well mount ride immediately in the rear the attendant of the two family and a few experienced warrior some on foot and some on horseback follow in the wind path on the halt of the foremost rank the rest ride up and be immediately make aware of the ominous sign which hitherto they have not notice instantly terror be depict in every countenance and the deep low voice of tisquantum sink into every heart as he exclaim ` the prairie be on fire ' ` turn ' cry henrich ` and fly let each horseman take one of those on foot behind and fly for you life cast the baggage on the ground -- stay for nothing but we people 's life ' he be obey : man and woman be all mount and henrich snatch he boy from the arm of the woman who carry he and give the child to oriana take up the terrify attendant on he own powerful steed the wind rise higher : and now the roar of the pursue flame come fearfully on the fugitive grow louder and louder while volume of dense smoke be drive over they head and darken the sky that have so lately shine in all its summer brightness headlong the party dash along the wind path and sometimes the terrify horse leap into the tall grass seek a straighter course or eager to pass by those who have flee before they but this be a vain attempt the wild pea-vine and other creep plant that stretch among the grass offer such impediment to rapid flight as force they again into the path and now the wild inhabitant of the broad savanna come rush on and join the furious flight add difficulty and confusion to the horror of the scene buffalo elk and antelope tear madly through the grass jostle the horse and they rider and leave they far in the rear the scream eagle ride high above among the cloud of smoke and many smaller bird fall suffocate to the ground while all the insect tribe take wing and everything that have life strove to escape the dread pursuer it be a desperate race the strength of the fugitive begin to fail and no refuge no hope seem near alas to some the race be lose the blinding effect of the dense smoke that fill the atmosphere the suffocating smell of the burning mass of vegetable matter and the lurid glare of the red flame that come on so rapidly overpower alike the horse and they rider : while the roaring of the fire -- which sound like a mighty rush cataract -- and the oppressive heat seem to confuse the sens and destroy the vital power of the more feeble and ill-mounted of the fugitive several of the horse fall and they devoted rider sink to the ground unable any longer to sustain the effort for life and henrich have the agony of pass by the wretched victim and leave they to they fate for he know that he have no power to save they many mile be traverse -- and still the unbroken level of the prairie spread out before they -- and still the roaring and destructive flame come bear on the mighty wind behind they a few scattered tree be the only object that break the monotony of the plain and the hill at the foot of which they have travel that morning and where alone they could lock for safety be still at a great distance at length the aged tisquantum 's power of endurance begin to give way the rein almost fall from he hand and in tremble accent he declare he total inability to proceed any further leave I my child ' he exclaim ` to perish here for my strength be go and what matter it where the old tisquantum breathe he last mahneto be here even in this awful hour to receive my spirit and i shall but lose a few short month or year of age and infirmity ' ` never my father ' cry h enrich as he catch the rein of the sachem 's horse and while he still urge he own overloaded steed to fresh exertion endeavor also to support the fail form of he father-in-law ` never will we leave you to die alone in this fiery desert hold on my father hold on yet a little longer till we gain the defile where the flame can not follow as and all will yet be well ' ' i can not my son ' reply the old man ` farewell my dear my noble boy -- farewell my oriana ' and he head sink down upon the neck of he horse he would have fall to the ground but for henrich who now check the panting steed and spring down to he foot in time to receive he in he arm fly oriana ' he exclaim as he wife also draw the bridle of she foam horse by he side ` fly oriana my beloved save you own life and that of we child if possible i will preserve you father -- but if not farewell and god be with you ' one moment oriana urge she horse again to its swiftest pace as if in obedience to she husband 's command -- the next she be at mailah 's side hold she infant in one arm white with the other she guide and control the terrify animal on which she ride ` here mailah ' she cry -- and she clasp the child to she breast and imprint one passionate kiss on its cheek -- ' take my ludovico and save he life and i will return to my husband and father if we follow you well if not be a mother to my child and may the blessing of god be on you ' she almost fling the infant into the extended arm of mailah and then have with difficulty turn she horse and force he to retrace he step she again rejoin those with whom she be resolve to live or die one glance of affectionate reproach she meet from she henrich 's eye : but he do not speak with the assistance of ludovico 's nurse who ride behind he he have just lift tisquantum to he own saddle and be prepare to mount himself and endeavor to support the unconscious old man and again commence the race far life or death but it seem a hopeless attempt -- so utterly helpless be the sachem and so unable to retain he seat quick as think oriana unbound she long twisted girdle of many color and fling it to henrich desire he to bind the fail form of she father to he own he do so : and the nurse have mount behind oriana again the now furious steed start forward all these action have take less time to perform than they have to relate but yet the pursue flame have gain much way and the flight become more desperate and more hazardous again the prostrate form of horse and they rider meet the eye of henrich and oriana but in the thickness of the air and the wild speed at which they be compel to pass it be impossible to distinguish who be the unhappy victim ` heaven be praise ' at length henrich exclaim -- and they be the first word he have utter since the flight have be resume -- ' heaven be praise i see the rock dimly through the cloud of smoke yet a few moment and we shall be safe already the grass around we be shorter and thinner : we be leave the savanna and shall soon reach the barren defile where the flame will find no fuel ' the horse seem to know that safety be near at hand for they bound forward with fresh vigor and quickly join the group of breathless fugitive who have reach the extremity of the prairie have pause to rest from they desperate exertion and to look out for those of they companion who be miss but who they hope would soon overtake they oriana snatch she now smile boy from mailah 's arm and embrace he with a fervency and emotion that show how little she have hope to see he face again but she own happy and grateful feeling be painfully interrupt by she friend 's exclamation of agony -- ` where be my lincoya ' she cry ` do he not follow with you i see he close to I when i pause to take you child : and he be not here o my lincoya my brave my beautiful boy have you perish in the flame with none to help you ' and she break forth into cry and lamentation that wring the heart of oriana she could give she no tiding of the lose youth for she know not whose fainting form she have pass in the narrow shroud path and it be utterly impossible now to go and seek he for the flame have follow hard upon they flight and be still rage over the mass of dry herbage and consuming even the scatter tuft that grow among the stone at the entrance to the ravine so intense be the heat of the glowing surface even after the blaze have die away that it would not be practicable to pass over it for many hour and the party who have reach a place of safety be compel to make arrangement for pass the night where they be not only that they might be ready to seek the remains of they lose friend the next morning but also because they own weary limb and those of they tremble horse refuse to carry they any further all the provision and other baggage which they have carry for they journey have be abandon in the flight end have become a rapid prey to the devour flame but several of the scorch and affright prairie fowl and a few hare -- exhaust with they long race -- be easily secure by the young hunter end afford a supper to the weary company the horse be then turn loose to find fodder for themselves and to drink at the little brook that still trickle among the rock and large fire have be light to scare the wild beast that like we traveler have be drive for refuge to the ravine all lay down to sleep thankful to the deity in whom they respectively trust for they preservation in such imminent peril fervent be the prayer and praise that be offer up that night by the little band of christian among whom henrich always officiate as minister : and even the distressed spirit of mailah be comfort and calm as she join in he word of thanksgiving and in he heartfelt petition that the lose lincoya might yet be restore to he parent or that if he spirit have already pass away from earth it might have be purify by faith and receive into the presence of its god and savior mailah be tranquilize but she grief and anxiety be not remove : and she pass that sad night in sleepless reflection on the dreadful fate of she only child and in sincere endeavor so to realize and apply all the bless truth she have learn from henrich as to derive from they that comfort to she own soul and that perfect resignation to the will of god that she well know they be design to afford to the christian believer and that night of watchfulness do not pass unprofitably to mailah 's spirit but where be lincoya where be the youth whose mother mourn he as dead he be safe amid the top most bough of a lonely tree that now stand scorch and leafless in the midst of the smolder plain several mile from the safe retreat that have be gain by he friend the horse on which he ride that day though fleet and active be young and uninured to long continue and violent exertion and at length its foot get entangled in some creep plant that have grow across the pathway it have fall violently to the ground and throw its young rider among the prairie-grass where he lay stunned and unable to rise until all he companion have pass by then he regain the path and attempt to raise the exhaust creature from the earth : but all in vain its tremble limb be unable to support it and lincoya see that he could no longer look to he favorite steed for the safety of he own life and must abandon it to perish in the flame but the boy be a indian and accustomed to indian difficulty and indian expedient he glance rapidly around for some means of preservation and see a tree of some magnitude and at no great distance he resolve to try to reach it ere the come fire have seize on the surround herbage and seek for a refuge in its summit with much difficulty he force he way through the tall rank grass that wave above he head and the wild vine that be entangled with it in every direction and he reach the foot of the tree just as the flame be begin to scorch its outmost branch he spring upward and climb with the agility of a squirrel he be soon in the highest fork of the tree and enable to look down in security on the devastating fire beneath he all around be one wide sea of ruddy flame that shoot up in fork and wave tongue high amid the heavy cloud of smoke happily for lincoya the herbage beneath he tree of refuge grow thin and scanty and do not afford much food for the devour element otherwise it must have consume he retreat and suffocate he even in its topmost bough as it be the lower branch only be destroy and the boy be able to endure the heat and smoke until the roar flame have pass beneath he and he watch they drive onward in the wake of he fly friend to follow he companion that night be hopeless for how could he traverse that red-hot plain he therefore settle himself firmly among the shelter branch to one of which he bind himself with he belt of deer skin and prepare to pass the night in that position as he have pass many similar one when he have be out on hunting expedition with he father-in-law jyanough long he gaze on the strange aspect of the wide savanna as it glow in the darkness of night with a lurid and fearful glare that only make the gloom more visible but weariness and exhaustion at length overcome he and he fall asleep and do not awake until the sun be high in the heaven the prospect around he be change but the plain look even more dreary and desolate than it appear while the fire be at work on its clothing of grass now all be lay low and smoking ash alone cover the nakedness of the savanna lincoya gaze earnestly in every direction that he might make sure of the route he must follow in order to rejoin he friend and he attention be attract by the figure of two man approach towards the tree in which he sit and apparently engage d in earnest conversation for a moment he hope lead he to believe that they be jyanough and henrich who have return probably in search of he and he be about to hail they with a loud and joyful cry but the caution so early instil into the mind of a indian restrain he : and well it be for he that he have not thus give vent to he feeling the man draw nearer and he see to he amazement that they be coubitant -- he whose death and burial have be so confidently report and salon -- the trusty salon -- to whom the conduct of the tribe have be depute after the suppose death of the appoint leader they come beneath the tree and seat themselves at its foot proceed to refresh themselves with food and water that look tempting to the eye of the fasting and parched lincoya as he gaze noiselessly and attentively at they proceedings and listen to they discourse ` at last i have be successful salon ' say coubitant to he companion ` at last i may rejoice in the destruction of those i hate with so bitter a hatred those burnt and broken weapon be henrich 's end this ornament belong to oriana ' as he say this he display in he hand

against you claim ' ` you be right nay faithful salon ' answer coubitant with a sign of warn approbation of the forethought of he accomplice ` let we lose no time in cross the plain for doubtless the survivor of this glorious fire will be early on they march and it would not do for they to overtake we in the midst of the ruin we have work we will set all inquiry to rest and then we will report to

track they proceed at a rapid pace but it be some time ere lincoya venture to descend from he hiding-place as he fear be observe on the level plain if either of those ruthless villain should east a glance behind they at length they retreat form appear to he like speck in the distance and he come down from he watch-tower and flee as fast as he active young limb could carry he towards the spot where he hope to rejoin he friend he have not very long continue he flight when he perceive several person on horseback approach towards he and soon he find himself in the arm of he joyful mother and be affectionately greet by jyanough and henrich who with several other have come out to look if any of they miss companion be still within reach of human aid all but lincoya have perish the fire and the smoke have not only destroy they life but have so blacken and disfigure they that it be impossible to identify a single individual a grave be dig in the yet warm earth and all the victim be bury sufficiently deep to preserve they remains from the ravages of wild beast and then the party return in all haste to those who anxiously await they at they place of refuge on the way lincoya related to he father-in-law and henrich the whole of the conversation which he have hear between coubitant and salon while he be in he safe retreat and they surprise at find that the former have survive he desperate fall from the brow of the precipice and still live to plan and work out scheme of cruelty and malice be only equal by they indignation at thus discover the treachery and deceit of salon they have hitherto put the most entire confidence in the fidelity of this man : and if they have still entertain any doubt or suspicion as to the honesty of coubitant 's intention they have rely on salon to discover he plan and prevent any mischief be accomplish the whole story be tell to tisquantum and he counsel be ask as to the best mode of now counteract the further scheme of the traitor and escape the snare which they find be yet to be lay for they destruction it would be impossible for they to reach the camp on the bank of the missourus by the path which coubitant have point out without pass through the defile where the villain and he confederate now propose to lie in wait for they and where in spite of they superior number many of they party would probably be wound by the arrow and dart of they hidden foe without have any opportunity of defend themselves that route be therefore abandon but the old sachem remember have traverse this part of the continent many year ago and he know of a track to the west by which the mountain that skirt the course of the missourus might be avoid and the river reach at a considerable distance above the place at which the encampment be appoint to be form this road be indeed much longer than that across the prairie and would occupy several day to traverse so that it be doubtful whether coubitant would wait so long in he lurking-place or whether he would conclude that the chief be dead and return to take the command of the tribe nevertheless no other course be open and with as little delay as possible the journey be commence a scanty supply of food be obtain by the bow and arrow of the hunter and water be occasionally meet with in the small rivulet that flow from the hill and wander on until they eventually lose themselves in the broad missourus inure to privation and to toilsome journey the indian party heed they not but cheerfully proceed on they way until at length they behold the wigwam of they tribe standing on a green meadow near the river 's side they hasten on and be receive with joyful acclamation by the inhabitant who have almost despaired of ever see they again the conflagration of the prairie be know to they but almost all of they be ignorant of the true cause of the awful calamity and attribute it entirely to accident nor be any suspicion arouse in they mind by the conduct of coubitant and salon who have pretend the greatest alarm and anxiety for the fate of the chief and they party and have set out as soon as it be possible to traverse the savanna in the hope as they declare of render assistance to any of the sachem 's company who might have survive the catastrophe much to the relief of all the party they find that neither coubitant nor he accomplice have yet return to the camp and they prolonged absence be become a source of uneasiness to the rest of the tribe who be prepare to send out a party of man to search for they the very day that henrich lead he detachment into the village it be agree by the sachem and jyanough that they would not communicate to the rest of they people all they have discover of the treachery of coubitant and salon as they know not yet how many of the warrior might have be induce to join in the conspiracy and connive at they crime they therefore account for have travel by so circuitous a route on the plea of they inability to cross the prairie without any supply of either provision or water and they command the party who be about to search for coubitant and salon to set out immediately and to use every possible exertion to find they and bring they in safety to the camp they could have tell they messenger exactly where the villain be to be find but that would have betray a greater knowledge of they movement than it would have be prudent to disclose and they only direct the man to shout aloud every now and then as they traverse the mountain pass that the lose traveler might know of they approach and also to carry with they a supply of food sufficient to last several day the messenger depart : and then jyanough set himself to work with all a indian 's sagacity to find out the extent to which the conspiracy have be carry among the warrior of the tribe he succeed in convict four man of the design to elevate coubitant to the chieftainship and of a knowledge and participation in he last desperate scheme for the destruction of the sachem and all he family summary justice be therefore execute on the culprit who scorn to deny they crime when once they be charge with they and submit to the sentence of they chief with a fortitude that almost seem to expiate they offence the most daring of the four openly exult in he rebellious project and boast of he long-concealed hatred towards the pale-faced stranger who presume to exercise authority over the free red man and tisquantum deem it politic to inflict on he a capital punishment he be therefore direct to kneel down before he which he do with the greatest composure and the aged chief then draw he long sharp knife and with a steady hand and unflinching eye plunge it into the heart of the criminal he expire without a groan or a struggle and then the other three wretch be lead up together and place in the same humble posture before the offended sachem at henrich 's request the capital sentence be remit but one of agony and shame be inflict in its stead -- one that be commonly reserve for the punishment of repeat case of theft the sachem 's knife again be lift and with a dexterous movement of he hand he slit the nose of each of the culprit from top to bottom and dismiss they to carry for life the mark of they disgrace no cry be utter by any one of the victim nor the slightest resistance offer to they venerable judge and executioner for such cowardice would in the estimation of the indian have be far more contemptible than the crime of which they have be convict silently they withdraw nor do they even by the expression of they countenance seem to question the justice of they chastisement the next step to be pursue be to prepare for secure coubitant and salon the moment they should make they appearance in the camp and before they could be make aware of the discovery at they treason for this purpose very effectual step be take and jyanough -- the faithful and energetic jyanough -- take the command of the band of trusty warrior who be appoint to seize the leader of the conspiracy and to bring they into the presence of the chief that evening soon after sunset the search party return and no sooner do jyanough perceive from the spot where he have post he man among the rock and bush that command the pathway that coubitant and he fellow-criminal be with they than he give the concerted signal and rush upon they in a instant they be seize by the arm and drag forcibly forward to the village they ask no question of they captor -- for conscience tell they that they sin have find they out and that they be about to expiate they crime

bank of the river which in that part be rather high and precipitous the shades of evening be deepen and the dark visage of coubitant look darker than ever while the lurid light of he deep-set eye seem to glow with even unwonted luster from beneath he shaggy and overhang brow the greatest part of the tribe be gather together in that place and stand silently around to view the criminal and to witness they expect fate for now all be acquaint with they guilt and all who be assemble here be indignant at they treachery against they venerable and beloved sachem and they scarcely less respected white chieftain the voice of tisquantum break the ominous silence ` coubitant ' he solemnly begin ` you have deceive you chief you have speak to he word of peace when death be in you heart be it not so ' '

the wild tenant of the wood be free care and anxiety have indeed continue to be the portion of the pilgrim father and they family though mingle with many blessing they number have considerably increase during the year that elapse since last we take a view of they condition and they town bad assume a much more comfortable and impose appearance many trading vessel have also visit the rise colony from the mother-country and have bring out to the settler useful supplies of clothing and other article of great value among these none be more acceptable to the emigrant than the first specimen of horn cattle consist of three cow and a bull that reach the settlement about the third year after its establishment they be hail with universal joy by all the inhabitant of new plymouth who seem to feel as if the presence of such old accustomed object bring back to they a something of home that they have never feel before in the land of they exile these precious cattle be a common possession of the whole colony and be not divide until the year 1627 when they number have greatly increase and when a regular division of the house and land also take place the trade of the colony have likewise be considerably augment both with the indian and with the english whose fishing vessel frequent the coast and be the means of they carry on a constant intercourse and traffic with they friend at home one of these vessel bring out to the emigrant the sad intelligence of the death of they beloved pastor john robinson -- he who have be honor and respect by every puritan community whether in europe or america and for whose arrival the pilgrim have look with anxious hope ever since the day of they sorrowful parting in holland ` surely ' -- as a friend of bradford 's write to he from leyden -- we pastor would never have go from hence if prayer tear or means of aid could have save he ' the consternation of the settler be great indeed year after year they have go on expect and wait for he come to resume he official duty among they and therefore they have never take any measure to provide themselves with regular pastor who might preach the gospel to they three time every lord 's day accord to they custom in europe and also administer to they the sacrament which previous to they exile all the grown-up member of the community have habitually receive every Sunday the death of they spiritual leader and counselor have destroy all they hope of be again unite to he on earth and the blow fall heavily on all and cast a gloom over the settlement that be not soon dispersed but still the pilgrim do not immediately proceed to choose another minister the belief that the divine service could receive no part of its sanctity from either time place or person but only from the holy spirit of god which hallow it -- be then as it be now a lead feature of the independent and presbyterian church of america and therefore the puritan of new plymouth do not feel it a necessity -- although they deem it a _ privilege _ -- to enjoy the spiritual ministration of ordain clergyman hitherto the venerable brewster with the occasional aid of bradford winslow and a few other distinguish for piety and eloquence have deliver the customary address and prayer and have perform the rite of baptism at length in the year 1628 allerton the assistant of bradford after he have be on a mission to england bring back with he a young preacher of the name of roger who very shortly give such evident sign of insanity that the settler be oblige to send he back to he native land at a considerable expense and trouble in the meantime the number of settler on other part of the coast of new england have augment to a great extent and in salem alone there be four minister who have come out with the english emigrant of whom only two could find adequate employment one of the other therefore name ralph smith who be a man of much piety and judge orthodox by the puritan go to plymouth and offer himself as pastor to the inhabitant he be choose by the people to be they spiritual leader and become the first regularly-appointed preacher who officiate among these the earliest settler in new england two or three small vessel be about this time build by the man of plymouth for they own use and prove of great service to they as they connection with other colony of european on the american coast become more extensive and profitable a friendly intercourse with the dutch settler at the mouth of the great river hudson have also lately be establish to the great satisfaction of the plymouther and to the mutual advantage and comfort of both party it be commence by the man of holland soon after they formal settlement near the hudson where they erect a village and a fortress call fort amsterdam from thence they address a courteous letter to they old connection the english exile from leyden and invite they to a occasional barter of they respective goods and production and also offer they they service in any other way that could be useful governor bradford -- who still by annual election retain he important office -- return a equally friendly reply to these overture : and at the same time tender he own and he people 's grateful acknowledgement of all the kindness and hospitality that they have receive during they residence in holland in year go by the following year they be surprise and gratify by a visit from de brazier the secretary of the dutch colony who anchor at manomet a place twenty mile to the south of new plymouth and from thence send to request the pilgrim to send a boat for he he ship be well stock with such wares as be likely to be acceptable to the english and accord to the custom of the time he be attend by several gaily dress trumpeter and a numerous retinue of servant the new pinnace which have recently be build at manomet be immediately dispatch for the welcome visitor and he be hospitably entertain by he new friend for three day after which the governor attend by rodolph and some other return with he to he vessel to make they purchase and to give in exchange for they european goods such fur and skin and tobacco as they have be able to collect in they general storehouse on ` the bury hill ' from this period a active trade be carry on between the two settlement which prove highly advantageous to both -- the dutch supply the man of plymouth with sugar linen and other stuff in return for they skin timber and tobacco during all this time a almost perfect peace be maintain with the neighbor indian tribe and the friendship that have so early be establish between the english settler and the wampanoge become more confirm and strengthen all external matter now wear a far more prosperous aspect than they have hitherto do and the pilgrim feel that they have both the means and the leisure to add to the comfort of they social and domestic life some year previously a small portion of land have be assign to each family for its own particular use : but the possession of this land have not be make hereditary and although the fact of its be appropriate to one household have considerably increase the zeal and industry of the cultivator yet they still desire that feeling of inalienable property which so greatly add to the value of every possession to gratify this natural desire the governor and he council have deem it advisable to depart so far from the term of the original treaty as to allot to each colonist a acre of land as near the town as possible in order that if any danger threaten they might be able to unite speedily for the general defense this arrangement give much satisfaction to the settler but in the year 1627 they be place in a still more comfortable and independent position they be by they charter lord of all the neighboring land for a circle of more than one hundred mile that portion of they territory therefore which be most contiguous to the town be divide into portion of twenty acre five long on the side next the coast and four broad and to each citizen one of these portion be assign with the liberty of purchase another for he wife and also one for every child who reside with he to every six of these piece be allot a cow two goat and a few pig so that each settler become possess of a little farm of he own and a small herd of cattle to stock it with : and peace and plenty at length seem to smile on the hardy and long - endure settler meanwhile the colony of massachusett which have be found in the year 1624 increase rapidly it be first plant at nantasket a desert village of the indian at the entrance of the bay of massachusett where the plymouth settler have previously erect a few house for the convenience of carry on they trade with the neighbor tribe another settlement have be form two year later at naumkeak a tongue of land of remarkable fertility where also a desert indian village be find which form the commencement of the town afterwards call salem and which have become -- at the period we have now arrive at in we story -- a place of some importance it be found by a man of much zeal end enthusiasm of the name of endicott who be one of the original possessor of the patent grant to several gentleman of dorsetshire for the land in massachusett bay extend from the merrimak to the charle river from north to south but stretch to a indefinite distance westward even over the unexplored region between the boisterous atlantic and the ` silent sea ' as the pacific have be very aptly and beautifully designate endicott have be invest by the society to which he belong in england with the government of the whole district of massachusett and he soon find himself call on to exercise he authority for the suppression of the disturbance excite by the settler of quincy this place be inhabit by a set of low and immoral man one of whom name thoma morton have come over in the wild and dissolute train send out by weston several year previously he be a man of some talent but of very contemptible character : and have attach himself to the retinue of captain wollaston and he companion who first settle at quincy and give it the name of mount wollaston he afterwards with he friend remove to virginia leave some of he servant and a overseer to manage the plantation during he absence but no sooner be morton relieved of the presence of those who have hitherto keep he in some restraint than he rouse the servant to a complete mutiny which end in they drive the overseer from the plantation and indulge in every kind of excess they even have the boldness and the dishonesty to sell the land which have be leave in they charge by the lawful possessor to the indian and to obtain fresh estate which they claim as they own and have thus establish a sort of lawless independence they pass they time in drinking and wild revelry on the first of may they erect a may-pole in old-english fashion but not contented with celebrate that day of spring-time and flower with innocent pastime they hang the pole with verse of a immoral and impious character and invite the ignorant heathen to share in they festivity they abandon themselves to drunkenness and profligacy the horror and indignation of the severe puritan of new plymouth at this outbreak of licentiousness be great indeed in they eye almost every amusement be look upon as a sin and the most innocent village dance round a maypole be regard as nearly ally to the heathenish game in honor of the goddess flora the conduct therefore of the disorderly settler of quincy fill they with shame and grief and they feel humble as well as indignant when they reflect on the discredit which such proceedings must necessarily bring on the christian profession and the british name nor be this all : it be not merely discredit that they have to fear the insane and profligate conduct of morton threaten to bring on they eventually as well as on all the emigrant evil of a more personal kind for when morton and he wild associate find they means of self-gratification again run short they have the folly to part with arm and ammunition to the indian and to teach they how to use they thus give they the power of not only resist the authority of the english but also of effectually attack they whenever any subject of dispute should arise between they and the pale-faced invader most joyfully the native take advantage of this impolitic weakness and so eagerly do they purchase the coveted firearm of they rival that morton send to england for a fresh supply of the dangerous merchandise such conduct be quite sufficient to arouse the fear and the vigilance of every other colony of new england and the chief inhabitant of the various plantation agree to request the interference of they brethren of new plymouth as be the oldest and most powerful settlement in order to bring the offender to they sens bradford willingly listen to they petition for he desire nothing more earnestly than to have a opportunity of openly manifest to he countryman and to the indian how greatly oppose he and he people be to the proceedings of morton 's gang he have also a very sufficient pretext for such interference as he could bring forward the positive command of he sovereign that no arm of any kind should be give or sell to the native he resolve however before he have recourse to harsher measure to try and bring morton and he wild crew to a better mode of life by friendly and persuasive message but these only excite the contempt and derision of the ruffian and the doughty warrior mile standish be therefore dispatch with a band of he veteran follower to seize on the desperado they come upon they when they be in the midst of they drunken revelry and after a fierce struggle succeed in make they all prisoner and convey they safely to plymouth from thence morton be send by the first opportunity to england to be try by the high council who however do not take any active measure against he or he follower many of the latter escape and continue they disorderly life until they be check by the vigorous proceedings of endicott who severely reprimand they and cut down the may-pole which have give rise to so much offence and he name the hill on which the notorious plantation be situate ` mount dagon ' in memory of the profane doings of its inhabitant the coast of massachusett bay be now stud with plantation and with rise town and village the stream of emigration continue to increase and the wealth and prosperity of the colony in general keep pace with the addition to they number and with they extend trade with foreign colony and with the mother-country boston have become a place of some note and seem to be regard as the seat of commerce for the massachusett district as well as the center of the civil government most of the family of the neighbor plantation especially of charlestown remove to boston and ere long it be deem expedient to find a regular church there and the building of a house of god be commence winthrop the governor also exert himself in the erection of a fortress to repel the dreaded attack of the indian but he soon perceive that this be a needless precaution for all the neighbor tribe readily offer they friendship and even they submission and as the strength of the colony daily increase he find that he have less and less to fear from the indian the sagamore of sawgus in the vicinity of boston remain the steady friend of the english until he death and chickatabot sachem of neponset one of the neighbor chief of the massachusett frequently visit the rise town of boston on one of these occasion he excite the mirth of the governor and he suite by request to be allow to purchase he fall-dress coat to which he have take a great fancy to this strange and original request the governor courteously reply that it be not the custom of the english sagamore to dispose of they raiment in that manner but he console the disappointed chieftain by send for he tailor and order he to measure chickatabot for a full suit this treasure the sachem carry away with he three day afterwards to astonish the eye of he subject in he native wild and he loyalty towards the english be greatly strengthen by so handsome and judicious a present cundincus also the chief of the powerful and much dreaded narragansett send he son with a friendly greet to the new settler of boston and in the following year he nephew and co-ruler miantonomo come on a visit to the governor he be for some day a inmate of winthrop 's house and it be record that he not only conduct himself with the greatest decorum but that be also sit patiently to listen to a sermon of a hour and a half 's duration of which of course he scarcely comprehend one word governor winthrop follow the good example that have already be set by both carver and bradford at new plymouth in regard to all dealings with the native he always maintain they rights with the most strict and impartial justice and if any englishman commit a injury against the property of a indian he compel he to replace it -- in some case even to twice the value of the article in question the new settler have always be on very friendly term with the elder colony of plymouth and visit be frequently exchange between the governor and other of the inhabitant which though perform with much difficulty and even danger be a source of mutual pleasure to the two band of british emigrant if the man of plymouth regard with some feeling of jealous anxiety the grow power and greatness of they rival it be but natural nevertheless no difference of any importance arise between the colony on the subject of civil superiority it be on spiritual matter that they sometimes disagree and on these point the plymouther watch the newcomer with suspicious sensitiveness and resolve to maintain they dearly - purchase base rights to religious freedom against any pretension that might be make by the church of boston this latter community be frequently subject to division and dispute on those point of faith and discipline that each party regard as all-important but on the carry out of which they could not agree and a certain spirit of intolerance have already begin to show itself among they which in later time ripen into actual cruelty and persecution the first instance of any display of this unchristian spirit with which we narrative be concern be the treatment of a young clergyman name roger william who come over to new england several year after the emigration of the pilgrim father when the renew oppression of the puritan minister by the english bishop drive many of they number to seek a refuge in america in the same year also arrive john elliott a man whose name be deservedly remembered and respect in new england as stand conspicuous for zeal and virtue so great and so successful be he labor among the native heathen and so eminent be he piety and he self-denying charity

of boston that no time will ever efface this dreadful event occur about forty year after that period of which we be now treat -rrb- roger william be a man comparatively unknown in he own country but he be destine to exercise considerable influence in the land of he adoption by he peculiar view of religious freedom which go far beyond those of the generality of he fellow puritan he desire to extend to other that liberty of conscience which he claim as he own privilege and for the attainment of which he have become a wanderer and a exile but he soon find that many of he countryman have forget in america the principle of spiritual freedom for which they have so nobly contend in england and be ready to employ against those who differ from they the same ` carnal weapon ' that have already drive they from they mother-country he suffering be indeed light in comparison of those which be afterwards inflict on the miserable quaker by the government of massachusett but still they be hard for flesh and blood to bear and galling to a free spirit to receive from those who boast of they own love of freedom roger william be not more than thirty-two year of age when he arrive in new england he have boldly separated himself from all communion with the high church of he native country and before he would attach himself to the church of boston he demand from its member a similar declaration of independence the father of the colony be however by no means prepare to take so decide a step which would lay they open to the attack of the english hierarchy and although a few year afterwards when they could do it with less risk of punishment they abjure all connection with the church of england yet they dare not at present give any countenance to such individual boldness as that which william have manifest he uncompromising principle be however in unison with those of the church of salem and he be invite by that community to be they teacher as a assistant to they pastor skelton whose health be then decline the ruler of boston be extremely indignant at this act of independence on the part of the salemer and they address to they a remonstrance desire they to take no such step without the concurrence of the government of the state of massachusett but the man of salem do not withdraw they invitation which be accept by roger william and in a short time he piety he eloquence and the kind courtesy of he manners gain for he the esteem and affection of the whole community he be not however permit to remain in peace in he new home the suspicion and ill-will of the boston government follow he to salem and so greatly embittered he life and interrupt he labor that he find it expedient to withdraw to plymouth where he find employment as assistant to the regular pastor ralph smith he preaching cause great excitement in new plymouth from the fervor of he eloquence and the freedom of he opinion which arouse the sympathy of many of the pilgrim father governor bradford be much interested by the young and enthusiastic minister and he describe he in he journal as ' a man full of the fear of god and of zeal but very unsettled in judgement ' certainly he opinion be peculiar and he spirit bold and defy to a degree that rather shock and astonish the sober severe and exclusive man of plymouth but he sincere piety cause he to be respect even by those who shrink from go such length as he do and he engaging manners win the affection of all who be admit to he intimacy one cause of the anger of the ruler of boston against this energetic young man be a essay which he write and address to the governor of plymouth in which he state he conviction that ` the king of england have no right whatever to give away these land on which they have settle but that they belong exclusively to the native and must be buy in by auction from they ' no one who entertain a sense of justice will now be dispose to object to this opinion but it give great offence to the government of boston and he be summon before the general court to answer to governor winthrop for have promulgate such notion he do not however attempt to defend they but good-humoredly declare that they be privately address to bradford who with tin chief man of plymouth agree with he in all the material point of he essay and he offend to burn it if it have give offence at boston the subject be then drop and william return to plymouth where he continue to reside for a considerable time during that period he not only gain many friend among the inhabitant but he also by a constant intercourse with the wampanoge and other neighbor tribe obtain a considerable knowledge of they language and manners and secure they veneration and love this as we shall have occasion to observe proved afterwards of the greatest advantage to he but he own restless spirit be not satisfy with quietly discharge the duty of he office and enjoy the society of he own countryman and they indian ally again he draw upon himself the wrath of the boston church by openly state he conviction that no civil government have a right to punish any individual for a breach of the sabbath or for any offence against either of the four commandment or the first table he maintain that these point should be leave to the conscience alone or in the case of those who have agree to a church covenant to the authority of the church the civil magistrate he consider as only empower to punish such violation of the law as interfere with the public peace this unheard-of heresy against the principle by which the bostoner be govern be receive with amazement and indignation : and although they could not take any immediate measure to testify they displeasure and to punish the offender yet he thenceforth become the object of hatred and suspicion to the ruler and they only wait for a fitting opportunity of openly manifest it william be aware of the feeling entertain towards he by the government of massachusett but he be not thereby deter from express he opinion in new plymouth and so great be he attachment to the people of salem who have first afford he a home that he would again have venture thither have he not be detain by he new friend they be both numerous and sincere : and among they none be more attach to he than the maitland family who agree with he in most of he religious and political opinion and value he society on account of he unaffected piety and the various power and accomplishment of he mind possibly it be the attraction that roger william find in this family that cause he so long to turn a deaf ear to the repeat solicitation of he old friend at salem that he would again take up he abode among they certainly it be not fear of the ruler of boston that keep he undaunted spirit in a district over which they have no authority neither be it altogether the harmony that subsist between he view and those of the hospitable plymouther on many point they agree but not on all and those who differ from he fear that he continued residence among they might excite a party spirit and mar that peace which have hitherto reign in they community still roger william do

not satisfy the critical eye of a artist it be edith 's character which look out from she clear hazel eye and win the interest and the affection of all who know she gentle and affectionate in disposition but at the same time firm enduring and fall of energy she combine the characteristic quality of both she parent and add to they a originality all she own she education in the common acceptation of the term have necessarily be both desultory and imperfect and yet under its influence the mind and character of edith have strengthen and mature in no common degree the very circumstance by which she be surround have educate she and sorrow -- deep abide sorrow for the loss of both she much-loved brother -- have teach she to look on life in a different point of view and with different expectation from those with which it be usually regard by the young she mother have watch she opening mind and disposition with much care and anxiety : but she have not seek to check its interesting peculiarity or to control the wild exuberance of thought and feeling that be occasionally manifest by she intelligent and engaging child as she grow older she become more and more the

thus a perfect confidence be establish and ever subsist between the mother and daughter and the natural thoughtfulness of spirit and energy of purpose that belong to edith be unchecked and she be allow to possess a individuality of character that be unhappily too often repress and destroy in these present day of high civilization and uniformity of education the courteous manners which both helen and she husband have acquire in early life -- when they dwell in comparative affluence in england -- be inherit by they daughter in full measure and she whole manner and conduct be mark by a refinement and elegance that seem little in keep with the life of extreme simplicity and even of hardship that she have experience from she early childhood while she brother be spare to she she be they constant companion and playfellow and except when she mother require she attendance either as she pupil or she assistant in domestic occupation she spend the greatest part of the day in ramble with they on the sea-shore or through the adjacent wood or else in the active and tasteful cultivation of they garden and when successive calamity deprive she of these cherish object of she early

erect and the plant that he and ludovico have transplant from the forest to cover its trellised wall and to decorate the garden that surround it many of these be again remove and plant on fingal 's

indulge she own high aspiration and none but helen be the confidant of any of she thought and imagining many of they she keep within she own breast for she feel that it would distress she mother to know how little charm remain to she in life and how often she look up into the blue depths of heaven and wish that she have ` the wing of a dive and could flee away ' from this cold world ` and be at rest ' where henrich and ludovico dwelt and yet edith be not unhappy as she grow up and become a more equal and rational companion to she parent the care and business of life necessarily occupy more of she time and thought and give she less leisure for solitary meditation and she daily increase sense of the duty and responsibility of a christian lead she to regard as selfishness that indulgence of she own thought and feeling in which she have so much delighted she be therefore cheerful and even gay at home but she desire no pleasure beyond those that she home afford and that be perfectly consistent with the self deny view and principle of she puritan fellow-countryman in all the doctrine of she sect edith be thoroughly well-informed and to all those that be really scriptural she give a sincere and heart-felt assent but the stern severity of puritan principle and puritan bigotry find no response in she gentle nature and the narrow - mind intolerance of the boston church arouse both she contempt and indignation she be therefore quite prepared to regard with interest and favor the free-minded young minister who have make himself obnoxious to they law end custom and have seek a refuge among the more liberal and kindly pilgrim of new plymouth the acquaintance of roger william be soon make by the maitland and once begin it quickly ripen into intimacy and friendship in rodolph he find a sound and able adviser in helen a kind friend and a well-informed companion but in edith he find a kindred spirit to he own -- one who could understand and sympathize in he yearning for freedom of thought and action and in he strong sense of the injustice of he oppressor in all they taste and pursuit they be likewise as well agree as in they religious and social opinion edith 's passionate love of natural beauty be fully share by the young refugee and many a hour pass swiftly away while he instruct he quick and willing scholar in the mystery of sketch in which pleasant art he be himself a proficient edith love music also and frequently accompany she own rich voice with the simple note of the mandolin while she sing the old song of she fatherland hitherto she mother have be she only instructor in this most refined and refining of all human pleasure but now she find a able and very ready teacher in roger william : and it be a matter of astonishment to she father when he observe the rapid progress she make both in the science and the practice of music from the time the interesting stranger undertake to give she lesson he deep manly voice harmonize perfectly with she sweet tone and they often bring tear to the eye of helen and call forth a sigh from the breast of rodolph as they sing together some ancient english ballad or unite they voice in the chant and anthem that be dear to the heart of the exile and recall day of youth and happiness long pass away and never to return edith 's bower be the usual scene of these domestic concert and there the long sweet summer evening glide away in happiness that the ` queen of that bower ' -- as henrich have name she -- have never know since the last evening that she spend there with she brother she begin to wonder why she have hitherto associate none but melancholy idea with the lovely spot and to find that it be possible to feel even gay and light-hearted while surround by henrich 's flower and look on fingal 's grave how strange it seem -- and yet how pleasant a new existence seem opening before edith 's soul and life no longer appear a dreary pilgrimage which duty alone could render interesting the power of she mind also receive a fresh impulse from the society of the cultivate englishman and be draw out in a manner as agreeable as it be new roger have bring from he native land a collection of book which though small in number seem to edith a perfect library and all be offer for she perusal several of they be of course on controversial and doctrinal subject and these she be able to understand and to appreciate : but among these graver and more abstruse treatise be some of a more attractive nature -- some volume of foreign travel and ancient legend and heart-stirring poetry in which the soul of edith revel as in a garden of new and fragrant flower it be a fresh and a very rich enjoyment to one who have know so few literary pleasure to pore over these volume and find she own vivid thought and wild imagining set before she in all the captivating color of poetry and fiction or to follow the wanderings of traveler through the civilized and enlighten country of the old continent and learn from book those manners and custom of refined life which in all human probability it would never be she lot to witness but this enjoyment be more than double when roger take the book and -- as he often do -- read to she and she mother while they sit at they work in edith 's bower in the heat of the day and if the younger listener do occasionally pause in she occupation and forget to ply she needle while she look up at the fine expressive countenance of the reader she may be pardon for the voice and the expression be in such perfect unison that the one add greatly to the effect of the other perhaps these day of peaceful intercourse and grow but unacknowledged affection be among the happiest of edith 's checkered life : certain it be that in after day of trial and difficulty she look back upon they as on some green and sunny spot in the varied field of memory but they could not last for ever day and week pass by and edith be too happy in the present to occupy herself much about the future but she parent think of it for she and roger thought of it for she and for himself she graceful manners and appearance have attract he on he first acquaintance with she and the favorable impression have be strengthen from day to day as he acquire a more intimate knowledge of she thoughtful character and amiable temper : and it be not long ere he feel that he future happiness in life depend on she return those sentiment with which she have inspire he have he be possess of much vanity he would not long have entertain any doubt on this interesting point for edith be too open and ingenuous and too little in the habit of disguise she feeling to pretend a indifference that she heart soon deny but the very admiration and respect with which she inspire roger prevent he from ` lay the flattering unction to he soul ' and cause he for some time to suppose that the very evident pleasure she feel in he society arise from the solitary life she have hitherto lead and the natural enjoyment of a intelligent mind in converse with one who could enter into she feeling and taste and impart some fresh idea to give food to she thought and imagination helen however be not under this misconception with regard to she daughter 's feeling and she feel much anxiety as to the result of she acquaintance with the young clergyman the remarkable transparency of edith 's character render it easy for a parent 's eye to discover the deep impression that roger 's fascinating manners and rare accomplishment have make both on she fancy and she heart and it be equally easy to perceive that he affection be entirely gain and that he be not a man to draw back in this or any other pursuit in which he feeling be deeply engage there be a simple earnestness of manner in every thing that he say or do that irresistibly win both confidence and love and helen and she husband entertain not the slightest doubt of the sincerity of he attachment to they child or of he full intention to offer he hand to she as soon as he could feel any certainty of its be accept neither do they doubt he power to make she happy for it be evident that they taste and disposition be admirably suit and they character mark to a great degree by the same peculiarity but it be these very peculiarity in which they so well agree and which each would probably strengthen and confirm in the other that give rise to the anxious thought that dwell in helen 's mind and which she communicate to rudolph roger william be already a marked man and a object of suspicion and displeasure to the rise power of boston already he have be compel to retire before the persecute spirit of the boston church and to seek shelter in the rival and more charitable colony where he peculiar opinion be tolerate even if they be not approve but the maitland know that he position at new plymouth do not satisfy the yearning of he earnest and aspiring soul and that he feel a strong desire to return to salem and minister among those who have be he first friend and he first congregation he reason for so bag delay this measure be very evident and edith 's parent justly fear that as soon as the object which now engross he whole mind be attain and he have win they daughter 's heart and band be would take she from she present safe and peaceful home to share with he the trial and difficulty and even danger which might await he on he return to the state of massachusett where they feel sure he would again proclaim the opinion that have already give so much offence this be a reasonable cause for anxiety but it be not a sufficient ground on which to refuse a connection with such a man as roger william -- a man who might indeed by he daring freedom of spirit and uncompromising opinion bring earthly trial on himself and any one whose fate be unite to he but whose lofty piety and steadfast faith must carry with they a spiritual blessing and gild and cheer the path however dark and thorny in which he and he partner should be call to tread it be therefore with mingled feeling of pain and pleasure that helen hear from edith that roger have at length take courage to declare to she he own feeling and to ask whether she could return they she glowing cheek and glistening eye as she reveal the interesting fact would have leave she mother in no doubt as to the answer she have return even if she have not already guess she sentiment and she and rodolph could but give they consent to she wish and ask a blessing on she choice the joy and gratitude of roger know no bound now he feel that life lay all bright and clear before he and that no outward trial could have power to cloud he path so long as edith walk by he side to divide he sorrow and double he joy he employ all he eloquence to persuade rodolph and helen to consent to he speedy marriage for now that he object in linger at plymouth be attain all he love for he flock at salem and he desire once more to dwell among they return with add force he be impatient to resume he spiritual duty where first he have commence they in new england and he be eager also to present edith as he bride to the friend who have once so kindly receive he and who now so pressingly invite he to return the aspect of affair in the state of massachusett be then peaceable and no demonstration of enmity towards roger have lately be make by the boston ruler so that rodolph and helen have no well-grounded pretext for delay they daughter 's marriage and she removal to salem with she husband the letter of invitation to roger william from that community also contain such alarming account of the rapidly decline health of they pastor skelton that the necessity for the presence of he intended successor could not be deny with some reluctance the maitland therefore agree to a early day for the performance of the simple ceremony that would unite they beloved and only remain child to one whom they love and respect but whose fiery zeal inspire they with doubt and anxiety no sooner be the happy day fix than roger hasten to dispatch a trusty messenger to roxburgh with a letter to he value friend and brother minister elliot -- who be appoint preacher in that town -- to entreat he to be present at he marriage and to honor the ceremony by give the customary address at its conclusion much to he satisfaction -- and that of all the maitland family -- this request be accede to and the ` prince of missionary ' arrive at new plymouth accompany also by he bride he be betroth when he leave england but circumstance have then prevent he intended wife from accompany he but as soon as he be settle at roxburgh she follow he to the land of he exile and become he faithful and devoted companion through a long and toilsome life and he able and efficient helpmate in all he difficulty the chief object of this excellent man in leave he own country be not so much to escape the persecution that then await the minister of he sect as to attempt the conversion of the native heathen for this pious and disinterested purpose he abandon home and kindred and all that be dear to he and at the age of twenty-seven enter that land of distant promise to the evangelization of which he have resolve to devote all the power of he life and the faculty of he energetic mind so abstemious and self-denying be he that he mode of life resemble that of a hermit and at the same time so liberal be he in relieve the want of other -- whether he own countryman or the red indian -- that if he wife have not be a careful and clever manager they must often have be reduce to absolute want there be a anecdote record of he so characteristic of the self-forgetting spirit of the ` great apostle of the indian ' that it ought not to be omit here where we be endeavor to give a faithful picture of the manners and the principle of the pilgrim father and they immediate follower the society in england under whose auspices he have emigrate allow he a salary of # 50 a year a great portion of which as well as of he small private resource be always dedicate to charitable purpose it be he custom when he receive he quarterly payment from the treasurer of the colony to give away a considerable part of it before he reach he home so that _ dame _ elliot -- as she be call -- only receive a very small sum inadequate to the necessary expense of she frugal housekeeping the paymaster know the good man 's peculiarity and be aware of the domestic embarrassment that he too-liberal bounty often occasion he therefore tie the money up in a handkerchief with so many knot that he be sure the pastor could never untie they and give it to he say in jest ` now really reverend sir you must this time give it all to you worthy spouse ' elliot smile and depart : but before he reach he dwelling he remember a afflict family who stand in need of he assistance and consolation and on go to visit they he find they overwhelm with unexpected distress he immediately attempt to open he handkerchief but all he effort be unavail to loosen the complicated knot ` well well ' he say at last ' i see it be the will of the lord that you should have the whole ' and give they all he wealth he return home penniless dame elliot never show any displeasure at these improvident act of she husband she admire and respect he pious motive and he beautiful spirit of self-denial : and she only strive the more to limit she expense and to make they home cheerful and comfortable with the scanty means she possess while she willingly conform to the life of extreme simplicity which he feel it right to adopt more than one dish be never allow to appear on he table and water be he only beverage if wine be offer he at the house of a friend he courteously decline but never blame in other the indulgence which he deny to himself he use to say ` wine be a precious noble thing and we should thank the lord for it but to suit I aright water should rather be there ' such be the christian pair who come to attend the wedding of edith and roger and to offer they congratulation on the event and they prayer that it might tend to the present and the eternal happiness of they value friend and he interesting bride it could not be otherwise than that dame elliot and edith should form a speedy and a lasting friendship there be a similarity of feeling and a difference of character that render they peculiarly agreeable to each other and make they mutually rejoice in the prospect of future intercourse which the strong regard that subsist between elliot and william and the nearness of salem to roxburgh promise to afford they the young matron be of a much more calm and subdue temperament than she new friend she early life and education have be very different from edith 's and the man on whom she have fix she affection and the mode of life to which she marriage have conduct she have alike tend to promote a quiet composure and steady regulation of mind rather than to arouse the enthusiastic feeling and the lively fancy that distinguish edith 's character and which have prove so irresistible a charm to the fervid soul of william but each of the young woman be well adapt to the lot which providence have assign they and each prove a blessing and a support through life to they respective partner but little preparation be require for the puritan nuptials that be now about to be celebrate : and little gaiety or display be manifest on the occasion accord to the custom of the sect the marriage ceremony be perform by bradford as the chief civil magistrate and the personal friend of the family at that period marriage be regard as a mere civil act and either the magistrate of the place or a commissary appoint for the purpose be alone require by law to officiate if a clergyman chance to be present he be generally request to offer up a prayer or even to deliver a suitable discourse to the party but this be a matter of choice and not of necessity and have no share in the validity of the ceremony even the wedding ring have already begin to be regard by the plymouther as a relic of popish corruption and superstition and be in many case dispense with and some time afterwards formally forbid but on this occasion it be retain at the wish of both edith and she mother who be accustom to regard it as a beautiful and almost a sacred symbol of the purity and the duration of the holy tie of marriage on the appoint day the civil rite be duly and solemnly perform by the governor in the presence of a few choose friend among whom none feel more interest in the future welfare of the young bride than the venerable william brewster although he be not a regular minister he be invite by rodolph and helen to offer up a prayer for the temporal and eternal happiness of they beloved child and fervently and eloquently the old man comply with they request : and tear of affection and anxiety glisten in he eye as he conclude he prayer and add he own heartfelt blessing to that which he have ask from heaven elliot then deliver a powerful and impressive address to the young married couple on they social and domestic as well as they spiritual duty and a simple but well-arranged repast at rodolph 's house complete the ceremony of the day it be about this time that the marriage of henrich and oriana be celebrate in the distant wilderness where all the outward circumstance be so different and where no prescribed form could be observe to render the simple ceremony legal or impressive and yet surely it be as sacred and as bind to those who then plight they faith to each other as if it have be perform with all the rite of civilized life the vow of henrich and he christian bride be make in the presence of that god who institute marriage and hollow it and they be sanctify by the ` prayer of faith ' which rise as freely and as acceptably from the wilderness as from the stately cathedral have edith and she much-loved brother know that they earthly fate be thus be decide so nearly at the same period how would the supplication which they offer for themselves have be mingle with prayer for the happiness of one another a brief sojourn in she much-loved home be allow to edith after she marriage and then she gladly but tearfully leave she parent to share the fortune of he who would be more to she than father or mother or brother or sister could be the pinnace that belong to the colony be appoint by the governor to convey roger and he bride to massachusett bay and land they as near as possible to they new home in salem and thus edith be spare the fatigue and difficulty of a long and toilsome journey through the wood and the wilderness by land she be kindly and joyfully welcome by she husband 's friend and admirer who be already dispose to regard she with favor and who soon learn both to love and respect she for she own many amiable and estimable quality chapter xx ` she be a woman of a steadfast mind tender and deep in she excess of love ' the life of peace and tranquillity which roger and he young bride enjoy in they new home be not long permit to be they happy lot the apprehension that have be feel by edith 's anxious parent be but too soon realize and notwithstanding all the good advice that he receive at plymouth and all he own sincere resolution to avoid if possible all future dispute with the elder or the boston church roger william again become the object of they persecute intolerance the fact of he be again invite to salem to assist the pastor be regard as extremely offensive to the government of boston : but when shelton die very shortly after roger 's arrival and he be elect to be the regular minister of the congregation it be look upon as a sinful defiance of lawful authority and one which demand exemplary punishment a opportunity for this exercise of power soon occur the township of salem lain claim to a certain disputed piece of land and address a petition to the government of massachusett in which they demand to be put in possession of it but in consequence of the recent act of the community with regard to roger william 's election the claim be unjustly reject the salemer then by the advice of they pastor write to all the other church in the bay and request they to unite in a remonstrance to the government this act be in perfect accordance with the spirit of the puritanical principle which distinctly separate the church from the state and it ought not therefore to have give offence to any one but they practice differ greatly from they theory and the feeling against william be so strong that all the church -- the elder of which be oppose to he opinion -- now take part with the government of boston against he this treatment so irritated the warm feeling of william and so keenly wound he sense of justice and love of liberty that he require the church of salem to renounce all connection with the other congregation and even go so far as to refuse all intercourse with he own church until this separation be agree to but strongly as the salemer be attach to they pastor they could not consent to so decisive a measure as he demand and be vex and dispirit by the general disapprobation which they conduct have excite in the rest of the colony the greatest part of the congregation fall away from he this desertion grieve the heart of the zealous minister but it do not discourage he or subdue he determine spirit he begin to hold spiritual meeting at he own house which be attend by those member of the church who fully concur in he view and who consider that he have be treat with injustice this proceeding naturally arouse a strong party spirit in the town and even threaten to produce a permanent division in the church as the follower of william hold themselves entirely aloof from the rest of the congregation deeply do edith lament this unhappy state of affair she devotion to she noble-minded husband and the natural tendency of she own mind lead she to sympathize entirely in he opinion and feeling and she strong sense of right and wrong cause she to condemn the injustice of the government and the weak truckling spirit of the sister-church but she judgement be more calm and dispassionate than that of roger and she temper far less excitable she therefore see the impropriety as well as the danger of cause a schism in the church and she use all she powerful influence to induce she husband to give up these irregular assembly and without compromise he own opinion to endeavor to ward off the enmity of the man of boston she earnestly beseech he again to leave the congregation of salem -- the greater portion of which have already desert he and he cause -- and to return to plymouth where a safe and a happy home might yet be afford to they and where no persecution for conscience ' sake need be fear but all she argument and she persuasion be alike ineffectual on this one point she find she roger firm and inflexible -- for on this point he feel that he honor and he conscience be both concerned and even for edith 's sake he could not act contrary to they dictate he know that danger hang over he head and though he would not shrink from it himself he beseech she to seek a temporary refuge with she parent and remain at plymouth until the threaten storm have blow over but it be now edith 's turn to show herself firm and decide and so clearly do roger perceive that separation would be to she a far greater trial than any other that could befall she in he company that he forbear to urge a measure that it wring he own heart to propose at length the bode storm begin to break over he head for all he suppose offence he be again summon before the general assembly at boston and in fear and anxiety edith see he depart she know full well that he would never renounce or even soften down he opinion through any fear of man and she do not for a moment desire that he should thus lower himself in she estimation and he own but she also know the bitterness of the enmity feel towards he by the authority at boston and she could not repress she apprehension of its consequence as she anticipate roger refuse to acknowledge himself guilty of a offence against the church or state nor would he even yield one point of he religious or political opinion during a long disputation with the celebrated pastor hooker he be therefore declare contumacious by the government : and with the assent of all the assemble clergy except he friend elliot he be banish from the territory of massachusett six week be allow he by the general assembly to make he preparation and remove beyond the boundary of they dominion : but as this term would have bring the time of he banishment to the winter season when such a journey would have be impracticable he be afterwards permit to remain at salem until the spring with great apparent unconcern he return to he home where he fond and admiring wife welcome he with joy and strengthen he spirit by the cheerful manner in which she receive the news of they sentence of banishment she have feel a undefined dread of something much more hard to bear -- of something which might possibly separate she husband from she : but banishment _ with he _ be only a change of home and let they lot be cast where it might she could be happy indeed she entertain a hope that roger would consent to remove to plymouth and take up he abode there which would have give she extreme satisfaction but she soon find that this hope could not be accomplish for she enthusiastic husband have form a design of found a church of he own and of be entirely independent of all government in spiritual matter in order to carry out this purpose he daringly continue to hold the obnoxious assembly in he own house and to instill he opinion into the mind of the many young and zealous friend who gather around he these meeting be even more numerously attend after he return from boston than they be before he be summon to the bar of the general assembly for persecution and injustice naturally recoil on the perpetrator of it and the victim of such harsh measure be sure to gain friend and supporter among the warm-hearted and the generous a report of these proceedings be carry to boston and also a rumor of william 's suppose plan for found a independent church and settlement in narragansett bay it be even declare that some of he friend have already go off to the south and be seek a fitting spot on which to commence building this information rouse the fear as well as the wrath of the government the eloquence and ability of william be well know to the ruler and they dread the influence that he would inevitably exercise over the neighbor church if he establish himself and he follower in a district so contiguous to they own they therefore resolve to employ still more harsh and stringent measure than have yet be attempt in order to put a stop to he disorderly proceedings and prevent the further dissemination of he opinion he be accordingly once more summon to the chief town and have he obey the summons he be to have be forcibly convey on board a vessel then in the harbor and send off to england as a rebel and schismatic unworthy to dwell in the new settlement when the summons arrive at salem roger be ill have catch a fever from some member of he flock on whom he have be attend and he therefore reply with truth that it would endanger he life to attempt the journey to boston he serious indisposition have occasion to edith much anxiety and alarm but now she be make to feel how often those event which we regard as misfortune be really ` blessing in disguise ' and how frequently we merciful and all-seeing father render they the means of we preservation from far greater evil it would be well if the conviction of this bless truth be constantly present to we mind how many anxious care would it disperse or soothe and how many thanksgiving would it call forth edith feel its truth and its consolation as she sit by the side of she husband 's couch and write from he dictation the reply that save he from immediate compliance with the dreaded summons nothing would have induce roger to plead illness as a excuse for disobedience unless it have actually exist : and he fearless spirit would probably have lead he into the snare that be lay for he edith know this secret danger for governor winthrop who have see and admire she on one of he visit to plymouth and who now kindly sympathize in she feeling have send she a private note by the messenger in which he warn she of the danger that wait william at boston and desire she by some means to prevent he appear before the general assembly winthrop highly disapprove of the young minister 's bold and independent conduct but he shrink from so cruel a act as be resolve on by he council he do not however choose to declare he more lenient judgement and he adopt the plan of inform roger 's wife of the fate that be design for he and leave it to she judgement and affection to take the proper measure to avert it it be not until after the departure of the messenger that edith tell she husband of winthrop 's kind interference and show he he note the indignation of william at such a flagrant disregard of all common justice be so great that edith fear it would bring on a accession of the fever it however act in a perfectly contrary manner he sleep well that night and the follow morning declare he intention of set off immediately to boston and there accuse the general assembly of they unlawful intention and daring they to put it into execution ' i will upbraid they with they injustice and charge they with they purpose crime ' he exclaim and he fine eye flash with excitement that almost make edith fear that the fever have affect he mind ' i will appeal to god and man against they lawless cruelty ' he continue ` and rouse the whole colony to defend my right to liberty of thought and action ' oh roger ' cry he wife -- and she catch he burn hand and press it to she throbbing heart -- ` cease such wild and desperate word would you drive I to distraction by thus throw yourself into the power of you bitter and relentless enemy who in boston would stand up to defend you cause who could deliver you from the evil intention of these cruel man it be true that the governor have show himself you friend -- i should rather say my friend -- by give I this secret information but he would not openly espouse you cause or resist the will of the assembly why then should you spurn from you the means of safety that have be so mercifully afford and tempt providence to leave you to you fate ' ` edith ' he reply -- and the bright flush fade from he cheek and the fire in he eye die away and he sink again upon he couch -- ` edith you have subdue my spirit or perhaps ' he add smile up in she face ` weakness have subdue it i feel that i have no strength to accomplish what i desire and to show my persecutor that liberty of thought and feeling be my birthright and that i will never relinquish the privilege i must therefore submit to the will of one who be wiser and mightier than i be and believe I my edith ' he continue -- as he see the tear fall from she gentle eye -- ` believe I i do to with perfect contentment now the passion -- the sinful passion -- that stir I so mightily just now be go and i feel the goodness of my god in hold I back from the rash act i contemplated and from rush upon danger that i might indeed defy but could not hope to conquer i will be calm my love and you shall devise some means for my escape i feel assure that still more violent measure will be adopt by the assembly to get I into they power and now that i can quietly reflect on the consequence of such a event i be aware that they would probably be we violent and indefinite separation i could not bear that edith though i believe that i could bear much to vindicate my honor ' how change be roger 's countenance now all passion -- all excitement -- be go and the natural sweetness of he disposition and tenderness of he heart resume they interrupted influence over he whole manner and expression edith think she have never either admire or love he so much as at this moment when he have conquer he impetuous feeling and yield he fiery impulse to show a bold resentment of injury to she influence and persuasion ` heaven bless you my own roger ' she exclaim ` and reward you better resolution by grant we many future year of unite happiness but now we must think of the present and provide for its emergency i see clearly that there be now no safety for you in salem and that a speedy flight can alone ensure you liberty you have make a great sacrifice for my sake and i will also make one for yours i will not even ask to fly with you for i could only be a encumbrance to you at this inclement season of the year and my presence here may be of use to you my heart rebel while i say it roger but you must go alone and use every exertion to reach plymouth as speedily as possible when you be safe beneath my father 's roof then will be time enough to think of I i feel no doubt that governor bradford will afford you every assistance in he power and probably will again allow the vessel that bring we here in brighter day to convey I once more to you and to happiness ' edith have try to speak with steadiness and composure and so far she have succeed tolerably well but when she realize to herself the time that must elapse before she could rejoin she husband and all the danger and privation that might await he in the interval she calmness quite give way and she burst into tear of uncontrollable agony roger strive to cheer she and to point to the happy future that he trust be in store for they -- if not on earth yet assuredly in a better world where faithful heart will never know the misery of parting but it be not until he have kneel with she in prayer and have humbly ask to meet the come trial and to be sanctify by it that she tear cease to flow and a smile of hope and resignation illumine she interesting countenance ' i must act now roger ' she say in a cheerful voice as she rise from she knee ` we time be short and i must make such arrangement for you comfort during you journey as be in my power all other thing that be needful to you i will endeavor to send by sea to plymouth or if no opportunity occur during the winter you must have patience until i can convey they myself ' she voice again tremble and unbidden tear again rise to she eye but she seek relief in occupation and on the day after the morrow when roger be to commence he toilsome journey at break of day he knapsack be ready and store with everything that would be most requisite to he comfort the moment of parting come but we will not describe it it be bear by edith as a devoted christian wife can bear anything that be necessary for the safety and welfare of she husband but when he be go and she swimming eye could no longer see he beloved form or catch he last signal of farewell the whole desolation of she own position burst upon she : and edith be for a time bow down with grief she feel herself alone in the world and she shrink from seek comfort or sympathy from any human being who be then near she but friend whom she could not then expect to see be near and the wounded heart find a balm and a consolation beyond its hope the very evening after roger 's departure edith 's spirit be cheer by the arrival of elliot and he wife at she now dreary home o how she welcome they and how deeply they sympathize in she distress and anxiety they have hear of the last summons that have be send from the general assembly and have hasten to salem in spite of the severity of the weather to offer any assistance or counsel that might be need by either roger or edith they rejoice with much thankfulness when they hear of he have escape the cruel vengeance of he adversary but they mind be fill with fear and anxiety when they reflect on the many peril that he might encounter on he long journey and the suffering from cold and hunger and fatigue that he must endure in he present debilitated state of health they do not however add to edith 's anxiety by tell of they own but exert themselves to cheer and rouse she and lead she to place a perfect trust in the over-ruling care of he without whose permission not even a sparrow can fall to the ground the wisdom of the plan that edith have persuade she husband to adopt be soon but too apparent for in a few day a pinnace arrive at salem bring a officer and attendant who be commission by the general assembly to seize on the offend pastor and convey he on board a vessel that be lie at nantasket ready for sea but this cruel and arbitrary intention be happily frustrated the officer come to the dwelling of william and have the mortification of find that he have be go three day nor could all he threat or persuasion obtain from any of the inmate the least information concern he flight he also seek out and strictly interrogate several of the inhabitant of salem who be know to be the partisan of this persecute friend of liberty but although they be well acquaint with he sudden departure and he destination and some of the younger man be even prepare to follow he not one of they betray they respected leader the officer therefore return to boston to report the ill-success of he errand which excite much wrath and vexation in the member of the assembly but afford secret satisfaction to the amiable governor winthrop who have unwillingly submit to the decision of a large majority of the government and who have kindly exert himself to rescue from a cruel and unjust fate the man whose only fault consist in a determination to think for himself meanwhile the fugitive be pursue he slow and difficult way through the wood and wild to the south of salem but whither should he direct he step every road out of the district must lead he through the territory of he foe and persecutor and he dare not show in any of the hamlet or village where he person and reputation be well know lest he should be seize and give up to the magistrate of boston he therefore travel chiefly by night guide by the moon and star and lay conceal in some damp covert or rocky ravine during the day the small stock of provision that edith have place in he knapsack be soon expend and for some day he subsist on the nut and berry that still remain on the tree at length he feel himself safe from immediate pursuit and change he course suddenly to the east he emerge from the shelter of the wood and hurry across the open plain that skirt the bay he find himself at the spot which he desire to reach this be a little cove on the shore surround on the land side by rock and only capable of receive a small boat into its tranquil harbor as roger approach the water 's edge and step round the last point of rock that conceal the inlet he make a signal which to he great joy be instantly reply to from within day be just dawn over the far horizon and a dim twilight shone on the smooth and boundless ocean that spread to the east a few light stroke of a oar fall on roger 's ear and then he see the white spray and the dark form of a boat emerge from the gloomy cavern that be form by the overhang rock in a moment he hand be grasp in that of a friend and all he sense of loneliness vanish away seaton entreated he to lose no time in enter the boat and leave the inhospitable shore of massachusett and william gladly obey he the little shallop which he friend at salem have secretly purchase and send by one of the most devoted of they number to meet he at the appoint place be well supply with provision and warm clothing which prove a most seasonable relief to roger but the most acceptable part of its contents be a letter from edith inform he of the welcome arrival of they friend the elliot at salem and of the futile effort of the man of boston to make he a prisoner edith write more cheerfully than she feel and she speak of the happy time when they would be reunite and of she hope that it be not far distant assure he that she be willing -- and trust ere long to be able -- to follow he to any spot where he might fix he home this letter and the refreshment with which seaton furnish he raise he drooping and exhaust spirit and at he friend 's request he wrap himself in the large boat-cloak that he provident wife have send for he and lay down to enjoy the first calm and undisturbed repose that have be permit to he since he leave he beloved home silently and rapidly the little boat glide over the calm surface of the bay and ere long it be opposite to the harbor of boston and might be espy by some of the vessel lie there roger still sleep the deep sleep of exhaustion and security but seaton now require he aid and reluctantly arouse he to take a second oar and speed the shallop past the region of danger roger spring to he foot and seize the oar and the boat dart forward from the impulse of he now fresh and powerful arm it pass near several boat belong to the bostoner but the fugitive draw he large spanish hat over he brow and hide he well-known form and dress beneath the fold of the ample cloak and thus escape detection or observation it be he intention to row down the bay as far as new plymouth where he design to visit edith 's parent and apprise they of all that have befall he and also endeavor to prevail on bradford to send a vessel as soon as the inclemency of the weather have subside to bring he wife to she paternal home he then propose to go on with seaton and any of the plymouther who would accompany he and seek a settlement further to the south in some part of narragansett bay but this scheme be not permit to be carry out towards evening a fresh breeze spring up from the east and before sun-set it blow so violently that roger and he companion have the greatest difficulty in keep they little vessel out at sea and prevent its be dash on the coral reef that gird that ` stern and rock-bound coast ' manfully they work at the oar but they strength be almost exhaust and no creek or inlet offer they a secure refuge still they persevere -- for it be a struggle for life the least remission of they toil would have place they at the mercy of the wind and they must have be drive violently against the sunken rock at length when the light of day be fail they and they begin to give themselves up as lose the keen eye of roger espy a opening through the foam-covered reef and though it be narrow and evidently dangerous he and seaton resolve to make a desperate effort to pass through it and gain the smooth still water that they know must lie between the rock and the shore they breathe a fervent and heart-felt prayer for help from above and then commence the fearful contest the moment they turn the prow of they shallop towards the shore the light and buoyant little vessel dart forward impel by both wind and tide and mount like a seabird on the rolling wave the dashing spray fall ever it almost blind its crew and the helm no longer have power to divert its headlong course ` now may he who rule the storm have pity on my edith ' exclaimed roger as he see the fail extent of they peril and not a fear for himself cross he steadfast soul ` may the lord of the wind and the wave be we guide and protector or the next minute will be we last ' he clasp he hand in prayer and raise he kindling eye to the frown heaven above he but he eye of faith could look through those dark cloud and see a father 's hand of love and mercy governing and control the element : and he spirit be at peace ` now god be praise ' cry seaton as he draw a long shiver breath and snatch up both the oar project they on each side of the boat to protect it from the rock that bound the narrow channel ` we have enter the passage and with heaven 's help we shall yet be save ' they have indeed dash straight into the opening that divide the reef and through which the wave be rush at a terrific rate and they only apparent chance of safety lay in the possibility of guide the little bark through the channel without its be impel against the rugged side william catch one of the oar from he friend and both direct they whole strength to this object there be a brief interval of breathless suspense and then the boat strike on a hidden coral rock it be but for a moment -- another swell wave lift it again and roll forward bear the little vessel on its summit into the smooth water that lay like a narrow lake between the dangerous reef and the flat sandy shore but the peril be not yet over the blow-on the rock though momentary have be so violent as to spring a leak in the bottom of the boat and through this the water gush up with fearful rapidity threaten to sink it before the shore could be reach again the oar be pull with the strength of desperation and again the danger be avert but roger william and he friend find themselves on a desert and uninhabited coast with a useless vessel and no means of proceed to plymouth still they life have be providentially preserved and they be deeply grateful to the divine power which have be exert for they rescue and faith and courage and bodily strength be they portion likewise : and they do not despair they sleep long and soundly and the follow morning have ascertain that the boat be too seriously injured to be repair by any means at they command they resolve on abandon it and recommence they journey on foot the extreme difficulty of reach plymouth by land and the wide circuit from the course that he wish ultimately to pursue that must be travel in order to reach the settlement of the pilgrim father cause william to relinquish that part of he plan and decide on striking at once into the forest and pursue a south-westerly course until he should arrive at narragansett bay this would lead he through the trackless wood and the dreary wild inhabit only by the barbarous and untutored red man but from they he hope to meet with that hospitality and succor which be deny he by he fellow - countryman and fellow-christians chapter xxi ` ... alas to see the strength that cling round woman in such hour ... a mournful sight though lovely a o'erflowing of the spring the full spring of affection deep and bright and she because she life be ever twine with other life and by no stormy wind may thence be shake and because the light of tenderness be round she and she eye doth weep such passionate tear -- therefore she thus endure ' heman without any guide roger and he faithful friend seaton wander through the wilderness they take from the stranded boat as much of food and other useful article as they could carry but the provision do not last long and before they reach any indian encampment they be seduce to extreme want and suffer they clothes be drench by the frequent heavy rain which so completely saturate the ground and the dead branch that lay strew upon it as often to preclude all possibility of light a fire they night be pass on the damp ground or beneath any shelter rock that they could find and once a hollow tree afford they a refuge from the storm that rage around they when no other be at hand at length after fourteen week of trial and hardship they reach the village of packanokick where dwelt masasoyt the aged sagamore of the wampanoge during the time that william have reside at plymouth he have learn the language of the native and on some of he visit to the village of mooanam he have become acquaint with he father masasoyt the chief sachem of the divide tribe the regard and respect with which he eloquence and he attractive manners have inspire the younger chieftain be fully share by the sagamore and both prince and people learn to love and reverence the man who honor they rights respect they prejudice and pray to he god for they welfare he appearance in the village of masasoyt be hail with joy and regard as a privilege by all the inhabitant the sachem receive both he and be way-worn companion with kindness and hospitality and give they a chamber in he own lodge which if not remarkable either for cleanliness or comfort yet seem a luxurious abode to man who have pass so many day and night in the unsheltered depths of the forest on the follow morning when food and rest have somewhat restore the exhaust strength of the traveler masasoyt invite william to a private conference in which he inform he that a serious quarrel have again arise between he tribe and that of cundineus the chief of the narragansett and he entreat he to use all he powerful influence with the latter to heal the present dissension and prevent the dispute from end in open hostility william undertake this negotiation with much satisfaction for peace-making be not only in accordance with he feeling and with the duty of he profession but he also desire to secure the favor and protection of the narragansett chief on the border of whose dominion he design to fix he future home he therefore make no delay in set out with a few indian attendant on the propose expedition and in a few day return to packanokick with the welcome intelligence that the wrath of cundincus be appease and that he have listen favorably to the explanation of he rival chieftain the old narragansett chief also be so captivate by the english stranger and so win by he peculiar eloquence that we be tell that ` the barbarous heart of the old prince love he like a son to he latest breath ' and he nephew and co-ruler the young miantonomo also regard he as a friend and place in he a perfect confidence ` let no one ' thankfully exclaimed william in he diary ` mistrust providence -- these raven feed I in the wilderness ' but inactive repose be neither the wish nor the lot of roger william and he earnestly desire to reach the spot where he propose to find he new settlement and prepare a home for he beloved edith and from whence also he hope to be able to send a letter to salem or to plymouth which might allay the anxious fear that he well know she have so long be endure since he have receive the letter that seaton bring he from he high-minded wife he have not have any opportunity of convey to she the intelligence of he own safety or of hearing from she whether she strength and spirit be support under the protracted trial of absence and anxiety he know also that ere this time he have reason to believe himself a father and he heart yearn to be assure of the welfare of he wife and child and to see they safely lodge beneath the shelter of he own roof it be a source of extreme consolation to he under all he feeling of anxiety to believe that he edith have be cheer and support by the presence of dame elliot and she excellent husband who he feel assure would not leave she until she could be remove either to plymouth or to she husband 's new abode : and to they kind care and the protection of he heavenly father he be contented to leave she while he use every effort to procure for she a safe and happy home in which he could hope ere long to welcome she he therefore lose no time in conclude a bargain with masasoyt for a piece of land in the district call seacomb -lrb- \* -rrb- not far from the east arm of narragansett bay and thither he proceed with seaton and commence building and plant from this place he find mean to convey intelligence both to salem and plymouth of the safe termination of he perilous journey and he intention to fix he settlement on the piece of ground that he have purchase he messenger return after a considerable interval and bring he a letter from he now joyful wife which gladden he heart with the welcome news of she health and safety and that also of he little daughter edith this name she tell he have be give to the infant in accordance with what she know to be he wish and he friend john elliot -- who with he wife have reside chiefly at salem since he departure -- have perform the rite of baptism she further inform he that governor bradford on hearing of she lonely position have kindly promise to send a vessel for she and as the severity of winter have already partially subside she be in daily expectation of the arrival of the pinnace which would carry she back to the happy home of she youth and then she hope the time would not be long until she could rejoin she husband and once more be at peace -lrb- footnote : now reheboth -rrb- this letter call forth the lively joy and gratitude of roger and animated he to fresh zeal and activity in all he proceedings at seacomb he be also encouraged greatly by the arrival at the same time of five of he most devoted adherent from salem who have no sooner learn from he indian messenger of he arrival at the place of he destination than they determine to accompany the friendly savage on he return to seacomb and assist they friend and teacher in all he labor for the formation of a independent settlement all this visa cheer and satisfactory but the trial of this undaunted man be not over yet he trusty messenger have bring he another dispatch which he have not yet attend to he now open it and find that it come from the governor of plymouth and contain a earnest injunction to he to abandon seacomb which he inform he be include in they patent and to remove to the other side of the river that form they boundary where he could be free and independent like themselves ' i accept he wise counsel as a voice from god ' write william : and he ' immediately resolve to be guide by it and again commence he wanderings in a frail indian canoe he and he companion row up the arm of the sea now call the river seacock they know not where to land or where again to pitch they tent in the wilderness but they be soon guide by the friendly voice of a party of narragansett on the opposite shore these native have recognize they friend william and now shout out in broken english the welcome word ` what cheer ' the sound fall like music on the ear of the desolate exile and in remembrance of the event the spot of ground where they first land on the narragansett territory receive the name of _ ` what cheer ' _ which it still retain a spring call _ ` william 's spring ' _ be also show by the present inhabitant of this district in proud and grateful memory of the spot where the founder of a future free state first set foot on shore the place where the wanderer land be call by the indian maushasuck and it be make over to he by the generous cundincus as a free and absolute possession and also all the land include between the river pawtucket and maushasuck -lrb- \* -rrb- this property he share equally with he present comrade and also with some other who shortly after join he from salem and make they whole number amount to thirteen he do not reserve any advantage to himself although the land actually belong to he alone but divide it into thirteen equal portion on each of which a rude hut be immediately erect these be soon improve and become a rise village to which william give the name of providence in grateful remembrance of the divine guidance and protection which have bring he at length to ` the haven where he would be ' -lrb- footnote : now call the providence river -rrb- he and he associate unite themselves into a sort of ` town - fellowship ' and independent church and one of the first rule which they lay down for they future guidance and government be that no one should ever suffer in that settlement for conscience ' sake it be summer when the little village begin to be build and before the land could be clear and prepare for cultivation the season be too far advance to allow any hope of a corn-harvest the new settler have therefore to endure the same poverty and privation that have be the lot of the earlier planter in new england they have no means of obtain any of the comfort of civilized life except from boston or plymouth : and as they possess no vessel besides a indian canoe this be a service of toil and much hazard still they do not repine for liberty be here they precious portion and hope for the future sustained they through the trial of the present time but where be edith where be that true-hearted woman while she husband be thus struggle with difficulty and privation she be where both inclination and duty have lead she -- by he side and smile at trial that she be permit to share with he and to lighten by she presence we must here revert to the time before edith have be bless by receive intelligence of she husband from seacomb and have so cheerfully reply to the note which he write to she on a scrap of paper tear from he pocket book in order not to interrupt the history of roger 's difficulty and they successful issue we have not yet narrate the trial that he exemplary wife have endure -- and endure with a resolution and fortitude equal to he own when the joyful news of roger 's safety reach edith at salem she be slowly recover from a long and dangerous illness which anxiety and sorrow have bring on she a few week after the birth of she child through all she suffering of mind end body dame elliot have be she nurse and she comforter and she and she husband have sacrifice they own domestic comfort and they own humble but cherish home to lessen the sorrow of they afflict friend all the consolation that human sympathy and affection could afford to edith be give by these true christian friend and all the spiritual strength that the prayer end exhortation of such a minister as elliot could impart to a sorrowing spirit be receive and gratefully appreciate by the object of he solicitude and care but when week and month have elapse and still no tiding come of the beloved wanderer what hope could be give to the desolate heart of edith she friend have themselves give up all hope of roger 's have survive the toil end privation of the journey and how could they bid he wife cheer up and look for brighter day which they believe would never come a letter which edith receive from she parent by the captain of a fishing-boat from plymouth too clearly prove that william have never reach that settlement and from that day the health and spirit of he wife visibly decline she do not give way to violent grief but a settle melancholy dwelt on she pale and lovely countenance and all the thoughtful abstraction of she early year which happiness have chase from she feature return again no object but she infant seem to rouse she and then it be only to tear : but tear be better than that look of deep and speechless sorrow that generally meet the anxious gaze of she friend and make they at time apprehensive for she reason at length she physical power give way and a violent attack of fever bring edith to the brink of the grave during this period both elliot and he wife devoted themselves day and night to the poor sufferer whose mind wander continually and whose deeply-touching lamentation for the beloved one whom she mourn as dead bring tear to the eye of she faithful friend they have no hope of she recovery nor could they heartily desire it for they believe she earthly happiness be wreck for ever and they could ask no better fate for she than a speedy reunion with she roger in a home beyond the grave she child they look on as they own and cherish she with almost a parent 's love and care while they resolve to bring she up in those high and holy principle that have be so nobly contend for by she unfortunate father and so beautifully exemplify in the amiable character of she mother the fever run high and bear down all the strength -- both moral and physical -- of its victim at length after day and night of restlessness and delirium a deep and heavy sleep come on and edith lay still and motionless for hour while she untiring friend sit watch she in silence and offer up fervent prayer for the soul that seem to be depart during this anxious period a gentle knock be make at the door and elliot on open it be present by edith 's single attendant with the small packet that roger 's indian messenger have bring for she mistress in tremble agitation the pastor show the direction -- which he know to be in he friend 's handwriting -- to he wife : and now indeed they lift up they heart to the god who heareth prayer that he would be please to recall the precious life that seem to be fast ebb away and to permit he tried and faithful servant again to be unite and enjoy the happiness that yet might be they portion on earth noiselessly elliot glide from the room -- for he fear to awaken the sleeper -- and seek the friendly indian from whom he learn the good news of roger 's safety and all the particulars that the red man could relate concern he he then return to edith 's chamber and in a low whisper communicate all that he have hear to he wife and consult with she as to the best method of communicate the startling tiding to edith should she ever awake from she present death-like slumber they be still engage in earnest but scarcely audible conversation when dame elliot who do not cease from watch she patient observe she open she large eye and fix they with a look of intelligent inquiry on herself and she husband she make a sign to he and he likewise be strike with the evident change in edith 's countenance and fill with hope that she reason have perfectly return this hope be quickly confirm by the invalid say in a very low voice but in a collect manner -- ' i have sleep very long and my dream have be very painful i dream that i be alone in the world and that a angel come to take my soul where he have go to dwell and then -- just as i bade farewell to earth -- a little form come between I and the angel and hold I back where be that little be dame elliot let I look on she that my tremble spirit may be stay no roger no -- i must not ask to follow you yet ' edith seem too weak for tear or for any strong emotion but she close she eye and slowly clasp she almost transparent hand upon she breast and look so still and colorless that she might have be take for a marble monument but for the dark wave hair that fall upon she pillow and shaded she snowy neck dame elliot take up the infant from its little wicker cradle and hold it towards edith say gently -- ` look up my edith and bless the little be that god have give to call you back to life and happiness ' _ ` happiness ' _ murmured edith ` that word have no meaning for I duty be my only tie to life ' but she do look up and as she eye be long end fondly fix on the unconscious feature of the child she own sweet look of gentleness rise into they again and she raise she feeble arm as if to take the infant ` and he will never see she ' she whisper ` he will never look on he child in this world ' elliot think that hope might now be give without danger and he take she waste hand in he and say -- ` edith you have have much sorrow and it have nearly bring you down to the grave but can you bear to feel the agitation of hope can you listen calmly while i tell you that some tiding of you husband have reach we and that he be certainly alive after the time when you believe he dead ' he pause and look anxiously to see the effect of this sentence and he be almost awed by the expression of edith 's countenance it be not agitation -- it be not joy -- it be not tremble uncertainty but it be a look of concentrated mental power and endurance and of speechless inquiry that seem to say ` now utter my sentence of life or death and do it quickly ' dame elliot could not bear it burst into tear of deep emotion she beat down and imprint a kiss on edith 's cold brow while she exclaim in broken accent -- ` yes it be true dearest edith you may live -- and live we hope for happiness as great as have ever be you portion ' ' o my god ' cry edith - ` this be too much -- too much of joy for one so weak and faithless but tell I my friend -- tell I all i can bear it now ' gently and gradually elliot prepare she for the blissful certainty of she husband 's safety and when he find that illness have not greatly weaken she natural strength of mind and that she could bear the joy that await she he give she roger 's own letter and feel assure that the tear she at length shed at the sight of he hand-writing would relieve and calm she over-burdened heart in this he judge truly for though edith be greatly exhaust after this strong excitement yet she pass a tranquil night and be so much recover on the follow morning as to be able to converse composedly with she kind friend the fever have pass away and the sense of restore happiness join to youth and a naturally good constitution have a rapid effect in renovate she strength and spirit and recall a faint bloom to she cheek before the indian set out on he return to seacomb she insist on see he and herself deliver to he a letter to roger in which she have carefully avoid all mention of she illness she make numerous inquiry of he relative to she husband 's health and present situation and charge he to convey she packet safely and tell he employer that he have see she and he child well and happy she could say this with truth for so rapidly have she recover that the inexperienced eye of the indian could detect no remain indisposition in the slight and graceful form of the interesting pale-face or any trace of disease in the bright eye that smile so kindly upon he he depart with the friend of william and earnestly do he wife wish that it have be possible for she to accompany they and join she husband at once but this could not be and she could only endeavor to regain she strength so as to be able to proceed to plymouth as soon as the promise vessel arrive in due time it come : and bid she kind and devoted friend a affectionate farewell edith and she child embark with all the little property that remain to she and soon find herself once more beneath the peaceful roof of she parent until she arrive at plymouth she be not aware of the fresh trial that have befall she husband in be compel to abandon he settlement at seacomb and remove into the narragansett district this change be distressing to she as it net only place the line of she future habitation at a greater distance from she parent and friend at new plymouth but also remove it further from all civilized life and into a district inhabit by a tribe whom she have learn to dread from she childhood as the rival and foe of the friendly wampanoge still these consideration do not in any measure abate she eagerness to fellow roger and take she part in all he toil and anxiety the winter have pass away and though far from genial the weather be more tolerable for travel and edith resolve to set out all the argument and entreaty of helen and rodolph to induce she to delay she journey for some month be ineffectual she husband live and he be suffer hardship -- and could she remain separated from he now that she own strength have be restore the only concession she could be persuade to make be to wait until some friend from plymouth be find to accompany she gladly would she father have do so but he be suffer so severely from the ague that so often attack the settlement in the spring month as to be perfectly incompetent to attempt the toilsome journey no vessel could now be procure and it be on foot that edith propose to traverse the wide extent of wilderness that stretch between plymouth and roger 's place of refuge two faithful and active indian be appoint by mooanam to be she guide and to carry the infant which she would not consent to leave behind she and in order that this might be accomplish with greater facility apannow provide she with one of the indian cradle -- or rather pouch -- in which the red squaw so commonly carry they young child on they back this be thickly line with soft and elastic bog-moss and well adapt to the purpose for which it be design all be prepare and the impatient edith only wait for a companion from among she own countryman who be all so much occupy at that busy season as to feel little disposed to undertake so long a journey but she find one at length who be sufficiently interested in she happiness and that of she husband to leave he home and he occupation and offer to be she protector this be the excellent edward winslow who have be she father 's constant friend ever since they first emigration and who bad also learn to know and value roger william during he residence at plymouth with such a companion edith feel she have nothing to fear and she anxious parent commit she to he care with greater confidence than they would have do to that of any other protector he natural sagacity he courage and he knowledge of the indian and they language render he peculiarly suitable for the enterprise and he warm friendship for rodolph and all he family and the lively power of he pious and intelligent mind ensure to edith both a kind and a agreeable fellow-traveler nevertheless it be not without many prayer and tear that helen see she daughter once more leave she childhood 's home and commence she journey but edith 's spirit be joyous and she hope be high and she child lay smile contentedly in its strange nest which be sling on the shoulder of one of the indian guide the other carry a small stock of provision and other necessaries and thus the little party set forth we will rot follow they day by day in they fatiguing journey but merely state that its length and difficulty exceed even the expectation of edith and she companion but never damp the persevere courage of the former or draw from she a complaint or a wish to return she only feel that every step however rough and toilsome carry she nearer to the object that be dearest to she on earth and this conviction support she when otherwise she strength must have fail sometimes a indian wigwam afford she rest and shelter but frequently a bed of dry leaf and a roof of bough be the best lodging that winslow and the indian could provide for she and she little infant happily the weather be calm and mild and the season sufficiently advance to enable the indian to find a quantity of nutritious root which with the meal or nokake that they carry with they -- or procure from the native by the way -- form the chief subsistence of the party occasionally they fare be improve by a wild turkey or wood duck or perhaps a squirrel or hare that winslow bring down with he gun but often the day 's journey be perform with no other refreshment than a few spoonsful of dry meal and a draught of cold water until something more nourishing could be procure at they place of repose for the right roger william be stand one evening on the bank of the river or rather arm of the sea call seacock near the spot where he have first land and to which he have give the name of ` what cheer ' he be examine the landing-place and contrive some means of turn it into a sort of harbor for canoe that belong to the settler in he new village when he attention be attract to the other side of the river by hear he own name loudly call by native voice he look to the spot and see two indian plunge into the water and swim rapidly towards he : and as they do so he also observe two other figure emerge from a grove of tree that reach nearly to the eastern brink of the inlet the distance be considerable but roger 's keen eye could discern that one of they be a female form and as they approach nearer to the water 's edge and the ray of the evening sun fall brightly upon they he also see that the arm of that graceful and familiar form carry a infant ` surely it be a illusion ' he exclaim i have so long picture to my mind that bless sight that at length my fancy seem realize it can not be ' but again he name be call -- not now with a indian accent but in the manly english tone of edward winslow ` bring down a canoe roger ' he shout across the water ` edith and you child can not swim this arm of the sea ' it be then true edith -- he beloved wife -- be there and only that narrow inlet divide they the indian have spring to the shore and be wait he direction to go in search of a canoe but for a few moment he do not regard they so rivet be he eye and all he sens on the opposite shore but now he remember that only by means of a boat could he attain that shore and make a signal of wild joy and welcome to edith he hurry up the creek with the indian and rapidly unloose the mooring of he canoe which lay securely behind a project rock he leap into it leave the native on the shore and paddle the canoe swiftly down the creek to the spot where edith stand wait to receive he tremble with agitation and joy when the first burst of emotion at this long-desired meeting with he wife and hitherto unknown child have subside roger warmly welcome the friend who have so kindly protect they during they long journey and bring they to the wild spot that be now he only home he then lead they to the canoe and with winslow 's assistance soon row they to the other side and conduct they to he infant settlement the hut be indeed erect and cover in with shingle roof but they appearance promise little of outward comfort to edith yet a inward joy and satisfaction be now permit to she which at one time she have never hope to enjoy again on earth and all externals be as nothing when compare with this nevertheless she exert herself with all a woman 's taste and skill to arrange the simple furniture of the hut and even to add a something of decoration and both she husband and winslow wonder at the improvement which she soon effect in the appearance of the dwelling and the ingenuity with which she convert the rudest material into article of use or ornament she joyous spirit and active moment give a life and animation to the hitherto dreary scene and roger feel that he have indeed in she a helpmate who would cheer the loneliest situation and shed a grace and charm ever poverty itself winslow appreciate all she excellent and amiable quality very highly also and yet he lament the lot of both he friend who have to endure in this comparative solitude all the struggle and all the hardship that the pilgrim father have once encounter and have now conquer but the visit of this ` great and pious soul ' as roger describe edward winslow very greatly cheer the heart of the exile he remain for many week in the new settlement and only leave it when the advance of the season warn he that the short indian summer be draw to a end a vessel which arrive at that time from plymouth and which bring the wife and family of several of the settler afford he the means of return by sea and avoid the tedious land journey he depart with the thanks and blessing of he friend to convey to edith 's parent the happy intelligence that she be both well and happy and that it be evident she cheerful spirit have power to sustain she through every difficulty by which she might be surround chapter xxii ` epictetus say : every thing have two handle the art of take thing by the right handle or the better side -- which charity always doth -- would save much of those jangling and heart-burning that so abound in the world ' archbishop leighton for a long period a unbroken peace have subsist between the english settler and the native tribe but this could no longer be maintain and a succession of petty injury and mutual misunderstanding bring about a state of hostility that the pilgrim father have labor -- and generally with success -- to avert they kind and equitable treatment of the indian have not be as we have have occasion to show adopt by the later emigrant and doubt and suspicion have take the place of that confidence and respect with which the red man have soon learn to regard the settler of new plymouth the recent colony of connecticut which be compose of band of settler from plymouth and massachusett and also a few dutch planter first come into hostile collision with the native the settler of new plymouth have enter upon a almost desert land those of massachusett have ensure to themselves safety by they superior strength and those among the narragansett be protect from injury by the friendly feeling of the neighbor indian but the settlement of connecticut be surround by hardy and hostile race and could only enjoy security so long as the mutual hatred of the native tribe prevent they from unite against the intruder in the extreme west of the narragansett district and near the entrance of long island sound dwell a powerful division of the pequodee of that race of red warrior whose pride and ambition cause they to be both fear and hate by the other tribe in the vicinity they could bring upward of seven hundred warrior into the field and they chief sassacus have in common with almost all the great indian sagamore a number of subordinate chief who yield to he a certain degree of obedience the narragansett be the only tribe that could at all compete in strength with the fierce and haughty pequodee and they young chieftain miantonomo be already regard by sassacus as a dangerous rival such be the feeling that exist among the tribe near the settlement of connecticut when a event occur that disturb the peace of the whole community two merchant of virginium who have long dwelt in massachusett and who be engage in trafficking with the connecticut settler be suddenly and treacherously attack by a party of pequodee and with they attendant barbarously murder and shortly afterwards another trader name oldham meet the same fate be assassinate while he be quietly sleep in he boat by some indian who have but a hour before be converse with he in a friendly manner this latter murder do not take place actually among the pequodee but on a small island belong to the narragansett call block island but the inhabitant deny all knowledge of its perpetration and the murderer flee to the pequodee by whom they be receive and sheltered a strong suspicion therefore lay on they as be guilty of the latter crime as well as the former the government of massachusett immediately resolve on punish the offender and a troop of eighty or ninety man be send off to block island to seek for the murderer the native endeavor to oppose they landing but after a short contest they flee and hide themselves in the wood for two day the boston soldier remain on the island burning and devastate the village and field end firing at random into the thicket but without see a single be they then break up the canoe that lay on the beach and sail away to the country of the pequodee to insist on the guilty individual be deliver to they and on this condition to offer peace but neither the murderer nor they protector be to be find all have flee to the forest and the marsh whither the english could not follow they and they merely succeed in killing and wound a few straggler and burn the hut that come in they way this fruitless expedition render the pequodee bolder than ever and the neighbor town be harass by they nightly attack and notwithstanding all they precaution and the patrol that be set on every side the savage fall on the whites whenever they be at work in the distant field they slew the man with they tomahawk end drag they wretched wife and daughter away to captivity and thus in a short time thirty of the english settler have become the victim of they fury meanwhile messenger be send to plymouth and massachusett to implore they aid and the latter state promise two hundred soldier and the former forty which be as many as its small population could afford the pequodee dread the power of the english endeavor to move the narragansett -- who have from the most distant time be they rival and enemy -- to join they in a offensive and defensive alliance against the white man whom they represent as a common foe to the indian and the future destroyer of they race this intended confederation be discover by roger william who spend much of he time in visit the indian village and instruct the native with all of whom he obtain a remarkable degree of influence this noble-minded and truly christian-spirited man immediately seize the opportunity of repay with benefit the heavy injury that he have receive from the massachusett and with a admirable magnanimity and self devotion he set himself to prevent the dangerous alliance the government of massachusett be well aware that william be the only man who could effect this desirable object and on hearing from he of the scheme of sassacus they immediately request the former victim of they unjust persecution to employ he influence with the native for the benefit of he countryman : and well and zealously be comply with this request he leave he now comfortable home and all the various employment that occupy he time and travel restlessly from place to place defy the storm and the wave in a miserable canoe and meeting with a undaunted courage the assemble party of hostile tribe whom he seek at he own extreme peril to bring into alliance with the english he succeed in he patriotic object and after along doubtful negotiation he persuade the narragansett to refuse the proffer coalition with the pequodee they young chief miantonomo even go a journey to boston where he be receive with distinguished mark of honor and respect and sign a treaty which ally he to the settler against he own countryman the troops from the river-town assemble together and go down the connecticut to attack the pequodee in they own land they number be but small -- not exceed eighty man -- as each town furnish a much weaker force than have be promise but they be join by a band of the mohican a hardy race inhabit the valley of the connecticut and who have be alienate from the pequodee by the oppression and arrogance that have excite the enmity of so many other tribe the combined force of the english and indian be place under the command of captain mason a brave and intelligent officer who have serve in the netherland under general fairfax the detachment that be expect from new plymouth be not ready to march at the time of the troops take the field captain standish therefore do not set out himself but he allow such of he brother - soldier as be ready to precede he and take part in the commencement of the campaign among these rodolph maitland who still retain all the fire and energy of he youth be the foremost and he lead a little band of brave companion to the place of rendezvous the learn minister stone -- the friend and colleague of hooker -- accompany the troops from boston for a band of puritanical warrior would have think themselves but badly provide for without such spiritual aid the instruction of the government of connecticut direct mason to land in the harbor of pequod -lrb- \* -rrb- and thus attack the indian force on they own ground but he find the natural strength of the place so much greater than he expect and also observe that it be so watchfully guard by he enemy that he resolve to pass on to the harbor in narragansett bay and after have strengthen he force with the warrior promise by miantonomo to attack the pequodee from thence a circumstance occur here that be so characteristic of the time and of the manners of the puritan that it must not be omit the officer under mason be dissatisfy with this alteration in the plan of the campaign and assert that the instruction give to the commander ought to be literally follow it be therefore resolve to refer the question to the minister who be direct ` to bring down by prayer the responsive decision of the lord ' stone pass nearly the whole night in prayer and supplication for wisdom to decide the matter and the next morning declare to the officer that the view take by they leader be the right one on which they all submit without a murmur -lrb- footnote : now newhaven -rrb- the indian reinforcement continue to increase miantonomo bring two hundred warrior and other ally tribe join they on they march until the number of native auxiliary amount to five hundred in these mason place little confidence and would gladly have await the arrival of the forty man from plymouth who be already at providence on they way to join he but he man be eager to attack the savage and the indian taunt he with cowardice for desire to delay the conflict and he be force to advance at once the great strength of the pequodee consist in two large fort in one of which the redoubted chief sassacus himself command the other be situate on the bank of the mystic a inconsiderable river that run parallel to the connecticut these indian fort or castle consist of wooden palisade thirty or forty foot high generally erect on a elevated situation and enclose a space sufficiently large to contain a considerable number of wigwam for the aged man -- or whitehead -- and the woman and child these two fortress be the pride and the confidence of the pequodee who believe they to be invulnerable as indeed they have hitherto find they to the assault of they own countryman and the other indian tribe appear to hold they in the same estimation for when they find that it be mason 's intention to march directly to the fort on the mystic they courage fail completely they be only accustomed to the indian mode of warfare which consist in secret attack and cunning stratagem and the idea of brave the terrible pequodee in they stronghold overpower they resolution the very warrior who only the day before have boast of they deed now be crest-fallen and cry out ` sassacus be a god he be invincible ' and they desert in troops and return to they own dwelling thus the english find themselves deprive of at least a hundred of they narragansett ally the rest remain with they as do also the mohican but they fear of the pequodee be so great that mason could only employ they as a sort of rear-guard meanwhile these haughty indian be exult in they suppose security and indulge in song and feast they believe that the english be terrify at they strength and reputed number and have flee from the intended place of landing in pequod harbor in fear and have abandon they enterprise altogether they therefore amuse themselves with fishing in the bay and then invite they ally to join they revel they pass the night in vaunting of they own great action and defy the cowardly whites we have see that they assume arrogance have arouse the jealousy and hatred of most of the neighbor tribe but there be still a few who adhere to they cause and be willing to unite with they against the british intruder among those none be more powerful or more zealous than the nausett -- that tribe which have so greatly harass and annoy the first settler at plymouth and which still retain the same feeling of enmity that have then influence they the presence of henrich among that portion of the tribe that be govern by tisquantum have indeed secure to himself the respect and regard of almost the whole community but it have not weaken the strong prejudice that they as well as the main body of they tribe entertain against he race or lessen they ardent desire to rid the land of the powerful invader sassacus be well acquaint with the sentiment of he nausett ally and he have lose no time in secure the co-operation of the sagamore of the tribe as soon as he know that the british troops be prepare to attack he and he have also dispatch a swift messenger to meet tisquantum and he warrior and entreat they to use all possible expedition to join he in he own fortress and assist in defend it against he enemy with the present position and intended movement of tisquantum 's party the pequodee chief be perfectly conversant for there be one in he castle who be acquaint with the plan of the nausett and have only leave they council when they camp be pitch on the bank of the great missourus this individual have reason of he own besides he wish to strengthen he countryman against the english for desire the presence of tisquantum 's warrior in the approach contest he hope to place henrich in such a position that he would have no alternative but either to lead the nausett against he own people or to excite they distrust and even hatred by refuse to do so he expect and wish that he should adopt the latter course for he know that he have himself still many secret adherent in the tribe who would gladly make this a excuse for withdraw they allegiance from the white sachem and bestow it on he and thus at length the long-sought object of he restless ambition might he attain and then -- then revenge -- that burn passion of he soul -- might quickly be also satiate it be now many month since coubitant have escape the punishment that be due to he many crime and have flee from the wrath of tisquantum but he have contrived to keep up a exact knowledge of the movement of the tribe and even a intercourse with he own treacherous partisan often indeed as the nausett travel slowly across the wide plain between the missourus and the mississippus that well-known and terrible eye of fire be fix upon they from the elevated bough of some thick tree or from the overhang summit of a neighbor rock and often at night when the camp be sink in the silence of repose he guilty confederate creep forth to meet he in some retired spot and form plan for the future in this way coubitant dodge the path of the nausett while they traverse the forest and savanna the lull and the valley that lead they at length to the great lake now so well know as lake superior here they encamp for a considerable time in order to construct a sufficient number of canoe to carry the whole party across it and also by follow the chain of lake and river that intersect that part of the great continent and end in lake ontario to enable they to land at no very great distance from they own native district when the little fleet set out on its long and circuitous voyage coubitant actually contrived to be one of the passenger he partisan secure a canoe to themselves and pretend that some of they arrangement be incomplete they linger on the shore until the rest of the boat be nearly out of sight they then summon they leader from he place of concealment and give he a seat in the canoe follow at they leisure thus he perform the whole of the voyage and when the tribe land on the eastern shore of ontario and recommence they wanderings on land he leave they route and hasten forward to try and contrive some scheme that could further he own view the news of the war between the english and he old friend the pequodee soon reach he and in a incredibly short time he arrive in they country and join sassacus in he fortified village it be he who travel from thence to the head-quarter of the nausett near cape cod and secure they assistance in the come conflict and then return in time to send a trusty emissary to meet tisquantum and deliver to he a courteous message from sassacus this message have the desire effect for tisquantum call a council of he brave and submit to they the request of they powerful ally that they would fight with he against the narragansett the emissary be instruct to say nothing of the quarrel with the english for coubitant wish to get henrich into the power of the pequodee before he become aware of the service that be to be require of he and he trust that no intelligence would reach he in the desolate country through which he and he warrior would have to march all the assemble council be unanimous in they decision that the request of sassacus should be comply with and tisquantum then turn to henrich who sit beside he and say -- ` my son the day be past when i could lead forth my warrior to the battle and wield my tomahawk with the best and the bravest i must sit in my tent with the child and the squaw and tell of the deed that i once could perform while my young brave be in the field of fight you must now be they leader henrich and let they see that though you skin be fair you have in you breast a indian heart ' ' i will my father ' reply the young sachem ` you warrior shall be lead into the thickest of the battle even as if you long-lost tekoa go before they with he glance spear tisquantum shall never have cause to feel shame for the son of he adoption ' ' i know it my brave henrich ' say the old chief ' i know that the honor of tisquantum 's race be safe in you hand and that you will fight in defense of my ancient friend and ally even as i would have fight in the day of my young strength come away now my warrior must prepare to go with the messenger of the great sassacus no time must be lose in give he the aid he ask and you my son will be ready by to-morrow 's dawn to lead they on they way i can not go with you for these feeble limb be unfit to travel at the speed with which you must cross the forest and the plain neither could the woman and child bear it we will follow the course that we design to take and go to the land of my father in the far east and there we will wait for we victorious warrior ' as tisquantum say this he leave the hall of council which consist of a shadow maple tree and lead he companion to the hut of bough in which oriana and mailah sit anxiously await the result of the conference they do not regret when they hear that they husband be to hasten to the scene of war for they be indian woman and could glory in the deed of they warrior but when they be inform that the main body of the tribe be to pursue the intended route towards paomet -lrb- \* -rrb- they grief and disappointment be very great -lrb- footnote : cape cod -rrb- ` must i leave you henrich ' exclaimed oriana ` must i know that you be in the battle-field and wound perhaps and want my aid and i far away let I go with you you know that oriana can bear danger and fatigue and hardship and with you there would be no danger ' ` it can not be ' reply henrich gently but decidedly ` you father can not travel as we must do with no respite or repose and you my oriana could not leave he and we boy you must go with they to paomet my love and prepare a home for I after the fight be do the camp of the fierce pequodee be no place for you ' oriana feel that she husband be right and she say no more but she do not the less sorrowfully assist he in he preparation for the journey and the battle or feel less keenly the grief of separation when at daybreak on the follow morning he and he warrior be ready to set out ` my son ' say tisquantum as he grasp the hand of henrich ' i have one request -- i would rather say command -- to impress upon you before we part let it not be know in the camp that you be a pale-face i know that you good arm will bring glory on yourself and those who follow you and i would have that glory belong to my own people among whom you have learn to fight i ask it also for you own sake for in the camp of sassacus there may be some who regard you race with jealousy and hatred and would not bear to see a pale-face excel the red man you may trust my warrior they look on you as they would have do on my tekoa but you may not trust either we indian friend or we indian foe ' henrich regard this precaution as needless yet when oriana join she entreaty to those of she father he readily give the promise require he costume and accoutrements be strictly native and constant exposure to the air and sun have burn he skin almost to a copper color but he eye be a deep blue and he hair though now dark have a rich auburn glow upon it that differ greatly from the jet black lock so universal among the indian to hide this oriana gather it up into a knot on the top of he head in native fashion and cover it with a close black cap over this he sachem 's coronet of feather be place and it would have require a very scrutinise and suspicious eye to have detect the disguise the blue eye alone give intimation of a european extraction and they be so shaded by long black lash and have a expression so deep and penetrate that few could discover of what color they be the tongue of hannah too have learn to speak the indian language with a pure native accent that no one could acquire who have not be bring up among the red man so that there be little fear of he be know for a pale-face amid the excitement and confusion of the war the warrior depart and tisquantum 's party resume they journey though not so joyously as before they separation from those who be go to meet danger and perhaps death with unremitting speed the nausett brave pursue they way and reach the land of the pequodee before the campaign have begin sassacus have as we have see take up he position in one of he boast fort and he want no reinforcement there for he presence be regard by he people as a panoply of strength he therefore send to desire the nausett detachment to march to fort mystic and assist the garrison there in defend it against any attack that might he make chapter xxiii ` merciful god how horrible be night ... there the shout of battle the barbarian yell the bray of dissonant instrument the clang of arm the shriek of agony the groan of death in one wild uproar and continuous din shake the still air while overhead the moon regardless of the stir of this low world hold on she heavenly way ' madoc henrich be now call on to perform the part of a indian leader in a indian camp it be no new position to he for during he year of wander with the nansett he have take a active part in many of the war that be be wage by the tribe among whom they have sojourn against they hostile neighbor he therefore be fully conversant with indian mode of warfare but he be as unaccustomed as he follower be to the defense of a fortress or to a pitched battle between assemble force in a open field he have not be long at fort mystic ere he find that he be about to be oppose to some of he own countryman and the information fill he with grief and dismay it be true he have dwell so long among the nausett indian and all he personal interest be so bind up with theirs that he feel as if they be indeed he kindred but still he heart yearn towards he own people and the friend of he childhood and the idea of be instrumental in shed the blood of a briton be utterly repugnant to he it be now however too late to retract he have pledge he word to tisquantum that he would lead he warrior bravely against the foe of he ally and honor forbid he to decline the post of they sachem and commander he therefore conceal he scruple and anxiety in he own breast and resolve to do what he now feel to be he duty it be with much satisfaction that he learn from one of the indian spy that the detachment of troops from new plymouth have be unable to join the force of they countryman for thus he should be spare the trial of be place in opposition to those with whom perhaps he have be bring up in childhood towards the other settler be entertain a far less friendly feeling as report of they cruel and unjust conduct towards the native have from time to time reach he during he residence in different part of the continent the pequodee and they ally treat he with respect and honor as the representative of they ancient friend tisquantum and if he english blood be know to any of they they make no remark on the subject they do not dare to notice what such a man as the nausett sachem appear to be choose to conceal but it be certain that there be one in the fortress of mystic whose keen eye have penetrate the disguise and to whom the feature of henrich be so familiar that he could even read he thought in he open and ingenuous countenance coubitant be already in the castle before the nausett detachment arrive and while he dexterously contrived to conceal himself from henrich he watch he narrowly and he eye be on he when he first become aware that english soldier be with the foe with whom he must contend then do the savage exult in the painful struggle that he could perceive the news excite in he rival 's breast and he hope that the white sachem would find some pretext for leave the fort and desert to he own countryman he keep spy continually watch he every movement with order to allow he full liberty to escape but to follow and secure he before he purpose could be effect and bring he in bond to receive from coubitant 's own hand the punishment of a coward and a deserter but he wait in vain for any such attempt on the part of the young sachem henrich never leave the fortress and employ himself in endeavor to keep he man from share in the revelry and wild security of they countryman in this endeavor he have but little success and jyanough alone remain with he friend and take no part in the noisy song and dance that follow the feast and con-tinned almost until midnight then a deep and profound stillness gradually succeed to the barbarous noise of the wild festival and long before day-break the exhaust reveller be all bury in a heavy sleep even the watch whose business it be to patrol round the fort have that night carelessly leave they respective station and come inside the palisade to light they pipe here they find none awake but the nausett sachem and he friend who be slowly walk among the weary and sleep warrior attend only by a large and powerful dog there be another wakeful eye in the fortress and that be even now fix on henrich bat he whose dark soul look forth from that singular eye be himself conceal from view and be intently watch the object of he hatred and hope that he would now attempt some act of cowardice or treachery henrich and jyanough approach the guard who have thus thoughtlessly leave they post and desire they immediately to return to they duty but while the man remonstrate on the uselessness of so strictly keep a watch now that no present attack could be expect they be startle by the loud and furious bark of rodolph who have wander to the open gate and thus give ominous warning of approach danger the terrify guard now reach to the gate accompany by henrich and jyanough when to they dismay they behold in the faint moonlight a large body of man approach close to the fort they easily discern that the foremost of the troop be european and they raise a loud cry of ` owannux owannux ' -- englishman englishman -- which quickly arouse the sleeper and bring they towards the gate in the next minute the fort be thickly hem in by the british force and a second dense ring be form beyond they by they indian ally the main entrance be soon force by the sword and musket of the vigorous assailant and though the pequodee fight with all the fury of despair they be drive back and compel to retreat towards the wigwam they be closely pursue by they foe and at length throw themselves into the hut which contain the terrify woman and child and resolve to defend they to the last gasp while the murderous strife continue the light of day begin to dawn and soon the full glow of the rise sun reveal the work that have be do in darkness the ground be strew with dead and die indian but the band of english warrior be yet unbroken and be fiercely bear onward towards the wigwam they number be small indeed when compare with those of they opponent but the latter have no firearm and a panic seem to have strike they from the force and suddenness of the attack still they defend the line of wigwam with desperation until mason with amazing boldness enter one of they and seize a brand from the hearth set fire to the roof of reed a indian warrior be in the act of level he arrow at he when a english officer spring forward and cut the string of the bent bow with he sword this officer catch the eye of henrich and though he know not why rivet it by a strange and unaccountable attraction he be a noble - look man and though he dark hair be slightly tinge with gray he muscular limb have apparently lose none of they force and he spirit none of its courage and energy so fixedly be the attention of henrich fasten on the gallant soldier that for a time he be regardless of the battle that rage around he and of the fearful conflagration that be spread along the indian hut these be only compose of weed and dry moss and reed and the flame quickly catch hold of they and promise soon to bring the conflict to a dreadful close the eye of henrich be still fix on that noble english officer and the instinctive feeling of admiration and respect with which he aspect inspire he be increase by see he regardless of he own safety actively engage in rescue a indian woman and she child from a mass of burn ruin he have be observe by other eye also -- by eye that recognize he and glare with irrepressible fury as they fall on he ' a indian warrior approach he from behind while he be unguardedly pursue he work of mercy and henrich see the savage prepare to strike a deadly blow that would have cleft the head of the stranger in twain could he stand and see the noble briton thus fall by a secret and unresisted attack no every feeling and every instinct of he heart forbid it one instant he tomahawk fly in a gleaming circle round he head and the next it fall with crush force on the right shoulder of the savage and sink deeply into he chest it be a timely blow and save the white man 's life but it could not save he from a severe wound in the back where the axe of the indian fall heavily as he arm drop powerlessly by he side -- never to be raise again coubitant sink on the ground and as he turn to look on he unexpected assailant he blood-shot eye meet those of henrich and glare fiercely first at he and then at he intended victim whose life have be so strangely preserve they stand side by side unconscious of the tie that bind they so closely together coubitant know it well and he feel in this awful moment that mahneto have in righteous retribution send the son to preserve the father 's life from the hand of he who have hate both alike he hate they still : and even with he die breath he would not reveal the secret that would have unite those seemingly hostile warrior in the embrace of deep affection rodolph have not see the friend whose timely aid have partially avert the deadly blow that have be aim at he by the savage but on turn round he be astonish to perceive that he foe and he avenger be apparently of the same party the latter -- whose countenance express the deepest indignation and who be raise he bloody hatchet from the prostrate form of the wounded indian -- be evidently not one of the ally of the english and he dress and ornament and air of dignified command indicate he to be a chief among he own people why then have he come to the aid of a enemy rodolph gaze inquiringly at the fine countenance of the young sachem which be now bent upon the die indian at he foot ` coubitant ' he exclaim in the nausett tongue ` be it indeed you whom i have thus slay unknowingly you have be a bitter and a untiring enemy to I but it be not for this that i smote thee to the earth i know you not but i saw you aim a cowardly blow at the white chief and i save he i forgive you now for all you hatred and all you evil design which mahneto have thus recompense upon you own head ' ' i ask not you forgiveness ' reply the savage in a deep struggle voice -- for the hand of death be on he and the dark fire of he eye be wane out ` in death i hate and defy you and in death i enjoy a revenge that you know not of ' he strive to raise he hand in menace but it fall to the ground and with a groan of suppress agony he expire the fight be rage with unabated violence and the conflagration have already spread to the farthest end of the fortress henrich look around for he comrade who be bravely contend with they powerful foe at some distance and he hastily prepare to join they but as he turn away he courteously wave he hand to rodolph and say in the english language but with a indian accent ` farewell brave englishman ' rodolph start that voice have thrill through he heart when it have speak a strange language : but now it strike upon he with a sense of familiarity that be could not account for as the indian chief be evidently a utter stranger to he he return he parting salutation and ` farewell ' but still he watch he retreat form and think he distinctly hear he utter the name ` rodolph ' as a large dog which have stand near he during they brief encounter bound after he over foe heap of slay and die ` surely it be my own fancy that conjure up that name ' thought rodolph the next moment he find himself compel again to join the conflict and at the head of he little band to fight he way out of the fortress which be rapidly become a prey to the devour flame all the english withdraw outside the palisade and thickly surround the fort while they indian ally who have hitherto keep aloof now take courage to approach and form a second circle outside the most furious despair now take possession of the soul of the devoted pequodee : and they terrible war-cry be hear resounding high and mingled with the agonising yell of the woman and child and helpless aged man who be expire amid the flame many of the warrior climb the palisade and leap down among they foe hope to escape but they be quickly despatch by the musket and bayonet of the english or if any have power to break through the first hostile line they fall beneath the battle-axis of the mohican rodolph have receive a considerable wound but it have not entirely disabled he at the head of he man he pass through the open gate of the fortress and attempt still to lead and command they he find however that he strength be fail and that he could no longer wield he good broad sword he therefore stand lean on it and watch with mingle feeling of pity and horror the progress of the work of destruction presently he see a side entrance to the fort throw suddenly open and the form of the indian chief -- whose tomahawk have save he life and whose voice have awaken such strange feeling -- appear rush forth he be attend by another striking look warrior and follow by a band of determine native who be resolve to escape or sell they life dearly rodolph 's man who occupy the position opposite to that gate raise they musket to fire on these brave man but they commander loudly and authoritatively bid they desist ` hold i command you ' he exclaim ` let that noble chieftain escape and all he attendant for he sake he save my life in the fort and death to the man who injure he he attempt to rush forward to enforce he order but pain and loss of blond prevent he from move and he would have fall but for the support of one of he comrade meanwhile henrich and jyanough and they band of nausett have rush through the unopposing rank of the english and be now contend desperately with the indian line beyond the british troops pause and look after they and the sympathy that brave man feel for each other prevent any of they from attempt to pursue or molest they on the contrary all now wish they success with breathless anxiety rodolph gaze after they and watch the towering plume that adorn the noble head of the sachem as he bear onward through the oppose crowd of indian he pass and gain the plain beyond attend by he follower and from the elevated position at which the fort be erect rodolph could still watch the little band retire until the indian hero be hide from view by a thicket so fiercely have the fire second the effort of the english that the whole conflict only last one hour in that brief space of time between five and six hundred indian -- young and old man and woman -- be destroy by fire and sword and the small remainder be make prisoner of war by the english or carry off as prize by the hostile native only two of the british soldier be slay but many be wound and the arrow remain some time in the wound and the want of necessary medicine and refreshment add greatly to they suffering the medical attendant attach to the expedition and the provision have all be leave in the boat and a march of more than six mile through they enemy ' land be necessary in order to reach they litter be therefore construct and in these the wound be send off under the charge of the mohican while the able-bodied man whose number be reduce to little more than forty prepare to follow as a rear-guard the whole party be still near the smoking ruin of the fort when they be startle by perceive a large body of armed native approach these be a band of more than three hundred pequodee send by sassacus to aid the garrison of fort mystic happily they do not discover the small number of the english who be in a condition to oppose they and they turn aside and avoid a re-encounter the white man take advantage of this mistake on the part of they enemy and hasten forward with all the speed that circumstance would allow but they have not proceed far when they ear be assail by the most discordant yell from the pequodee they have reach the scene of devastation and when they behold the ruin fort and the ground strew with hundred of mangled corpse and expire friend they fury know no bound they stamp and howl with rage and grief and madly tear they hair while they give vent to they excite feeling in that fearful and peculiar yell at the sound of which the stoutest heart might quail then with a wild and desperate effort at revenge they rush down the bill in pursuit of they cruel enemy the rear - guard turn and meet the onset bravely the savage be receive with a shower of bullet which check they furious assault but they hang on the rear of the english and harass they during the whole of they retreat they however reach they vessel in safety and arrive in triumph at hartford from which port they have sail three week

themselves to other tribe and the sachem then destroy he second fortress end carry off he treasure to the land of the mohawk near the river hudson and with he principal chief join that warlike race meanwhile the remainder of the troops from massachusett whom the government have not think it necessary to send with captain mason have land at saybroke lead by captain houghton and attend by wilson as they spiritual guide they arrive just in time to hear of the successful issue of the campaign and have therefore nothing leave for they to do except to join a small band from connecticut and keep down or destroy the few pequodee or other hostile indian who still lurk about the district and keep the settler in fear and anxiety these wretched native be chase into they most secret haunt where they be barbarously slay they wigwam be burnt and they field desolate nor be the english the only foe of the once terrible pequodee they indian rival take advantage of they present weak and scattered condition to wreak upon they the suppress vengeance of bygone year and pursue with ruthless cruelty those whose very name have once inspire they with awe and dread and yet -- with shame be it say -- the _ christian _ leader of the troops of massachusett himself a member of the strict and exclusive church of boston surpass these savage in cruelty on one occasion he make prisoner of nearly a hundred pequodee of these miserable creature he send the wife and child into servitude at boston while he cause the man -- thirty-seven in number -- to be bind hand and foot and carry in a shallop

of the treasure that be have bring with he from he own lose dominion and he heart be send by he murderer as a peace-offering to the government of connecticut thus end the war which have be commence as a necessary measure of self-defence and in which the pious and high-minded roger william have at first take so active and influential a part the manner in which it be carry out and the cruelty that mark so many of its detail be repulsive in the highest degree to he just and benevolent spirit but where mercy be concern he opinion and advice have no influence with the stern man of boston the only act which meet with he approbation in the conclusion of the campaign be the assignment of the depopulate land of the pequodee to unca the chief of the mohican as be a conquer territory the usual law of war would have annex it to the territory of the victor but in this case the settler adhere to they original principle of only obtain by purchase from the native those tract of land on which they desire to settle and a great part of that which be now bestow on unca be afterwards buy back from he and he inferior sachem or obtain by friendly contract until the english become possessor of the whole district at a subsequent period the pequodee who have escape from they desolated land and join other tribe assemble themselves together and make one final effort at establish they independence in a distant part of the country but they power and prosperity be break for ever captain mason be again send to subdue this remnant of the tribe and the destruction that be accomplish on these unhappy

clear depths with unalloyed delight i hear they still unchanged though some from earth be music part and the tone of mirth -- wild silvery tone that ring through day more bright have die in other -- yet to I they come singing of boyhood back -- the voice of my home ' heman one sabbath evening a few month after the event relate in the last chapter and when the short second indian summer that so often return late in the month of September be at its height the inhabitant of new plymouth be assemble at they meeting-house on ` the bury hill ' and engage at they usual devotions none be leave in they dwelling except those whom age or sickness prevent from join the rest of the congregation or those who be necessarily detain by the care of young child the habitation of rodolph maitland be therefore desert by all but janet who would gladly have go that evening to listen to the husband of she young mistress for roger william be to lead the prayer of the congregation and to deliver to they the customary address but edith 's little girl demand she care and old janet take too much pride and pleasure in the interesting child to repine at have the charge of she even though it prevent she from attend at the meeting-house on the first occasion of roger 's officiate there since he marriage little edith be just begin to walk alone and it be she delight to play in the bright sunny garden and pluck the gay flower that still bloom there in profusion she be thus engage and murmur a sweet but inarticulate song that she mother have attempt to teach she when janet apprehend no danger return for a moment to the house to perform some domestic duty just then a stranger follow by a large dog enter the garden by the wicket gate that lead towards the forest and stand silently gaze around he without at first observe the happy and occupied child he be tall and of a commanding appearance and he costume which be richly ornamented in the indian fashion bespeak he to be a native of high rank but have any one closely examine he countenance they would have discover beneath those long dark lash and clearly marked eyebrow the deep blue eye of the saxon race which be also indicate by the rich brown hair that now unconcealed wave across he manly forehead a keen eye would also have detect on the feature of that seeming indian sachem a expression of deep thought and strong emotion that tell of old remembrance not yet obliterate and of feeling that belong to home and kindred yes henrich be indeed absorb in those recollection that be revive in he breast by the sight of object once so familiar but which many year have elapse since last he have look on much be change : but much be still the same the rude hut commodious log-house that once stand on that site be now replace by a substantial and picturesque dwelling in the elizabethan style of architecture whose deep bay window be hang with the sweet single rose that be native of the wood and other flowering plant while wreath of the well-known virginian creeper now glowing in its scarlet hue of autumn climb to the summit of the carve gable and pinnacle that ornament the building and hang from thence in rich festoon on the front of this dwelling the evening sun fall brightly and its slanting beam likewise partially illuminate the garden with long streak of light while other part be throw into strong shadow by the tree and shrub that grow among the flower-bed one of these -- a noble tulip-tree -- rise in the center of the enclosure and stretch its giant arm wide on every side on this tree the eye of the wanderer rest long and then he approach it and stand look wistfully towards a bower that be situate near the old tree and over which the creeper fall in wild luxuriance be it a tear that glitter in that warlike stranger 's eye as a ray from the western sun fall on he face through the thick overhang foliage and do those manly limb tremble as he clasp he hand over he face and sink on the rustic seat beneath the tulip-tree ' i can not enter the house ' he exclaim in a low voice ' i can not seek those loved one there where once we dwell in happiness together and where perhaps none now remain to welcome the wanderer home o that some one would appear who might tell I of they fate ' henrich speak to himself in he native tongue he could not speak a strange language in that old familiar spot and he voice attract the notice of the little girl who be now slowly move towards he she hand fill with the spoil of the flower-bed she stop and gaze at the stranger and then utter a faint cry of fear that at once rouse henrich from he reverie he eye fall on the lovely child and instantly he memory recall the feature and expression of he brother ludovico to whom the little edith bear a strong resemblance with a irresistible impulse he spring forward and catch the little girl in he arm and seek by caress to soothe she fear and hush she cry of terror but those cry have catch the watchful ear of janet and with all the speed that she could use she come run from the house merely anticipate that she charge have fall down or be alarm at find herself alone what be then she terror and amazement at see she in the arm of a indian one instant she stand rivet to the spot not know how to act the next she turn and again hurry in to the house from whence she escape by a back door and speed breathlessly towards ` the bury hill ' she know that the service be over -- for the last strain of the parting hymn have be bear down by the evening breeze as she leave the house -- and therefore she would find help and succor from the return congregation that deep melodious sound have be hear by henrich also and it have strike a chord in he heart that vibrate almost to agony the stillness and abstraction of he look as he listen to the die cadence silence the cry of the little child she gaze into he upturned eye and possibly she feel that those eye have a expression that be neither strange nor terrible -- for now she suffer the stranger to seat himself again on the bench beneath the tulip tree and place she gently on he knee such be the picture that meet the eye of edith and she husband and parent as they rush into the garden follow by the tremble and exhaust janet ` my child my edith ' shriek the young mother and spring towards the tree that name tell a long history to the wanderer which he heart have already guess the indian warrior rise but he do not fly no he only meet the terrify mother and as he place she child in she tremble arm he fold they both in he own in amazement and indignation at this rude action roger now catch he arm and in the indian tongue inquire hastily -- ` who be you and what can cause this freedom ' i be henrich maitland ' exclaim the stranger ` and the lord have bring I back to my home once more ' oh the music -- the thrilling startling music -- of those word to the ear and heart of those who bad so long believe he dead the surprise and joy be too intense for helen and she sink faint into the arm of she long-lost son : while rodolph grasp he hand and exclaim with deep emotion -- ` now god be praise my brave my bless son surely he mercy be infinite and he way past find out now i know why my heart yearn so strangely towards the indian chief who save my life in the fort of mystic and why he voice have such a thrilling and familiar tone that speak of home and bygone year look on I my henrich and say do you not recognize the english soldier whom you generous interference preserve from a dreadful death ' the change in rodolph 's dress and he own overpowering emotion have hitherto prevent henrich from discover that in the noble-looking man whom he be proud to call he father he also behold that gallant british officer whose appearance have so powerfully attract he in the conflict of fort mystic but when he look into that fine countenance he well remember every feature and he wonder why he have not know he even when they meet so unexpectedly in the excitement of the battle that be a happy hour and in the joy of meeting so many that he love henrich for awhile forget that any one be miss but soon be look around as if seek some familiar object which do not meet he eye he fear to ask for ludovico : but he father see the inquire look and guess its import ` he be go ' he say gently ` you brother do not remain with we long after you have leave we and he young spirit be now where we believe that yours have long be dwelling in peace he would have rejoice to see this day dear henrich for he as well as edith mourn you loss sincerely but he be happy now and we will not regret he the lord have restore to we one of we son in a manner so strange and under such extraordinary circumstance that we can hardly realize the blessing tell we henrich how this have be bring about ' the violent agitation occasion by such a meeting have now somewhat subside and the wanderer could calmly relate the story of he adventure while he mother and sister sit on each side of he gaze fondly at he much-changed but still familiar countenance and the scarcely less interested janet seat herself on the turf with little edith on she knee rodolph and roger william also recline on the ground and all be impatient for the narrative ` we group be not complete ' say henrich ` come hither rodolph ' and then address he dog in the indian language he make he lie down at he foot ` then my ear do not deceive I ' exclaim maitland ` when you leave I henrich in the midst of that fearful fray i think i hear you pronounce my name and the sound startle I strangely have you then call you unconscious companion by you father 's name and in all you wanderings and you trial and temptation have that name be dear to you ' ` heaven only know _ how _ dear ' reply the sachem ` the remembrance of my parent and all they teach I in my childhood have be not only my joy and consolation but my safeguard also you will find I very unlearned and ignorant in all worldly knowledge for i have have no means of keep up the little i have acquire but god be praise i have be keep from forget he and the savior in whom you teach I to put my trust nor have i be quite alone in my faith one there be of whom i shall have much to tell you in the course of my history who have be and be my spiritual companion and support i have have many blessing ' ` how truly be it declare not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord ' exclaimed helen as she raise she eye in grateful gratitude to heaven now she and rodolph feel that they have _ indeed _ recover they lost son -- not for time alone but for eternity henrich 's long and adventurous story be tell : and so many be the question and the comment that it call forth that long be it be finish the light of day have all depart and be replace by the softer ray of the unclouded moon it be with mingled feeling of disappointment and of gratitude that henrich 's friend hear of he marriage with a indian female but as he describe she character and speak of she sincere and humble faith and of all that she have be to he since the first day of he captivity they become more than reconcile to the alliance and thank god who have so mercifully provide they son with such a friend and companion to cheer he otherwise lonely life they and edith also feel impatient to become acquaint with this new relative whom they be already prepare to love and as she be now dwelling near cape cod with she father and the rest of she tribe they hope to do so before the winter set in henrich promise that this hope should be compile with but it be a source of sorrow and disappointment to he family when they hear that he be pledge to the aged tisquantum never to take he only and beloved child from he as long as he live he could not therefore at present change he mode of life or take up he abode at new plymouth but must return to dwell with he indian friend and fill the place of tisquantum 's son and representative until the old man should be gather to he father the day that henrich pass in the home of he childhood fly rapidly away all he old friend gather around he to welcome he on he unexpected return and to offer they congratulation to he happy parent and sister the joy of the venerable brewster at again behold he young friend and pupil and at find he still a sincere and intelligent christian be very great and even among those who have never know he he adventurous story and he frank and engaging manners excite the deepest interest between himself and he brother-in-law roger william a strong and lasting friendship be establish and when the time arrive for henrich to return to paomet roger propose to accompany he and assist in escort he wife and child to pay they promise visit to new plymouth this offer be gladly accept and the english minister and the indian chief set out on foot the journey be comparatively easy to man who have long be accustom to such toil and difficulty as both henrich and roger have for year be inure to and they reach paomet very quickly but sorrow meet they there the first sound that fall on they ear as they approach the village be the indian dirge for a depart soul henrich listen for a moment to catch the exact direction from whence the ominous sound proceed and then dart forward with such velocity that roger active as he be could with difficulty follow he henrich hasten towards a large dwelling at the upper end of the village and enter the low door he behold a sight which though it fill he heart with unaffected grief be yet in some sense a relief to he fear it be not for he wife or child that the wail be be make it be tisquantum who lay on the bed of death and who turn he dim and sunken eye towards he as he pass the threshold the old man smile a joyful welcome and hold out he tremble hand to greet he and oriana -- who be seat on the ground by she father 's bedside in a attitude of deep and silent sorrow -- spring to she foot with a cry of joy and throw herself into she husband 's arm burst into a flood of long-suppressed tear ` you be come at lest ' she exclaim ` you be come in time to see my father die and to receive he blessing o henrich how i have hope end prey for you return i fear you would be too late and my beloved father have something to confide to you -- i know he have -- which will fill you soul

would have prove a blessing indeed to the red man and we people would not hate they and seek to destroy they as i once seek to do but enough of this my strength be fail henrich you example have teach I that you god be holy and just and good it have make I feel the truth of the christian 's religion ' tear of humble joy and gratitude glisten in henrich 's eye at this confession he kneel beside the die convert and bow he head upon the bed but he heart be too full to allow he to express he thanksgiving audibly oriana be equally affect but another form kneel beside they and another deep rich voice arise in prayer which be utter fluently in the indian language and in which the heart of all present join fervently although the speaker be a stranger to all but henrich it be roger william who have
