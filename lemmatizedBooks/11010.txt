heathen on this subject as they be represent in _ plato 's _ dialogue upon prayer entitle _ alcibiade the second _ which doubtless give occasion to _ juvenal 's _ tenth satire and to the second satire of _ persius _ as the last of these author have almost transcribe the precede dialogue entitle _ alcibiade the first _ in he fourth satire the speaker in this dialogue upon prayer be _ socrate _ and _ alcibiade _ and the substance of it -lrb- when draw together out of the intricacy and digression -rrb- as follow _ socrate _ meet he pupil _ alcibiade _ as he be go to he devotions and observe he eye to be fix upon the earth with great seriousness and attention tell he that he have reason to be thoughtful on that occasion since it be possible for a man to bring down evil upon himself by he own prayer and that those thing which the god send he in answer to he petition might turn to he destruction : this say he may not only happen when a man pray for what he know be mischievous in its own nature as _ oedipus _ implore the god to sow dissension between he son but when he pray for what he believe would be for he good and against what he believe would be to he detriment this the philosopher shew must necessarily happen among we since most man be blind with ignorance prejudice or passion which hinder they from see such thing as be really beneficial to they for a instance he ask _ alcibiade _ whether he would not be thoroughly pleased and satisfied if that god to whom he be go to address himself should promise to make he the sovereign of the whole earth _ alcibiade _ answer that he should doubtless look upon such a promise as the greatest favor that he could bestow upon he _ socrate _ then ask he if after -lrb- receiving -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- this great favor he would be content -lrb- ed -rrb- to lose he life or if he would receive it though he be sure he should make a ill use of it to both which question _ alcibiade _ answer in the negative socrate then shew he from the example of other how these might very probably be the effect of such a blessing he then add that other reputed piece of good-fortune as that of have a son or procure the highest post in a government be subject to the like fatal consequence which nevertheless say he man ardently desire and would not fail to pray for if they think they prayer might be effectual for the obtain of they have establish this great point that all the most apparent blessing in this life be obnoxious to such dreadful consequence and that no man know what in its event would prove to he a blessing or a curse he teach _ alcibiade _ after what manner he ought to pray in the first place he recommend to he as the model of he devotions a short prayer which a _ greek _ poet compose for the use of he friend in the follow word _ o _ jupiter _ give we those thing which be good for we whether they be such thing as we pray for or such thing as we do not pray for : and remove from we those thing which be hurtful though they be such thing as we pray for _ in the second place that he disciple may ask such thing as be expedient for he he shew he that it be absolutely necessary to apply himself to the study of true wisdom and to the knowledge of that which be he chief good and the most suitable to the excellency of he nature in the third and last place he inform he that the best method he could make use of to draw down blessing upon himself and to render he prayer acceptable would be to live in a constant practice of he duty towards the god and towards man under this head he very much recommend a form of prayer the _ lacedemonian _ make use of in which they petition the god _ to give they all good thing so long as they be virtuous _ under this head likewise he give a very remarkable account of a oracle to the follow purpose when the _ athenian _ in the war with the _ lacedemonian _ receive many defeat both by sea and land they send a message to the oracle of _ jupiter ammon _ to ask the reason why they who erect so many temple to the god and adorn they with such costly offering why they who have institute so many festival and accompany they with such pomp and ceremony in short why they who have slay so many hecatomb at they altar should be less successful than the _ lacedemonian _ who fall so short of they in all these particulars to this say he the oracle make the following reply _ i be better pleased with the prayer of the _ lacedemonian _ than with all the oblation of the _ greek as this prayer imply and encourage virtue in those who make it the philosopher proceed to shew how the most vicious man might be devout so far as victim could make he but that he offering be regard by the god as bribe and he petition as blasphemy he likewise quote on this occasion two verse out of _ homer _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- in which the poet say that the scent of the _ trojan _ sacrifice be carry up to heaven by the wind but that it be not acceptable to the god who be displeased with _ priam _ and all he people the conclusion of this dialogue be very remarkable _ socrate _ have deter _ alcibiade _ from the prayer and sacrifice which he be go to offer by set forth the above-mentioned difficulty of perform that duty as he ought add these word _ we must therefore wait till such time as we may learn how we ought to behave ourselves towards the god and towards man _ but when will that time come say _ alcibiade _ and who be it that will instruct we for i would fain see this man whoever he be it be one say _ socrate _ who take care of you but as _ homer _ tell we -lrb- 3 -rrb- that _ minerva _ remove the mist from _ diomede _ he eye that he might plainly discover both god and man so the darkness that hang upon you mind must be remove before you be able to discern what be good and what be evil let he remove from my mind say _ alcibiade _ the darkness and what else he please i be determine to refuse nothing he shall order I whoever he be so that i may become the better man by it the remain part of this dialogue be very obscure : there be something in it that would make we think _ socrate _ hint at himself when he speak of this divine teacher who be to come into the world do not he own that he himself be in this respect as much at a loss and in as great distress as the rest of mankind some learn man look upon this conclusion as a prediction of we savior or at least that socrate like the high-priest -lrb- 4 -rrb- prophesy unknowingly and point at that divine teacher who be to come into the world some age after he however that may be we find that this great philosopher saw by the light of reason that it be suitable to the goodness of the divine nature to send a person into the world who should instruct mankind in the duty of religion and in particular teach they how to pray whoever read this abstract of _ plato 's _ discourse on prayer will i believe naturally make this reflection that the great founder of we religion as well by he own example as in the form of prayer which he teach he disciple do not only keep up to those rule which the light of nature have suggest to this great philosopher but instruct he disciple in the whole extent of this duty as well as of all other he direct they to the proper object of adoration and teach they accord to the third rule above-mentioned to apply themselves to he in they closet without show or ostentation and to worship he in spirit and in truth as the _ lacedemonian _ in they form of prayer implore the god in general to give they all good thing so long as they be virtuous we ask in particular _ that we offence may be forgive as we forgive those of other _ if we look into the second rule which _ socrate _ have prescribe namely that we should apply ourselves to the knowledge of such thing as be best for we this too be explain would at large in the doctrine of the gospel where we be teach in several instance to regard those thing as curse which appear as blessing in the eye of the world and on the contrary to esteem those thing as blessing which to the generality of mankind appear as curse thus in the form which be prescribe to we we only pray for that happiness which be we chief good and the great end of we existence when we petition the supreme be for _ the come of he kingdom be solicitous for no other temporal blessing but we daily sustenance _ on the other side we pray against nothing but sin and against _ evil _ in general leave it with omniscience to determine what be really such if we look into the first of _ socrate _ he rule of prayer in which he recommend the above-mentioned form of the ancient poet we find that form not only comprehend but very much improve in the petition wherein we pray to the supreme be that _ he will may be do : _ which be of the same force with that form which we savior use when he pray against the most painful and most ignominious of death _ nevertheless not my will but thine be do _ this comprehensive petition be the most humble as well as the most prudent that can be offer up from the creature to he creator as it suppose the supreme be will nothing but what be for we good and

much trouble themselves about the decency of the comparison the satyr or iambick of _ simonide _ with which i shall entertain my reader in the present paper be a remarkable instance of what i formerly advance the subject of this satyr be woman he describe the sex in they several character which he derive to they from a fanciful supposition raise upon the doctrine of præexistence he tell we that the god form the soul of woman out of those seed and principle which compose several kind of animal and element and that they good or bad disposition arise in they accord as such and such seed and principle predominate in they constitution i have translate the author very faithfully and if not word for word -lrb- which we language would not bear -rrb- at least so as to comprehend every one of he sentiment without add any thing of my own i have already apologize for this author want of delicacy and must further premise that the follow satyr affect only some of the lower part of the sex and not those who have be refine by a polite education which be not so common in the age of this poet _ in the begin god make the soul of womankind out of different material and in a separate state from they body _ _ the soul of one kind of woman be form out of those ingredient which compose a swine a woman of this make be a slut in she house and a glutton at she table she be uncleanly in she person a slattern in she dress and she family be no better than a dunghill _ _ a second sort of female soul be form out of the same material that enter into the composition of a fox such a one be what we call a notable discerning woman who have a insight into every thing whether it be good or bad in this species of female there be some virtuous and some vicious _ _ a third kind of woman be make up of canine particle these be what we commonly call _ scold _ who imitate the animal of which they be take that be always busy and bark that snarl at every one who come in they way and live in perpetual clamor _ _ the fourth kind of woman be make out of the earth these be you sluggard who pass away they time in indolence and ignorance hover over the fire a whole winter and apply themselves with alacrity to no kind of business but eat _ _ the fifth species of female be make out of the sea these be woman of variable uneven temper sometimes all storm and tempest sometimes all calm and sunshine the stranger who see one of these in she smile and smoothness would cry she up for a miracle of good humor but on a sudden she look and she word be change she be nothing but fury and outrage noise and hurricane _ _ the sixth species be make up of the ingredient which compose a ass or a beast of burden these be naturally exceed slothful but upon the husband exert he authority will live upon hard fare and do every thing to please he they be however far from be averse to venereal pleasure and seldom refuse a male companion _ _ the cat furnished material for a seventh species of woman who be of a melancholy froward unamiable nature and so repugnant to the offer of love that they fly in the face of they husband when he approach they with conjugal endearment this species of woman be likewise subject to little theft cheat and pilfering _ _ the mare with a flow mane which be never break to any servile toil and labor compose a eighth species of woman these be they who have little regard for they husband who pass away they time in dress bathing and perfuming who throw they hair into the nicest curl and trick it up with the fairest flower and garland a woman of this species be a very pretty thing for a stranger to look upon but very detrimental to the owner unless it be a king or prince who take a fancy to such a toy _ _ the ninth species of female be take out of the ape these be such as be both ugly and ill-natured who have nothing beautiful in themselves and endeavor to detract from or ridicule every thing which appear so in other _ _ the tenth and last species of woman be make out of the bee and happy be the man who get such a one for he wife she be altogether faultless and unblameable she family flourish and improve by she good management she love she husband and be beloved by he she bring he a race of beautiful and virtuous child she distinguish she self among she sex she be surround with grace she never sit among the loose tribe of woman nor pass away she time

fragment of the same author : _ a man can not possess any thing that be better than a good woman nor any thing that be worse than a bad one _ as the poet have shew a great penetration in this diversity of female character he have avoid the fault which _ juvenal _ and monsieur _ boileau _ be guilty of the former in he sixth and the other in he last satyr where they have endeavor to expose the sex in general without do justice to the valuable part of it such levelling satyr be of no use to the world and for this reason i have often wonder how the _ french _ author above-mention who be a man of exquisite judgment and a lover of virtue could think human nature a proper subject for satyr in another of he celebrated piece which be call _ the satyr upon man _ what vice or frailty can a discourse correct which censure the whole species alike and endeavor to shew by some superficial stroke of wit that brute be the more excellent creature of the two a satyr should expose nothing but

and worthy thought of we self whoever have a mean opinion of the dignity of he nature will act in no higher a rank than he have allot himself in he own estimation if he consider he be as circumscribe by the uncertain term of a few year he design will be contract into the same narrow span he imagine be to bind he existence how can he exalt he thought to any thing great and noble who only believe that after a short turn on the stage of this world he be to sink into oblivion and to lose he consciousness for ever for this reason i be of opinion that so useful and elevate a contemplation as that of the _ soul immortality _ can not be resume too often there be not a more improve exercise to the human mind than to be frequently review its own great privilege and endowment nor a more effectual means to awaken in we a ambition raise above low object and little pursuit than to value we self as heir of eternity it be a very great satisfaction to consider the best and wisest of mankind in all nation and age assert as with one voice this they birthright and to find it ratify would by a express revelation at the same time if we turn we thought inward upon we self we may meet with a kind of secret sense concur with the proof of we own immortality you have in my opinion raise a good presumptive argument from the increase appetite the mind have to knowledge and to the extend its own faculty which can not be accomplish as the more restrained perfection of lower creature may in the limit of a short life i think another probable conjecture may be raise from we appetite to duration it self and from a reflection on we progress through the several stage of it : _ we be complain _ as you observe in a former speculation _ of the shortness of life and yet be perpetually hurry over the part of it to arrive at certain little settlement or imaginary point of rest which be disperse up and down in it _ now let we consider what happen to we when we arrive at these _ imaginary point of rest _ : do we stop we motion and sit down satisfied in the settlement we have gain would or be we not remove the boundary and mark out new point of rest to which we press forward with the like eagerness and which cease to be such as fast as we attain they we case be like that of a traveller upon the _ alp _ who should fancy that the top of the next hill must end he journey because it terminate he prospect but he no sooner arrive as it than he see new ground and other hill beyond it and continue to travel on as before -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be so plainly every man 's condition in life that there be no one who have observe any thing but may observe that as fast as he time wear away he appetite to something future remain the use therefore i would make of it be this that since nature -lrb- as some love to express it -rrb- do nothing in vain or to speak properly since the author of we being have plant no wander passion in it no desire which have not its object futurity be the proper object of the passion so constantly exerci would about it and this restlessness in the present this assign we self over to further stage of duration this successive grasp at somewhat still to come appear to I -lrb- whatever it may to other -rrb- as a kind of instinct or natural symptom which the mind of man have of its own immortality i take it at the same time for grant that the immortality of the soul be sufficiently establish by other argument : and if so this appetite which otherwise would be very unaccountable and absurd seem very reasonable and add strength to the conclusion but i be amaze when i consider there be creature capable of thought who in spite of every argument can form to themselves a sullen satisfaction in think otherwise there be something so pitifully mean in the inverted ambition of that man who can hope for annihilation and please himself to think that he whole fabrick shall one day crumble into dust and mix with the mass of inanimate being that it equally deserve we admiration and pity the mystery of such men unbelief be not hard to be penetrate and indeed amount to nothing more than a sordid hope that they shall not be immortal because they dare not be so this bring I back to my first observation and give I occasion to say further that as worthy action spring from worthy thought so worthy thought be likewise the consequence of worthy action : but the wretch who have degrade himself below the character of immortality be very willing to resign he pretension to it and to substitute in its room a dark negative happiness in the extinction of he be the admirable _ shakespear _ have give we a strong image of the unsupported condition of such a person in he last minute in the second part of king _ henry _ the sixth where cardinal _ beaufort _ who have be concern in the murder of the good duke _ humphrey _ be represent on he death-bed after some short confused speech which shew a imagination disturb with guilt just as he be expire king _ henry _ standing by he full of compassion say _ lord cardinal if thou thinkst on heaven bliss hold up thy hand make signal of that hope he die and make no sign _ -- the despair which be here shewn without a word or action on the part of the die person be beyond what could be paint by the most forcible expression whatever i shall not pursue this thought further but only add that as annihilation be not to be have with a wish so it be the most abject thing in the world to wish it what be honor fame wealth or power when compare with the generous expectation of a be without end and a happiness adequate to that be i shall trouble you no further but with a certain gravity which these thought have give I i reflect upon some thing people say of you -lrb- as they will of man

præexistence some of the ancient philosopher have in a manner satirize the vicious part of the human species in general from a notion of the soul postexistence if i may so call it and that as _ simonide _ describe brute enter into the composition of woman other have represent human soul as enter into brute this be commonly term the doctrine of transmigration which suppose that human soul upon they leave the body become the soul of such kind of brute as they most resemble in they manners or to give a account of it as mr _ dryden _ have describe it in he translation of _ pythagora _ he

of christianity if i may use that phrase to manage we action to the best advantage and direct they in such a manner that every thing we do may turn to account at that great day when every thing we have do will be set before we in order to give this consideration its full weight we may cast all we action under the division of such as be in themselves either good evil or indifferent if we divide we intention after the same manner and consider they with regard to we action we may discover that great art and secret of religion which i have here mention a good intention join to a good action give it its proper force and efficacy join to a evil action extenuate its malignity and in some case may take it wholly away and join to a indifferent action turn it to a virtue and make it meritorious as far as human action can be so in the next place to consider in the same manner the influence of a evil intention upon we action a evil intention pervert the best of action and make they in reality what the father with a witty kind of zeal have term the virtue of the heathen world so many _ shine sin _ it destroy the innocence of a indifferent action and give a evil action all possible blackness and horror or in the emphatical language of sacred writ make _ sin exceed sinful _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- if in the last place we consider the nature of a indifferent intention we shall find that it destroy the merit of a good action abate but never take away the malignity of a evil action and leave a indifferent action in its natural state of indifference it be therefore of unspeakable advantage to possess we mind with a habitual good intention and to aim all we thought word and action at some laudable end whether it be the glory of we maker the good of mankind or the benefit of we own soul this be a sort of thrift or good-husbandry in moral life which do not throw away any single action but make every one go as far as it can it multiply the means of salvation increase the number of we virtue and diminish that of we vice there be something very devout though not solid in _ acosta 's _ answer to _ limborch _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- who object to he the multiplicity of ceremony in the _ jewish _ religion as washing dress meat purgation and the like the reply which the _ jew _ make upon this occasion be to the best of my remembrance as follow : there be not duty enough -lrb- say he -rrb- in the essential part of the law for a zealous and active obedience time place and person be requisite before you have a opportunity of put a moral virtue into practice we have therefore say he enlarged the sphere of we duty and make many thing which be in themselves indifferent a part of we religion that we may have more occasion of shew we love to god and in all the circumstance of life be do something to please he monsieur _ st evremond _ have endeavor to palliate the superstition of the roman catholick religion with the same kind of apology where he pretend to consider the differ spirit of the papist and the calvinist as to the great point wherein they disagree he tell we that the former be actuate by love and the other by fear and that in they expression of duty and devotion towards the supreme be the former seem particularly careful to do every thing which may possibly please he and the other to abstain from every thing which may possibly displease he -lrb- 3 -rrb- but notwithstanding this plausible reason with which both the jew and the roman catholick would excuse they respective superstition it be certain there be something in they very pernicious to mankind and destructive to religion because the injunction of superfluous ceremony make such action duty as be before indifferent and by that mean render religion more burdensome and difficult than it be in its own nature betray many into sin of omission which they could not otherwise be guilty of and fix the mind of the vulgar to the shadowy unessential point instead of the more weighty and more important matter of the law this zealous and active obedience however take place in the great point we be recommend for if instead of prescribe to we self indifferent action as duty we apply a good intention to all we most indifferent action we make we very existence one continue act of obedience we turn we diversion and amusement to we eternal advantage and be please he -lrb- whom we be make to please -rrb-

mean if possible to shame those who have greater advantage of know they duty and therefore greater obligation to perform it into a better course of life besides that many among we be unreasonably disposed to give a fairer hearing to a pagan philosopher than to a christian writer i shall therefore produce a instance of this excellent frame of mind in a speech of _ socrate _ which be quote by _

_ we find in these word of that great man the habitual good intention which i would here inculcate and with which that divine philosopher always act i shall only add that _ erasmus _ who be a unbigotted roman catholick be so much transport with this passage of _ socrate _ that he could scarce forbear look upon he as a saint and desire he to pray for he or as that ingenious and learn writer

would not be understand to mean those who be worthless in themselves or who without any call will press into the company of they betters nor when i speak of patron do i mean those who either have it not in they power or have no obligation to assist they friend but i speak of such league where there be power and obligation on the one part and merit and expectation on the other the division of patron and client may i believe include a third of we nation the want of merit and real worth in the client will strike out about ninety-nine in a hundred of these and the want of ability in patron as many of that kind but however i must beg leave to say that he who will take up another time and fortune in he service though he have no prospect of reward he merit towards he be as unjust in he dealings as he who take up goods of a tradesman without intention or ability to pay he of the few of the class which i think fit to consider there be not two in ten who succeed insomuch that i know a

those great service some through discontent lose they speech some they memory other they sens or they life and i seldom see a man thoroughly discontented but i conclude he have have the favor of some great man i have know of such as have be for twenty year together within a month of a good employment but never arrive at the happiness of be possess of any thing there be nothing more ordinary than that a man who be get into a considerable station shall immediately alter he manner of treat all he friend and from that moment he be to deal with you as if he be you fate you be no longer to be consult even in matter which concern you self but you patron be of a species above you and a free communication with you be not to be expect this perhaps may be you condition all the while he bear office and when that be at a end you be as intimate as ever you be and he will take it very ill if you keep the distance he prescribe you towards he in he grandeur one would think this should be a behavior a man could fall into with the worst grace imaginable but they who know the world have see it more than once i have often with secret pity hear the same man who have profess he abhorrence against all kind of passive behavior lose minute hour day and year in a fruitless attendance on one who have no inclination to befriend he it be very much to be regard that the great have one particular privilege above the rest of the world of be slow in receive impression of kindness and quick in take offence the elevation above the rest of mankind except in very great mind make man so giddy that they do not see after the same manner they do before : thus they despise they old friend and strive to extend they interest to new pretender by this mean it often happen that when you come to know how you lose such a employment you will find the man who get it never dream of it but forsooth he be to be surprize into it or perhaps sollicit to receive it upon such occasion as these a man may perhaps grow out of humor and if you be so all mankind will fall in with the patron and you be a humourist and untractable if you be capable of be sour at a disappointment : but it be the same thing whether you do or do not resent ill usage you will be use after the same manner as some good mother will be sure to whip they child till they cry and then whip they for cry there be but two way of do any thing with great people and those be by make you self either considerable or agreeable : the former be not to be attain but by find a way to live without they or conceal that you want they the latter be only by fall into they taste and pleasure : this be of all the employment in the world the most servile except it happen to be of you own natural humor for to be agreeable to another especially if he be above you be not to be possess of such quality and accomplishment as should render you agreeable in you self but such as make you agreeable in respect to he a imitation of he fault or a compliance if not subservience to he vice must be the measure of you conduct when it come to that the unnatural state a man live in when he patron please be end and he guilt and complaisance be object to he tho the man who reject he for he vice be not only he partner but seducer thus the client -lrb- like a young woman who have give up the innocence which make she charming -rrb- have not only lose he time but also the virtue which could render he capable of resent the injury which be do he it would be endless to recount the -lrb- trick -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- of turn you off from themselves to person who have less power to serve you the art of be sorry for such a unaccountable accident in you behavior that such a one -lrb- who perhaps have never hear of you -rrb- oppose you advancement and if you have any thing more than ordinary in you you be flatter with a whisper that ti no wonder people be so slow in do for a man of you talent and the like after all this treatment i must still add the pleasantest insolence of all which i have once or twice see to wit that when a silly rogue have throw away one part in three of he life in unprofitable attendance it be take

that which we look upon as the proper means for attain it since i be engage on this subject i can not forbear mention a story which i have lately hear and which be so well attest that i have no manner

unfortunately happen that both of they fall in love with the female negro above mention who would have be very glad to have take either of they for she husband provide they could agree between themselves which should be the man but they be both so passionately in love with she that neither of they could think of give she up to he rival and at the same time be so true to one another that neither of they would think of gain she without he friend consent the torment of these two lover be the discourse of the family to which they belong who could not forbear observe the strange complication of passion which perplex the heart of the poor negro that often drop expression of the uneasiness they undergo and how impossible it be for either of they ever to be happy after a long struggle between love and friendship truth and jealousy they one day take a walk together into a wood carry they mistress along with they : where after abundance of lamentation they stab she to the

of they he there discover the woman lie dead upon the ground with the two negro on each side of she kiss the dead corps weep over it and beat they breast in the utmost agony of grief and despair he immediately run to the _ english _ family with the news of what he have see who upon come to the place see the woman dead and the two negro expire by she with wound they have give themselves we see in this amazing instance of barbarity what strange disorder be breed in the mind of those man whose passion be not regulate by virtue and discipline by reason though the action which i have recite be in it self full of guilt and horror it proceed from a temper of mind which might have produce very noble fruit have it be inform and guide by a suitable education it be therefore a unspeakable blessing

and most insignificant part of mankind endeavor to procure in the little circle of they friend and acquaintance the poorest mechanick nay the man who live upon common alms get he he set of admirer and delight in that superiority which he enjoy over those who be in some respects beneath he this ambition which be natural to the soul of man might methink receive a very happy turn and if it be rightly direct contribute as much to a person advantage as it generally do to he uneasiness and disquiet i shall therefore put together some thought on this subject which i have not meet with in other writer : and shall set they down as they have occur to I without be at the pain to connect or methodise they all superiority and preeminence that one man can have over another may be reduce to the notion of quality which consider at large be either that of fortune body or mind the first be that which consist in birth title or riches and be the most foreign to we nature and what we can the least call we own of any of the three kind of quality in relation to the body quality arise from health strength or beauty which be nearer to we and more a part of we self than the former quality as it regard the mind have its rise from knowledge or virtue and be that which be more essential to we and more intimately unite with we than either of the other two the quality of fortune tho a man have less reason to value himself upon it than on that of the body or mind be however the kind of quality which make the most shine figure in the eye of the world as virtue be the most reasonable and genuine source of honor we generally find in title a imitation of some particular merit that should recommend man to the high station which they possess holiness be ascribe to the pope majesty to king serenity or mildness of temper to prince excellence or perfection to ambassador grace to archbishop honor to peer worship or venerable behavior to magistrate and reverence which be of the same import as the former to the inferior clergy in the founder of great family such attribute of honor be generally correspondent with the virtue of the person to whom they be apply but in the descendant they be too often the mark rather of grandeur than of merit the stamp and denomination still continue but the intrinsick value be frequently lose the death-bed shew the emptiness of title in a true light a poor dispirited sinner lie tremble under the apprehension of the state he be entr on and be ask by a grave attendant how he holiness do another hear himself address to under the title of highness or excellency who lie under such mean circumstance of mortality as be the disgrace of human nature title at such a time look rather like insult and mockery than respect the truth of it be honor be in this world under no regulation true quality be neglect virtue be oppress and vice triumphant the last day will rectify this disorder and assign to every one a station suitable to the dignity of he

virtue here that they may not be put above we in a state which be to settle the distinction for eternity man in scripture be call _ stranger _ and _ sojourner _ upon _ earth _ and life a _ pilgrimage _ several heathen as well as christian author under the same kind of metaphor have represent the world as a inn which be only design to furnish we with accommodation in this we passage it be therefore very absurd to think of set up we rest before we come to we journey end and not rather to take care of the reception we shall there meet than to fix we thought on the little convenience and advantage which we enjoy one above another in the way to it _ epictetus _ make use of another kind of allusion which be very beautiful and wonderfully proper to incline we to be satisfy with the post in which

not suit we and that we could act another better but this -lrb- say the philosopher -rrb- be not we business all that we be concern in be to excel in the part which be give we if it be a improper one

for he live and die a slave he motive to contentment in this particular receive a very great inforcement from the above-mentioned consideration if we remember that we part in the other world will be new cast and that mankind will be there range in different station of superiority and præeminence in proportion as they have here excel one another in virtue and perform in they several post of life

think seem highly probable that ambition run through the whole species and that every man in proportion to the vigor of he complection be more or less actuate by it it be indeed no uncommon thing to meet with man who by the natural bent of they inclination and without the discipline of philosophy aspire not to the height of power and grandeur who never set they heart upon a numerous train of client and dependancy nor other gay appendage of greatness who be contented with a competency and will not molest they tranquillity to gain a abundance : but it be not therefore to be conclude that such a man be not ambitious he desire may have cut out another channel and determine he to other pursuit the motive however may be still the same and in these case likewise the man may be equally push on with the desire of distinction though the pure consciousness of worthy action abstract from the view of popular applause be to a generous mind a ample reward yet the desire of distinction be doubtless implant in we nature as a additional incentive to exert we self in virtuous excellence this passion indeed like all other be frequently pervert to evil and ignoble purpose so that we may account for many of the excellency and folly of life upon the same innate principle to wit the desire of be remarkable : for this as it have be differently cultivate by education study and converse will bring forth suitable effect as it fall in with a -lrb- ingenuous -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- disposition or a corrupt mind it do accordingly express itself in act of magnanimity or selfish cunning as it meet with a good or a weak understanding as it have be employ in embellish the mind or adorn the outside it render the man eminently praise-worthy or ridiculous ambition therefore be not to be confine only to one passion or pursuit for as the same humor in constitution otherwise different affect the body after different manners so the same aspiring principle within we sometimes break forth upon one object sometimes upon another it can not be doubt but that there be as great desire of glory in a ring of wrestler or cudgel-player as in any other more refined competition for superiority no man that could avoid it would ever suffer he head to be break but out of a principle of honor this be the secret spring that push they forward and the superiority which they gain above the undistinguish 'd

of a lower nature since therefore no man 's lot be so unalterably fix in this life but that a thousand accident may either forward or disappoint he advancement it be methink a pleasant and inoffensive speculation to consider a great man as divest of all the adventitious circumstance of fortune and to bring he down in one imagination to that low station of life the nature of which bear some distant resemblance to that high one he be at present possess of thus one may view he exercise in miniature those talent of nature which be draw out by education to they full length enable he for the discharge of some important employment on the other hand one may raise uneducated merit to such a pitch of greatness as may seem equal to the possible extent of he improve capacity thus nature furnish a man with a general appetite of glory education determine it to this or that particular object the desire of distinction be not i think in any instance more observable than in the variety of outside and new appearance which the modish part of the world be oblige to provide in order to make themselves remarkable for any thing glaring and particular either in behavior or apparel be know to have this good effect that it catch the eye and will not suffer you to pass over the person so adorn without due notice and observation it have likewise upon this account be frequently resent as a very great slight to leave any gentleman out of a lampoon or satyr who have as much right to be there as he neighbor because it suppose the person not eminent enough to be take notice of to this passionate fondness for distinction be owe various frolicksome and irregular practice as sally out into nocturnal exploit break of window singing of catch beat the watch get drunk twice a day kill a great number of horse with many other enterprize of the like fiery nature : for certainly many a man be more rakish and extravagant than he would willingly be be there not other to look on and give they approbation one very common and at the same time the most absurd ambition that ever shew it self in humane nature be that which come upon a man with experience and old age the season when it might be expect he should be wisest and therefore it can not receive any of those lessen circumstance which do in some measure excuse the disorderly ferment of youthful blood : i mean the passion for get money exclusive of the character of the provident father the affectionate husband or the generous friend it may be remark for the comfort of honest poverty that this desire reign most in those who have but few good quality to recommend they this be a weed that will grow in a barren soil humanity good nature and the advantage of a liberal education be incompatible with avarice ti strange to see how suddenly this abject passion kill all the noble sentiment and generous ambition that adorn humane nature it render the man who be over-run with it a peevish and cruel master a severe parent a unsociable husband a distant and mistrustful friend but it be more to the present purpose to consider it as a absurd passion of the heart rather than as a vicious affection of the mind as there be frequent instance to be meet with of a proud humility so this passion contrary to most other affect applause by avoid all show and appearance for this reason it will not sometimes endure even the common decency of apparel _ a covetous man will call himself poor that you may sooth he vanity by contradict he _ love and the desire of glory as they be the most natural so they be capable of be refine into the most delicate and rational passion ti true the wise man who strike out of the secret path of a private life for honor and dignity allure by the splendor of a court and the unfelt weight of publick employment whether he succeed in he attempt or no usually come near enough to this paint greatness to discern the dawbing he be then desirous of extricate himself out of the hurry of life that he may pass away the remainder of he day in tranquillity and retirement it may be think then but common prudence in a man not to change a better state for a worse nor ever to quit that which he know he shall take up again with pleasure and yet if human life be not a little move with the gentle gale of hope and fear there may be some danger of its stagnate in a unmanly indolence and security it be a known story of _ domitian _ that after he have possess himself of the _ roman _ empire he desire turn would upon catch fly active and masculine spirit in the vigor of youth neither can nor ought to remain at rest : if they debar themselves from aim at a noble object they desire will move downward and they will feel themselves actuate by some low and abject passion thus if you cut off the top branch of a tree and will not suffer it to grow any higher it will not therefore cease to grow but will quickly shoot out at the bottom the man indeed who go into the world only with the narrow view of self-interest who catch at the applause of a idle multitude as he can find no solid contentment at the end of he journey so he deserve to meet with disappointment in he way but he who be actuate by a noble principle whose mind be so far enlarged as to take in the prospect of he country 's good who be enamoured with that praise which be one of the fair attendant of virtue and value not those acclamation which be not second by the impartial testimony of he own mind who repine not at the low station which providence have at present allot he but yet would willingly advance himself by justifiable means to a more rising and advantageous ground such a man be warm with a generous emulation it be a virtuous movement in he to wish and to endeavor that he power of do good may be equal to he will the man who be fit out by nature and send into the world with great ability be capable of do great good or mischief in it it ought therefore to be the care of education to infuse into the untainted youth early notice of justice and honor that so the possible advantage of good part may not take a evil turn nor be pervert to base and unworthy purpose it be the business of religion and philosophy not so much to extinguish we passion as to regulate and direct they to valuable well-chosen object : when these have point out to we which course we may lawfully steer ti no

discretion only make a man the master of he own part but of other men the discreet man find out the talent of those he converse with and know how to apply they to proper use accordingly if we look into particular community and division of man we may observe that it be the discreet man not the witty nor the learn nor the brave who guide the conversation and give measure to the society a man with great talent but void of discretion be like _ polyphemus _ in the fable strong and blind endue with a irresistible force which for want of sight be of no use to he though a man have all other

station of life at the same time that i think discretion the most useful talent a man can be master of i look upon cunning to be the accomplishment of little mean ungenerous mind discretion point out the noblest end to we and pursue the most proper and laudable method of attain they : cunning have only private selfish aim and stick at nothing which may make they succeed discretion have large and extended view and like a well-formed eye command a whole horizon : cunning be a kind of short-sightedness that discover the minutest object which be near at hand but be not able to discern thing at a distance discretion the more it be discover give a greater authority to the person who possess it : cunning when it be once detect lose its force and make a man incapable of bring about even those event which he might have do have he pass only for a plain man discretion be the perfection of reason and a guide to we in all the duty of life cunning be a kind of instinct that only look out after we immediate interest and welfare discretion be only find in man of strong sense and good understanding : cunning be often to be meet with in brute themselves and in person who be but the fewest

throw off my cloath and take a leap into that part of the sea which be so much frequent by _ olphi _ the fisherman and tho i should escape with my life i know you will be please with it _ i shall leave it with the critick to determine whether the place which this shepherd so particularly point out be not the above-mentioned _ leucate _ or at least some other lover leap which be suppose to have

that if he should escape with -lrb- life -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- he know he mistress would be please with it which be accord to we interpretation that she would rejoice any way to get rid of a lover who be so troublesome to she after this short preface i shall present my reader with some letter which i have receive upon this subject the first be send I by a physician _ mr _ spectator the lover leap which you mention in you 223d paper be generally i believe a very effectual cure for love and not only for love but for all other evil in short sir i be afraid it be such a leap as that which _ hero _ take to get rid of she passion for _ leander _ a man be in no danger of break he heart who break he neck to prevent it i know very well the wonder which ancient author relate concern this leap and in particular that very many person who try it escape not only with they life but they limb if by this mean they get rid of they love tho it may in part be ascribe to the reason you give for it why may not we suppose that the cold bath into which they plunge themselves have also some share in they cure a leap into the sea or into any creek of salt water very often give a new motion to the spirit and a new turn to the blood for which reason we prescribe it in distemper which no other medicine will reach i could produce a quotation out of a very venerable author in which the frenzy produce by love be compare to that which be produce by the bite of a mad dog but as this comparison be a little too coarse for you paper and might look as if it be cite to ridicule the author who have make use of it i shall only hint at it and desire you to consider whether if the frenzy produce by these two different cause be of the same nature it may not very properly be cure by the same means _ i be sir you most humble servant and well-wisher _ esculapius _ mr _ spectator i be a young woman cross in love my story be very long and melancholy to give you the head of it : a young gentleman after have make

_ the lover leap _ and whether one may go to it by land but alas i be afraid it have lose its virtue and that a woman of we time would find no more relief in take such a leap than in sing a hymn to _

be apt to take cold ridicule perhaps be a better expedient against love than sober advice and i be of opinion that _ hudibra _ and _ don quixote _ may be as effectual to cure the extravagancy of this

that man who be very inquisitive you may often observe that tho he speak as good sense as any man upon any thing with which he be well acquaint he can not trust to the range of he own fancy to entertain himself upon that foundation but go on to still new enquiry thus tho you know he be fit for the most polite conversation you shall see he very well contented to sit by a jockey give a account of the many revolution in he horse health what potion he make he take how that agree with he how afterwards he come to he stomach and he exercise or any the like impertinence and be as well pleased as if you talk to he on the most important truth this humor be far from make a man unhappy tho it may subject he to raillery for he generally fall in with a person who seem to be bear for he which be you talkative fellow it be so order that there be a secret bent as natural as the meeting of different sex in these two character to supply each other want i have the honor the other day to sit in a publick room and see a inquisitive man look with a air of satisfaction upon the approach of one of these talker the man of ready utterance sit down by he and rub he head lean on he arm and make a uneasy countenance he begin there be no manner of news to-day i can not tell what be the matter with I but i sleep very ill last night whether i catch cold or no i know not but i fancy i do not wear shoe thick enough for the weather and i have cough all this week : it must be so for the custom of wash my head winter and summer with cold water prevent any injury from the season enter that way

and so repeat almost _ verbatim _ all that have be say to he the truth be the inquisitive be the funnel of conversation they do not take in any thing for they own use but merely to pass it to another

they be not a malicious people and if you will supply they you may contradict any thing they have say before by they own mouth a farther account of a thing be one of the gratefullest goods that can arrive to they and it be seldom that they be more particular than to say the town will have it or i have it from a good hand : so that there be room for the town to know the matter more particularly and for a better hand to contradict what be say by a good one i have not know this humor more ridiculous than in a father who have be earnestly solicitous to have a account how he son have pass he leisure hour if it be in a way thoroughly insignificant there can not be a greater joy than a enquirer discover in see he follow so hopefully he own step : but this humor among man be most pleasant

species immediately fall a whisper he pedigree i could overhear by break she be he aunt then a answer ay she be of the mother side : then again in a little lower voice he father wear generally a darker wig answer not much but this gentleman wear higher heel to he shoe as the inquisitive in my opinion be such merely from a vacancy in they own imagination there be nothing methink so dangerous as to communicate secret to they for the same temper of enquiry make they as impertinently communicative : but no man though he converse with they need put himself in they power for they will be contented with matter of less moment as well when there be fuel enough no matter what it be -- thus the end of sentence in the news papers as _ this want confirmation this occasion many speculation _

three different copy of this beautiful original : the first be a translation by _ catullus _ the second by monsieur _ boileau _ and the last by a gentleman whose translation of the _ hymn to venus _

will know very well the reason why one of these verse be print in _ roman _ letter -lrb- 3 -rrb- and if he compare this translation with the original will find that the three first stanza be rendr almost word for word and not only with the same elegance but with the same short turn of expression which be so remarkable in the _ greek _ and so peculiar to the _ sapphick _ ode i can not imagine for what reason madam _ dacier _ have tell we that this ode of _ sappho _ be preserved entire in _ longinus _ since it be manifest to any one who look into that author quotation of it that there must at least have be another stanza which be not transmit to we the second translation of this fragment which i shall here cite be that of monsieur _ boileau _ heureux quus prés de toi pour toi seule

thick together and follow one another with that vehemence and emotion as in the original in short monsieur _ boileau _ have give we all the poetry but not all the passion of this famous fragment i shall in the last place present my reader with the _ english _ translation i blest as th ` immortal god be he the youth who fondly sit by thee and hear and see thee all the while softly speak and

quick through all my vital frame o'er my dim eye a darkness hang my ear with hollow murmur ring iv in dewy damp my limb be child my blood with gentle horror thrill would my feeble pulse forget to play i faint sink and dy would away instead of give any character of this last translation i shall desire my learn reader to look into the criticism which _ longinus _ have make upon the original by that mean he will know to which of the translation he ought to give the preference i shall only add that this translation be write in the very spirit of _ sappho _ and as near the _ greek _ as the genius of we language will possibly suffer _ longinus _ have observe that this description of love in _ sappho _ be a exact copy of nature and that all the circumstance which follow one another in such a hurry of sentiment notwithstanding they appear repugnant to each other be really such as happen in the phrenzy of love i wonder that not one of the critick or editor through whose hand this ode have pass have take occasion from it to mention a circumstance relate by _ plutarch _ that author in the famous story of _ antiochus _ who fall in love with _ stratonice _ he mother-in-law and -lrb- not

some kind of fascination in the eye of a large circle of people when dart altogether upon one person i have see a new actor in a tragedy so bind up by it as to be scarce able to speak or move and have expect he would have die above three act before the dagger or cup of poison be bring in it would not be amiss if such a one be at first introduce as a ghost or a statue till he recover he spirit and grow fit for some living part as this sudden desertion of one self shew a diffidence which be not displease it imply at the same time the greatest respect to a audience that can be it be a sort of mute eloquence which plead for they favor much better than word could do and we find they generosity naturally move to support those who be in so much perplexity to entertain they i be extremely pleased with a late instance of this kind at the opera of _ almahide _ in the encouragement give to a young singer -lrb- 2 -rrb- whose more than ordinary concern on she first appearance recommend she no less than she agreeable voice and just performance meer bashfulness without merit be awkward and merit without modesty insolent but modest merit have a double claim to acceptance and generally meet with as many patron as beholder _ i be _ & c it be impossible that a person should exert himself to advantage in a assembly whether it be he part either to sing or speak who lie under too great oppression of modesty i remember upon talk with a friend of mine concern the force of pronunciation we discourse lead we into the enumeration of the several organ of speech which a orator ought to have in perfection as the tongue the tooth -lrb- the lip -rrb- the nose the palate and the wind-pipe upon which say my friend you have omit the most material organ of they all and that be the forehead but notwithstanding a excess of modesty obstruct the tongue and render it unfit for its office a due proportion of it be think so requisite to a orator that rhetorician have recommend it to they disciple as a particular in they art _ cicero _ tell we that he never like a orator who do not appear in some little confusion at the beginning of he speech and confess that he himself never enter upon a oration without tremble and concern it be indeed a kind of deference which be due to a great assembly and seldom fail to raise a benevolence in the audience towards the person who speak my correspondent have take notice that the bravest man often appear timorous on these occasion as indeed we may observe that there be generally no creature more impudent than a coward -- _ linguá melior sedfrigida bello dextera _ -- a bold tongue and a feeble arm be the qualification of _ drance _ in _ virgil _ as _ homer _ to express a man both timorous and sawcy make use of a kind of point which be very rarely to be meet with in he writings namely that he have the eye of a dog but the heart of a deer -lrb- 3 -rrb- a just and reasonable modesty do not only recommend eloquence but set off every great talent which a man can be possess of it heighten all the virtue which it accompany like the shades in painting it raise and round every figure and make the color more beautiful though not so glaring as they would be without it modesty be not only a ornament but also a guard to virtue it be a kind of quick and delicate _ feeling _ in the soul which make she shrink and withdraw she self from every thing that have danger in it it be such a exquisite sensibility as warn she to shun the first appearance of every thing which be hurtful i can not at present recollect either the place or time of what i be go to mention but i have read somewhere in the history of ancient _ greece _ that the woman of the country be seize with a unaccountable melancholy which dispose several of they to make away with themselves the senate after have try many expedient to prevent this self-murder which be so frequent among they publish a edict that if any woman whatever should lay violent hand upon she self she corps should be expose naked in the street and drag about the city in the most publick manner this edict immediately put a stop to the practice which be before so common we may see in this instance the strength of female modesty which be able to overcome the violence even of madness and despair the fear of shame in the fair sex be in those day more prevalent than that of death if modesty have so great a influence over we action and be in many case so impregnable a fence to virtue what can more undermine morality than that politeness which reign among the unthinking part of mankind and treat as unfashionable the most ingenuous part of we behavior which recommend impudence as good breeding and keep a man always in countenance not because he be innocent but because he be shameless _ seneca _ think modesty so great a check to vice that he prescribe to we the practice of it in secret and advise we to raise it in ourselves upon imaginary occasion when such as be real do not offer themselves for this be the meaning of he precept that when we be by ourselves and in we greatest solitude we should fancy that _ cato _ stand before we and see every thing we do in short if you banish modesty out of the world she carry away with she half the virtue that be in it after these reflection on modesty as it be a virtue i must observe that there be a vicious modesty which justly deserve to be ridicule and which those person very often discover who value themselves most upon a well-bred confidence this happen when a man be ashamed to act up to he reason and would not upon any consideration be surprize in the practice of those duty for the performance of which he be send into the world many a impudent libertine would blush to be catch in a serious discourse and

think human nature incapable of do we not meet with frequent instance of it in ordinary conversation there be another kind of vicious modesty which make a man ashamed of he person he birth he

or four day spend in this manner he retire for as many to he seat within a few mile of the town to the enjoyment of himself he family and he friend thus business and pleasure or rather in sir _ andrew _ labor and rest recommend each other they take they turn with so quick a vicissitude that neither become a habit or take possession of the whole man nor be it possible he should be surfeit with either i often see he at we club in good humor and yet sometimes too with a air of care in he look : but in he country retreat he be always unbent and such a companion as i could desire and therefore i seldom fail to make one with he when he be pleased to invite I the other day as soon as we be get into he chariot two or three beggar on each side hang upon the door and solicit we charity with the usual rhetorick of a sick wife or husband at home three or four helpless little child all starve with cold and hunger we be force to part with some money to get rid of they importunity and then we proceed on we journey with the blessing and acclamation of these people well then say _ sir andrew _ we go off with the prayer and good wish of the beggar and perhaps too we health will be drunk at the next ale-house : so all we shall be able to value ourselves upon be that we have promote the trade of the victualler and the excise of the government but how few ounce of wooll do we see upon the back of those poor creature and when they shall next fall in we way they will hardly be better dress would they must always live in rag to look like object of compassion if they family too be such as they be represent ti certain they can not be better clothe and must be a great deal worse fed : one would think potato should be all they bread and they drink the pure element and then what goodly customer be the farmer like to have for they wooll corn and cattle such customer and such a consumption can not choose but advance the land interest and hold up the rent of the gentleman but of all man live we merchant who live by buy and sell ought never to encourage beggar the goods which we export be indeed the product of the land but much the greatest part of they value be the labor of the people : but how much of these people labor shall we export whilst we hire they to sit still the very alms they receive from we be the wages of idleness i have often think that no man should be permit to take relief from the parish or to ask it in the street till he have first purchase as much as possible of he own livelihood by the labor of he own hand and then the publick ought only to be tax to make good the deficiency if this rule be strictly observe we should see every where such a multitude of new labourer as would in all probability reduce the price of all we manufacture it be the very life of merchandise to buy cheap and sell dear the merchant ought to make he outset as cheap as possible that he may find the greater profit upon he return and nothing will enable he to do this like the reduction of the price of labor upon all we manufacture this too would be the ready way to increase the number of we foreign market : the abatement of the price of the manufacture would pay for the carriage of it to more distant country and this consequence would be equally beneficial both to the land and trading interest as so great a addition of labor hand would produce this happy consequence both to the merchant and the gentle man we liberality to common beggar and every other obstruction to the increase of labourer must be equally pernicious to both sir _ andrew _ then go on to affirm that the reduction of the price of we manufacture by the addition of so many new hand would be no inconvenience to any man : but observe i be something startle at the assertion he make a short pause and then resume the discourse it may seem say he a paradox that the price of labor should be reduce without a abatement of wages or that wages can be abate without any inconvenience to the labourer and yet nothing be more certain than that both those thing may happen the wages of the labourer make the greatest part of the price of every thing that be useful and if in proportion with the wages the price of all other thing should be abate every labourer with less wages would be still able to purchase as many necessaries of life where then would be the inconvenience but the price of labor may be reduce by the addition of more hand to a manufacture and yet the wages of person remain as high as ever the admirable sir william petty -lrb- 2 -rrb- have give example of this in some of he writings : one of they as i remember be that of a watch which i shall endeavor to explain so as shall suit my present purpose it be certain that a single watch could not be make so cheap in proportion by one only man as a hundred watch by a hundred for as there be vast variety in the work no one person could equally suit himself to all the part of it the manufacture would be tedious and at last but clumsily perform : but if a hundred watch be to be make by a hundred man the case may be assign to one the dial to another the wheel to another the spring to another and every other part to a proper artist as there would be no need of perplexing any one person with too much variety every one would be able to perform he single part with greater skill and expedition and the hundred watch would be finish in one fourth part of the time of the first one and every one of they at one fourth part of the cost tho the wages of every man be equal the reduction of the price of the manufacture would increase the demand of it all the same hand would be still employ and as well pay the same rule will hold in the clothing the shipping and all the other trade whatsoever and thus a addition of hand to we manufacture will only reduce the price of they the labourer will still have as much wages and will consequently be enable to purchase more conveniency of life so that every interest in the nation would receive a benefit from the increase of we work people besides i see no occasion for this charity to common beggar since every beggar be a inhabitant of a parish and every parish be tax to the maintenance of they own poor -lrb- 3 -rrb- for my own part i can not be mightily please with the law which have do this which have provide better to feed than employ the poor we have a tradition from we forefather that after the first of those law be make they be insult with that famous song hang sorrow and cast away care the parish be bind to find we & c and if we will be so good-natured as to maintain they without work they can do no less in return than sing we _ the merry beggar _ what then be i against all act of charity god forbid i know of no virtue in the gospel that be in more pathetical expression recommend to we practice _ i be hungry and -lrb- ye -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- give I no meat thirsty and ye give I no drink naked and ye clothe I not a stranger and ye take I not in sick and in prison and ye visit I not _ we bless savior treat the exercise or neglect of charity towards a poor man as the performance or breach of this duty towards himself i shall endeavor to obey the will of my lord and master : and therefore if a industrious man shall submit to the hardest labor and coarsest fare rather than endure the shame of take relief from the parish or ask it in the street this be the hungry the thirsty the naked and i ought to believe if any man be come hither for shelter against persecution or oppression this be the stranger and i ought to take he in if any countryman of we own be fall into the hand of infidel and life in a state of miserable captivity this be the man in prison and i should contribute to he ransom i ought to give to a hospital of invalid to recover as many useful subject as i can but i shall bestow none of my bounty upon a alms-house of idle people and for the same reason i should not think it a reproach to I if i have withhold my charity from those common beggar but we prescribe better rule than we be able to practice we be ashamed not to give into the mistaken custom of we country : but at the same time i can not but think it a reproach worse than that of common swearing that the idle and the abandon be suffer in the name of heaven and all that be sacred to extort from christian and tender mind a supply to a

would ask he adversary question upon question till he have convince he out of he own mouth that he opinion be wrong this way of debate drive a enemy up into a corner seize all the pass through which he can make a escape and force he to surrender at discretion _ aristotle _ change this method of attack and invent a great variety of little weapon call would syllogism as in the _ socratick _ way of dispute you agree to every thing which you opponent advance in the _ aristotelick _ you be still deny and contradict some part or other of what he say _ socrate _ conquer you by stratagem _ aristotle _ by force : the one take the town by sap the other sword in hand the university of _ europe _ for many year carry on they debate by syllogism insomuch that we see the knowledge of several century lay out into objection and answer and all the good sense of the age cut and mince into almost a infinitude of distinction when we university find that there be no end of wrangle this way they invent a kind of argument which be not reducible to any mood or figure in _ aristotle _ it be call the _ argumentum basilinum _ -lrb- other write it _ bacilinum _ or _ baculinum _ -rrb- which be pretty well express would in we _ english _ word _ club-law _ when they be not able to confute they antagonist they knock would he down it be they method in these polemical debate first to discharge they

beauty and loveliness of virtue without consider it as a duty and as the means of make we happy both now and hereafter i design therefore this speculation as a essay upon that subject in which i shall consider virtue no further than as it be in it self of a amiable nature after have premise that i understand by the word virtue such a general notion as be affix to it by the writer of morality and which by devout man generally go under the name of religion and by man of the world under the name of honor hypocrisy it self do great honor or rather justice to religion and tacitly acknowledge it to be a ornament to human nature the hypocrite would not be at so much pain to put on the appearance of virtue if he do not know it be the most proper and effectual means to gain the love and esteem of mankind we learn from _ hierode _ it be a common say among the heathen that the wise man hate no body but only love the virtuous _ tully _ have a very beautiful gradation of thought to shew how amiable virtue be we love a virtuous man say he who live in the remotest part of the earth though we be altogether out of the reach of he virtue and can receive from it no manner of benefit nay one who die several age ago raise a secret fondness and benevolence for he in we mind when we read he story : nay what be still more one who have be the enemy of we country provide he war be regulate by justice and humanity as in the instance of _ pyrrhus _ whom _ tully _ mention on this occasion in opposition to _ hannibal _ such be the natural beauty and loveliness of virtue stoicism which be the pedantry of virtue ascribe all good qualification of what kind soever to the virtuous man accordingly -lrb- cato -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the character _ tully _ have leave of he carry matter so far that he would not allow any one but a virtuous man to be handsome this indeed look more like a philosophical rant than the real opinion of a wise man yet this be what _ cato _ very seriously maintain in short the stoic think they could not sufficiently represent the excellence of virtue if they do not comprehend in the notion of it all possible perfection -lrb- s -rrb- and therefore do not only suppose that it be transcendently beautiful in it self but that it make the very body amiable and banish every kind of deformity from the person in whom it reside it be a common observation that the most abandon to all sense of goodness be apt to wish those who be related to they of a different character and it be very observable that none be more strike with the charm of virtue in the fair sex than those who by they very admiration of it be carry to a desire of ruin it a virtuous mind in a fair body be indeed a fine picture in a good light and therefore it be no wonder that it make the beautiful sex all over charm as virtue in general be of a amiable and lovely nature there be some particular kind of it which be more so than other and these be such as dispose we to do good to mankind temperance and abstinence faith and devotion be in themselves perhaps as laudable as any other virtue but those which make a man popular and beloved be justice charity munificence and in short all the good quality that render we beneficial to each other for which reason even a extravagant man who have nothing else to recommend he but a false generosity be often more beloved and esteemed than a person of a much more finished character who be defective in this particular the two great ornament of virtue which shew she in the most advantageous view and make she altogether lovely be chearfulness and good-nature these generally go together as a man can not be agreeable to other who be not easy within himself they be both very requisite in a virtuous mind to keep out melancholy from the many serious thought it be engage in and to hinder its natural hatred of vice from souring into severity and censoriousness if virtue be of this amiable nature what can we think of those who can look upon it with a eye of hatred and ill-will or can suffer they aversion for a party to blot out all the merit of the person who be engage in it a man must be excessively stupid as well as uncharitable who believe that there be no virtue but on he own side and that there be not man as honest as himself who may differ from he in political principle man may oppose one another in some particulars but ought not to carry they hatred to those quality which be of so amiable a nature in themselves and have nothing to do with the point in dispute man of virtue though of different interest ought to consider themselves as more nearly unite with one another than with the vicious part of mankind who embark with they in the same civil concern we should bear the same love towards a man of honor who be a living antagonist which _ tully _ tell we in the forementioned passage every one naturally do to a enemy that be dead in short we should esteem virtue though in a foe and abhor vice though in a friend i speak this with a eye to those cruel treatment which man of all side be apt to give the character of those who do not agree with they how many person of undoubted probity and exemplary virtue on either side be blackn and defame how many man of honor expose to publick obloquy and reproach those therefore who be either the instrument or abettor in such infernal dealings

the emperor nurse have be very much addict to drinking which habit _ nero _ receive from he nurse and be so very particular in this that the people take so much notice of it as instead of _ tiberius nero _ they call would he _ biberius mero _ the same _ diodorus _ also relate of _ caligulum _ predecessor to _ nero _ that he nurse use to moisten the nipple of she breast frequently with blood to make _ caligulum _ take the better hold of they which say _ diodorus _ be the cause that make he so blood-thirsty and cruel all he life-time after that he not only committed frequent murder by he own

parent may be corrupt by a ill-tempered nurse how many child do we see daily bring into fit consumption rickets & c merely by suck they nurse when in a passion or fury but indeed almost any disorder of the nurse be a disorder to the child and few nurse can be find in this town but what labor under some distemper or other the first question that be generally ask a young woman that want to be a nurse -lrb- why -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- she should be a nurse to other people child be answer by she have a ill husband and that she must make shift to live i think now this very answer be enough to give any body a shock if duly consider for a ill husband may or ten to one if he do not bring home to he wife a ill distemper or at least vexation and disturbance besides as she take the child out of meer necessity she food will be accordingly or else very coarse at best whence proceed a ill-concocted and coarse food for the child for as the blood so be the milk and hence i be very well assure proceeds the scurvy the evil and many other distemper i beg of you for the sake of the many poor infant that may and will be save by weigh this case seriously to exhort the people with the utmost vehemence to let the child suck they own -lrb- mother -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- both for the benefit of mother and child for the general argument that a mother be weakn by give suck to she child be vain and simple i will maintain that the mother grow stronger by it and will have she health better than she would have otherwise : she will find it the greatest cure and preservative for the vapor and future miscarriage much beyond any other remedy whatsoever : she child will be like giant whereas otherwise they be but live shadow and like unripe fruit and certainly if a woman be strong enough to bring forth a child she be beyond all doubt strong enough to nurse it afterwards it grieve I to observe and consider how many poor child be daily ruin would by careless nurse and yet how tender ought they to be of a poor infant since the least hurt or blow especially upon the head may make it senseless stupid or otherwise miserable for ever but i can not well leave this subject as yet for it seem to I very unnatural that a woman that have feed a child as part of she self for nine month should have no desire to nurse it farther when bring to light and before she eye and when by its cry it implore she assistance and the office of a mother do not the very cruellest of brute tend they young one with all the care and delight imaginable for how can she be call have a mother that will not nurse she young one the earth be call the mother of all thing not because she produce but because she maintain and nurse what she produce the generation of the infant be the effect of desire but the care of it argue virtue and choice i be not ignorant but that there be some case of necessity where a mother can not give suck and then out of two evil the least must be choose but there be so very few that i be sure in a thousand there be hardly one real instance for if a woman do but know that she husband can spare about three or six shilling a week extraordinary -lrb- altho this be but seldom consider

glance she eye or play with she fan as for news-monger politician mimick story-teller with other character of that nature which give birth to loquacity they be as commonly find among the man as the woman for which reason i shall pass they over in silence i have often be puzzle to assign a cause why woman should have this talent of a ready utterance in so much greater perfection than man i have sometimes fancy that they have not a retentive power or the faculty of suppress they thought as man have but that they be necessitate to speak every thing they think and if so it would perhaps furnish a very strong argument to the _ cartesian _ for the supporting of they -lrb- doctrine -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- that the soul always think but as several be of opinion that the fair sex be not altogether

be a excellent anatomist have promise I by the first opportunity to dissect a woman 's tongue and to examine whether there may not be in it certain juice which render it so wonderfully voluble -lrb- or -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- flippant or whether the fiber of it may not be make up of a finer or more pliant thread or whether there be not in it some particular muscle which dart it up and down by such sudden glance and vibration or whether in the last place there may not be certain undiscovered channel run from the head and the heart to this little instrument of loquacity and convey into it a perpetual affluence of animal spirit nor must i omit the reason which _ hudibra _ have give why those who can talk on trifle speak with the greatest fluency namely that the tongue be like a race-horse which run the faster the lesser weight it carry which of these reason soever may be look upon as the most probable i think the _ irishman 's _ thought be very natural who after some hour conversation

be after this manner that i shall consider laughter and ridicule in my present paper man be the merriest species of the creation all above and below he be serious he see thing in a different light from other being and find he mirth -lrb- a -rrb- rise from object that perhaps cause something like pity or displeasure in higher nature laughter be indeed a very good counterpoise to the spleen and it seem but reasonable that we should be capable of receive joy from what be no real good to we since we can receive grief from what be no real evil i have in my forty-seventh paper raise a speculation on the notion of a modern philosopher -lrb- 1 -rrb- who describe the first motive of laughter to be a secret comparison which we make between we self and the person we laugh at or in other word that satisfaction which we receive from the opinion of some pre-eminence in we self when we see the absurdity of another or when we reflect on any past absurdity of we own this seem to hold in most case and we may observe that the vainest part of mankind be the most addict to this passion i have read a sermon of a conventual in the church of _ rome _ on those word of the wise man _ i say of laughter it be mad and of mirth what do it _ upon which he lay it down as a point of doctrine that laughter be the effect of original sin and that _ adam _ could not laugh before the fall laughter while it last slacken and unbrace the mind weaken the faculty and cause a kind of remissness and dissolution in all the power of the soul : and thus far it may be look upon as a weakness in the composition of human nature but if we consider the frequent relief we receive from it and how often it break the gloom which be apt to depress the mind and damp we spirit with transient unexpected gleam of joy one would take care not to grow too wise for so great a pleasure of life the talent of turn man into ridicule and expose to laughter those one converse with be the qualification of little ungenerous temper a young man with this cast of mind cut himself off from all manner of improvement every one have he flaw and weakness nay the greatest blemish be often find in the most shine character but what a absurd thing be it to pass over all the valuable part of a man and fix we attention on he infirmity to observe he imperfection more than he virtue and to make use of he for the sport of other rather than for we own improvement we therefore very often find that person the most accomplish in ridicule be those who be very shrewd at hit a blot without exert any thing masterly in themselves as there be many eminent critick who never writ a good line there be many admirable buffoon that animadvert upon every single defect in another without ever discover the least beauty of they own by this mean these unlucky little wit often gain reputation in the esteem of vulgar mind and raise themselves above person of much more laudable character if the talent of ridicule be employ to laugh man out of vice and folly it might be of some use to the world but instead of this we find that it be generally make use of to laugh man out of virtue and good sense by attack every thing that be solemn and serious decent and praiseworthy in human life we may observe that in the first age of the world when the great soul and master-piece of human nature be produce man shine by a noble simplicity of behavior and be stranger to those little embellishment which be so fashionable in we present conversation and it be very remarkable that notwithstanding we fall short at present of the ancient in poetry painting oratory history architecture and all the noble art and science which depend more upon genius than experience we exceed they as much in doggerel humor burlesque and all the trivial art of ridicule we meet with more raillery among the modern but more good sense among the ancient the two great branch of ridicule in write be comedy and burlesque the first ridicule person by draw they in they proper character the other by draw they quite unlike themselves burlesque be therefore of two kind the first represent mean person in the accoutrements of hero the other describe great person act and speak like the basest among the people _ don quixote _ be a instance of the first and _ lucian _ god of the second it be a dispute among the critick whether burlesque poetry run best in heroick verse like that of the _ dispensary _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- or in doggerel like that of _ hudibra _ i think where the low character be to be raise the heroick be the proper measure but when a hero be to be pull down and degrade it be do best in doggerel if _ hudibra _ have be set out with as much wit and humor in heroick verse as he be in doggerel he would have make a much more agreeable figure than he do though the generality of he reader be so wonderfully please with the double rhime that i do not expect many will be of my opinion in this particular i shall conclude this essay upon laughter with observe that the metaphor of laugh apply to field and meadow when they be in flower or to tree when they be in blossom run through all language which i have not observe of any other metaphor except that of fire and burning when they be apply to love this shew that we naturally regard laughter as what be in it self both amiable and beautiful for this reason likewise _ venus _ have

propose that no instrument of this nature should be make use of which i have not tune and license after have carefully examine in what manner it may affect the ear of she majesty 's liege subject

itinerant tradesman before they make they appearance in we street as also to accommodate they cry to they respective wares and to take care in particular that those may not make the most noise who have the least to sell which be very observable in the vender of card-match to whom i can not but apply that old proverb of _ much cry but little wool _ some of these last mention musician be so very loud in the sale of these trifling manufacture that a honest splenetick gentleman of my acquaintance bargain with one of they never to come into the street where he live : but what be the effect of this contract why the whole tribe of card-match-maker which frequent that quarter pass by he door the very next day in hope of be buy off after the same manner it be another great imperfection in we _

that one would think the enemy be at we gate this likewise i would take upon I to regulate in such a manner that there should be some distinction make between the spreading of a victory a march or a

more inexcusable because these be wares which be in no danger of cool upon they hand there be other who affect a very slow time and be in my opinion much more tuneable than the former the cooper in

be very often ask if they have any chair to mend you own memory may suggest to you many other lamentable ditty of the same nature in which the musick be wonderfully languish and melodious i be always please with that particular time of the year which be proper for the pickling of dill and cucumber but alas this cry like the song of the -lrb- nightingale -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- be not hear above two

well-regulated city those humourist be to be tolerate who not contented with the traditional cry of they forefather have invent particular song and tune of they own : such as be not many year since the pastryman commonly know by the name of the colly-molly-puff and such as be at this day the vender of powder and wash-ball who if i be rightly inform go under the name of _ powder-watt _ i must not here omit one particular absurdity which run through this whole vociferous generation and which render they cry very often not only incommodious but altogether useless to the publick i mean that idle accomplishment which they all of they aim at of cry so as not to be understand whether or no they have learn this from several of we affect singer i will not take upon I to say but most certain it be that people know the wares they deal in rather by they tune than by they word insomuch that i have sometimes see a country boy run out to buy apple of a bellows-mender and gingerbread from a grinder of knife and scissar nay so strangely infatuate be some very eminent artist of this particular grace in a cry that none but then acquaintance be able to guess at they profession for who else can know

prosecution of he design as this be the end of the passion in general so it be particularly of ambition which push the soul to such action as be apt to procure honor and reputation to the actor but if we carry we reflection higher we may discover further end of providence in implant this passion in mankind it be necessary for the world that art should be invent and improve book write and transmit to posterity nation conquer and civilized : now since the proper and genuine motive to these and the like great action would only influence virtuous mind there would be but small improvement in the world be there not some common principle of action work equally with all man and such a principle be ambition or a desire of fame by which -lrb- great -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- endowment be not suffer to lie idle and useless to the publick and many vicious man over-reach as it be and engage contrary to they natural inclination in a glorious and laudable course of action for we may further observe that man of the greatest ability be most fire with ambition : and that on the contrary mean and narrow mind be the least actuate by it : whether it be that -lrb- a man 's sense of he own -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- incapacity make -lrb- he -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- despair of come at fame or that -lrb- he have -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- not enough range of think to look out for any good which do not more immediately

passion as would be useless to the world and a torment to -lrb- himself -lrb- 8 -rrb- -rrb- be not this desire of fame very strong the difficulty of obtain it and the danger of lose it when obtain would be sufficient to deter a man from so vain a pursuit how few be there who be furnish with ability sufficient to recommend they action to the admiration of the world and to distinguish themselves from the rest of mankind providence for the most part set we upon a level and observe a kind of proportion in its dispensation towards we if it render we perfect in one accomplishment it generally leave we defective in another and seem careful rather of preserve every person from be mean and deficient in he qualification than of make any single one eminent or extraordinary and among those who be the most richly endowed by nature and accomplish by they own industry how few be there whose virtue be not obscure by the ignorance prejudice or envy of they beholder some man can not discern between a noble and a mean action other be apt to attribute they to some false end or intention and other purposely misrepresent or put a wrong interpretation on they but the more to enforce this consideration we may observe that those be generally most unsuccessful in they pursuit after fame who be most desirous of obtain it it be _ sallust 's _ remark upon _ cato _ that the less he covet glory the more he acquire it -lrb- 9 -rrb- man take a ill-natur 'd pleasure in cross we inclination and disappointing we in what we heart be most set upon when therefore they have discover the passionate desire of fame in the ambitious man -lrb- as no temper of mind be more apt to show it self -rrb- they become sparing and reserve in they commendation they envy he the satisfaction of a applause and look on they praise rather as a kindness do to he person than as a tribute pay to he merit other who be free from this natural perverseness of temper grow wary in they praise of one who set too great a value on they lest they should raise he too high in he own imagination and by consequence remove he to a greater distance from themselves but further this desire of fame naturally betray the ambitious man into such indecency as be a lessen to he reputation he be still afraid lest any of he action should be throw away in private lest he desert should be conceal from the notice of the world or receive any disadvantage from the report which other make of they this often set he on empty boast and ostentation of himself and betray he into vain fantastick recital of he own performance : he discourse generally lean one way and whatever be the subject of it tend obliquely either to the detract from other or to the extolling of himself vanity be the natural weakness of a ambitious man which expose he to the secret scorn and derision of those he converse with and ruin the character he be so industrious to advance by it for tho he action be never so glorious they lose they lustre when they be draw at large and set to show by he own hand and as the world be more apt to find fault than to commend the boast will probably be censure when the great action that occasion it be forget besides this very desire of fame be look on as a meanness -lrb- and -lrb- 10 -rrb- -rrb- imperfection in the greatest character a solid and substantial greatness of soul look down with a generous neglect on the censure and applause of the multitude and place a man beyond the little noise and strife of tongue accordingly we find in we self a secret awe and veneration for the character of one who move above we in a regular and illustrious course of virtue without any regard to we good or ill opinion of he to we reproach or commendation as on the contrary it be usual for we when we would take off from the fame and reputation of a action to ascribe it to vain-glory and a desire of fame in the actor nor be this common judgment and opinion of mankind ill-founded : for certainly it denote no great bravery of mind to be work up to any noble action by so selfish a motive and to do that out of a desire of fame which we could not be prompt to by a disinterested love to mankind or by a generous passion for the glory of he that make we thus be fame a thing difficult to be obtain by all but particularly by those who thirst after it since most man have so much either of ill-nature or of wariness as not to gratify -lrb- or -lrb- 11 -rrb- -rrb- sooth the vanity of the ambitious man and since this very thirst after fame naturally betray he into such indecency as be a lessen to he

rise in the esteem of mankind all those who make they entrance into the world with the same advantage and be once look on as he equal be apt to think the fame of he merit a reflection on they own indesert and will therefore take care to reproach he with the scandal of some past action or derogate from the worth of the present that they may still keep he on the same level with themselves the like kind of consideration often stir up the envy of such as be once he superior who think it a detraction from they merit to see another get ground upon they and overtake they in the pursuit of glory and will therefore endeavor to sink he reputation that they may the better preserve they own those who be once he equal envy and defame he because they now see he they superior and those who be once he superior because they look upon he as they equal but further a man whose extraordinary reputation thus lift he up to the notice and observation of mankind draw a multitude of eye upon he that will narrowly inspect every part of he consider he nicely in all view and not be a little pleased when they have take he in the worst and most disadvantageous light there be many who find a pleasure in contradict the common report of fame and in spread abroad the weakness of a exalted character they publish they ill-natur would discovery with a secret pride and applaud themselves for the singularity of they judgment which have search deeper than other detect what the rest of the world have overlook and find a flaw in what the generality of mankind admire other there be who proclaim the error and infirmity of a great man with a inward satisfaction and complacency if they discover none of the like error and infirmity in themselves for while they be expose another weakness they be tacitly aim at they own commendation who be not subject to the like infirmity and be apt to be transport with a secret kind of vanity to see themselves superior in some respects to one of a sublime and celebrated reputation nay it very often happen that none be more industrious in publish the blemish of a extraordinary reputation than such as lie open to the same censure in they own character as either hope to excuse they own defect by the authority of so high a example or raise a imaginary applause to themselves for resemble a person of a exalted reputation though in the blameable part of he character if all these secret spring of detraction fail yet very often a vain ostentation of wit set a man on attack a established name and sacrifice it to the mirth and laughter of those about he a satyr or a libel on one of the common stamp never meet with that reception and approbation among its reader as what be aim at a person whose merit place he upon a eminence and give he a more conspicuous figure among man whether it be that we think it shew greater art to expose and turn to ridicule a man whose character seem so improper a subject for it or that we be please by some implicit kind of revenge to see he take down and humble in he reputation and in some measure reduce to we own rank who have so far raise himself above we in the report and opinion of mankind thus we see how many dark and intricate motive there be to detraction and defamation and how many malicious spy be search into the action of a great man who be not always the best prepare for so narrow a inspection for we may generally observe that we admiration of a famous man lessen upon we nearer acquaintance with he and that we seldom hear the description of a celebrated person without a catalogue of some notorious weakness and infirmity the reason may be because any little slip be more conspicuous and observable in he conduct than in another as it be not of a piece with the rest of he character or because it be impossible for a man at the same time to be attentive to the more important -lrb- part -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- of he life and to keep a watchful eye over all the inconsiderable circumstance of he behavior and conversation or because as we have before observe the same temper of mind which incline we to a desire of fame naturally betray we into such slip and unwariness as be not incident to man of a contrary disposition after all it must be confess would that a noble and triumphant merit often break through and dissipate these little spot and sully in its reputation but if by a mistaken pursuit after fame or through human infirmity any false step be make in the more momentous concern of life the whole scheme of ambitious design be break and disappoint the smaller stain and blemish may die away and disappear amidst the brightness that surround they but a blot of a deeper nature cast a shade on all the other beauty and darken the whole character how difficult therefore be it to preserve a great name when he that have acquire it be so obnoxious to such little weakness and infirmity as be no small diminution to it when discover especially when they be so industriously proclaimed and aggravate by such as be once he superior or equal by such as would set to show they judgment or they wit and by such as be guilty or innocent of the same slip or misconduct in they own behavior but be there none of these disposition in other to censure a famous man nor any such miscarriage in himself yet would he meet with no small trouble in keep up he reputation in all its height and splendor there must be always a noble train of action to preserve he fame in life and motion for when it be once at a stand it naturally flag and languish admiration be a very short-liv would passion that immediately decay upon grow familiar with its object unless it be still feed with fresh discovery and keep alive by a new perpetual succession of miracle rise up to its view and even the greatest action of a celebrated -lrb- person -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- labor under this disadvantage that however surprising and extraordinary they may be they be no more than what be expect from he but on the contrary if they fall any thing below the opinion that be conceive of he tho they might raise the reputation of another they be a diminution to _ he _ one would think there should be something wonderfully please in the possession of fame that notwithstanding all these mortifying consideration can engage a man in so desperate a pursuit and yet if we consider the little happiness that attend a great character and the multitude of disquietude to which the desire of it subject a ambitious mind one would be still the more surprised to see so many restless candidate for glory ambition raise a secret tumult in the soul it inflame the mind and put it into a violent hurry of thought : it be still reach after a empty imaginary good that have not in it the power to abate or satisfy it most other thing we long for can allay the craving of they proper sense and for a while set the appetite at rest : but fame be a good so wholly foreign to we nature that we have no faculty in the soul adapt to it nor any organ in the body to relish it a object of desire place out of the possibility of fruition it may indeed fill the mind for a while with a giddy kind of pleasure but it be such a pleasure as make a man restless and uneasy under it and which do not so much satisfy the present thirst as it excite fresh desire and set the soul on new enterprise for how few ambitious man be there who have get as much fame as they desire and whose thirst after it have not be as eager in the very height of they reputation as it be before they become known and eminent among man there be not any circumstance in _ cæsars _ character which give I a greater idea of he than a say which _ cicero _ tell we -lrb- 3 -rrb- he frequently make use of in private conversation _ that he be satisfy with he share of life and fame se satis vel ad naturam vel ad gloriam vixisse _ many indeed have give over they pursuit after fame but that have proceed either from the disappointment they have meet in it or from they experience of the little pleasure which attend it or from the better information or natural coldness of old age but seldom from a full satisfaction and acquiescence in they present enjoyment of it nor be fame only unsatisfying in it self but the desire of it lay we open to many accidental trouble which those be free from who have no such a tender regard for it how often be the ambitious man cast down and disappoint if he receive no praise where he expect it nay how often be he mortify with the very praise he receive if they do not rise so high as he think they ought which they seldom do unless increase by flattery since few man have so good a opinion of we as we have of we self but if the ambitious man can be so much grieve even with praise it self how will he be able to bear up under scandal and defamation for the same temper of mind which make he desire fame make he hate reproach if he can be transport with the extraordinary praise of man he will be as much deject by they censure how little therefore be the happiness of a ambitious man who give every one a dominion over it who thus subject himself to the good or ill speech of other and put it in the power of every malicious tongue to throw he into a fit of melancholy and destroy he natural rest and repose of mind especially when we consider that the world be more apt to censure than applaud and himself fuller of imperfection than virtue we may further observe that such a man will be more grieve for the loss of fame than he could have be please with the enjoyment of it for tho the presence of this imaginary good can not make we happy the absence of it may make we miserable : because in the enjoyment of a object we only find that share of pleasure which it be capable of give we but in the loss of it we do not proportion we grief to the real value it bear but to the value we fancy and imagination set upon it so inconsiderable be the satisfaction that fame bring along with it and so great the disquietude to which it make we liable the desire of it stir up very uneasy motion in the mind and be rather inflamed than satisfy by the presence of the thing desire the enjoyment of it bring but very little pleasure tho the loss or want of it be very sensible and afflicting and even this little happiness be so very precarious that it wholly depend on the will of other we be not only tortured by the

a particular order and method i have first of all consider the reason why providence may have implant in we mind such a principle of action i have in the next place shewn from many consideration first that fame be a thing difficult to be obtain and easily lose secondly that it bring the ambitious man very little happiness but subject he to much uneasiness and dissatisfaction i shall in the last place shew that it hinder we from obtain a end which we have ability to acquire and which be accompany with fulness of satisfaction i need not tell my reader that i mean by this end that happiness which be reserve for we in another world which every one have ability to procure and which will bring along with it fulness of joy and pleasure for evermore how the pursuit after fame may hinder we in the attainment of this great end i shall leave the reader to collect from the three follow consideration _ first _ because the strong desire of fame breed several vicious habit in the mind _ secondly _ because many of those action which be apt to procure fame be not in they nature conducive to this we ultimate happiness _ thirdly _ because if we should allow the same action to be the proper instrument both of acquire fame and of procure this happiness they would nevertheless fail in the attainment of this last end if they proceed from a desire of the first these three proposition be self-evident to those who be verse in speculation of morality for which reason i shall not enlarge upon they but proceed to a point of the same nature which may open to we a more uncommon field of speculation from what have be already observe i think we may make a natural conclusion that it be the greatest folly to seek the praise or approbation of any be besides the supreme and that for these two reason because no other be can make a right judgment of we and esteem we accord to we merit and because we can procure no considerable benefit or advantage from the esteem and approbation of any other be in the first place no other be can make a right judgment of we and esteem we accord to we merit create being see nothing but we outside and can -lrb- therefore -rrb- only frame a judgment of we from we exterior action and behavior but how unfit these be to give we a right notion of each other perfection may appear from several consideration there be many virtue which in they own nature be incapable of any outward representation : many silent perfection in the soul of a good man which be great ornament to human nature but not able to discover themselves to the knowledge of other they be transact in private without noise or show and be only visible to the great searcher of heart what action can express the entire purity of thought which refine and sanctify a virtuous man that secret rest and contentedness of mind which give he a perfect enjoyment of he present condition that inward pleasure and complacency which he feel in do good that delight and satisfaction which he take in the prosperity and happiness of another these and the like virtue be the hidden beauty of a soul the secret grace which can not be discover by a mortal eye but make the soul lovely and precious in he sight from whom no secret be conceal again there be many virtue which want a opportunity of exert and shew themselves in action every virtue require time and place a proper object and a fit conjuncture of circumstance for the due exercise of it a state of poverty obscure all the virtue of liberality and munificence the patience and fortitude of a martyr or confessor lie conceal in the flourishing time of christianity some virtue be only see in affliction and some in prosperity some in a private and other in a publick capacity but the great sovereign of the world behold every perfection in its obscurity and not only see what we do but what we would do he view we behavior in every concurrence of affair and see we engage in all the possibility of action he discover the martyr and confessor without the tryal of flame and torture and will hereafter entitle many to the reward of action which they have never the opportunity of perform another reason why man can not form a right judgment of we be because the same action may be aim at different end and arise from quite contrary principle action be of so mixt a nature and so full of circumstance that as man pry into they more or less or observe some part more than other they take different hint and put contrary interpretation on they so that the same action may represent a man as hypocritical and design to one which make he appear a saint or hero to another he therefore who look upon the soul through its outward action often see it through a deceitful medium which be apt to discolor and pervert the object : so that on this account also _ he _ be the only proper judge of we perfection who do not guess at the sincerity of we intention from the goodness of we action but weigh the goodness of we action by the sincerity of we intention but further it be impossible for outward action to represent the perfection of the soul because they can never shew the strength of those principle from whence they proceed they be not adequate expression of we virtue and can only shew we what habit be in the soul without discover the degree and perfection of such habit they be at best but weak resemblance of we intention faint and imperfect copy that may acquaint we with the general design but can never express the beauty and life of the original but the great judge of all the earth know every different state and degree of human improvement from those weak stirring and tendency of the will which have not yet form themselves into regular purpose and design to the last entire finishing and consummation of a good habit he behold the first imperfect rudiment of a virtue in the soul and keep a watchful eye over it in all its progress till it have receive every grace it be capable of and appear in its full beauty and perfection thus we see that none but the supreme be can esteem we accord to we proper merit since all other must judge of we from we outward action which can never give they a just estimate of we since there be many perfection of a man which be not capable of appear in action many which allow no natural incapacity of shew themselves want a opportunity of do it or should they all meet with a opportunity of appear by action yet those action maybe misinterpret and apply to wrong principle or though they plainly discover the principle from whence they proceed they could never shew the degree strength and perfection of those principle and as the supreme be be the only proper judge of we perfection so be he the only fit rewarder of they this be a consideration that come home to we interest as the other adapt it self to we ambition and what could the most aspiring or the most selfish man desire more be he to form the notion of a be to whom he would recommend himself than such a knowledge as can discover the least appearance of perfection in he and such a goodness as will proportion a reward to it let the ambitious man therefore turn all he desire of fame this way and that he may propose to himself a fame worthy of he ambition let he consider that if he employ he ability to the best advantage the time will come when the supreme governor of the world the great judge of mankind who see every degree of perfection in other and possess all possible perfection in himself shall proclaim he worth before man and angel and pronounce to he in the presence of the whole

private scandal nor any thing that may tend to the defamation of particular person family or society there be not one of these above-mentioned subject that would not sell a very indifferent paper could i think of gratify the publick by such mean and base method but notwithstanding i have reject every thing that savor of party every thing that be loose and immoral and every thing that might create uneasiness in the mind of particular person i find that the demand of my papers have encrease every month since they first appearance in the world this do not perhaps reflect so much honor upon my self as on my reader who give a much greater attention to discourse of virtue and morality than ever i expect or indeed could hope when i break loose from that great body of writer who have employ they wit and part in propagate vice and irreligion i do not question but i should be treat as a odd kind of fellow that have a mind to appear singular in my way of writing : but the general reception i have find convince I that the world be not so corrupt as we be apt to imagine and that if those man of part who have be employ in vitiate the age have endeavor would to rectify and amend it they need -lrb- not -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- have sacrifice they good sense and virtue to they fame and reputation no man be so sink in vice and ignorance but there be still some hidden seed of goodness and

how much care i have avoid all such thought as be loose obscene or immoral and i believe my reader would still think the better of I if he know the pain i be at in qualify what i write after such a manner that nothing may be interpret as aim at private person for this reason when i draw any faulty character i consider all those person to whom the malice of the world may possibly apply it and take care to dash it with such particular circumstance as may prevent all such ill-natured application if i write any thing on a black man i run over in my mind all the eminent person in the nation who be of that complection : when i place a imaginary name at the head of a character i examine every syllable and letter of it that it may not bear any resemblance to one that be real i know very well the value which every man set upon he reputation and how painful it be to be expose to the mirth and derision of the publick and should therefore scorn to divert my reader at the expence of any private man as i have be thus tender of every particular person reputation so i have take more than ordinary care not to give offence to those who appear in the higher figure of life i would not make

even such author as i could not name without honor this i must confess to have be a piece of very great self-denial : for as the publick relish nothing better than the ridicule which turn upon a writer of any eminence so there be nothing which a man that have but a very ordinary talent in ridicule may execute with greater ease one might raise laughter for a quarter of a year together upon the work of a person who have publish but a very few volume for which -lrb- reason -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- i be astonish that those who have appear against this paper have make so very little of it the

pleasing forgetfulness or negligence of the particular hurry of life in which he be engage together with a longing for that state which he be charm with in description but when we consider the world it self and how few there be capable of a religious learn or philosophick solitude we shall be apt to change a regard to that sort of solitude for be a little singular in enjoy time after the way a man himself like best in the world without go so far as wholly to withdraw from it i have often observe there be not a man breathing who do not differ from all other man as much in the sentiment of he

spirit of contradiction : these man do every thing which they be able to support as if guilt and impunity could not go together they choose a thing only because another dislike it and affect forsooth a inviolable constancy in matter of no manner of moment thus sometimes a old fellow shall wear this or that sort of cut in he cloath with great integrity while all the rest of the world be degenerate

of a great fortune by secret method to other man if he have not the pomp of a numerous train and of professor of service to he he have every day he live the conscience that the widow the fatherless

be the fable -lrb- 4 -rrb- which be perfect or imperfect accord as the action which it relate be more or less so this action should have three qualification in it first it should be but one action secondly it should be a entire action and thirdly it should be a great action -lrb- 5 -rrb- to consider the action of the _ iliad _ _ æneid _ and _ paradise lose _ in these three several light _ homer

investing of _ troy _ it be manifest that the story of the poem would have be a series of several action he therefore open he poem with the discord of he prince and -lrb- artfully -lrb- 7 -rrb- -rrb-

manner _ æneas _ make he first appearance in the _ tyrrhene _ sea and within sight of _ italy _ because the action propose to be celebrate be that of he settle himself in _ latium _ but because it be necessary for the reader to know what have happen to he in the taking of _ troy _ and in the precede part of he voyage _ virgil _ make he hero relate it by way of episode in the second and third book of the _ æneid _ the contents of both which book come before those of the first book in the thread of the story tho for preserving of this unity of action they follow they in the disposition of the poem _ milton _ in imitation of these two great poet open he _ paradise lose _ with a infernal council plot the fall of man which be the action he propose to celebrate and as for those great action which precede in point of time the battle of the angel and the creation of the world -lrb- which would have entirely destroy the unity of he principal action have he relate they in the same order that they happen -rrb- he cast they into the fifth sixth and seventh book by way of episode to this noble poem _ aristotle _ himself allow that _ homer _ have nothing to boast of as to the unity of he fable -lrb- 9 -rrb- tho at the same time that great critick and philosopher endeavor to palliate this imperfection in the _ greek _ poet by impute it in some measure to the very nature of a epic poem some have be of opinion that the _ æneid _ -lrb- also labor -lrb- 10 -rrb- -rrb- in this particular and have episode which may be look upon as excrescency rather than as part of the action on the contrary the poem which we have now under we consideration have no other episode than such as naturally arise from the subject and yet be fill with such a multitude of astonishing -lrb- incident -lrb- 11 -rrb- -rrb- that it give we at the same time a pleasure of the greatest variety and of the greatest -lrb- simplicity uniform in its nature tho diversify in the execution -lrb- 12 -rrb- -rrb- i must observe also that as _ virgil _ in the poem which be design to celebrate the original of the _ roman _ empire have describe the birth of its great rival the _ carthaginian _ commonwealth : _ milton _ with the like art in he poem on the _ fall of man _ have relate the fall of those angel who be he profess enemy besides the many other beauty in such a episode its run parallel with the great action of the poem hinder it from break the unity so much as another episode would have do that have not so great a affinity with the principal subject in short this be the same kind of beauty which the critick admire in _ the spanish frier _ or _ the double discovery _ -lrb- 13 -rrb- where the two different plot look like counter-part and copy of one another the second qualification require in the action of a epic poem be that it should be a _ entire _ action : a action be entire when it be complete in all its part or as _ aristotle _ describe it when it consist of a begin a middle and a end nothing should go before it be intermix with it or follow after it that be not relate to it as on the contrary no single step should be omit in that just and regular progress which it must be suppose to take from its original to its consummation thus we see the anger of _ achille _ in its birth its continuance and effect and _ æneas 's _ settlement in _ italy _ carry on thro all the opposition in he way to it both by sea and land the action in _ milton _ excel -lrb- i think -rrb- both the former in this particular we see it contrived in hell execute upon earth and punish by heaven the part of it be tell in the most distinct manner and grow out of one another in the most natural -lrb- order -lrb- 14 -rrb- -rrb- the third qualification of a epic poem be its _ greatness _ the anger of _ achille _ be of such consequence that it embroil the king of _ greece _ destroy the hero of _ troy _ and engage all the god in faction _ æneas 's _ settlement in _ italy _ produce the _ cæsars _ and give birth to the _ roman _ empire _ milton 's _ subject be still greater than either of the former it do not determine the fate of single person or nation but of a whole species the united power of hell be join together for the destruction of mankind which they affect in part and would have complete have not omnipotence it self interpose the principal actor be man in he greatest perfection and woman in she highest beauty they enemy be the fall angel : the messiah they friend and the almighty they protector in short every thing that be great in the whole circle of be whether within the verge of nature or out of it have a proper part assign it in this noble poem in poetry as in architecture not only the whole but the principal member and every part of they should be great i will not presume to say that the book of game in the _ æneid _ or that in the _ iliad _ be not of this nature nor to reprehend _ virgil 's _ simile of the top -lrb- 15 -rrb- and many other of the same -lrb- kind -lrb- 16 -rrb- -rrb- in the _ iliad _ as liable to any censure in this particular but i think we may say without -lrb- derogate from -lrb- 17 -rrb- -rrb- those wonderful performance that there be a unquestionable magnificence in every part of _ paradise lose _ and indeed a much greater than could have be form upon any pagan system but _ aristotle _ by the greatness of the action do not only mean that it should be great in its nature but also in its duration or in other word that it should have a due length in it as well as what we properly call greatness the just measure of this kind of magnitude he explain by the follow similitude -lrb- 18 -rrb- a animal no bigger than a mite can not appear perfect to the eye because the sight take it in at once and have only a confused idea of the whole and not a distinct idea of all its part if on the contrary you should suppose a animal of ten thousand furlong in length the eye would be so fill with a single part of it that it could not give the mind a idea of the whole what these animal be to the eye a very short or a very long action would be to the memory the first would be as it be lose and swallow up by it and the other difficult to be contain in it _ homer _ and _ virgil _ have shew they principal art in this particular the action of the _ iliad _ and that of the _ æneid _ be in themselves exceed short but be so beautifully extend and diversify by the -lrb- invention -lrb- 19 -rrb- -rrb- of _ episode _ and the machinery of god with the like poetical ornament that they make up a agreeable story sufficient to employ the memory without overcharge it _ milton 's _ action be enrich with such a variety of circumstance that i have take as much pleasure in read the contents of he book as in the best invent story i ever meet with it be possible that the tradition on which the _ iliad _ and _ æneid _ be build have more circumstance in they than the history of the _ fall of man _ as it be relate in scripture besides it be easier for _ homer _ and _ virgil _ to dash the truth with fiction as they be in no danger of offend the religion of they country by it but as for _ milton _ he have not only a very few circumstance upon which to raise he poem but be also oblige to proceed with the greatest caution in every thing that he add out of he own invention and indeed notwithstanding all the restraint he be under he have fill he story with so many surprising incident which bear so close a analogy with what be deliver in holy writ that it be capable of please the most delicate reader without give offence to the most scrupulous the modern critick have collect from several hint in the _ iliad _ and _ æneid _ the space of time which be take up by the action of each of those poem but as a great part of _ milton 's _ story be transact in region that lie out of the reach of the sun and the sphere of day it be impossible to gratify the reader with such a calculation which indeed would be more curious than instructive none of the critick either ancient or modern have lay down rule to circumscribe the action of a epic poem with any determin would number of year day or hour _ this piece of criticism on _ milton 's paradise lose _ shall be carry on in -lrb- the -rrb- follow _ -lrb- saturday -rrb- _ papers _ l -lrb- footnote 1 : give place to he writer of rome and greece this application to milton of a line from the last elegy -lrb- 25th -rrb- in the second book of propertius be not only a example of addison 's felicity in choice of motto for a paper but be so bold and well-timed that it must have give a wholesome shock to the mind of many of the _ spectator _ reader addison be not before steele in appreciation of milton and diffusion of a true sense of he genius milton be the subject of the first piece of poetical criticism in the _ tatler _ where in he sixth number steele have say that all milton 's thought be wonderfully just and natural dwelt on the passage in which adam tell he thought upon first fall asleep soon after he creation this passage he contrast with the same apprehension of annihilation ascribe to eve in a much lower sense by dryden in he operatic version of _ paradise lose _ in _ tatler _ and _ spectator _ steele and addison have be equal contributor to the diffusion of a sense of milton 's genius in addison it have be strong even when at oxford in April 1694 a young man train in the taste of the day he omit shakespeare from a rhymed account of the chief english poet but of milton say : _ whate'er he pen describe i more than see whilst evry verse array would in majesty bold and sublime my whole attention draw and seem above the critic nicer law _ eighteen year older than he be when he write that addison now prepare by a series of Saturday essay -- the Saturday paper which reach many subscriber only in time for Sunday reading be always set apart in the _ spectator _ for moral or religious topic to show that judge also by aristotle and the critic nicer law milton be even technically a greater epic poet than either homer or virgil this nobody have concede dryden the best critic of the outgoing generation have say in the dedication of the translation of _ juvenal _ and _ persius _ publish in 1692 as for mr milton whom we all admire with so much justice he subject be not that of a heroick poem properly so call would : he design be the losing of we happiness he event be not prosperous like that of all other _ epique _ work -lrb- dryden 's french spelling of the word epic be suggestive for this new critical mode be one of the fashion that have be import from pari -rrb- he heavenly machine be many and he human person be but two but i will not take mr _ rymer 's _ work out of he hand : he have promise the world a critique on that author wherein tho he will not allow he poem for heroick i hope he will grant we that he thought be elevated he word sound and that no man have so happily copy would the manner of homer or so copiously translate he grecism and the latin elegancy of virgil ti true he run into a flat of thought sometimes for a hundred line together but tis when he be get into a track of scripture neither will i justify _ milton _ for he blank verse tho i may excuse he by the example of _ hanabal caro _ and other _ italian _ who have use it : for whatever cause he alledge for the abolish of rhime -lrb- which i have not now the leisure to examine -rrb- he own particular reason be plainly this that rhime be not he talent he have neither the ease of do it nor the grace of it so dryden who appreciate milton better than most of he critical neighbor write of he in 1692 the promise of rymer to discuss milton be make in 1678 when on the last page of he little book _ the tragedy of the last age consider would and examine by the practice of the ancient and by the common sense of all age in a letter to fleetwold shepheard esq _ -lrb- father of two lady who contribute a occasional letter to the _ spectator _ -rrb- he say : with the remain tragedy i shall also send you some reflection on that _ paradise lose _ of milton 's which some be pleased to call a poem and assert rhime against the slender sophistry wherewith he attaque it but two year after the appearance of dryden 's _ juvenal _ and _ persius _ rymer prefix to he translation of réné rapin 's _ reflection on aristotle 's poesie _ some reflection of he own on epic poet herein he speak under the head epic poetry of chaucer in whose time language be not capable of heroic character or spenser who want a true idea and lose himself by follow a unfaithful guide besides use a stanza which be in no wise proper for we language of sir william davenant who in _ gondibert _ have some stroke of a extraordinary judgment but be for unbeaten track and new way of think he hero be foreigner of cowley in whose _ davidei _ david be the least part of the poem and there be want of the one illustrious and perfect action which properly be the subject of a epick poem : all fail through ignorance or negligence of the fundamental rule or law of aristotle but he contemptuously pass over milton without mention réné rapin that great french oracle of whom dryden say in the preface to he own conversion of _ paradise lose _ into a opera that he be alone sufficient be all other critic lose to teach anew the art of write réné rapin in the work translate and introduce by rymer worship in aristotle the one god of all orthodox critic of he law he say there be no arrive at perfection but by these rule and they certainly go astray that take a different course and if a poem make by these rule fail of success the fault lie not in the art but in the artist all who have writ of this art have follow no other idea but that of aristotle again as to style to say the truth what be good on this subject be all take from aristotle who be the only source whence good sense be to be draw when one go about to write this be the critical temper addison resolve to meet on its own ground and do battle with for the honor of that greatest of all epic poet to whom he fearlessly say that all the greek and latin must give place in so do he might suggest here and there cautiously and without bring upon himself the discredit of much heresy -- indeed without be much of a heretic -- that even the divine aristotle sometimes fall short of perfection the conventional critic who believe they keep the gate of fame would neither understand nor credit he nine year after these papers appear charle gildon who pass for a critic of considerable mark edit with copious annotation as _ the law of poetry _ -lrb- 1721 -rrb- the duke of buckingham 's essay on poetry roscommon 's essay on translate verse and lord lansdowne on unnatural flight in poetry and in the course of comment gildon say that mr addison in the _ spectator _ in he criticism upon milton seem to have mistake the matter in endeavor to bring that poem to the rule of the epopoeium which can not be do it be not a heroic poem but a divine one and indeed of a new species it be plain that the proposition of all the heroic poem of the ancient mention some one person as the subject of they poem but milton begin he poem of thing and not of man the gildon be all go and when in the next generation after theirs national life begin in many part of europe strongly to

useful a kind that i can not forbear add my thought to yours on that subject methink it be a misfortune that the marriage state which in its own nature be adapt to give we the compleatest happiness this life be capable of should be so uncomfortable a one to so many as it daily prove but the mischief generally proceed from the unwise choice people make for themselves and expectation of happiness from thing not capable of give it nothing but the good quality of the person beloved can be a foundation for a love of judgment and discretion and whoever expect happiness from any thing but virtue wisdom good-humour and a similitude of manners will find themselves widely mistaken but how few be there who seek after these thing and do not rather make riches they chief if not they only aim how rare be it for a man when he engage himself in the thought of marriage to place he hope of have in such a woman a constant agreeable companion one who will divide he care and double he joy who will manage that share of he estate he intrust to she conduct with prudence and frugality govern he house with oeconomy and discretion and be a ornament to himself and family where shall we find the man who look out for one who place she chief happiness in the practice of virtue and make she duty she continual pleasure no : man rather seek for money as the complement of all they desire and regardless of what kind of wife they take they think riches will be a minister to all kind of pleasure and enable they to keep mistress horse hound to drink feast and game with they companion pay they debt contract by former extravagancy or some such vile and unworthy end and indulge themselves in pleasure which be a shame and scandal to humane nature now as for the woman how few of they be there who place the happiness of they marriage in the have a wise and virtuous friend one who will be faithful and just to all and constant and loving to they who with care and diligence will look after and improve the estate and without grudging allow whatever be prudent and convenient rather how few be there who do not place they happiness in outshine other in pomp and show and that do not think within themselves when they have marry such a rich person that none of they acquaintance shall appear so fine in they equipage so adorn in they person or so magnificent in they furniture as themselves thus they head be fill with vain idea and i heartily wish i could say that equipage and show be not the chief good of so many woman as i fear it be after this manner do both sex deceive themselves and bring reflection and disgrace upon the most happy and most honorable state of life whereas if they would but correct they depraved taste moderate they ambition and place they happiness upon proper

the consideration of its be the object of desire at power only as it sit upon another without any hope of partake any share of it at wisdom and capacity without any pretension to rival or envy its acquisition : i say to I who be really free from form any hope by behold the person of beautiful woman or warm my self into ambition from the success of other man this world be not only a meer scene but a very pleasant one do mankind but know the freedom which there be in keep thus aloof from the world i should have more imitator than the powerfullest man in the nation have follower to be no man 's rival in love or competitor in business be a character which if it do not recommend you as it ought to benevolence among those whom you live with yet have it certainly this effect that you do not stand so much in need of they approbation as you would if you aim at it more in set you heart on the same thing which the generality doat on by this mean and with this easy philosophy i be never less at a play than when i be at the theater but indeed i be seldom so well pleased with the action as in that place for most man follow nature no longer than while they be in they night-gown and all the busy part of the day be in character which they neither become or act in with pleasure to themselves or they beholder but to return to my lady : i be very well pleased to see so great a crowd of they assemble at a play wherein the heroine as the phrase be be so just a picture of the vanity of the sex in torment they admirer the lady who pine for the man whom she treat with so much impertinence and inconstancy be draw with much art and humor she resolution to be extremely civil but she vanity arise just at the instant that she resolve to express she self kindly be describe as by one who have study the sex but when my admiration be fix upon this excellent character and two or three other in the play i must confess i be move with the utmost indignation at the trivial senseless and unnatural representation of the chaplain it be possible there may be a pedant in holy order and we have see one or two of they in the world but such a driveler as sir _ roger _ so bereft of all manner of pride which be the characteristick of a pedant be what one would not believe could come into the head of the same man who draw the rest of the play the meeting between _ welford _ and he shew a wretch without any notion of the dignity of he function and it be out of all common sense that he should give a account of himself _ as one send four or five mile in a morning on foot for egg _ it be not to be deny but he part and that of the maid whom he make love to be excellently well perform but a thing which be blameable in it self grow still more so by the success in the execution of it it be so mean a thing to gratify a loose age with a scandalous representation of what be reputable among man not to say what be sacred that no beauty no excellence in a author ought to attone for it nay such excellence be a aggravation of he guilt and a argument that he err against the conviction of he own understanding and conscience wit should be try by this rule and a audience should rise against such a scene as throw down the reputation of any thing which the consideration of religion or decency should preserve from contempt but all this evil arise from this one corruption of mind that make man resent offence against they virtue less than those against they understand a author shall write as if he think there be not one man of honor or woman of chastity in the house and come off with applause : for a insult upon all the ten commandment with the little critick be not so bad as the breach of a unity of time or place half wit do not apprehend the misery that must necessarily flow from degeneracy of manners nor do they know that order be the support of society sir _ roger _ and he mistress be monster of the poet own form the sentiment in both of they be such as do not arise in fool of they education we all know that a silly scholar instead of be below every one he meet with be apt to be exalt above the rank of such as be really he superior : he arrogance be always found upon particular notion of distinction in he own head accompany with a pedantick scorn of all fortune and preheminence when compare with he knowledge and learn this very one character of sir _ roger _ as silly as it really be have do more towards the disparagement of holy order and consequently of virtue it self than all the wit that author or any other could make up for in the conduct of the longest life after it i do not pretend in say this to give myself air of more virtue than my neighbor but assert it from the principle by which mankind must always be govern sally of imagination be to

generally call they in _ english _ the fable and the character _ homer _ have excel all the heroic poet that ever write in the multitude and variety of he character every god that be admit into this poem act a part which would have be suitable to no other deity he prince be as much distinguish by they manners as by they dominion and even those among they whose character seem wholly make up of courage differ from one another as to the particular kind of courage in which they excel in short there be scarce a speech or action in the _ iliad _ which the reader may not ascribe to the person that speak or act without see he name at the head of it _ homer _ do not only outshine all other poet in the variety but also in the novelty of he character he have introduce among he _ grecian _ prince a person who have live thrice the age of man and converse with _ theseus hercule polyphemus _ and the first race of hero he principal actor be the -lrb- son -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- of a goddess not to mention the -lrb- offspring of other deity who have -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- likewise a place in he poem and the venerable _ trojan _ prince who be the father of so many king and hero there be in these several character of _ homer _ a certain dignity as well as novelty which adapt they in a more peculiar manner to the nature of a heroic poem tho at the same time to give they the greater variety he have describe a _ vulcan _ that be a buffoon among he god and a _ thersite _ among he mortal _ virgil _ fall infinitely short of _ homer _ in the character of he poem both as to they variety and novelty _ æneas _ be indeed a perfect character but as for _ achate _ tho he be stile the hero friend he do nothing in the whole poem which may deserve that title _ gya _ _ mnesteus _ _ sergestus _ and _ cloanthus _ be all of they man of the same stamp and character -- _ fortemque gyan fortemque cloanthum _ there be indeed several very natural incident on the part of _ ascanius _ as that of _ dido _ can not be sufficiently admire i do not see any thing new or particular in _ turnus _ _ palla _ and _ evander _ be -lrb- remote -rrb- copy of _ hector _ and _ priam _ as _ lausus _ and _ mezentius _ be almost parallel to _ palla _ and _ evander _ the character of _ nisus _ and _ eurialus _ be beautiful but common -lrb- we must not forget the part of _ sinon _ _ camillum _ and some few other which be fine improvement on the _ greek _ poet -rrb- in short there be neither that variety nor novelty in the person of the _ æneid _ which we meet with in those of the _ iliad _ if we look into the character of _ milton _ we shall find that he have introduce all the variety -lrb- he fable -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- be capable of receive the whole species of mankind be in two person at the time to which the subject of he poem be confine we have however four distinct character in these two person we see man and woman in the highest innocence and perfection and in the most abject state of guilt and infirmity the two last character be indeed very common and obvious but the two first be not only more magnificent but more new -lrb- 5 -rrb- than any character either in _ virgil _ or _ homer _ or indeed in the whole circle of nature _ milton _ be so sensible of this defect in the subject of he poem and of the few character it would afford he that he have bring into it two actor of a shadowy and fictitious nature in the person of _ sin _ and _ death _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- by which mean he have -lrb- work into -lrb- 7 -rrb- -rrb- the body of he fable a very beautiful and well-invented allegory but notwithstanding the fineness of this allegory may attone for it in some measure i can not think that person of such a chymerical existence be proper actor in a epic poem because there be not that measure of probability annex to they which be requisite in writings of this kind -lrb- as i shall shew more at large hereafter -rrb- _ virgil _ have indeed admit fame as a actress in the _ æneid _ but the part she act be very short and none of the most admire circumstance in that divine work we find in mock-heroic poem particularly in the _ dispensary _ and the _ lutrin _ -lrb- 8 -rrb- several allegorical person of this nature which be very beautiful in those composition and may perhaps be use as a argument that the author of they be of opinion -lrb- such -lrb- 9 -rrb- -rrb- character might have a place in a epic work for my own part i should be glad the reader would think so for the sake of the poem i be now examine and must further add that if such empty unsubstantial being may be ever make use of on this occasion never be any more nicely imagine and employ in more proper action than those of which i be now speak another principal actor in this poem be the great enemy of mankind the part of _ ulyss _ in _ homer odyssey _ be very much admire by _ aristotle _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- as perplexing that fable with very agreeable plot and intricacy not only by the many adventure in he voyage and the subtility of he behavior but by the various concealment and discovery of he person in several part of that poem but the crafty be i have now mention make a much longer voyage than _ ulyss _ put in practice many more wiles and stratagem and hide himself under a greater variety of shape and appearance all of which be severally detect to the great delight and surprize of the reader we may likewise observe with how much art the poet have vary several character of the person that speak to he infernal assembly on the contrary how have he represent the whole godhead exert it self towards man in its full benevolence under the three-fold distinction of a creator a redeemer and a comforter nor must we omit the person of _ raphael _ who amidst he tenderness and friendship for man shew such a dignity and condescension in all he speech and behavior as be suitable to a superior nature -lrb- the angel be indeed as much diversify in _ milton _ and distinguish by they proper part as the god be in _ homer _ or _ virgil _ the reader will find nothing ascribe to _ uriel gabriel michael _ or _ raphael _ which be not in a particular manner suitable to they respective character -rrb- there be another circumstance in the principal actor of the _ iliad _ and _ æneid _ which give a -lrb- peculiar -lrb- 11 -rrb- -rrb- beauty to those two poem and be therefore contrived with very great judgment i mean the author have choose for they hero person who be so nearly related to the people for whom they write _ achille _ be a greek and _ æneas _ the remote founder of _ rome _ by this mean they countryman -lrb- whom they principally propose to themselves for they reader -rrb- be particularly attentive to all the part of they story and sympathize with they hero in all they adventure a _ roman _ could not but rejoice in the escape success and victory of _ æneas _ and be grieve at any defeat misfortune or disappointment that befel he as a greek _ must have have the same regard for achille _ and it be plain that each of those poem have lose this great advantage among those reader to whom they hero be as stranger or indifferent person _ milton 's _ poem be admirable in this respect since it be impossible for any of its reader whatever nation country or people he may belong to not to be relate to the person who be the principal actor in it but what be still infinitely more to its advantage the principal actor in this poem be not only we progenitor but we representative we have a actual interest in every thing they do and no less than we utmost happiness be concerned and lie at stake in all they behavior i shall subjoin as a corollary to the foregoing remark a admirable observation out of _ aristotle _ which have be very much misrepresent in the quotation of some modern critick if a man of perfect and consummate virtue fall into a misfortune it raise we pity but not we terror because we do not fear that it may be we own case who do not resemble the suffer person but as that great philosopher add if we see a man of virtue mixt with infirmity fall into any misfortune it do not only raise we pity but we terror because we be afraid that the like misfortune may happen to we self who resemble the character of the suffer person i shall take another opportunity to observe that a person of a absolute and consummate virtue should never be introduce in tragedy and shall only remark in this place that the foregoing observation of _ aristotle _ -lrb- 12 -rrb- tho it may be true in other occasion do not hold in this because in the present case though the person who fall into misfortune be of the most perfect and consummate virtue it be not to be consider as what may possibly be but what actually be we own case since we be embark with they on the same bottom and must be partaker of they happiness or misery in this and some other very few instance _ aristotle 's _ rule for epic poetry -lrb- which he have draw from he reflection upon _ homer _ -rrb- can not be suppose to quadrate exactly with the heroic poem which have be make since he time since it be plain he rule would -lrb- still have be -lrb- 13 -rrb- -rrb- more perfect could he have peruse the _ æneid _ which be make some hundred year after he death _ in my next i shall go through other part of _ milton 's _ poem and hope that what i shall there

that have be produc 'd by the mind of man that great man have a desire to give the world something like a epick poem but he resolv would at the same time to break thro the rule of aristotle not that he be ignorant of they or contemn they milton be the first who in the space of almost 4000 year resolv would for he country 's honor and he own to present the world with a original poem that be to say a poem that should have he own thought he own image and he own spirit in order to this he be resolve to write a poem that by virtue of its extraordinary subject can not so properly be say to be against the rule as it may be affirm to be above they all we shall now shew for what reason the choice of milton 's subject as it set he free from the obligation which he lay under to the poetical law so it necessarily throw he upon new thought new image and a original spirit in the next place we shall shew that he thought he image and by consequence too he spirit be actually new and different from

operator open the first with a great deal of nicety which upon a cursory and superficial view appear like the head of another man but upon apply we glass to it we make a very odd discovery namely that what we look upon as brain be not such in reality but a heap of strange material wind up in that shape and texture and pack together with wonderful art in the several cavity of the skull for as _ homer _ tell we that the blood of the god be not real blood but only something like it so we find that the brain of a beau be not real brain but only something like it the _ pineal gland _ which many of we modern philosopher suppose to be the seat of the soul smell very strong of essence and orange-flower water and be encompass with a kind of horny substance cut into a thousand little face or mirror which be imperceptible to the naked eye insomuch that the soul if there have be any here must have be always take up in contemplate she own beauty we observe a long _ antrum _ or cavity in the

each side of the head which i must not omit that on the right side be fill with fiction flattery and falshood vow promise and protestation that on the leave with oath and imprecation there issue out a _ duct _ from each of these cell which run into the root of the tongue where both join together and pass forward in one common _ duct _ to the tip of it we discover several little road or canal run from the ear into the brain and take particular care to trace they out through they several passage one of they extend itself to a bundle of sonnet and little musical instrument other end in several bladder which be fill either with wind or froth but the latter canal enter into a great cavity of the skull from whence there go another canal into the tongue this great cavity be fill with a kind of spongy substance which the _ french _ anatomist call _ galimatias _ and the _ english _ nonsense the skin of the forehead be extremely tough and thick and what very much surprized we have not in they any single blood-vessel that we be able to discover either with or without we glass from whence we conclude that the party when alive must have be entirely deprive of the faculty of blush the _ os

upward when it express the contempt which the owner of it have upon see any thing he do not like or hear any thing he do not understand i need not tell my learn reader this be that muscle which perform the motion so often mention by the _ latin _ poet when they talk of a man 's cock he nose or play the rhinoceros we do not find any thing very remarkable in the eye save only that the _ musculi amatorius _ or as we may translate it into _ english _ the _ ogle muscle _ be very much worn and decay with use whereas on the contrary the _ elevator _ or the muscle which turn the eye

the brain such as it be into its proper place and lay it aside under a broad piece of scarlet cloth in order to be _ prepared _ and keep in a great repository of dissection we operator tell we that the preparation would not be so difficult as that of another brain for that he have observe several of the little pipe and tube which run through the brain be already fill with a kind of mercurial substance which he look upon to be true quick-silver he apply himself in the next place to the _ coquet heart _ which he likewise lay open with great dexterity there occur to we many particularity in

-rrb- before i enter upon the first of these i must advertise my reader that it be my design as soon as i have finish my general reflection on these four several head to give particular instance out of the poem which be now before we of beauty and imperfection which may be observe under each of they as also of such other particulars as may not properly fall under any of they this i think fit to premise that the reader may not judge too hastily of this piece of criticism or look upon it as imperfect before he have see the whole extent of it the sentiment in a epic poem be the thought and behavior which the author ascribe to the person whom he introduce and be _ just _ when they be conformable to the character of the several person the sentiment have likewise a relation to _ thing _ as well as _ person _ and be then perfect when they be such as be adapt to the subject if in either of these case the poet -lrb- endeavor to argue or explain to magnify or diminish to raise -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- love or hatred pity or terror or any other passion we ought to consider whether the sentiment he make use of be proper for -lrb- those -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- end _ homer _ be censure by the critick for he defect as to this particular in several part of the _ iliad _ and _ odyssey _ tho at the same time those who have treat this great poet with candor have attribute this defect to the time in which he live -lrb- 4 -rrb- it be the fault of the age and not of _ homer _ if there want that delicacy in some of he sentiment which now appear in the work of man of a much inferior genius besides if there be blemish in any particular thought there be a infinite beauty in the greatest part of they in short if there be many poet who would not have fall into the meanness of some of he sentiment there be none who could have rise up to the greatness of other _ virgil _ have excel all other in the propriety of he sentiment _ milton _ shine likewise very much in this particular : nor must we omit one consideration which add to he honor and reputation _ homer _ and _ virgil _ introduce person whose character be commonly know among man and such as be to be meet with either in history or in ordinary conversation _ milton 's _ character most of they lie out of nature and be to be form purely by he own invention it shew a greater genius in _ shakespear _ to have draw he _ calyban _ than he _ hotspur _ or _ julius cæsar : _ the one be to be supply out of he own imagination whereas the other might have be form upon tradition history and observation it be much easier therefore for _ homer _ to find proper sentiment for a assembly of _ grecian _ general than for _ milton _ to diversify he infernal council with proper character and inspire they with a variety of sentiment the lover of _ dido _ and _ aenea _ be only copy of what have pass between other person _ adam _ and _ eve _ before the fall be a different species from that of mankind who be descend from they and none but a poet of the most unbounded invention and the most exquisite judgment could have fill they conversation and behavior with -lrb- so many apt -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- circumstance during they state of innocence nor be it sufficient for a epic poem to be fill with such thought as be _ natural _ unless it abound also with such as be _ sublime _ virgil in this particular fall short of _ homer _ he have not indeed so many thought that be low and vulgar but at the same time have not so many thought that be sublime and noble the truth of it be _ virgil _ seldom rise into very astonishing sentiment where he be not fire by the _ iliad _ he every where charm and please we by the force of he own genius but seldom elevate and transport we where he do not fetch he hint from _ homer _ _ milton 's _ chief talent and indeed he distinguishing excellence lie in the sublimity of he thought there be other of the modern who rival he in every other part of poetry but in the greatness of he sentiment he triumph over all the poet both modern and ancient _ homer _ only except it be impossible for the imagination of man to distend itself with greater idea than those which he have lay together in he first -lrb- second -rrb- and sixth book -lrb- s -rrb- the seventh which describe the creation of the world be likewise wonderfully sublime tho not so apt to stir up emotion in the mind of the reader nor consequently so perfect in the epic way of write because it be fill with less action let the judicious reader compare what _ longinus _ have observe -lrb- 6 -rrb- on several passage in _ homer _ and he will find parallel for most of they in the _ paradise lose _ from what have be say we may infer that as there be two kind of sentiment the natural and the sublime which be always to be pursue in a heroic poem there be also two kind of thought which be carefully to be avoid the first be such as be affect and unnatural the second such as be mean and vulgar as for the first kind of thought we meet with little or nothing that be like they in _ virgil : _ he have none of those -lrb- trifling -lrb- 7 -rrb- -rrb- point and puerility that be so often to be meet with in _ ovid _ none of the epigrammatick turn of _ lucan _ none of those swell sentiment which be so frequent in _ statin _ and _ claudian _ none of those mixed embellishment of _ tasso _ every thing be just and natural he sentiment shew that he have a perfect insight into human nature and that he know every thing which be the most proper to -lrb- affect it -lrb- 8 -rrb- -rrb- mr _ dryden _ have in some place which i may hereafter take notice of misrepresent _ virgil 's _ way of think as to this particular in the translation he have give we of the _ aeneid _ i do not remember that _ homer _ any where fall into the fault above-mentioned which be indeed the false refinement of later age _ milton _ it must be confest have sometimes err in this respect as i shall shew more at large in another paper tho consider how all the poet of the age in which he writ be infect with this wrong way of think he be rather to be admire that he do not give more into it than that he do sometimes comply with the vicious taste which still prevail so much among modern writer but since several thought may be natural which be low and grovel a epic poet should not only avoid such sentiment as be unnatural or affected but also such as be -lrb- mean -lrb- 9 -rrb- -rrb- and vulgar _ homer _ have open a great field of raillery to man of more delicacy than greatness of genius by the homeliness of some of he sentiment but as i have before say these be rather to be imputed to the simplicity of the age in which he live to which i may also add of that which he describe than to any imperfection in that divine poet _ zoilus _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- among the ancient and monsieur _ perrault _ -lrb- 11 -rrb- among the modern push they ridicule very far upon he on account of some such sentiment there be no blemish to be observe in _ virgil

they have spend unnecessarily they might at present have be master of a competent fortune _ diligence _ justly claim the next place to _ thrift : _ i find both these excellently well recommend to

of dull and phlegmatick temper arrive to great estate by make a regular and orderly disposition of they business and that without it the greatest part and most lively imagination rather puzzle they affair than bring they to a happy issue from what have be say i think i may lay it down as a maxim that every man of good common sense may if he please in he particular station of life most certainly be rich the reason why we sometimes see that man of the greatest capacity be not so be either because they despise wealth in comparison of something else or at least be not content to be get a estate unless they may do it they own way and at the same time enjoy all the pleasure and gratification of life but besides these ordinary form of grow rich it must be allow that there be room for genius as well in this as in all other circumstance of life tho the way of get money be long since very numerous and tho so many new one have be find out of late year there be certainly still remain so large a

get together a quantity make up of several different sort he sell it again at a lower rate to the same perfumer who find out the trick call it _ tabac de mille fleures _ or _ snuff of a thousand

consider the language and as the learn world be very much divide upon milton as to this point i hope they will excuse I if i appear particular in any of my opinion and encline to those who judge the most advantageously of the author it be requisite that the language of a heroic poem should be both perspicuous and sublime -lrb- 1 -rrb- in proportion as either of these two quality be want the language be imperfect perspicuity be the first and most necessary qualification insomuch that a good-natur would reader sometimes overlook a little slip even in the grammar or syntax where it be impossible for he to mistake the poet sense of this kind be that passage in milton wherein he speak of satan -- god and he son except create thing nought valu would he nor shunn would and that in which he describe adam and eve adam the goodliest man of man since bear he son the fairest of she daughter eve it be plain that in the former of these passage accord to the natural syntax the divine person mention in the first line be represent as create being and that in the other adam and eve be confound with they son and daughter such little blemish as these when the thought be great and natural we should with horace -lrb- 2 -rrb- impute to a pardonable inadvertency or to the weakness of human nature which can not attend to each minute particular and give the last finish to every circumstance in so long a work the ancient critick therefore who be act by a spirit of candor rather than that of cavilling invent certain figure of speech on purpose to palliate little error of this nature in the writings of those author who have so many greater beauty to attone for they if clearness and perspicuity be only to be consult the poet would have nothing else to do but to cloath he thought in the most plain and natural expression but since it often happen that the most obvious phrase and those which be use in ordinary conversation become too familiar to the ear and contract a kind of meanness by pass through the mouth of the vulgar a poet should take particular care to guard himself against idiomatick way of speak ovid and lucan have many poorness of expression upon this account as take up with the first phrase that offer without put themselves to the trouble of look after such as would not only have be natural but also elevated and sublime milton have but few failing in this kind of which however you may -lrb- meet with some instance as -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the follow passage embrio and idiot eremite and fryar white black and gray -- with all they trumpery here pilgrim roam -- -- a while discourse they hold no fear lest dinner cool -- when thus begin we author -- who of all age to succeed but feel the evil on he bring by I will curse my head ill fare we ancestor impure for this we may thank adam -- the great master in composition know very well that many a elegant phrase become improper for a poet or a orator when it have be debase by common use for this reason the work of ancient author which be write in dead language have a great advantage over those which be write in language that be now speak be there any mean phrase or idiom in virgil and homer they would not shock the ear of the most delicate modern reader so much as they would have do that of a old greek or roman because we never hear they pronounced in we street or in ordinary conversation it be not therefore sufficient that the language of a epic poem be perspicuous unless it be also sublime to this end it ought to deviate from the common form and ordinary phrase of speech the judgment of a poet very much discover it self in shun the common road of expression without fall into such way of speech as may seem stiff and unnatural he must not swell into a false sublime by endeavor to avoid the other extream among the greek æschylus and sometimes sophocle be guilty of this fault among the latin claudian and statius and among we own countryman shakespear and lee in these author the affectation of greatness often hurt the perspicuity of the stile as in many other the endeavor after perspicuity prejudice its greatness aristotle have observe that the idiomatick stile may be avoid and the sublime form by the follow method -lrb- 4 -rrb- first by the use of metaphor -lrb- : such be those of milton -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- imparadise in one another arm -- and in he hand a reed stand wave tipt with fire -- the grassie clod now calvd -- -lrb- spangled with eye -- -rrb- in these and innumerable other instance the metaphor be very bold but just i must however observe that the metaphor be not -lrb- so -rrb- thick sown in milton which always savor too much of wit that they never clash with one another which as aristotle observe turn a sentence into a kind of a enigma or riddle -lrb- 6 -rrb- and that he seldom have recourse to they where the proper and natural word will do as well another way of raise the language and give it a poetical turn be to make use of the idiom of other tongue virgil be full of the greek form of speech which the critick call hellenism as horace in he ode abound with they much more than virgil i need not mention the several dialect which homer have make use of for this end milton in conformity with the practice of the ancient poet and with aristotle 's rule have infuse a great many latinism as well as græcisms and sometimes hebraism into the language of he poem as towards the beginning of it nor do they not perceive the evil plight in which they be or the fierce pain not feel yet to they genral voice they soon obey would -- -- who shall tempt with wandring foot the dark unbottom would infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out he uncouth way or spread he airy flight upborn with indefatigable wing over the vast abrupt -lrb- -- so both ascend in the vision of god -- book 2 -rrb- under this head may be reckon would the place the adjective after the substantive the transposition of word the turn the adjective into a substantive with several other foreign mode of speech which this poet have naturalized to give he verse the greater sound and throw it out of prose the third method mention by aristotle be what agree with the genius of the greek language more than with that of any other tongue and be therefore more use by homer than by any other poet i mean the lengthning of a phrase by the addition of word which may either be insert or omit as also by the extend or contracting of particular word by the insertion or omission of certain syllable milton have put in practice this method of raise he language as far as the nature of we tongue will permit as in the passage above-mentioned eremite -lrb- for -rrb- what be hermit in common discourse if you observe the measure of he verse he have with great judgment suppress a syllable in several word and shortn those of two syllable into one by which method besides the above-mentioned advantage he have give a greater variety to he number but this practice be more particularly remarkable in the name of person and of country as beëlzebub hessebon and in many other particulars wherein he have either change the name or make use of that which be not the most commonly know that he might the better depart from the language of the vulgar the same reason recommend to he several old word which also make he poem appear the more venerable and give it a greater air of antiquity i must likewise take notice that there be in milton several word of he own coining as cerberean miscreate hell-doom would embryon atom and many other if the reader be offend at this liberty in we english poet i would recommend he to a discourse in plutarch -lrb- 7 -rrb- which shew we how frequently homer have make use of the same liberty milton by the above-mentioned help and by the choice of the noblest word and phrase which we tongue would afford he have carry we language to a greater height than any of the english poet have ever do before or after he and make the sublimity of he stile equal to that of he sentiment i have be the more particular in these observation on milton 's stile because it be that part of he in which he appear the most singular the remark i have here make upon the practice of other poet with my observation out of aristotle will perhaps alleviate the prejudice which some have take to he poem upon this account tho after all i must confess that i think he stile tho admirable in general be in some place too much stiffen and obscure by the frequent use of those method which aristotle have prescribe for the raising of it this redundancy of those several way of speech which aristotle call foreign language and with which milton have so very much enriched and in some place darkn the language of he poem be the more proper for he use because he poem be write in blank verse rhyme without any other assistance throw the language off from prose and very often make a indifferent phrase pass unregarded but where the verse be not build upon rhyme there pomp of sound and energy of expression be indispensably necessary to support the stile and keep it from fall into the flatness of prose those who have not a taste for this elevation of stile and be apt to ridicule a poet when he depart from the common form of expression would do well to see how aristotle have treat a ancient author call euclid -lrb- 8 -rrb- for he insipid mirth upon this occasion mr dryden use to call -lrb- these -lrb- 9 -rrb- -rrb- sort of man he prose-critick i should under this head of the language consider milton 's number in which he have make use of several elision which be not customary among other english poet as may be particularly observe in he cut off the letter y when it precede a vowel -lrb- 10 -rrb- this and some other innovation in the measure of he verse have vary he number in such a manner as make they incapable of satiate the ear and cloy the reader which the same uniform measure would certainly have do and which the perpetual return of rhime never fail to do in long narrative poem i shall close these reflection upon the language of paradise lose with observe that milton have copy after homer rather than virgil in the length of he period the copiousness of he phrase and the running of he verse into one another l -lrb- footnote 1 : aristotle poetic ii § 26 the excellence of diction consist in be

observation for the reason just give the y of the word glory run into the succeed syllable and most assuredly be not cut off when we read of the excess of glory obscure : as when the sun new ri 'n

the legislative power be in the hand of person so happily distinguish that by provide for the particular interest of they several rank they be provide for the whole body of the people or in other word when there be no part of the people that have not a common interest with at least one part of the legislator if there be but one body of legislator it be no better than a tyranny if there be only two there will want a casting voice and one of they must at length be swallow up by dispute and contention that will necessarily arise between they four would have the same inconvenience as two and a greater number would cause too much confusion i could never read a passage in polybius and another in cicero to this purpose without a secret pleasure in apply it to the english constitution which it suit much better than the roman both these great author give the pre-eminence to a mixt government consist of three branch the regal the noble and the popular they have doubtless in they thought the constitution of the roman commonwealth in which the consul represent the king the senate the noble and the tribune the people this division of the three power in the roman constitution be by no means so distinct and natural as it be in the english form of government among several objection that might be make to it i think the chief be those that affect the consular power which have only the ornament without the force of the regal authority they number have not a casting voice in it for which reason if one do not chance to be employ abroad while the other sit at home the publick business be sometimes at a stand while the consul pull two different way in it besides i do not find that the consul have ever a negative voice in the passing of a law or decree of senate so that indeed they be rather the chief body of the nobility or the first minister of state than a distinct branch of the sovereignty in which none can be look upon as a part who be not a part of the legislature have the consul be invest with the regal authority to as great a degree as we monarch there would never have be any occasion for a dictatorship which have in it the power of all the three order and end in the subversion of the whole constitution such a history as that of suelonius which give we a succession of absolute prince be to I a unanswerable argument against despotick power where the prince be a man of wisdom and virtue it be indeed happy for he people that he be absolute but since in the common run of mankind for one that be wise and good you find ten of a contrary character it be very dangerous

gross and brutal ignorance european slavery be indeed a state of liberty if compare with that which prevail in the other three division of the world and therefore it be no wonder that those who grovel

physick in this however i be guide by the spirit of a philosopher as i take occasion from hence to reflect upon the regular encrease and diminution of mankind and consider the several various way

and can consider with pleasure to my self by which of those deliverance or as we commonly call they distemper i may possibly make my escape out of this world of sorrow into that condition of existence wherein i hope to be happier than it be possible for I at present to conceive but this be not all the use i make of the above-mentioned weekly paper a bill of mortality -lrb- 1 -rrb- be in my opinion

seth be nine hundred and twelve year and he die and all the day of methuselah be nine hundred and sixty nine year and he die immediately shut himself up in a convent and retire from the world as not think any thing in this life worth pursue which have not regard to another the truth of it be there be nothing in history which be so improve to the reader as those account which we meet with of the death of eminent person and of they behavior in that dreadful season i may also add that there be no part in history which affect and please the reader in so sensible a manner the reason i take to be this because there be no other single circumstance in the story of any person which can possibly be the case of every one who read it a battle or a triumph be conjuncture in which not one man in a million be likely to be engage but when we see a person at the point of death we can not forbear be attentive to every thing he say or do because we be sure that some time or other we shall we self be in the same melancholy circumstance the general the statesman or the philosopher be perhaps character which we may never act in but the die man be one whom sooner or later we shall certainly resemble it be perhaps for the same kind of reason that few book -lrb- write -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- in english have be so much peruse as dr sherlock 's discourse upon death though at the same time i must own that he who have not peruse this excellent piece have not perhaps read one of the strongest persuasive to a religious life that ever be write in any language the consideration with which i shall close this

and that he be not to set up he rest here but to keep a attentive eye upon that state of be to which he approach every moment and which will be for ever fix and permanent this single consideration would be sufficient to extinguish the bitterness of hatred the thirst of avarice and the cruelty of ambition i be very much pleased with the passage of antiphane a very ancient poet who live near a

or fall they should not be such as be acquaint only with the french and italian critick but also with the ancient and modern who have write in either of the learn language above all i would have they well verse in the greek and latin poet without which a man very often fancy that he understand a critick when in reality he do not comprehend he mean it be in criticism as in all other science and speculation one who bring with he any implicit notion and observation which he have make in he reading of the poet will find he own reflection methodize and explain and perhaps several little hint that have pass in he mind perfect and improve in the work of a good critick whereas one who have not these previous light be very often a utter stranger to what he read and apt to put a wrong interpretation upon it nor be it sufficient that a man who set up for a judge in criticism should have peruse the author above mention unless he have also a clear and logical head without this talent he be perpetually puzzle and perplexed amidst he own blunder mistake the sense of those he would confute or if he chance to think right do not know how to convey he thought to another with clearness and perspicuity aristotle who be the best critick be also one of the best logician that ever appear in the world mr lock essay on human understanding -lrb- 1 -rrb- would be think a very odd book for a man to make himself master of who would get a reputation by critical writings though at the same time it be very certain that a author who have not learn the art of distinguish between word and thing and of range he thought and set they in proper light whatever notion he may have will lose himself in confusion and obscurity i might further observe that there be not a greek or latin critick who have not shewn even in the style of he criticism that he be a master of all the elegance and delicacy of he native tongue the truth of it be there be nothing more absurd than for a man to set up for a critick without a good insight into all the part of learn whereas many of those who have endeavor to signalize themselves by work of this nature among we english writer be not only defective in the above-mentioned particulars but plainly discover by the phrase which they make use of and by they confused way of think that they be not acquaint with the most common and ordinary system of art and science a few general rule extract out of the french author -lrb- 2 -rrb- with a certain cant of word have sometimes set up a illiterate heavy writer for a most judicious and formidable critick one great mark by which you may discover a critick who have neither taste nor learning be this that he seldom venture to praise any passage in a author which have not be before receive and applaud by the publick and that he criticism turn wholly upon little fault and error this part of a critick be so very easie to succeed in that we find every ordinary reader upon the publishing of a new poem have wit and ill-nature enough to turn several passage of it into ridicule and very often in the right place this mr dryden have very agreeably remark in those two celebrated line error like straw upon the surface flow he who would search for pearl must dive below -lrb- 3 -rrb- a true critick ought to dwell rather upon excellency than imperfection to discover the conceal beauty of a writer and communicate to the world such thing as be worth they observation the most exquisite word and finest stroke of a author be those which very often appear the most doubtful and exceptionable to a man who want a relish for polite learning and they be these which a sower undistinguishing critick generally attack with the greatest violence tully observe that it be very easie to brand or fix a mark upon what he call verbum ardens -lrb- 4 -rrb- or as it may be render into english a glowing bold expression and to turn it into ridicule by a cold ill-natured criticism a little wit be equally capable of expose a beauty and of aggravate a fault and though such a treatment of a author naturally produce indignation in the mind of a understanding reader it have however its effect among the generality of those whose hand it fall into the rabble of mankind be very apt to think that every thing which be laugh at with any mixture of wit be ridiculous in it self such a mirth as this be always unseasonable in a critick as it rather prejudice the reader than convince he and be capable of make a beauty as well as a blemish the subject of derision a man who can not write with wit on a proper subject be dull and stupid but one who shew it in a improper place be as impertinent and absurd besides a man who have the gift of ridicule be apt to find fault with any thing that give he a opportunity of exert he beloved talent and very often censure a passage not because there be any fault in it but because he can be merry upon it such kind of pleasantry be very unfair and disingenuous in work of criticism in which the greatest master both ancient and modern have always appear with a serious and instructive air as i intend in my next paper to shew the defect in milton 's paradise lose i think fit to premise these few particulars to the end that the reader may know i enter upon it as on a very ungrateful work and that i shall just point at the imperfection without endeavor to enflame they with ridicule i must also observe with longinus -lrb- 5 -rrb- that the production of a great genius with many lapse and inadvertency be infinitely preferable to the work of a inferior kind of author which

fortunate and to shun the company of the unfortunate which notwithstanding the baseness of the precept to a honest mind may have something useful in it for those who push they interest in the world it be certain a great part of what we call good or ill fortune rise out of right or wrong measure and scheme of life when i hear a man complain of he be unfortunate in all he undertaking i shrewdly suspect he for a very weak man in he affair in conformity with this way of think cardinal richelieu use to say that unfortunate and imprudent be but two word for the same thing as the cardinal himself have a great share both of prudence and good-fortune he famous antagonist the count d'olivarez be disgrace at the court of madrid because it be alledge against he that he have never any success in he undertaking this say a eminent author be indirectly accuse he of imprudence cicero recommend pompey to the roman for they general upon three account as he be a man of courage conduct and good-fortune it be perhaps for the reason above-mentioned namely that a series of good-fortune suppose a prudent management in the person whom it befall that not only syllum the dictator but several of the roman emperor as be still to be see upon they medal among they other title give themselves that of felix or fortunate the heathen indeed seem to have value a man more for he good-fortune than for any other quality which i think be very natural for those who have not a strong belief of another world for how can i conceive a man crown with many distinguishing blessing that have not some extraordinary fund of merit and perfection in he which lie open to the supreme eye tho perhaps it be not discover by my observation what be the reason homer and virgil 's hero do not form a resolution or strike a blow without the conduct and direction of some deity doubtless because the poet esteem it the greatest honor to be favor by the god and think the best way of praise a man be to recount those favor which naturally imply a extraordinary merit in the person on whom they descend those who believe a future state of reward and punishment act very absurdly if they form they opinion of a man 's merit from he success but certainly if i think the whole circle of we be be conclude between we birth and death i should think a man 's good-fortune the measure and standard of he real merit since providence would have no opportunity of reward he virtue and perfection but in the present life a virtuous unbeliever who lie under the pressure of misfortune have reason to cry out as they say brutus do a little before he death o virtue i have worship thee as a substantial good but i find thou art a empty name but to return to we first point tho prudence do undoubtedly in a great measure produce we good or ill fortune in the world it be certain there be many unforeseen accident and occurrence which very often pervert the finest scheme that can be lay by human wisdom the race be not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong nothing less than infinite wisdom can have a absolute command over fortune the highest degree of it which man can possess be by no means equal to fortuitous event and to such contingency as may rise in the prosecution of we affair nay it very often happen that prudence which have always in it a great mixture of caution hinder a man from be so fortunate as he might possibly have be without it a person who only aim at what be likely to succeed and follow closely the dictate of human prudence never meet with those great and unforeseen success which be often the effect of a sanguine temper or a more happy rashness and this perhaps may be the reason that accord to the common observation fortune like other female delight rather in favor the young than the old upon the whole since man be so short-sighted a creature and the accident which may happen to he so various i can not but be of dr tillotson 's opinion in another case that be there any doubt of a providence yet it certainly would be very desirable there should be such a being of infinite wisdom and goodness on whose direction we might rely in the conduct of human life it be a great presumption to ascribe we success to we own management and not to esteem we self upon any blessing rather as it be the bounty of heaven than the acquisition of we own prudence i be very well pleased with a medal which be strike by queen elizabeth a little after the defeat of the invincible armada to perpetuate the memory of that extraordinary event it be well know how the king of spain and other who be the enemy of that great princess to derogate from she glory ascribe the ruin of they fleet rather to the violence of storm and tempest than to the bravery of the english queen elizabeth instead of look

come into we very language as a propriety of distinction to say when we would speak of person to they advantage they be people of condition there be no doubt but the proper use of riches imply that a man should exert all the good quality imaginable and if we mean by a man of condition or quality one who accord to the wealth he be master of shew himself just beneficent and charitable that term ought very deservedly to be have in the highest veneration but when wealth be use only as it be the support of pomp and luxury to be rich be very far from be a recommendation to honor and respect it be indeed the greatest insolence imaginable in a creature who would feel the extream of thirst and hunger if he do not prevent he appetite before they call upon he to be so forgetful of the common necessity of human nature as never to cast a eye upon the poor and needy the fellow who escape from a ship which strike upon a rock in the west and join would with the country people to destroy he brother sailor and make she a wreck be think a most execrable creature but do not every man who enjoy the possession of what he naturally want and be unmindful of the unsupplied distress of other man betray the same temper of mind when a man look about he and with regard to riches and poverty behold some draw in pomp and equipage and they and they very servant with a air of scorn and triumph overlook the multitude that pass by they and in the same street a creature of the same make cry out in the name of all that be good and sacred to behold he misery and give he some supply against hunger and nakedness who would believe these two being be of the same species but so it be that the consideration of fortune have take up all we mind and as i have often complain poverty and riches stand in we imagination in the place of guilt and innocence but in all season there will be some instance of person who have soul too large to be take with popular prejudice and while the rest of mankind be contend for superiority in power and wealth have they thought bent upon the necessity of those below they the charity-school which have be erect of late year be the greatest instance of publick spirit the age have produce : but indeed when we consider how long this sort of beneficence have be on foot it be rather from the good management of those institution than from the number or value of the benefaction to they that they make so great a figure one would think it impossible that in the space of fourteen year there should not have be five thousand pound bestow in gift this way

very readily compound with any lady in a hoop-petticoat if she give the price of one half yard of the silk towards cloathing feeding and instruct a innocent helpless creature of she own sex in one of these school the consciousness of such a action will give she feature a nobler life on this illustrious day -lrb- 1 -rrb- than all the jewel that can hang in she hair or can be cluster at she bosom it would be uncourtly to speak in harsher word to the fair but to man one may take a little more freedom it be monstrous how a man can live with so little reflection as to fancy he be not in a condition very unjust and disproportioned to the rest of mankind while he enjoy wealth and exert no benevolence or bounty to other as for this particular occasion of these school there can not any offer more worthy a generous mind would you do a handsome thing without return do it for a infant that be not sensible of the obligation : would you do it for publick good do it for one who will be a honest artificer : would you do it for the sake of heaven give it to one who shall be instruct in the worship of he for whose sake you give it it be methink a most laudable institution this if it be of no other expectation than that of produce a race of good and useful servant who will have more than a liberal a religious education what would not a man do in common prudence to lay out in purchase of one about he who would add to all he order he give the weight of the commandment to inforce a obedience to they for one who would consider he master as he father he friend and benefactor upon the easy term and in expectation of no other return but moderate wages and gentle usage it be the common vice of child to run too much among the servant from such as be educate in these place they would see nothing but lowliness in the servant which would not be disingenuous in the child all the ill office and defamatory whisper which take they birth from domestick would be prevent if this charity could be make universal and a good man might have a knowledge of the whole life of the person he design to take into he house for he own service or that of he family or child long before they be admit this

contrary to my expectation be bear to I every year streighten I so much that i have beg they mother to free I from the obligation of the above-mentioned pin-money that it may go towards make a

to tell I that if i do not do she justice i shall die in a jayl to this she add when she passion will let she argue calmly that she have several play-debt on she hand which must be discharge very suddenly and that she can not lose she money as become a woman of she fashion if she make I any abatement in this article i hope sir you will take a occasion from hence to give you opinion upon a subject which you have not yet touch and inform we if there be any precedent for this usage among we ancestor or whether you find any mention of pin-money in grotius puffendorf or any other of the civilian i be ever the humblest of you admirer josiah fribble esq as there be no man living who be a more profess advocate for the fair sex than my self so there be none that would be more unwilling to invade any of they ancient rights and privilege but as the doctrine of pin-money be of a very late date unknown to we great grandmother and not yet receive by many of we modern lady i think it be for the interest of both sex to keep it from spread mr fribble may not perhaps be much mistaken where he intimate that the supply a man 's wife with pin-money be furnish she with arm against himself and in a manner become accessary to he own dishonor we may indeed generally observe that in proportion as a woman be more or less beautiful and she husband advance in year she stand in need of a greater or less number of pin and upon a treaty of marriage rise or fall in she demand accordingly it must likewise be own that high quality in a mistress do very much inflame this article in the marriage reckoning but where the age and circumstance of both party be pretty much upon a level i can not but think the insist upon pin-money be very extraordinary and yet we find several match break off upon this very head what would a foreigner or one who be a stranger to this practice think of a lover that forsake he mistress because he be not willing to keep she in pin but what would he think of the mistress should he be inform that she ask five or six hundred pound a year for this use should a man unacquainted with we custom be tell the sum which be allow in great britain under the title of pin-money what a prodigious consumption of pin would he think there be in this island a pin a day say we frugal proverb be a groat a year so that accord to this calculation my friend fribble wife must every year make use of eight million six hundred and forty thousand new pin i be not ignorant that we british lady allege they comprehend under this general term several other conveniency of life i could therefore wish for the honor of my countrywoman that they have rather call it needle-money which might have imply something of good-housewifry and not have give the malicious world occasion to think that dress and trifle have always the uppermost place in a woman 's thought i know several of my fair reasoner urge in defense of this practice that it be but a necessary provision they make for themselves in case they husband prove a churl or a miser so that they consider this allowance as a kind of alimony which they may lay they claim to without actually separate from they husband but with submission i think a woman who will give up she self to a man in marriage where there be the least room for such a apprehension and trust she person to one whom she will not rely on for the common necessaries of life may very properly be accuse -lrb- in the phrase of a homely proverb -rrb- of be penny wise and pound foolish it be observe of over-cautious general that they never engage in a battel without secure a retreat in case the event should not answer they expectation on the other hand the greatest conqueror have burn they ship or break down the bridge behind they as be determine either to succeed or die in the engagement in the same manner i should very much suspect a woman who take such precaution for she retreat and contrive method how she may live happily without the affection of one to whom she join herself for life separate purse between man and wife be in my opinion as unnatural as separate bed a marriage can not be happy where the pleasure inclination and interest of both party be not the same there be no greater incitement to love in the mind of man than the sense of a person depend upon he for she ease and happiness as a woman use all she endeavor to please the person whom she look upon as she honor she comfort and she support for this reason i be not very much surprize at the behavior of a rough country squire who be not a little shocked at the proceeding of a young widow that would not recede from she demand of pin-money be so enraged at she mercenary temper that he tell she in great wrath as much as she think he she slave he would shew all

shew that this kind of implex fable wherein the event be unhappy be more apt to affect a audience than that of the first kind notwithstanding many excellent piece among the ancient as well as most of those which have be write of late year in we own country be raise upon contrary plan i must however own that i think this kind of fable which be the most perfect in tragedy be not so proper for a heroic poem milton seem to have be sensible of this imperfection in he fable and have therefore endeavor to cure it by several expedient particularly by the mortification which the great adversary of mankind meet with upon he return to the assembly of infernal spirit as it be describe in -lrb- a -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- beautiful passage of the tenth book and likewise by the vision wherein adam at the close of the poem see he off-spring triumphing over he great enemy and himself restore to a happier paradise than that from which he fall there be another objection against milton 's fable which be indeed almost the same with the former tho place in a different light namely that the hero in the paradise lose be unsuccessful and by no mean a match for he enemy this give occasion to mr dryden 's reflection that the devil be in reality milton 's hero -lrb- 5 -rrb- i think i have obviate this objection in my first paper the paradise lose be a epic -lrb- or a -rrb- narrative poem -lrb- and -rrb- he that look for a hero in it search for that which milton never intend -lrb- but -lrb- 6 -rrb- -rrb- if he will need fix the name of a hero upon any person in it ti certainly the messiah who be the hero both in the principal action and in the -lrb- chief episode -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- paganism could not furnish out a real action for a fable greater than that of the iliad or æneid and therefore a heathen could not form a higher notion of a poem than one of that kind which they call a heroic whether milton 's be not of a -lrb- sublimer -lrb- 8 -rrb- -rrb- nature i will not presume to determine : it be sufficient that i shew there be in the paradise lose all the greatness of plan regularity of design and masterly beauty which we discover in homer and virgil i must in the next place observe that milton have interweave in the texture of he fable some particulars which do not seem to have probability enough for a epic poem particularly in the action which he ascribe to sin and death and the picture which he draw of the limbo of vanity with other passage in the second book such allegory rather savor of the spirit of spenser and ariosto than of homer and virgil in the structure of he poem he have likewise admit of too many digression it be finely observe by aristotle that the author of a heroic poem should seldom speak himself but throw as much of he work as he can into the mouth of those who be he principal actor -lrb- 9 -rrb- aristotle have give no reason for this precept but i presume it be because the mind of the reader be more awed and elevated when he hear æneas or achille speak than when virgil or homer talk in they own person besides that assume the character of a eminent man be apt to fire the imagination and raise the idea of the author tully tell we -lrb- 10 -rrb- mention he dialogue of old age in which cato be the chief speaker that upon a review of it he be agreeably impose upon and fancy that it be cato and not he himself who utter he thought on that subject if the reader would be at the pain to see how the story of the iliad and the æneid be deliver by those person who act in it he will be surprize to find how little in either of these poem proceed from the author milton have in the general disposition of he fable very finely observe this great rule insomuch that there be scarce a third part of it which come from the poet the rest be speak either by adam and eve or by some good or evil spirit who be engage either in they destruction or defense from what have be here observe it appear that digression be by no means to be allow of in a epic poem if the poet even in the ordinary course of he narration should speak as little as possible he should certainly never let he narration sleep for the sake of any reflection of he own i have often observe with a secret admiration that the longest reflection in the æneid be in that passage of the tenth book where turnus be represent as dress himself in the spoil of palla whom he have slay virgil here let he fable stand still for the-sake of the follow remark how be the mind of man ignorant of futurity and unable to bear prosperous fortune with moderation the time will come when turnus shall wish that he have leave the body of palla untouched and curse the day on which he dress himself in these spoil as the great event of the æneid and the death of turnus whom æneas slew because he see he adorn with the spoil of palla turn upon this incident virgil go out of he way to make this reflection upon it without which so small a circumstance might possibly have slip out of he reader memory lucan who be a injudicious poet let drop he story very frequently for the sake of he unnecessary digression or he diverticulum as scaliger call they -lrb- 11 -rrb- if he give we a account of the prodigy which precede the civil war he declaim upon the occasion and shew how much happier it would be for man if he do not feel he evil fortune before it come to pass and suffer not only by its real weight but by the apprehension of it milton 's complaint -lrb- for -lrb- 12 -rrb- -rrb- he blindness he panegyrick on marriage he reflection on adam and eve go naked of the angel eat and several other passage in he poem be liable to the same exception tho i must confess there be so great a beauty in these very digression that i would not wish they out of he poem i have in a former paper speak of the character of milton 's paradise lose and declare my opinion as to the allegorical person who be introduce in it if we look into the sentiment i think they be sometimes defective under the follow head : first as there be several of they too much pointed and some that degenerate even into punn of this last kind i be afraid be that in the first book where speaking of the pigmy he call they -- the small infantry warrdon by crane -- another blemish -lrb- that -lrb- 13 -rrb- -rrb- appear in some of he thought be he frequent allusion to heathen fable which be not certainly of a piece with the divine subject of which he treat i do not find fault with these allusion where the poet himself represent they as fabulous as he do in some place but where he mention they as truth and matter of fact the limit of my paper will not give I leave to be particular in instance of this kind the reader will easily remark they in he perusal of the poem a third fault in he sentiment be a unnecessary ostentation of learning which likewise occur very frequently it be certain that both homer and virgil be master of all the learning of they time but it shew it self in they work after a indirect and conceal manner milton seem ambitious of let we know by he excursion on free-will and predestination and he many glance upon history astronomy geography and the like as well as by the term and phrase he sometimes make use of that he be acquaint with the whole circle of art and science if in the last place we consider the language of this great poet we must allow what i have hint in a former paper that it be often too much labor and sometimes obscure by old word transposition and foreign idiom seneca objection to the style of a great author riget ejus oratio nihil in eâ placidum nihil lene be what many critick make to milton : as i can not wholly refuse it so i have already apologize for it in another paper to which i may further add that milton 's sentiment and idea be so wonderfully sublime that it would have be impossible for he to have represent they in they full strength and beauty without have recourse to these foreign assistance we language sink under he and be unequal to that greatness of soul which furnish he with such glorious conception a second fault in he language be that he often affect a kind of jingle in he word as in the follow passage and many other : and bring into the world a world of woe -- begirt th ' almighty throne beseech or besiege -- this tempt we attempt -- at one slight bind high overleapt all bind i know there be figure for this kind of speech that some of the greatest ancient have be guilty of it and that aristotle himself have give it a place in he rhetorick among the beauty of that art -lrb- 14 -rrb- but as it be in its self poor and trifling it be i think at present universally explode by all the master of polite write the last fault which i shall take notice of in milton 's style be the frequent use of what the learn call technical word or term of art it be one of the great beauty of poetry to make hard thing intelligible and to deliver what be abstruse -lrb- of -lrb- 15 -rrb- -rrb- it self in such easy language as may be understand by ordinary reader : besides that the knowledge of a poet should rather seem bear with he or inspire than draw from book and system i have often wonder how mr dryden could translate a passage out of virgil after the follow manner tack to the larboard and stand off to sea veer star-board sea and land milton make use of larboard in the same manner when he be upon build he mention doric pillar pilaster cornice freeze architrave when he talk of heavenly body you meet with eccliptic and eccentric the trepidation star drop from the zenith ray culminate from the equator to which might be add many instance of the like kind in several other art and science i shall in my next -lrb- papers -lrb- 16 -rrb- -rrb- give a account of the many particular beauty in

to satisfie my curiosity by a nearer view i be stop by a object far more beautiful than any i have before discover in the whole place i fancy madam you will easily guess that this could hardly be any thing but you self in reality it be so you lay extend on the flower by the side of the river so that you hand which be throw in a negligent posture almost touch the water you eye be close but if you sleep deprive I of the satisfaction of see they it leave I at leisure to contemplate several other charm which disappear when you eye be open i could not but admire the tranquility you sleep in especially when i consider the uneasiness you produce in so many other while i be wholly take up in these reflection the door of the temple fly open with a very great noise and lift up my eye i see two figure in human shape come into the valley upon a nearer survey i find they to be youth and love the first be encircle with a kind of purple light that spread a glory over all the place the other hold a flaming torch in he hand i could observe that all the way as they come towards we the color of the flower appear more lively the tree shoot out in blossom the bird throw themselves into pair and serenade they as they pass : the whole face of nature glow with new beauty they be no sooner arrive at the place where you lay when they seat themselves on each side of you on they approach

read what i give for the entertainment of this day with a great deal of pleasure and publish it just as it come to my hand i shall be very glad to find there be many guess at for emilium mr spectator -lrb- 1 -rrb- if this paper have the good fortune to be honor with a place in you writings i shall be the more pleased because the character of emilium be not a imaginary but a real one i have industriously obscure the whole by the addition of one or two circumstance of no consequence that the person it be draw from might still be conceal and that the writer of it might not be in the least suspect and for -lrb- other -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- reason i chuse not to give it the form of a letter : but if besides the fault of the composition there be any thing in it more proper for a correspondent than the spectator himself to write i submit it to you better judgment to receive any other model you think fit i be sir you very humble servant there be nothing which give one so please a prospect of human nature as the contemplation of wisdom and beauty : the latter be the peculiar portion of that sex which be therefore call fair but the happy concurrence of both these excellency in the same person be a character too celestial to be frequently meet with beauty be a over-weaning self-sufficient thing careless of provide it self any more substantial ornament nay so little do it consult its own interest that it too often defeat it self by betray that innocence which render it lovely and desirable as therefore virtue make a beautiful woman appear more beautiful so beauty make a virtuous woman really more virtuous whilst i be consider these two perfection gloriously unite in one person i can not help represent to my mind the image of emilium who ever behold the charming emilium without feeling in he breast at once the glow of love and the tenderness of virtuous friendship the unstudied grace of she behavior and the please accent of she tongue insensibly draw you on to wish for a nearer enjoyment of they but even she smile carry in they a silent reproof to the impulse of licentious love thus tho the attractive of she beauty play almost irresistibly upon you and create desire you immediately stand correct not by the severity but the decency of she virtue that sweetness and good-humour which be so visible in she face naturally diffuse it self into every word and action : a man must be a savage who at the sight of emilium be not more inclined to do she good than gratifie himself she person as it be thus studiously embellish by nature thus adorn with unpremeditated grace be a fit lodging for a mind so fair and lovely there dwell rational piety modest hope and chearful resignation many of the prevail passion of mankind do undeservedly pass under the name of religion which be thus make to express itself in action accord to the nature of the constitution in which it reside : so that be we to make a judgment from appearance one would imagine religion in some be little better than sullenness and reserve in many fear in other the desponding of a melancholly complexion in other the formality of insignificant unaffecting observance in other severity in other ostentation in emilium it be a principle found in reason and enliven with hope it do not break forth into irregular fit and sally of devotion but be a uniform and consistent tenor of action it be strict without severity compassionate without weakness it be the perfection of that good humor which proceed from the understanding not the effect of a easy constitution by a generous sympathy in nature we feel we self dispose to mourn when any of we fellow-creature be afflict but injure innocence and beauty in distress a object that carry in it something inexpressibly move : it soften the most manly heart with the tenderest sensation of love and compassion till at length it confess its humanity and flow out into tear be i to relate that part of emilium 's life which have give she a opportunity of exert the heroism of christianity it would make too sad too tender a story : but when i consider she alone in the midst of she distress look beyond this gloomy vale of affliction and sorrow into the joy of heaven and immortality and when i see she in conversation thoughtless and easie as if she be the most happy creature in the world i be transport with admiration surely never do such a philosophic soul inhabit such a beauteous form for beauty be often make a privilege against think and reflection it laugh at wisdom and will not abide the gravity of its instruction be i able to represent emilium 's virtue in they proper color and they due proportion love or flattery might perhaps be think to have draw the picture larger than life but as this be but a imperfect draught of so excellent a character and as i can not will not hope to have any interest in she person all that i can say of she be but impartial praise extort from I by the prevail brightness of she virtue so rare a pattern of female excellence ought not to be conceal but should be set out to the view and imitation of the world for how amiable do virtue appear thus as it be make visible to we in so fair a example honorium 's disposition be of a very different turn : she thought be wholly bent upon conquest and arbitrary power that she have some wit and beauty no body deny and therefore have the esteem of all she acquaintance as a woman of a agreeable person and conversation but -lrb- whatever she husband may think of it -rrb- that be not sufficient for honorium : she wave that title to respect as a mean acquisition and demand veneration in the right of a idol for this reason she natural desire of life be continually check with a inconsistent fear of wrinkle and old age emilium can not be suppose ignorant of she personal charm tho she seem to be so but she will not hold she happiness upon so precarious a tenure whilst she mind be adorn with beauty of a more exalted and lasting nature when in the full bloom of youth and beauty we see she surround with a crowd of adorer she take no pleasure in slaughter and destruction give no false delude hope which might encrease the torment of she disappointed lover but have for some time give to the decency of a virgin coyness and examine the merit of they several pretension she at length gratify she own by resign herself to the ardent passion of bromius bromius be then master of many good quality and a moderate fortune which be soon after unexpectedly encrease to a plentiful estate this for a good while prove he misfortune as it furnish he unexperienced age with the opportunity of evil company and a sensual life he might have longer wander in the labyrinth of vice and folly have not emilium 's prudent conduct win he over to the government of he reason she ingenuity have be constantly employ in humanize he passion and refine he pleasure she shew he by she own example that virtue be consistent with decent freedom and good humor or rather that it can not subsist without em she good sense readily instruct she that a silent example and a easie unrepining behavior will always be more perswasive than the severity of lecture and admonition and that there be so much pride interweave into the make of human nature that a obstinate man must only take the hint from another and then be leave to advise and correct himself thus by a artful train of management and unseen perswasion have at first bring he not to dislike and at length to be please with that which otherwise he would not have bear to hear of she then know how to press and secure this advantage by approve it as he thought and second it as he proposal by this mean she have gain a interest in some of he lead passion and make they accessary to he reformation there be another particular of emilium 's conduct which i cant forbear mention : to some perhaps it may at first sight appear but a trifling inconsiderable circumstance but for my part i think it highly worthy of observation and to be recommend to the consideration of the fair sex i have often think wrap gown and dirty linnen with all that huddle oeconomy of dress which pass under the general name of a mob the bane of conjugal love and one of the readiest means imaginable to alienate the affection of a husband especially a fond one i have hear some lady who have be surprize by company in such a deshabille apologize for it after this manner truly i be ashamed to be catch in this pickle but my husband and i be sit all alone by we self and i do not expect to see such good company -- this by the way be a fine compliment to the good man which ti ten to one but he return in dogged answer and a churlish behavior without know what it be that put he out of humor emilium 's observation teach she that as little inadvertency and neglect cast a blemish upon a great character so the neglect of apparel even among the most intimate friend do insensibly lessen they regard to each other by create a familiarity too low and contemptible she understand the importance of those thing which the generality account trifle and consider every thing as a matter of consequence that have the least tendency towards keep up or abate the affection of she husband he she esteem as a fit object to employ she ingenuity in please because he be to be please for life by the help of these and a thousand other nameless art which tis easier for she to practice than for another to express by the obstinacy of she goodness and unprovoked submission in spight of all she

piece of the same nature to pursue the allusion : as it be observe that among the bright part of the luminous body above mention there be some which glow more intensely and dart a stronger light than other so notwithstanding i have already shewn milton 's poem to be very beautiful in general i shall now proceed to take notice of such beauty as appear to I more exquisite than the rest milton have propose the subject of he poem in the follow verse of man 's first disobedience and the fruit of that forbid tree whose mortal taste bring death into the world and all we woe with loss of eden till one greater man restore we and regain the blisful seat sing heavenly muse -- these line be perhaps as plain simple and unadorned as any of the whole poem in which particular the author have conform himself to the example of homer and the precept of horace he invocation to a work which turn in a great measure upon the creation of the world be very properly make to the muse who inspire mose in those book from whence we author draw he subject and to the holy spirit who be therein represent as operating after a particular manner in the first production of nature this whole exordium rise very happily into noble language and sentiment as i think the transition to the fable be exquisitely beautiful and natural the nine day astonishment in which the angel lay entrance after they dreadful overthrow and fall from heaven before they could recover either the use of thought or speech be a noble circumstance and very finely imagine the division of hell into sea of fire and into firm ground impregnate with the same furious element with that particular circumstance of the exclusion of hope from those infernal region be instance of the same great and fruitful invention the thought in the first speech and description of satan who be one of the principal actor in this poem be wonderfully proper to give we a full idea of he he pride envy and revenge obstinacy despair and impenitence be all of they very artfully interweave in short he first speech be a complication of all those passion which discover themselves separately in several other of he speech in the poem the whole part of this great enemy of mankind be fill with such incident as be very apt to raise and terrifie the reader imagination of this nature in the book now before we be he be the first that awaken out of the general trance with he posture on the burning lake he rise from it and the description of he shield and spear thus satan talk to he nearest mate with head up-lift above the wave and eye that sparkling blaze he other part beside prone on the flood extend long and large lay float many a rood -- forthwith upright he rear from off the pool he mighty stature on each hand the flame drivn backward slope they point spire and roar in billow leave i ` th midst a horrid vale then with expand wing he steer he flight aloft incumbent on the dusky air that feel unusual weight -- -- he pondrous shield ethereal temper massie large and round behind he cast the broad circumference hang on he shoulder like the moon whose orb thro optick glass the tuscan artist view at evn from the top of fesole or in valdarno to descry new land river or mountain on she spotted globe he spear -lrb- to equal which the tallest pine hew on norwegian hill to be the mast of some great admiral be but a wand -rrb- he walk would with to support uneasie step over the burning marl -- to which we may add he call to the fall angel that lay plunge and stupify in the sea of fire he call would so loud that all the hollow deep of hell resound -- but there be no single passage in the whole poem work up to a greater sublimity than that wherein he person be describe in those celebrated line : -- he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stand like a tower & c he sentiment be every way answerable to he character and suitable to a create being of the most exalted and most depraved nature such be that in which he take possession of he place of torment -- hail horror hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor one who bring a mind not to be change by place or time and afterwards -- here at least we shall be free th ` almighty have not build here for he envy will not drive we hence : here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign be worth ambition tho in hell : better to reign in hell than serve in heavn amidst those impiety which this enraged spirit utter in other place of the poem the author have take care to introduce none that be not big with absurdity and incapable of shocking a religious reader he word as the poet himself describe they bear only a semblance of worth not substance he be likewise with great art describe as own he adversary to be almighty whatever perverse interpretation he put on the justice mercy and other attribute of the supreme be he frequently confess he omnipotence that be the perfection he be force to allow he and the only consideration which could support he pride under the shame of he defeat nor must i here omit that beautiful circumstance of he burst out in tear upon he survey of those innumerable spirit whom he have involve in the same guilt and ruin with himself -- he now prepared to speak whereat they double rank they bend from wing to wing and half enclose he round with all he peer : attention hold they mute thrice he assay and thrice in spite of scorn tear such as angel weep burst forth -- the catalogue of evil spirit have abundance of learn in it and a very agreeable turn of poetry which rise in a great measure from -lrb- its -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- describe the place where they be worship by those beautiful mark of river so frequent among the ancient poet the author have doubtless in this place homer catalogue of ship and virgil 's list of warrior in he view the character of moloch and belial prepare the reader mind for they respective speech and behavior in the second and sixth book the account of thammuz be finely romantick and suitable to what we read among the ancient of the worship which be pay to that idol -- thammuz come next behind whose annual wound in lebanon allure the syrian damsel to lament he fate in amorous ditty all a summer day while smooth adoni from he native rock run purple to the sea suppose with blood of thammuz yearly wound : the love tale infected zion 's daughter with like heat whose wanton passion in the sacred porch ezekiel see when by the vision lead he eye survey have the dark idolatry of alienate judah -- the reader will pardon I if i insert as a note on this beautiful passage the account give we by the late ingenious mr maundrell -lrb- 2 -rrb- of this ancient piece of worship and probably the first occasion of such a superstition we come to a fair large river -- doubtless the ancient river adoni so famous for the idolatrous rite perform here in lamentation of adonis we have the fortune to see what may be suppose to be the occasion of that opinion which lucian relate concern this river viz that this stream at certain season of the year especially about the feast of adoni be of a bloody color which the heathen look upon as proceed from a kind of sympathy in the river for the death of adoni who be kill by a wild boar in the mountain out of which this stream rise something like this we see actually come to pass for the water be stain would to a surprizing redness and as we observ would in travel have discolor would the sea a great way into a reddish hue occasion would doubtless by a sort of minium or red earth wash into the river by the violence of the rain and not by any stain from adoni 's blood the passage in the catalogue explain the manner how spirit transform themselves by contraction or enlargement of they dimension be introduce with great judgment to make way for several surprize accident in the sequel of the poem there follow one at the very end of the first book which be what the french critick call marvellous but at the same time probable by reason of the passage last mention as soon as the infernal palace be finish we be tell the multitude and rabble of spirit immediately shrink themselves into a small compass that there might be room for such a numberless assembly in this capacious hall but it be the poet refinement upon this thought which i most admire and which be indeed very noble in its self for he tell we that notwithstanding the vulgar among the fall spirit contract they form those of the first rank and dignity still preserve they natural dimension thus incorporeal spirit to smallest form reduce they shape immense and be at large though without number still amidst the hall of that infernal court but far within and in they own dimension like themselves the great seraphick lord and cherubim in close recess and secret conclave sate a thousand demy-god on golden seat frequent and full -- the character of mammon and the description of the pandæmonium be full of beauty there be several other stroke in the first book wonderfully poetical and instance of that sublime genius so peculiar to the author such be the description of azazel 's stature and of the infernal standard which he unfurl as also of that ghastly light by which the fiend appear to one another in they place of torment the seat of desolation void of light save what the glimmring of those livid flame cast pale and dreadful -- the shout of the whole host of fall angel when draw up in battel array : -- the universal host up send a shout that tear hell concave and beyond fright the reign of chaos and old night the review which the leader make of he infernal army : -- he thro the armed file dart he experienc would eye and soon traverse the whole battalion mew they order due they visage and stature as of god they number last he sum and now he heart distend with pride and hardning in he strength glory -- the flash of light which appear would upon the drawing of they sword : he speak : and to confirm he word outflew million of flame sword draw from the thigh of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze far round illumin would hell -- the sudden production of the pandæmonium anon out of the earth a fabrick huge rise like a exhalation with the sound of dulcet symphony and voice sweet the artificial illuminations make in it : -- from the arched roof pendent by subtle magick many a row of starry lamp and blaze crescet feed with naphtha and asphaltus yield light as from a sky -- there be also several noble simile and allusion in the first book of paradise lose and here i must observe that when milton allude either to thing or person he never quit he simile till it rise to some very great idea which be often foreign to the occasion that give birth to it the resemblance do not perhaps last above a line or two but the poet run on with the hint till he have raise out of it some glorious image or sentiment proper to inflame the mind of the reader and to give it that sublime kind of entertainment which be suitable to the nature of a heroick poem those who be acquaint with homer and virgil 's way of write can not but be please with this kind of structure in milton 's similitude i be the more particular on this head because ignorant reader who have form they taste upon the quaint simile and little turn of wit which be so much in vogue among modern poet can not relish these beauty which be of a much higher nature and be therefore apt to censure milton 's comparison in which they do not see any surprize point of likeness monsieur perrault be a man of this viciated relish and for that very reason have endeavor to turn into ridicule several of homer similitude which he call comparison a longue queue long-tail 's comparison -lrb- 3 -rrb- i shall conclude this paper on the first book of milton with the answer which monsieur boileau make to perrault on this occasion comparison say he in ode and epic poem be not introduce only to illustrate and embellish the discourse but to amuse and relax the mind of the reader by frequently disengage he from too painful a attention to the principal subject and by lead he into other agreeable image homer say he excel in this particular whose comparison abound with such image of nature as be proper to relieve and diversifie he subject he continually instruct the reader and make he take notice even in object which be every day before we eye of such circumstance as we should not otherwise have observe to this he add as a maxim universally acknowledge that it be not necessary in poetry for the point of the comparison to correspond with one another exactly but that a general resemblance be sufficient and that too much nicety in this particular favor of the rhetorician and epigrammatist in short if we look into the conduct of homer virgil and milton as the great fable be the soul of each poem so to give they work a agreeable variety they episode be so many short fable and they simile so many short episode to which you may add if you please that they metaphor be so many short simile if the reader consider the comparison in the first book of milton of the sun in a eclipse of the sleep leviathan

shall take no farther notice of it several of my reader may doubtless remember that upon the conclusion of the last war which have be carry on so successfully by the enemy they general be many of they transform into ambassador but the conduct of those who have command in the present war have it seem bring so little honor and advantage to they great monarch that he be resolve to trust he affair no

per annum which as the present exchange run will amount to at least one hundred and twenty six pound english this with the royal allowance of a thousand livre will enable they to find themselves in coffee and snuff not to mention news-papers pen and ink wax and wafer with the like necessaries for politician a man must be at least five and twenty before he can be initiate into the mystery of this academy tho there be no question but many grave person of a much more advanced age who have be constant reader of the paris gazette will be glad to begin the world a-new and enter themselves upon this list of politician the society of these hopeful young gentleman be to be under the direction of six professor who it seem be to be speculative statesman and draw out of the body of the royal academy these six wise master accord to my private letter be to have the follow part allot they the first be to instruct the student in state legerdemain as how to take off the impression of a seal to split a wafer to open a letter to fold it up again with other the like ingenious feat of dexterity and art when the student have accomplish themselves in this part of they profession they be to be deliver into the hand of they second instructor who be a kind of posture-master this artist be to teach they how to nod judiciously to shrug up they shoulder in a dubious case to connive with either eye and in a word the whole practice of political grimace the third be a sort of language-master who be to instruct they in the style proper for a foreign minister in he ordinary discourse and to the end that this college of statesman may be thoroughly practice in the political style they be to make use of it in they common conversation before they be employ either in foreign or domestick affair if one of they ask another what a-clock it be the other be to answer he indirectly and if possible to turn off the question if he be desire to change a loui d'or he must beg time to consider of it if it be enquire of he whether the king be at versaille or marly he must answer in a whisper if he be ask the news of the late gazette or the subject of a proclamation he be to reply that he have not yet read it : or if he do not care for explain himself so far he need only draw he brow up in wrinkle or elevate the left shoulder the fourth professor be to teach the whole art of political character and hieroglyphic and to the end that they may be perfect also in this practice they be not to send a note to one another -lrb- tho it be but to borrow a tacitus or a machiavil -rrb- which be not write in cypher they fifth professor it be think will be choose out of the society of jesuit and be to be well read in the controversy of probable doctrine mental reservation and the rights of prince this learn man be to instruct they in the grammar syntax and construe part of treaty-latin how to distinguish between the spirit and the letter and likewise demonstrate how the same form of word may lay a obligation upon any prince in europe different from that which it lay upon he most christian majesty he be likewise to teach they the art of find flaw loop-hole and evasion in the most solemn compact and particularly a great rabbinical secret revive of late year by the fraternity of jesuit namely that contradictory interpretation of the same article may both of they be true and valid when we statesman be sufficiently improve by these several instructor they be to receive they last polishing from one who be to act among they as master of the ceremony this gentleman be to give they lecture upon those important point of the elbow chair and the stair head to instruct they in the different situation of the right-hand and to furnish they with bow and inclination of all size measure and proportion in short this professor be to give the society they stiffening and infuse into they manners that beautiful political starch which may qualifie they for levee conference visit and make they shine in what vulgar mind be apt to look upon as trifle i have not yet hear any further particulars which be to be observe in this society of unfledged statesman but i must confess have i a son of five and twenty that should take it into he head at that age to set up for a politician i think i should go near to disinherit he for a block-head besides i should be apprehensive lest the same art which be to enable he to negotiate between potentate might a little infect he ordinary behavior between man and man there be no question but these young machiavil 's will in a little time turn they college upside-down with plot and stratagem and lay as many scheme to circumvent one another in a frog or a sallad as they may hereafter put in practice to over-reach a neighbouring prince or state we be tell that the spartan tho they punish theft in they young man when it be discover look upon it as honorable if it succeed provide the conveyance be clean and unsuspected a youth might afterwards boast of it this say the historian be to keep they sharp and to hinder they from be impose upon either in they publick or private negotiation whether any such relaxation of morality such little jeux desprit ought not to be allow in this intended seminary of politician i shall leave to the wisdom of they founder in the mean time we have fair warning give we by this doughty body of statesman : and as syllum see many marius 's in cæsar so i think we may discover many torcy in this college of academician whatever we think of we self i be afraid neither we smyrna or st jame 's will be a match for it we coffee-house be indeed very good institution but whether or no these we british school of politick may furnish out as able envoy and secretary as a academy that be set apart for that purpose will deserve we serious consideration especially if we remember that we country be more famous for produce man of integrity than statesman and that on the contrary french truth and british policy make

to resign conquest be a task as difficult in a beauty as a hero in the very entrance upon this work she must burn all she love-letter or since she be so candid as not to call she lover who follow she no longer unfaithful it would be a very good beginning of a new life from that of a beauty to send they back to those who writ they with this honest inscription article of a marriage treaty break off by the small-pox i have know but one instance where a matter of this kind go on after a like misfortune where the lady who be a woman of spirit writ this billet to she lover sir if you flatter I

the lover be a very honest plain man and what charm he be a person that go along with he in the care and joy of life not take up with she self but sincerely attentive with a ready and chearful mind to accompany he in either i can tell parthenissa for she comfort that the beauty generally speak be the most impertinent and disagreeable of woman a apparent desire of admiration a reflection upon they own merit and a precious behavior in they general conduct be almost inseparable accident in beauty all you obtain of they be grant to importunity and sollicitation for what do not deserve so much of you time and you recover from the possession of it as out of a dream you be ashamed of the vagary of fancy which so strangely mis-led you and you admiration of a beauty merely as such be inconsistent

destruction of its youth be like the loss which the year would suffer by the destruction of the spring the prejudice which the publick sustain from a wrong education of child be a evil of the same nature as it in a manner starve posterity and defraud we country of those person who with due care might make a eminent figure in they respective post of life i have see a book write by juan huarte -lrb- 1 -rrb- a spanish physician entitle examen de ingenios wherein he lay it down as one of he first position that nothing but nature can qualifie a man for learning and that without a proper temperament for the particular art or science which he study he utmost pain and application assist by the ablest master will be to no purpose he illustrate this by the example of tully 's son marcus cicero in order to accomplish he son in that sort of learning which he design he for send he to athen the most celebrated academy at that time in the world and where a vast concourse out of the most polite nation could not but furnish a young gentleman with a multitude of great example and accident that might insensibly have instruct he in he design study : he place he under the care of cratippus who be one of the greatest philosopher of the age and as if all the book which be at that time write have not be sufficient for he use he compose other on purpose for he : notwithstanding all this history inform we that marcus prove a meer blockhead and that nature -lrb- who it seem be even with the son for she prodigality to the father -rrb- render he incapable of improve by all the rule of eloquence the precept of philosophy he own endeavor and the most refined conversation in athen this author therefore propose that there should be certain tryer or examiner appoint by the state to inspect the genius of every particular boy and to allot he the part that be most suitable to he natural talent plato in one of he dialogue tell we that socrate who be the son of a midwife use to say that as he mother tho she be very skilful in she profession could not deliver a woman unless she be first with child so neither could he himself raise knowledge out of a mind where nature have not plant it accordingly the method this philosopher take of instruct he scholar by several interrogatory or question be only help the birth and bring they own thought to light the spanish doctor above mention as he speculation grow more refined assert that every kind of wit have a particular science correspond to it and in which alone it can be truly excellent as to those genius 's which may seem to have a equal aptitude for several thing he regard they as so many unfinished piece of nature work off in haste there be indeed but very few to whom nature have be so unkind that they be not capable

prose every boy be bind to have as good a memory as the captain of the form to be brief instead of adapt study to the particular genius of a youth we expect from the young man that he should adapt he genius to he study this i must confess be not so much to be imputed to the instructor as to the parent who will never be bring to believe that he son be not capable of perform as much as he neighbor and that he may not make he whatever he have a mind to if the present age be more laudable than those which have go before it in any single particular it be in that generous care which several well-disposed person have take in the education of poor child and as in these charity-school there be no place leave for the over-weening fondness of a parent the director of they would make they beneficial to the publick if they consider the precept which i have be thus long inculcate they might easily by well examine the part of those under they inspection make a just distribution of they

characterise as timorous and slothful and if we look in the sixth book we find he celebrate in the battel of angel for nothing but that scoff speech which he make to satan on they suppose advantage over the enemy as he appearance be uniform and of a piece in these three several view we find he sentiment in the infernal assembly every way conformable to he character such be he apprehension of a second battel he horror of annihilation he prefer to be miserable rather than not to be i need not observe that the contrast of think in this speech and that which precede it give a agreeable variety to the debate mammon 's character be so fully draw in the first book that the poet add nothing to it in the second we be before tell that he be the first who teach mankind to ransack the earth for gold and silver and that he be the architect of pandæmonium or the infernal place where the evil spirit be to meet in council he speech in this book be every way suitable to so depraved a character how proper be that reflection of they be unable to taste the happiness of heaven be they actually there in the mouth of one who while he be in heaven be say to have have he mind dazle with the outward pomp and glory of the place and to have be more intent on the riches of the pavement than on the beatifick vision i shall also leave the reader to judge how agreeable the follow sentiment be to the same character -- this deep world of darkness do we dread how oft amidst thick cloud and dark doth heavn all-ruling sire chuse to reside he glory umobscured and with the majesty of darkness round cover he throne from whence deep thunder roar muster they rage and heavn resemble hell as he we darkness can not we he light imitate when we please this desart soil want not she hidden lustre gem and gold nor want we skill or art from whence to raise magnificence and what can heavn shew more beelzebub who be reckon the second in dignity that fall and be in the first book the second that awaken out of the trance and confer with satan upon the situation of they affair maintain he rank in the book now before we there be a wonderful majesty describe in he rise up to speak he act as a kind of moderator between the two opposite party and propose a third undertaking which the whole assembly give into the motion he make of detach one of they body in search of a new world be ground upon a project devise by satan and cursorily propose by he in the follow line of the first book space may produce new world whereof so rife there go a fame in heavn that he erelong intend to create and therein plant a generation whom he choice regard should favor equal to the son of heaven : thither if but to pry shall be perhaps we first eruption thither or elsewhere : for this infernal pit shall never hold celestial spirit in bondage nor th ' abyss long under darkness cover but these thought full counsel must mature : -- it be on this project that beelzebub grounds he proposal -- what if we find some easier enterprise there be a place -lrb- if ancient and prophetick fame in heavn err not -rrb- another world the happy seat of some new race call would man about this time to be create like to we though less in power and excellence but favor more of he who rule above so be he will pronounc would among the god and by a oath that shake heavn whole circumference confirm would the reader may observe how just it be not to omit in the first book the project upon which the whole poem turn : as also that the prince of the fall angel be the only proper person to give it birth and that the next to he in dignity be the fittest to second and support it there be besides i think something wonderfully beautiful and very apt to affect the reader imagination in this ancient prophecy or report in heaven concern the creation of man nothing could shew more the dignity of the species than this tradition which run of they before they existence they be represent to have be the talk of heaven before they be create virgil in compliment to the roman commonwealth make the hero of it appear in they state of pre-existence but milton do a far greater honor to man-kind in general as he give we a glimpse of they even before they be in be the rise of this great assembly be describe in a very sublime and poetical manner they rise all at once be as the sound of thunder hear remote -- the diversion of the fall angel with the particular account of they place of habitation be describe with great pregnancy of thought and copiousness of invention the diversion be every way suitable to being who have nothing leave they but strength and knowledge misapply such be they contention at the race and in feat of arm with they entertainment in the follow line other with vast typhæan rage more fall rend up both rock and hill and ride the air in whirlwind hell scarce hold the wild uproar they musick be employ in celebrate they own criminal exploit and they discourse in sound the unfathomable depths of fate free-will and fore-knowledge the several circumstance in the description of hell be finely imagine as the four river which disgorge themselves into the sea of fire the extream of cold and heat and the river of oblivion the monstrous animal produce in that infernal world be represent by a single line which give we a more horrid idea of they than a much longer description would have do -- nature breed perverse all monstrous all prodigious thing abominable inutterable and worse than fable yet have feign would or fear conceiv would gorgon and hydra and chimera dire this episode of the fall spirit and they place of habitation come in very happily to unbend the mind of the reader from its attention to the debate a ordinary poet would indeed have spin out so many circumstance to a great length and by that means have weakn instead of illustrated the principal fable the flight of satan to the gate of hell be finely image i have already declare my opinion of the allegory concern sin and death which be however a very finish piece in its kind when it be not consider as a part of a epic poem the genealogy of the several person be contrived with great delicacy sin be the daughter of satan and death the offspring of sin the incestuous mixture between sin and death produce those monster and hell-hound which from time to time enter into they mother and tear the bowels of she who give they birth these be the terror of a evil conscience and the proper fruit of sin which naturally rise from the apprehension of death this last beautiful moral be i think clearly intimate in the speech of sin where complain of this she dreadful issue she add before mine eye in opposition sit grim death my son and foe who set they on and I he parent would full soon devour for want of other prey but that he know he end with mine involv would -- i need not mention to the reader the beautiful circumstance in the last part of this quotation he will likewise observe how naturally the three person concern in this allegory be tempt by one common interest to enter into a confederacy together and how properly sin be make the portress of hell and the only be that can open the gate to that world of torture the descriptive part of this allegory be likewise very strong and full of sublime idea the figure of death -lrb- the regal crown upon he head -rrb- he menace of satan he advance to the combat the outcry at he birth be circumstance too noble to be past over in silence and extreamly suitable to this king of terror i need not mention the justness of thought which be observe in the generation of these several symbolical person that sin be produce upon the first revolt of satan that death appear would soon after he be cast into hell and that the terror of conscience be conceive at the gate of this place of torment the description of the gate be very poetical as the opening of they be full of milton 's spirit -- on a sudden open fly with impetuous recoil and jarring sound th ' infernal door and on they hinge grate harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shake of erebus she open would but to shut excell would she powr the gate wide open stand that with extended wing a banner

nothing in a poet which have not life and manners ascribe to it but for my own part i be pleased most with those passage in this description which carry in they a greater measure of probability and be such as might possibly have happen of this kind be he first mount in the smoke that rise from the infernal pit he fall into a cloud of nitre and the like combustible material that by they explosion still hurry he forward in he voyage he spring upward like a pyramid of fire with he laborious passage through that confusion of element which the poet call the womb of nature and perhaps she grave the

pain to be in they right sens prosperous people -lrb- for happy there be none -rrb- be hurry away with a fond sense of they present condition and thoughtless of the mutability of fortune : fortune be a term which we must use in such discourse as these for what be work by the unseen hand of the disposer of all thing but methink the disposition of a mind which be truly great be that which make misfortune and sorrow little when they befall we self great and lamentable when they befall other man the most unpardonable malefactor in the world go to he death and bear it with composure would win the pity of those who should behold he and this not because he calamity be deplorable but because he seem himself not to deplore it : we suffer for he who be less sensible of he own misery and be incline to despise he who sink under the weight of he distress on the other hand without any touch of envy a temperate and well-govern would mind look down on such as be exalt with success with a

turn he face from the unhappy man who will not look again when he eye be cast upon modest sorrow who shun affliction like a contagion do but pamper himself up for a sacrifice and contract in himself a greater aptitude to misery by attempt to escape it a gentleman where i happen to be last night fall into a discourse which i think shew a good discerning in he : he take notice that whenever man have look into they heart for the idea of true excellency in human nature they have find it to consist in suffer after a right manner and with a good grace hero be always draw bear sorrow struggle with adversity undergo all kind of hardship and have in the service of mankind a kind of appetite to difficulty and danger the gentleman go on to observe that it be from this secret sense of the high merit which there be in patience under calamity that the writer of romance when they attempt to furnish out character of the highest excellence ransack nature for thing terrible they raise a new creation of monster dragon and giant : where the danger end the hero cease when he win a empire or gain he mistress the rest of he story be not worth relate my friend carry he discourse so far as to say that it be for higher being than man to join happiness and greatness in the same idea but that in we condition we have no conception of superlative excellence or heroism but as it be surround with a shade of distress it be certainly the proper education we should give we self to be prepare for the ill event and accident we be to meet with in a life sentence to be a scene of sorrow : but instead of this expectation we soften we self with prospects of constant delight and destroy in we mind the seed of fortitude and virtue which should support we in hour of anguish the constant pursuit of pleasure have in it something insolent and improper for we be there be a pretty sober liveliness in the ode of horace to delius where he tell he loud mirth or immoderate sorrow inequality of behavior either in prosperity or adversity be alike ungraceful in man that be bear to die moderation in both circumstance be peculiar to generous mind : man of that sort ever taste the gratification of health and all other advantage of life as if they be liable to part with they and when bereft of they resign they with a greatness of mind which shew they know they value and duration the contempt of pleasure be a certain preparatory for the contempt of pain : without this the mind be as it be take suddenly by any unforeseen event but he that have always during health and prosperity be abstinent in he

abraham 's intercede for sodom for which he have no warrant as we can find and we ask those thing which we be require to pray for they would therefore have much more reason to fear he anger if they do

school or under a private tutor be to be prefer _ as some of the greatest man in most age have be of very different opinion in this matter i shall give a short account of what i think may be best urge on both side and afterwards leave every person to determine for himself it be certain from _ suetonius _ that the roman think the education of they child a business properly belong to the parent themselves and plutarch in the life of marcus cato tell we that as soon as he son be capable of learn cato would suffer no body to teach he but himself tho he have a servant name chilo who be a excellent grammarian and who teach a great many other youth on the contrary the greek seem more inclined to publick school and seminary a private education promise in the first place virtue and good-breeding a publick school manly assurance and a early knowledge in the way of the world mr locke in he celebrated treatise of education -lrb- 1 -rrb- confess that there be inconveniency to be fear on both side if say he i keep my son at home he be in danger of become my young master if i send he abroad it be scarce possible to keep he from the reign contagion of rudeness and vice he will perhaps be more innocent at home but more ignorant of the world and more sheepish when he come abroad however as this learn author assert that virtue be much more difficult to be attain than knowledge of the world and that vice be a more stubborn as well as a more dangerous fault than sheepishness he be altogether for a private education and the more so because he do not see why a youth with right management might not attain the same assurance in he father house as at a publick school to this end he advise parent to accustom they son to whatever strange face come to the house to take they with they when they visit they neighbor and to engage they in conversation with man of part and breed it may be object to this method that conversation be not the only thing necessary but that unless it be a conversation with such as be in some measure they equal in part and year there can be no room for emulation contention and several of the most lively passion of the mind which without be sometimes move by these means may possibly contract a dulness and insensibility one of the greatest writer we nation ever produce observe that a boy who form party and make himself popular in a school or a college would act the same part with equal ease in a senate or a privy council and mr osborn speak like a man verse in the way of the world affirm that the well lay and carry on of a design to rob a orchard train up a youth insensibly to caution secrecy and circumspection and fit he for matter of greater importance in short a private education seem the most natural method for the form of a virtuous man a publick education for make a man of business the first would furnish out a good subject for plato 's republick the latter a member for a community over-run with artifice and corruption it must however be confess that a person at the head of a publick school have sometimes so many boy under he direction that it be impossible he should extend a due proportion of he care to each of they this be however in reality the fault of the age in which we often see twenty parent who tho each expect he son should be make a scholar be not contented altogether to make it worth while for any man of a liberal education to take upon he the care of they instruction in we great school indeed this fault have be of late year rectify so that we have at present not only ingenious man for the chief master but such as have proper usher and assistant under they i must nevertheless own that for want of the same encouragement in the country we have many a promising genius spoil and abuse in those seminary i be the more inclined to this opinion have my self experience the usage of two rural master each of they very unfit for the trust they take upon they to discharge the first impose much more upon I than my part tho none of the weakest could endure and use I barbarously for not perform impossibility the latter be of quite another temper and a boy who would run upon he errand wash he coffee-pot or ring the bell might have as little conversation with any of the classick as he think fit i have know a lad at this place excuse he exercise for assist the cook-maid and remember a neighbouring gentleman 's son be among we five year most of which time he employ in airing and water we master gray pad i scorn to compound for my fault by do any of these elegant office and be accordingly the best scholar and the worst use of any boy in the school i shall conclude this discourse with a advantage mention by quintilian as accompany a publick way of education which i have not yet take notice of namely that we very often contract such friendship at school as be a service to we all the follow part of we life i shall give you under this head a story very well know to several person and which you may depend upon as a real truth every one who be acquaint with westminster-school know that there be a curtain which use to be draw a-cross the room to separate the upper school from the lower a youth happen by some mischance to tear the above-mentioned curtain : the severity of the master -lrb- 2 -rrb- be too well know for the criminal to expect any pardon for such a fault so that the boy who be of a meek temper be terrify to death at the thought of he appearance when he friend who sit next to he bad he be of good cheer for that he would take the fault on himself he keep he word accordingly as soon as they be grow up to be man the civil war break out in which we two friend take the opposite side one of they follow the parliament the other the royal party as they temper be different the youth who have tear the curtain endeavor to raise himself on the civil list and the other who have bear the blame of it on the military : the first succeed so well that he be in a short time make a judge under the protector the other be engage in the unhappy enterprize of penruddock and grove in the west i suppose sir i need not acquaint you with the event of that undertaking every one know that the royal party be route and all the head of they among whom be the curtain champion imprison at exeter it happen to be he friend lot at that time to go to the western

forsake he any where it be in those part of he poem where the divine person be introduce as speaker one may i think observe that the author proceed with a kind of fear and tremble whilst he describe the sentiment of the almighty he dare not give he imagination its full play but chus to confine himself to such thought as be draw from the book of the most orthodox divine and to such expression as may be meet with in scripture the beauty therefore which we be to look for in these speech be not of a poetical nature nor so proper to fill the mind with sentiment of grandeur as with thought of devotion the passion which they be design to raise be a divine love and religious fear the particular beauty of the speech in the third book consist in that shortness and perspicuity of style in which the poet have couch the greatest mystery of christianity and draw together in a regular scheme the whole dispensation of providence with respect to man he have represent all the abstruse doctrine of predestination free-will and grace as also the great point of incarnation and redemption -lrb- which naturally grow up in a poem that treat of the fall of man -rrb- with great energy of expression and in a clearer and stronger light than i ever meet with in any other writer as these point be dry in themselves to the generality of reader the concise and clear manner in which he have treat they be very much to be admire as be likewise that particular art which he have make use of in the interspersing of all those grace of poetry which the subject be capable of receive the survey of the whole creation and of every thing that be transact in it be a prospect worthy of omniscience and as much above that in which virgil have draw he jupiter as the christian idea of the supreme be be more

upon the frontier of the creation between that mass of matter which be work into a world and that shapeless unformed heap of material which still lay in chaos and confusion strike the imagination with something astonishingly great and wild i have before speak of the limbo of vanity which the poet place upon this outermost surface of the universe and shall here explain my self more at large on that and other part of the poem which be of the same shadowy nature aristotle observe -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the fable of a epic poem should abound in circumstance that be both credible and astonishing or as the french critick chuse to phrase it the fable should be fill with the probable and the marvellous this rule be as fine and just as any in aristotle 's whole art of poetry if the fable be only probable it differ nothing from a true history if it be only marvellous it be no better than a romance the great secret therefore of heroic poetry be to relate such circumstance as may produce in the reader at the same time both belief and astonishment this be bring to pass in a well-chosen fable by the account of such thing as have really happen or at least of such thing as have happen accord to the receive opinion of mankind milton 's fable be a masterpiece of this nature as the war in heaven the condition of the fall angel the state of innocence and temptation of the serpent and the fall of man though they be very astonishing in themselves be not only credible but actual point of faith the next method of reconcile miracle with credibility be by a happy invention of the poet as in particular when he introduce agent of a superior nature who be capable of effect what be wonderful and what be not to be meet with in the ordinary course of thing ulyss 's ship be turn into a rock and æneas 's fleet into a shoal of water nymph though they be very surprising accident be nevertheless probable when we be tell that they be the god who thus transform they it be this kind of machinery which fill the poem both of homer and virgil with such circumstance as be wonderful but not impossible and so frequently produce in the reader the most please passion that can rise in the mind of man which be admiration if there be any instance in the æneid liable to exception upon this account it be in the beginning of the third book where æneas be represent as tear up the myrtle that drop blood to qualifie this wonderful circumstance polydorus tell a story from the root of the myrtle that the barbarous inhabitant of the country have pierce he with spear and arrow the wood which be leave in he body take root in he wound and give birth to that bleeding tree this circumstance seem to have the marvellous without the probable because it be represent as proceed from natural cause without the interposition of any god or other supernatural power capable of produce it the spear and arrow grow of themselves without so much as the modern help of a enchantment if we look into the fiction of milton 's fable though we find it full of surprize incident they be generally suit to we notion of the thing and person describe and temper with a due measure of probability i must only make a exception to the limbo of vanity with he episode of sin and death and some of the imaginary person in he chaos these passage be astonishing but not credible the reader can not so far impose upon himself as to see a possibility in they they be the description of dream and shadow not of thing or person i know that many critick look upon the story of circe polypheme the siren nay the whole odyssey and iliad to be allegory but allow this to be true they be fable which consider the opinion of mankind that prevail in the age of the poet might possibly have be accord to the letter the person be such as might have act what be ascribe to they as the circumstance in which they be represent might possibly have be truth and reality this appearance of probability be so absolutely requisite in the greater kind of poetry that aristotle observe the ancient tragick writer make use of the name of such great man as have actually live in the world tho the tragedy proceed upon adventure they be never engage in on purpose to make the subject more credible in a word besides the hidden meaning of a epic allegory the plain litteral sense ought to appear probable the story should be such as a ordinary reader may acquiesce in whatever natural moral or political truth may be discover in it by man of greater penetration satan after have long wander upon the surface or outmost wall of the universe discover at last a wide gap in it which lead into the creation and be describe as the opening through which the angel pass to and fro into the lower world upon they errand to mankind he sit upon the brink of this passage and take a survey of the whole face of nature that appear to he new and fresh in all its beauty with the simile illustrate this circumstance fill the mind of the reader with as surprizing and glorious a idea as any that arise in the whole poem he look down into that vast hollow of the universe with the eye or -lrb- as milton call it in he first book -rrb- with the kenn of a angel he survey all the wonder in this immense amphitheatre that lye between both the pole of heaven and take in at one view the whole round of the creation he flight between the several world that shine on every side of he with the particular description of the sun be set forth in all the wantonness of a luxuriant imagination he shape speech and behavior upon he transform himself into a angel of light be touch with exquisite beauty the poet think of direct satan to the sun which in the vulgar opinion of mankind be the most conspicuous part of the creation and the place in it a angel be a circumstance very finely contrived and the more adjust to a poetical probability as it be a receive doctrine among the most famous philosopher that every orb have its intelligence and as a apostle in sacred writ be say to have see such a angel in the sun in the answer which this angel return to the disguise evil spirit there be such a become majesty as be altogether suitable to a superior be the part of it in which he represent himself as present at the creation be very noble in it self and not only proper where it be introduce but requisite to prepare

himself employ on the same distant view of it look downward on the globe whose hither side with light from hence tho but reflect shine that place be earth the seat of man that light he day & c i must not conclude my reflection upon this third book of paradise lose without take notice of that celebrated complaint of milton with which it open and which certainly deserve all the praise that have be

woman of fashion whereof the number of six make a committee who sit thrice a week under the title of the inquisition on maid and batchelor it seem whenever there come such a unthinking gay thing as my self to town he must want all manner of necessaries or be put into the inquisition by the first tradesman he employ they have constant intelligence with cane-shop perfumer toymen coach-maker and

of marriage the friend he speak of be employ by the inquisition to take he in as the phrase be after all that be tell he he have information only of one woman that be lay for he and that the wrong one for the lady-commissioner have devote he to another than the person against whom they have employ they agent he friend to alarm he the plot be lay so well about this young gentleman that he have no friend to retire to no place to appear in or part of the kingdom to fly into but he must fall into the notice and be subject to the power of the inquisition they have they emissary and substitute in all part of this unite kingdom the first step they usually take be to find from a correspondence by they messenger and whisperer with some domestick of the batchelor -lrb- who be to be hunt into the toil they have lay for he -rrb- what be he manners he familiarity he good quality or vice not as the good in he be a recommendation or the ill a diminution but as they affect or contribute to the main enquiry what estate he have in he when this point be well report to the board they can take in a wild roar fox-hunter as easily as a soft gentle young fop of the town the way be to make all place uneasie to he but the scene in which they have allot he to act he brother huntsman bottle companion he fraternity of fop shall be bring into the conspiracy against he then this matter be not lay in so bare-faced a manner before he as to have it intimate mr such-a-one would make he a very proper wife but by the force of they correspondence they shall make it -lrb- as mr waller say of the marriage of the dwarf -rrb- as impracticable to have any woman besides she they design he as it would have be in adam to have refuse eve the man name by the commission for mr such-a-one shall neither be in

between the dearest friend nay make father and son irreconcilable enemy in spite of all the tie of gratitude on one part and the duty of protection to be pay on the other the lady of the inquisition understand this perfectly well and where love be not a motive to a man 's chus one whom they allot they can with very much art insinuate story to the disadvantage of he honesty or courage till the creature be too much dispirited to bear up against a general ill reception which he every where meet with and in due time fall into they appoint wedlock for shelter i have a long letter bear date the fourth instant which give I a large account of the policy of this court and find there be now before they a very refractory person who have escape all they machination for two year last past : but

aim only at a life without pain or reproach pleasure honor or riches be thing for which he have no taste but notwithstanding all this and what else he may defend himself with as that the lady be too old or too young of a suitable humor or the quite contrary and that it be impossible they can ever do other than wrangle from June to January every body tell he all this be spleen and he must have a wife while all the member of the inquisition be unanimous in a certain woman for he and they think they all together be better able to judge than he or any other private person whatsoever temple march

length of my discourse upon milton the paradise lose be look upon by the best judge as the greatest production or at least the noblest work of genius in we language and therefore deserve to be set before a english reader in its full beauty for this reason tho i have endeavor to give a general idea of its grace and imperfection in my six first papers i think my self oblige to bestow one upon every book in particular the three first book i have already dispatch and be now enter upon the fourth i need not acquaint my reader that there be multitude of beauty in this great author especially in the descriptive part of he poem which i have not touch upon it be my intention to point out those only which appear to I the most exquisite or those which be not so obvious to ordinary reader every one that have read the critick who have write upon the odyssey the iliad and the aeneid know very well that though they agree in they opinion of the great beauty in those poem they have nevertheless each of they discover several master-stroke which have escape the observation of the rest in the same manner i question not but any writer who shall treat of this subject after I may find several beauty in milton which i have not take notice of i must likewise observe that as the greatest master of critical learning differ among one another as to some particular point in a epic poem i have not bind my self scrupulously to the rule which any one of they have lay down upon that art but have take the liberty sometimes to join with one and sometimes with another and sometimes to differ from all of they when i have think that the reason of the thing be on my side we may consider the beauty of the fourth book under three head in the first be those picture of still-life which we meet with in the description of eden paradise adam bower & c in the next be the machine which comprehend the speech and behavior of the good and bad angel in the last be the conduct of adam and eve who be the principal actor in the poem in the description of paradise the poet have observe aristotle 's rule of lavish all the ornament of diction on the weak unactive part of the fable which be not support by the beauty of sentiment and character -lrb- 2 -rrb- accordingly the reader may observe that the expression be more florid and elaborate in these description than in most other part of the poem i must further add that tho the drawing of garden river rainbow and the like dead piece of nature be justly censure in a heroic poem when they run out into a unnecessary length the description of paradise would have be faulty have not the poet be very particular in it not only as it be the scene of the principal action but as it be requisite to give we a idea of that happiness from which we first parent fall the plan of it be wonderfully beautiful and form upon the short sketch which we have of it in holy writ milton 's exuberance of imagination have pour forth such a redundancy of ornament on this seat of happiness and innocence that it would be endless to point out each particular i must not quit this head without further observe that there be scarce a speech of adam or eve in the whole poem wherein the sentiment and allusion be not take from this they delightful habitation the reader during they whole course of action always find himself in the walk of paradise in short as the critick have remark that in those poem wherein shepherd be actor the thought ought always to take a tincture from the wood field and river so we may observe that we first parent seldom lose sight of they happy station in any thing they speak or do and if the reader will give I leave to use the expression that they thought be always paradisiacal we be in the next place to consider the machine of the fourth book satan be now within prospect of eden and look round upon the glory of the creation be fill with sentiment different from those which he discover whilst he be in hell the place inspire he with thought more adapt to it : he reflect upon the happy condition from which he fall and break forth into a speech that be softn with several transient touch of remorse and self-accusation : but at length he confirm himself in impenitence and in he design of draw man into he own state of guilt and misery this conflict of passion be raise with a great deal of art as the opening of he speech to the sun be very bold and noble o thou that with surpassing glory crown would look ` st from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the star hide they diminish would head to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beam that bring to my remembrance from what state i fall how glorious once above thy sphere this speech be i think the finest that be ascribe to satan in the whole poem the evil spirit afterwards proceed to make he discovery concern we first parent and to learn after what manner they may be best attack he bound over the wall of paradise he sit in the shape of a cormorant upon the tree of life which stand in the center of it and overtop all the other tree of the garden he alighting among the herd of animal which be so beautifully represent as play about adam and eve together with he transform himself into different shape in order to hear they conversation be circumstance that give a agreeable surprize to the reader and be devise with great art to connect that series of adventure in which the poet have engage -lrb- this -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- artificer of fraud the thought of satan 's transformation into a cormorant and place himself on the tree of life seem raise upon that passage in the iliad where two deity be describe as perch on the top of a oak in the shape of vultur he plant himself at the ear of eve under the -lrb- form -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- of a toad in order to produce vain dream and imagination be a circumstance of the same nature as he start up in he own form be wonderfully fine both in the literal description and in the moral which be conceal under it he answer upon he be discover and demand to give a account of himself -lrb- be -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- conformable to the pride and intrepidity of he character know ye not then say satan fill would with scorn know ye not I ye know I once no mate for you there sit where you dare not soar not to know I argue you self unknown the lowest of you throng -- zephon 's rebuke with the influence it have on satan be exquisitely graceful and moral satan be afterwards lead away to gabriel the chief of the guardian angel who keep watch in paradise he disdainful behavior on this occasion be so remarkable a beauty that the most ordinary reader can not but take notice of it gabriel 's discover he approach at a distance be draw with great strength and liveliness of imagination o friend i hear the tread of nimble foot hast this way and now by glimp discern ithuriel and zephon through the shade and with they come a third of regal port but fade splendor wan who by he gait and fierce demeanor seem the prince of hell not likely to part hence without contest : stand firm for in he look defiance lour the conference between gabriel and satan abound with sentiment proper for the occasion and suitable to the person of the two speaker satan cloathe himself with terror when he prepare for the combat be truly sublime and at least equal to homer description of discord celebrate by longinus or to that of fame in virgil who be both represent with they foot stand upon the earth and they head reach above the cloud while thus he speak th ' angelic squadron bright turn would fiery red sharpning in moon horn they phalanx and begin to hem he round with port spear & c -- on the other side satan alarm would collect all he might dilate stand like teneriff or atla unremov have he stature reach the sky and on he crest sit horror plum would -- i must here take -lrb- notice -lrb- 6 -rrb- -rrb- that milton be every where full of hint and sometimes literal translation take from the greatest of the greek and latin poet but this i may reserve for a discourse by it self because i would not break the thread of these speculation that be design for english reader with such reflection as would be of no use but to the learn i must however observe in this place that the break off the combat between gabriel and satan by the hang out of the golden scale in heaven be a refinement upon homer think who tell we that before the battle between hector and achille jupiter weigh the event of it in a pair of scale the reader may see the whole passage in the 22nd iliad virgil before the last decisive combat describe jupiter in the same manner as weigh the fate of turnus and æneas milton though he fetch this beautiful circumstance from the iliad and æneid do not only insert it as a poetical embellishment like the author above-mentioned but make a artful use of it for the proper carry on of he fable and for the break off the combat between the two warrior who be upon the point of engaging -lrb- to this we may further add that milton be the more justified in this passage as we find the same noble allegory in holy writ where a wicked prince some few hour before he be assault and slay be say to have be weigh in the scale and to have be find want -rrb- i must here take notice under the head of the machine that uriel 's glide down to the earth upon a sunbeam with the poet device to make he descend as well in he return to the sun as in he come from it be a prettiness that might have be admire in a little fanciful poet but seem below the genius of milton the description of the host of armed angel walk they nightly round in paradise be of another spirit so say on he lead he radiant file dazle the moon -- as that account of the hymn which we first parent use to hear they sing in these they midnight walk be altogether divine and inexpressibly amusing to the imagination we be in the last place to consider the part which adam and eve act in the fourth book the description of they as they first appear to satan be exquisitely draw and sufficient to make the fall angel gaze upon they with all that astonishment and those emotion of envy in which he be represent two of far nobler shape erect and tall god-like erect with native honor clothe in naked majesty seem would lord of all and worthy seem would : for in they look divine the image of they glorious maker shon truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure severe but in true filial freedom plac would : for contemplation he and valor form would for softness she and sweet attractive grace he for god only she for god in he he fair large front and eye sublime declar would absolute rule and hyacinthin lock round from he parted forelock manly hang clustring but not beneath he shoulder broad she as a veil down to she slender waste she unadorned golden tress wear dis-shevel would but in wanton ringlet wav would so pass would they naked on nor shun would the sight of god or angel for they think no ill : so hand in hand they pass the loveliest pair that ever since in love embrace meet there be a fine spirit of poetry in the line which follow wherein they be describe as sit on a bed of flower by the side of a fountain amidst a mixed assembly of animal the speech of these two first lover flow equally from passion and sincerity the profession they make to one another be full of warmth : but at the same time found on truth in a word they be the gallantry of paradise : -- when adam first of man -- sole partner and sole part of all these joy dearer thy self than all -- but let we ever praise he and extol he bounty follow we delightful task to prune these grow plant and tend these flowr which be it toilsome yet with thee be sweet to whom thus eve reply would o thou for whom and from whom i be form would flesh of thy flesh and without whom be to no end my guide and head what thou hast say be just and right for we to he indeed all praise owe and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy so far the happier lot enjoy thee preeminent by so much odds while thou like consort to thy self canst no where find & c the remain part of eve speech in which she give a account of she self upon she first creation and the manner in which she be bring to adam be i think as beautiful a passage as any in milton or perhaps in any other poet whatsoever these passage be all work off with so much art that they be capable of please the most delicate reader without offend the most severe that day i oft remember when from sleep & c a poet of less judgment and invention than this great author would have find it very difficult to have fill -lrb- these -lrb- 7 -rrb- -rrb- tender part of the poem with sentiment proper for a state of innocence to have describe the warmth of love and the profession of it without artifice or hyperbole : to have make the man speak the most endearing thing without descend from he natural dignity and the woman receive they without depart from the modesty of she character in a word to adjust the prerogative of wisdom and beauty and make each appear to the other in its proper force and loveliness this mutual subordination of the two sex be wonderfully keep up in the whole poem as particularly in the speech of eve i have before mention and upon the conclusion of it in the follow line so speak we general mother and with eye of conjugal attraction unreproved and meek surrender half embrace lean would on we first father half she swell breast naked meet he under the flow gold of she loose tress hide : he in delight both of she beauty and submissive charm smil would with superior love -- the poet add that the devil turn away with envy at the sight of so much happiness we have another view of we first parent in they evening discourse which be full of please image and sentiment suitable to they condition and character the speech of eve in particular be dress up in such a soft and natural turn of word and sentiment as can not be sufficiently admire i shall close my reflection upon this book with observe the masterly transition which the poet make to they evening worship in the follow line thus at they shady lodge arriv would both stand both turn would and under open sky ador have the god that make both -lrb- sky -rrb- air earth and heaven which they behold the moon resplendent globe and starry pole : thou also madst the night maker omnipotent and thou the day & c most of the modern heroick poet have imitate the ancient in begin a speech without premise that the person say thus or thus but as it be easie to imitate the ancient in the omission of two or three word it require judgment to do it in such a manner as they shall not be miss and that the speech may begin naturally without they there be a fine instance of this kind out of homer in the twenty third chapter of longinus l -lrb- footnote 1 : from this date to the end of the series the

she with thought of vanity pride and ambition the author who shew a wonderful art throughout he whole poem in prepare the reader for the several occurrence that arise in it found upon the above-mention would circumstance the first part of the fifth book adam upon he awake find eve still asleep with a unusual discomposure in she look the posture in which he regard she be describ would with a tenderness not to be express would as the whisper with which he awaken she be the softest that ever be convey would to a lover ear he wonder be to find unwaken would eve with tress discompo would and glowing cheek as through unquiet rest : he on he side lean half-rai would with look of cordial love hang over she enamor would and behold beauty which whether waking or asleep shot forth peculiar grace : then with voice mild as when zephyrus on flora breathe she hand soft touch whisper would thus : awake my fairest my espous would my latest find heavn last best gift my ever new delight awake : the morning shine and the fresh field call we we lose the prime to mark how spring we tend plant how blow the citron grove what drop the myrrh and what the balmy reed how nature paint she color how the bee sit on the bloom extract liquid sweet such whisper wak would she but with startled eye on adam whom embrace thus she speak : o sole in whom my thought find all repose my glory my perfection glad i see thy face and morn return would -- i can not but take notice that milton in the conference between adam and eve have he eye very frequently upon the book of canticle in which there be a noble spirit of eastern poetry and very often not unlike what we meet with in homer who be generally place near the age of solomon i think there be no question but the poet in the precede speech remember would those two passage which be speak on the like occasion and fill would with the same pleasing image of nature my beloved spake and say unto I rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter be past the rain be over and go the flower appear on the earth the time of the singing of bird be come and the voice of the turtle be hear in we land the fig-tree putteth forth she green fig and the vine with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair-one and come away come my beloved let we go forth into the field let we get up early to the vineyard let we see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranate bud forth he prefer the garden of eden to that -- where the sapient king hold dalliance with he fair egyptian spouse shew that the poet have this delightful scene in he mind eve dream be full of those high conceit engendr pride which we be tell the devil endeavor have to instill into she of this kind be that part of it where she fancy herself awaken would by adam in the follow beautiful line why sleepst thou eve now be the pleasant time the cool the silent save where silence yield to the night-warbling bird that now awake tune sweetest he love-labour would song now reign full orb have the moon and with more -lrb- pleasing -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- light shadowy set off the face of thing : in vain if none regard heavn wake with all he eye whom to behold but thee nature desire in whose sight all thing joy with ravishment attract by thy beauty still to gaze a injudicious poet would have make adam talk thro the whole work in such sentiment as these : but flattery and falshood be not the courtship of milton 's adam and could not be hear by eve in she state of innocence except only in a dream produc would on purpose to taint she imagination other vain sentiment of the same kind in this relation of she dream will be obvious to every reader tho the catastrophe of the poem be finely presag would on this occasion the particulars of it be so artfully shadow would that they do not anticipate the story which follow in the ninth book i shall only add that tho the vision it self be found upon truth the circumstance of it be full of that wildness and inconsistency which be natural to a dream adam conformable to he superior character for wisdom instruct and comfort eve upon this occasion so chear would he he fair spouse and she be chear would but silently a gentle tear let fall from either eye and wipe they with she hair two other precious drop that ready stand each in they chrystal sluice he ere they fall kiss would as the gracious sign of sweet remorse and pious awe that fear would to have offend the morning hymn be write in imitation of one of those psalm where in the overflowing of gratitude and praise the psalmist call not only upon the angel but upon the most conspicuous part of the inanimate creation to join with he in extol they common maker invocation of this nature fill the mind with glorious idea of god work and awaken that divine enthusiasm which be so natural to devotion but if this call upon the dead part of nature be at all time a proper kind of worship it be in a particular manner suitable to we first parent who have the creation fresh upon they mind and have not see the various dispensation of providence nor consequently could be acquaint with those many topick of praise which might afford matter to the devotions of they posterity i need not remark the beautiful spirit of poetry which run through this whole hymn nor the holiness of that resolution with which it conclude have already mention those speech which be assign to the person in this poem i proceed to the description which the poet -lrb- give -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- of raphael he departure from before the throne and the flight through the choir of angel be finely image as milton every where fill he poem with circumstance that be marvellous and astonishing he describe the gate of heaven as frame after such a manner that it open of it self upon the approach of the angel who be to pass through it till at the gate of heavn arriv have the gate self-open would wide on golden hinge turn as by work divine the sovereign architect have frame the poet here seem to have regard two or three passage in the 18th iliad as that in particular where speaking of vulcan homer say that he have make twenty tripode run on golden wheel which upon occasion might go of themselves to the assembly of the god and when there be no more use for they return again after the same manner scaliger have rally homer very severely upon this point as m dacier have endeavor to defend it i will not pretend to determine whether in this particular of homer the marvellous do not lose sight of the probable as the miraculous workmanship of milton 's gate be not so extraordinary as this of the tripode so i be persuade he would not have mention it have not he be support in it by a passage in the scripture which speak of wheel in heaven that have life in they and move of themselves or stand still in conformity with the cherubim whom they accompany there be no question but milton have this circumstance in he thought because in the follow book he describe the chariot of the messiah with live wheel accord to the plan in ezekiel 's vision -- forth rush would with whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deity flash thick flame wheel within wheel undrawn itself instinct with spirit -- i question not but bossu and the two dacier who be for vindicate every thing that be censure in homer by something parallel in holy writ would have be very well pleased have they think of confront vulcan 's tripode with ezekiel 's wheel raphael 's descent to the earth with the figure of he person be represent in very lively color several of the french italian and english poet have give a loose to they imagination in the description of angel : but i do not remember to have meet with any so finely draw and so conformable to the notion which be give of they in scripture as this in milton after have set he forth in all he heavenly plumage and represent he as alight upon the earth the poet conclude he description with a circumstance which be altogether new and imagine with the greatest strength of fancy -- like maium 's son he stand and shake he plume that heavnly fragrance fill have the circuit wide -- raphael 's reception by the guardian angel he pass through the wilderness of sweet he distant appearance to adam have all the grace that poetry be capable of bestow the author afterwards give we a particular description of eve in she domestick employment so say with dispatchful look in haste she turn on hospitable thought intent what choice to chuse for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix taste not well join would inelegant but bring taste after taste uphold with kindliest change bestir she then & c -- though in this and other part of the same book the subject be only the housewifry of we first parent it be set off with so many please image and strong expression as make it none of the least agreeable part in this divine work the natural majesty of adam and at the same time he submissive behavior to the superior be who have vouchsafe to be he guest the solemn hail which the angel bestow upon the mother of mankind with the figure of eve ministring at the table be circumstance which deserve to be admire raphael 's behavior be every way suitable to the dignity of he nature and to that character of a sociable spirit with which the author have so judiciously introduce he he have receive instruction to converse with adam as one friend converse with another and to warn he of the enemy who be contrive he destruction : accordingly he be represent as sit down at table with adam and eating of the fruit of paradise the occasion naturally lead he to he discourse on the food of angel after have thus enter into conversation with man upon more indifferent subject he warn he of he obedience and make natural transition to the history of that fall angel who be employ would in the circumvention of we first parent have i follow monsieur bossu 's method in my first paper of milton i should have date the action of paradise lose from the beginning of raphael 's speech in this book as he suppose the action of the æneid to begin in the second book of that poem i could allege many reason for my draw the action of the æneid rather from its immediate beginning in the first book than from its remote beginning in the second and shew why i have consider the sack of troy as a episode accord to the common acceptation of that word but as this would be a dry unentertaining piece of criticism and perhaps unnecessary to those who have read my first paper i shall not enlarge upon it whichever of the notion be true the unity of milton 's action be preserve accord to either of they whether we consider the fall of man in its immediate beginning as proceed from the resolution take in the infernal council or in its more remote beginning as proceed from the first revolt of the angel in heaven the occasion which milton assign for this revolt as it be found on hint in holy writ and on the opinion of some great writer so it be the most proper that the poet could have make use of the revolt in heaven be describe with great force of imagination and a fine variety of circumstance the learn reader can not but be please with the poet imitation of homer in the last of the follow line at length into the limit of the north they come and satan take he royal

by several passage in the precede book i omit quote these passage in my observation on the former book have purposely reserve they for the opening of this the subject of which give occasion to they the author imagination be so inflam would with this great scene of action that wherever he speak of it he rise if possible above himself thus where he mention satan in the beginning of he poem : -- he the almighty power hurl would headlong flame from th ' ethereal sky with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chain and penal fire who dare defy th ' omnipotent to arm we have likewise several noble hint of it in the infernal conference o prince o chief of many throned power that lead th ' imbattel would seraphim to war too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defeat have lose we heavn and all this mighty host in horrible destruction lay thus low but see i the angry victor have recall he minister of vengeance and pursuit back to the gate of heavn : the sulphurous hail shot after we in storm overblown have lay the fiery surge that from the precipice of heaven receiv have we fall : and the thunder wing with red lightning and impetuous rage perhaps have spend he shaft and cease now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep there be several other very sublime image on the same subject in the first book as also in the second what when we flee amain pursued and strook with heavn afflict thunder and besought the deep to shelter we this hell then seem would a refuge from those wound -- in short the poet never mention anything of this battel but in such image of greatness and terror as be suitable to the subject among several other i can not forbear quote that passage where the power who be describe as preside over the chaos speak in the third book thus satan and he thus the anarch old with faultring speech and visage incompo would answer would i know thee stranger who thou art that mighty lead angel who of late make head against heaven king tho overthrow i saw and hear for such a numerous host flee not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin rout on rout confusion worse confound and heavn gate pour would out by million she victorious band pursue -- it requir would great pregnancy of invention and strength of imagination to fill this battel with such circumstance as should raise and astonish the mind of the reader and at the same time a exactness of judgment to avoid every thing that might appear light or trivial those who look into homer be surprize to find he battel still rise one above another and improve in horror to the conclusion of the iliad milton 's fight of angel be work up with the same beauty it be usher would in with such sign of wrath as be suitable to omnipotence incense the first engagement be carry would on under a cope of fire occasion would by the flight of innumerable burning dart and arrow which be discharge from either host the second onset be still more terrible as it be fill with those artificial thunder which seem to make the victory doubtful and produce a kind of consternation even in the good angel this be follow would by the tear up of mountain and promontory till in the last place the messiah come forth in the fulness of majesty and terror the pomp of he appearance amidst the roaring of he thunder the flash of he lightning and the noise of he chariot-wheel be describe with the utmost flight of human imagination there be nothing in the first and last day engagement which do not appear natural and agreeable enough to the idea most reader would conceive of a fight between two army of angel the second day engagement be apt to startle a imagination which have not be raise and qualify would for such a description by the reading of the ancient poet and of homer in particular it be certainly a very bold thought in we author to ascribe the first use of artillery to the rebel angel but as such a pernicious invention may be well suppose to have proceed from such author so it enter very properly into the thought of that be who be all along describ would as aspire to the majesty of he maker such engine be the only instrument he could have make use of to imitate those thunder that in all poetry both sacred and profane be represent as the arm of the almighty the tear up the hill be not altogether so daring a think as the former we be in some measure prepare for such a incident by the description of the giant war which we meet with among the ancient poet what still make this circumstance the more proper for the poet use be the opinion of many learn man that the fable of the giant war which make so great a noise in antiquity -lrb- and give birth to the sublimest description in hesiod 's work be -lrb- l -rrb- -rrb- a allegory found upon this very tradition of a fight between the good and bad angel it may perhaps be worth while to consider with what judgment milton in this narration have avoid every thing that be mean and trivial in the description of the latin and greek poet and at the same time improve every great hint which he meet with in they work upon this subject homer in that passage which longinus have celebrate for its sublimeness and which virgil and ovid have copy would after he tell we that the giant throw os upon olympus and pelion upon os he add a epithet to pelion -lrb- -lrb- greek : einosíphullon -rrb- -rrb- which very much swell the idea by bring up to the reader imagination all the wood that grow upon it there be further a great beauty in he single out by name these three remarkable mountain so well know to the greek this last be such a beauty as the scene of milton 's war could not possibly furnish he with claudian in he fragment upon the giant war have give full scope to that wildness of imagination which be natural to he he tell we that the giant tear up whole island by the root and throw they at the god he describe one of they in particular take up lemno in he arm and whirling it to the sky with all vulcan 's shop in the midst of it another tear up mount ida with the river enipeus which run down the side of it but the poet not content to describe he with this mountain upon he shoulder tell we that the river flow would down he back as he hold it up in that posture it be visible to every judicious reader that such idea savor more of burlesque than of the sublime they proceed from a wantonness of imagination and rather divert the mind than astonish it milton have take every thing that be sublime in these several passage and compose out of they the follow great image from they foundation loosn to and fro they pluck would the seat hill with all they land rock water wood and by the shaggy top up-lifting bear they in they hand -- we have the full majesty of homer in this short description improv would by the imagination of claudian without its puerility i need not point out the description of the fall angel see the promontory hang over they head in such a dreadful manner with the other numberless beauty in this book which be so conspicuous that they can not escape the notice of the most ordinary reader there be indeed so many wonderful stroke of poetry in this book and such a variety of sublime idea that it would have be impossible to have give they a place within the bound of this paper besides that i find it in a great measure do to my hand at the end of my lord roscommon 's essay on translate poetry i shall refer my reader thither for some of the master stroke in the sixth book of paradise lose tho at the same time there be many other which that noble author have not take notice of milton notwithstanding the sublime genius he be master of have in this book draw to he assistance all the help he could meet with among the ancient poet the sword of michael which make so great -lrb- a -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- havock among the bad angel be give he we be tell out of the armory of god -- but the sword of michael from the armory of god be give he temper so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge : it meet the sword of satan with steep force to smite descend and in half cut sheer -- this passage be a copy of that in virgil wherein the poet tell we that the sword of æneas which be give he by a deity break into piece the sword of turnus which come from a mortal forge as the moral in this place be divine so by the way we may observe that the bestow on a man who be favor by heaven such a allegorical weapon be very conformable to the old eastern way of think not only homer have make use of it but we find the jewish hero in the book of maccabee who have fight the battel of the choose people with so much glory and success receive in he dream a sword from the hand of the prophet jeremiah the following passage wherein satan be describe as wound by the sword of michael be in imitation of homer the gride sword with discontinuous wound pass through he butt the ethereal substance close not long divisible and from the gash a stream of nectarous humor issue flow sanguine -lrb- such as celestial spirit may bleed -rrb- and all he armor stain -- homer tell we in the same manner that upon diomede wound the god there flow would from the wound a ichor or pure kind of blood which be not breed from mortal viand and that tho the pain be exquisitely great the wound soon close up and heal in those being who be vest with immortality i question not but milton in he description of he furious moloch fly from the battel and bellow with the wound he have receive have he eye on mar in the iliad who upon he be wound be represent as retire out of the fight and make a outcry louder than that of a whole army when it begin the charge homer add that the greek and trojan who be engage in a general battel be terrify would on each side with the bellowing of this wounded deity the reader will easily observe how milton have keep all the horror of this image without run into the ridicule of it -- where the might of gabriel fight and with fierce ensign pierc would the deep array of moloch furious king who he defy would and at he chariot-wheel to drag he bind threaten would nor from the holy one of heavn refrain he tongue blasphemous : but anon down cloven to the waste with shattered arm and uncouth pain flee bellow -- milton have likewise raise he description in this book with many image take out of the poetical part of scripture the messiah chariot as i have before take notice be form upon a vision of ezekiel who as grotius observe have very much in he of homer spirit in the poetical part of he prophecy the follow line in that glorious commission which be give the messiah to extirpate the host of rebel angel be draw from a sublime passage in the psalm go then thou mightiest in thy father might ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheel that shake heavn basis bring forth all my war my bow my thunder my almighty arm gird on thy sword on thy puissant thigh the reader will easily discover many other stroke of the same nature there be no question but milton have heat he imagination with the fight of the god in homer before he enter would upon this engagement of the angel homer there give we a scene of man hero and god mix would together in battel mar animate the contend army and lift up he voice in such a manner that it be hear distinctly amidst all the shout and confusion of the fight jupiter at the same time thunder over they head while neptune raise such a tempest that the whole field of battel and all the top of the mountain shake about they the poet tell we that pluto himself whose habitation be in the very center of the earth be so affright at the shock that he leap from he throne homer afterwards describe vulcan as pour down a storm of fire upon the river xanthus and minerva as throw a rock at mar who he tell we cover would seven acre in he fall as homer have introduce into he battel of the god every thing that be great and terrible in nature milton have fill he fight of good and bad angel with all the like circumstance of horror the shout of army the rattle of brazen chariot the hurl of rock and mountain the earthquake the fire the thunder be all of they employ would to lift up the reader imagination and give he a suitable idea of so great a action with what art have the poet represent the whole body of the earth tremble even before it be create all heaven resound and have earth be then all earth have to its center shake -- in how sublime and just a manner do he afterwards describe the whole heaven shake under the wheel of the messiah chariot with that exception to the throne of god -- under he burn wheel the stedfast empyrean shake throughout all but the throne it self of god -- notwithstanding the messiah appear clothe with so much terror and majesty the poet have still find means to make he reader conceive a idea of he beyond what he himself be able to describe yet half he strength he put not forth but checkt he thunder in mid volley for he mean not to destroy but root they out of heaven in a word milton 's genius which be so great in it self and so strengthen by all the help of learn appear in this book every way equal to he subject which be the most sublime that could enter into the thought of a poet as he know all the art of affect the mind -lrb- he know it be necessary to give -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- it certain resting-place and opportunity of recover it self from time to time : he have -lrb- therefore -rrb- with great address intersperse several speech

the art or science that have not be recommend to the world by the pen of some of the professor master or lover of they whereby the usefulness excellence and benefit arise from they both as to the speculative and practical part have be make publick to the great advantage and improvement of such art and science why should dance a art celebrate by the ancient in so extraordinary a manner be totally neglect by the modern and leave destitute of any pen to recommend its various excellency and substantial merit to mankind the low ebb to which dancing be now fall be altogether owe to this silence the art be esteem would only as a amusing trifle it lie altogether uncultivated and be unhappily fall under the imputation of illiterate and mechanick : and as terence in one of he prologue complain of the rope-dancer draw all the spectator from he play so may we well say that caper and tumble be now prefer to and supply the place of just and regular dancing on we theater it be therefore in my opinion high time that some one should come in to its assistance and relieve it from the many gross and growing error that have creep into it and over-cast its real beauty and to set dancing in its true light would shew the usefulness and elegancy of it with the pleasure and instruction produc would from it and also lay down some fundamental rule that might so tend to the improvement of its professor and information of the spectator that the first might be the better enable to perform and the latter render would more capable of judge what be -lrb- if there be any thing -rrb- valuable in this art to encourage therefore some ingenious pen capable of so generous a undertaking and in some measure to relieve dancing from the disadvantage it at present lie under i who teach to dance have attempt a small treatise as a essay towards a history of dancing in which i have enquire into its antiquity original and use and shewn what esteem the ancient have for it : i have likewise consider the nature and perfection of all its several part and how beneficial and delightful it be both as a qualification and a exercise and endeavor to answer all objection that have be maliciously rai would against it i have proceed to give a account of the particular dance of the greek and roman whether religious warlike or civil and take particular notice of that part of dancing relate to the ancient stage and in which the pantomime have so great a share : nor have i be want in give a historical account of some particular master excellent in that surprising art after which i have advance some observation on the modern dancing both as to the stage and that part of it so absolutely necessary for the qualification of gentleman and lady and have conclude with some short remark on the origin and progress of the character by which dance be writ down and communicate to one master from another if some great genius after this would arise and advance this art to that perfection it seem capable of receive what might not be expect from it for if we consider the origin of art and science we shall find that some of they take rise from beginning so mean and unpromise that it be very wonderful to think that ever such surprizing structure should have be raise upon such ordinary foundation but what can not a great genius effect who would have think that the clangorous noise of a smith hammer should have give the first rise to musick yet macrobius in he second book relate that pythagora in pass by a smith shop find that the sound proceed from the hammer be either more grave or acute accord to the different weight of the hammer the philosopher to improve this hint suspend different weight by string of the same bigness and find in like manner that the sound answer to the weight this being discover would he find out those number which produc would sound that be consonant : as that two string of the same substance and tension the one be double the length of the other give that interval which be call diapason or a eighth the same be also effect from two string of the same length and size the one have four time the tension of the other by these step from so mean a beginning do this great man reduce what be only before noise to one of the most delightful science by marry it to the mathematick and by that mean cause it to be one of the most abstract and demonstrative of science who know therefore but motion whether decorous or representative may not -lrb- as it seem highly probable it may -rrb- be take into consideration by some person capable of reduce it into a regular science tho not so demonstrative as that proceeding from sound yet sufficient to entitle it to a place among the magnify would art now mr spectator as you have declare you self visitor of

which a mind seasoned with humanity naturally feel in its self at the sight of a multitude of people who seem pleased with one another and partake of the same common entertainment i could not but

of france himself have a better strut i be indeed very attentive to my old friend remark because i look upon they as a piece of natural criticism and be well pleased to hear he at the conclusion of almost every scene tell I that he could not imagine how the play would end one while he appear much concern for andromache and a little while after as much for hermione : and be extremely puzzle to think what would become of pyrrhus when sir roger see andromache 's obstinate refusal to she lover importunity he whisper would I in the ear that he be sure she would never have he to which he add with a more than ordinary vehemence you cant imagine sir what ti to have to do with a widow upon pyrrhus he threatning afterwards to leave she the knight shake he head and mutter to himself ay do if

be give of he upon hermione 's go off with a menace to pyrrhus the audience give a loud clap to which sir roger add on my word a notable young baggage as there be a very remarkable silence and stillness in the audience during the whole action it be natural for they to take the opportunity of these interval between the act to express they opinion of the player and of they respective part sir roger hear a cluster of they praise oreste strike in with they and tell they that he think he friend pylade be a very sensible man as they be afterwards applaud pyrrhus sir roger put in a second time

viam quam monstrat eque -- hor i have lately receive a third letter from the gentleman who have already give the publick two essay upon education as he thought seem to be very just and new upon this subject i shall communicate they to the reader sir if i have not be hinder by some extraordinary business i should have send you sooner my further thought upon education you may please to remember that in my last letter i endeavor to give the best reason that could be urge in favor of a private or publick education upon the whole it may perhaps be think that i seem rather encline to the latter though at the same time i confess that virtue which ought to be we first and principal care be more usually acquire in the former i intend therefore in this letter to offer at method by which i conceive boy might be make to improve in virtue as they advance in letter i know that in most of we public school vice be punish and discourage whenever it be find out but this be far from be sufficient unless we youth be at the same time teach to form a right judgment of thing and to know what be properly virtue to this end whenever they read the life and action of such man as have be famous in they generation it should not be think enough to make they barely understand so many greek or latin sentence but they should be ask they opinion of such a action or say and oblige to give they reason why they take it to be good or bad by this mean they would insensibly arrive at proper notion of courage temperance honor and justice there must be great care take how the example of any particular person be recommend to they in gross instead of which they ought to be teach wherein such a man though great in some respects be weak and faulty in other for want of this caution a boy be often so dazzle with the lustre of a great character that he confound its beauty with its blemish and look even upon the faulty part of it with a eye of admiration i have often wonder how alexander who be naturally of a generous and merciful disposition come to be guilty of so barbarous a action as that of drag the governor of a town after he chariot i know this be generally ascribe to he passion for homer but i lately meet with a passage in plutarch which if i be not very much mistaken still give we a clearer light into the motive of this action plutarch tell we that alexander in he youth have a master name lysimachus who tho he be a man destitute of all politeness ingratiate himself both with philip and he pupil and become the second man at court by call the king peleus the prince achille and himself phoenix it be no wonder if alexander have be thus use not only to admire but to personate achille should think it glorious to imitate he in this piece of cruelty and extravagance to carry this thought yet further i shall submit it to you consideration whether instead of a theme or copy of verse which be the usual exercise as they be call in the school-phrase it would not be more proper that a boy should be task once or twice a week to write down he opinion of such person and thing as occur to he in he reading that he should descant upon the action of turnus and æneas shew wherein they excel or be defective censure or approve any particular action observe how it might have be carry to a greater degree of perfection and how it exceed or fall short of another he might at the same time mark what be moral in any speech and how far it agree with the character of the person speak this exercise would soon strengthen he judgment in what be blameable or praiseworthy and give he a early seasoning of morality next to those example which may be meet with in book i very much approve horace 's way of setting before youth the infamous or honorable character of they contemporary : that poet tell we this be the method he father make use of to incline he to any particular virtue or give he a aversion to any particular vice if say horace my father advise I to live within bound and be contented with the fortune he should leave I do not you see -lrb- say he -rrb- the miserable condition of burr and the son of albus let the misfortune of those two wretch teach you to avoid luxury and extravagance if he would inspire I with a abhorrence to debauchery do not -lrb- say he -rrb- make you self like sectanus when you may be happy in the enjoyment of lawful pleasure how scandalous -lrb- say he -rrb- be the character of trebonius who be lately catch in bed with another man 's wife to illustrate the force of this method the poet add that as a headstrong patient who will not at first follow he physician prescription grow orderly when he hear that he neighbor die all about he so youth be often fright from vice by hear the ill report it bring upon other xenophon 's school of equity in he life of cyrus the great be sufficiently famous : he tell we that the persian child go to school and employ they time as diligently in learn the principle of justice and sobriety as the youth in other country do to acquire the most difficult art and science : they governor spend most part of the day in hear they mutual accusation one against the other whether for violence cheating slander or ingratitude and teach they how to give judgment against those who be find to be any way guilty of these crime i omit the story of the long and short coat for which cyrus himself be punish as a case equally know with any in littleton the method which apuleius tell we the indian gymnosophist take to educate they disciple be still more curious and remarkable he word be as follow : when they dinner be ready before it be serve up the master enquire of every particular scholar how he have employ he time since sun-rise some of they answer that have be choose as arbiter between two person they have compose they difference and make they friend some that they have be execute the order of they parent and other that they have either find out something new by they own application or learn it from the instruction of they fellow : but if there happen to be any one among they who can not make it appear that he have employ the morning to advantage he be immediately exclude from the company and oblige to work while the rest be at dinner it be not impossible that from these several way of produce virtue in the mind of boy some general method might be invent what i would endeavor to inculcate be that we youth can not be too soon teach the principle of virtue see the first impression which be make on the mind be always the strongest the archbishop of cambray make telemachus say that though he be young in year he be old in the art of know how to keep both he own and he friend secret when my father say the prince go to the siege of troy he take I on he knee and after have embrace and bless I as he be surround by the noble of ithaca o my friend say he into you hand i commit the education of my son if ever you lov would he father shew it in you care towards he but above all do not omit to form he just sincere and faithful in keep a secret these word of my father say telemachus be continually repeat to I by he friend in he absence who make no scruple of communicate to I in they uneasiness to see my mother surround with lover and the measure they design to take on that occasion he add that he be so ravish at be thus treat like a man and at the confidence repose in he that he never once abuse it nor could all the insinuation of he father rival ever get he to betray what be commit to he under the seal of secrecy there be hardly any virtue which a lad might not thus learn by practice and example i have hear of a good man who use at certain time to give he scholar six penny apiece that they might tell he the next day how they have employ would it the third part be always to be lay out in charity and every boy be blame or commend as he could make it appear that he have choose a fit object in short nothing be more want to we publick school than that the master of they should use the same care in fashion the manners of they scholar as in form they tongue to the learn language where-ever the former be omit i can not help agree with mr locke that a man must have a very strange value for word when prefer the language of the greek and roman to that which make they such brave man he can think it worth while to hazard the innocence and virtue of he son for a little greek and latin as the subject of this essay be of the highest importance and what i do not remember to have yet see treat by any author i have send you what occurr

of the person who be guilty of it mr spectator i have the happiness the other night of sit very near you and you worthy friend sir roger at the acting of the new tragedy which you have in a late paper or two so justly recommend i be highly please with the advantageous situation fortune have give I in place I so near two gentleman from one of which i be sure to hear such reflection on the several incident of the play as pure nature suggest and from the other such as flow from the exactest art and judgment : tho i must confess that my curiosity lead I so much to observe the knight reflection that i be not so well at leisure to improve my self by yours nature i find play would she part in the knight pretty well till at the last conclude line she entirely forsake he you must know sir that it be always my custom when i have be well entertain at a new tragedy to make my retreat before the facetious epilogue enter not but that those piece be often very well writ but have pay down my half crown and make a fair purchase of as much of the please melancholy as the poet art can afford I or my own nature admit of i be willing to carry some of it home with I and cant endure to be at once trick would out of all tho by the wittiest dexterity in the world however i keep my seat tother night in hope of find my own sentiment of this matter favor would by you friend when to my great surprize i find the knight enter with equal pleasure into both part and as much satisfied with mr oldfield 's gaiety as he have be before with andromache 's greatness whether this be no other than a effect of the knight peculiar humanity plea have to find at last that after all the tragical doings every thing be safe and well i do not know but for my own part i must confess i be so dissatisfied that i be sorry the poet have save andromache and could heartily have wish that he have leave she stone-dead upon the stage for you can not imagine mr spectator the mischief she be reserv 'd to do I i find my soul during the action gradually work would up to the highest pitch and feel the exalted passion which all generous mind conceive at the sight of virtue in distress the impression believe I sir be so strong upon I that i be persuade if i have be let alone in it i could at a extremity have venture to defend you self and sir roger against half a score of the fiercest mohock : but the ludicrous epilogue in the close extinguish would all my ardor and make I look upon all such noble atchievement as downright silly and romantick what the rest of the audience feel i cant so well tell : for my self i must declare that at the end of the play i find my soul uniform and all of a piece but at the end of the epilogue it be so jumble together and divide between jest and earnest that if you will forgive I a extravagant fancy i will here set it down i could not but fancy if my soul have at that moment quit my body and descend to the poetical shades in the posture it be then in what a strange figure it would have make among they they would not have know what to have make of my motley spectre half comick and half tragick all over resemble a ridiculous face that at the same time laugh on one side and cry o tother the only defense i think i have ever hear make for this as it seem to I most unnatural tack of the comick tail to the tragick head be this that the mind of the audience must be refresh and gentleman and lady not send away to they own home with too dismal and melancholy thought about they : for who know the consequence of this we be much obliged indeed to the poet for the great tenderness they express for the safety of we person and heartily thank they for it but if that be all pray good sir assure they that we be none of we like to come to any great harm and that let they do they best we shall in all probability live out the length of we day and frequent the theater more than ever what make I more desirous to have some reformation of this matter be because of a ill consequence or two attend it : for a great many of we church-musician be relate to the theater they have in imitation of these epilogue introduce in they farewell voluntary a sort of musick quite foreign to the design of church-service to the great prejudice of well-disposed people those finger gentleman should be inform that they ought to suit they air to the place and business and that the musician be oblige to keep to the text as much as the preacher for want of this i have find by experience a great deal of mischief : for when the preacher have often with great piety and art enough handle he subject and the judicious clark have with utmost diligence cull out two stave proper to the discourse and i have find in my self and in the rest of the pew good thought and disposition they have be all in a moment dissipate by a merry jigg from the organ-loft one know not what further ill effect the epilogue i have be speak of may in time produce : but this i be credibly inform of that paul lorrain -lrb- 3 -rrb- -- have resolv would upon a very sudden reformation in he tragical drama and that at the next monthly performance he design instead of a penitential psalm to

this book which give we a account of the six day work the poet receive but very few assistance from heathen writer who be stranger to the wonder of creation but as there be many glorious stroke of poetry upon this subject in holy writ the author have numberless allusion to they through the whole course of this book the great critick i have before mention though a heathen have take notice of the sublime manner in which the lawgiver of the jew have describ would the creation in the first chapter of genesis -lrb- 4 -rrb- and there be many other passage in scripture which rise up to the same

that homer give we the same idea of the latter as opening of themselves tho he afterwards take off from it by tell we that the hour first of all remove those prodigious heap of cloud which lay as a barrier before they i do not know any thing in the whole poem more sublime than the description which follow where the messiah be represent at the head of he angel as look down into the chaos calming its confusion ride into the midst of it and draw the first out-line of the creation on heavenly ground they stand and from the shore they view would the vast immeasurable abyss outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild up from the bottom turn by furious wind and surge wave as mountain to assault heaven height and with the center mix the pole silence ye trouble wave and thou deep peace say then th

and all create thing : one foot he center would and the other turn would round through the vast profundity obscure and say thus far extend thus far thy bound this be thy just circumference o world the thought of the golden compass be conceive altogether in homer spirit and be a very noble incident in this wonderful description homer when he speak of the god ascribe to they several arm and instrument with the same greatness of imagination let the reader only peruse the description of minerva 's ægis or buckler in the fifth book with she spear which would overturn whole squadron and she helmet that be sufficient to cover a army draw out of a hundred city : the golden compass in the above-mentioned passage appear a very natural instrument in the hand of he whom plato somewhere call the divine geometrician as poetry delight in cloathe abstracted idea in allegory and sensible image we find a magnificent description of the creation form would after the same manner in one of the prophet wherein he describe the almighty architect as measure the water in the hollow of he hand mete out the heaven with he span comprehend the dust of the earth in a measure weigh the mountain in scale and the hill in a balance another of they describe the supreme be in this great work of creation represent he as lay the foundation of the earth and stretch a line upon it : and in another place as garnish the heaven stretch out the north over the empty place and hang the earth upon nothing this last noble thought milton have express would in the follow verse : and earth self-ballanc would on she center hang the beauty of description in this book lie so very thick that it be impossible to enumerate they in this paper the poet have employ would on they the whole energy of we tongue the several great scene of the creation rise up to view one after another in such a manner that the reader seem present at this wonderful work and to assist among the choir of angel who be the spectator of it how glorious be the conclusion of the first day -- thus be the first day ev 'n and morn nor past uncelebrated nor unsung by the celestial quire when orient light exhale first from darkness they behold birth-day of heavn and earth with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they fill would we have the same elevation of think in the third day when the mountain be bring forth and the deep be make immediately the mountain huge appear emergent and they broad bare back up-heave into the cloud they top ascend the sky : so high as heav have the tumid hill so low down sink a hollow bottom broad

would wonder how the poet could be so concise in he description of the six day work as to comprehend they within the bound of a episode and at the same time so particular as to give we a lively idea of they this be still more remarkable in he account of the fifth and sixth day in which he have draw out to we view the whole animal creation from the reptil to the behemoth as the lion and the

it be the duty of a great person so to demean himself as that whatever endowment he may have he may appear to value himself upon no quality but such as any man may arrive at : he ought to think no man

general i can say that he who behold he will easily expect from he any thing that be to be imagine or execute by the wit or force of man the prince be of that stature which make a man most easily become all part of exercise have height to be graceful on occasion of state and ceremony and no less adapt for agility and dispatch : he aspect be erect and compo would he eye lively and thoughtful yet rather vigilant than sparkling he action and address the most easy imaginable and he behavior in a assembly peculiarly graceful in a certain art of mix insensibly with the rest and become one of

representation of the play this have already be repeat nine time i must own i be the more surprize to find this censure in opposition to the whole town in a paper which have hitherto be famous for the candor of its criticism i can by no means allow you melancholy correspondent that the new epilogue be unnatural because it be gay if i have a mind to be learn i could tell he that the prologue and epilogue be real part of the ancient tragedy but every one know that on the british stage they be distinct performance by themselves piece entirely detach from the play and no way essential to it the moment the play end mr oldfield be no more andromache but mr oldfield and tho the poet have leave andromache stone-dead upon the stage as you ingenious correspondent phrase it mr oldfield might still

at the same time think a very good epilogue hold be you mad you damn would confound dog i be to rise and speak the epilogue this divert manner be always practice by mr dryden who if he be not the best writer of tragedy in he time be allow by every one to have the happiest turn for a prologue or a epilogue the epilogue to cleomene don sebastian the duke of guise aurengzebe and love triumphant be all precedent of this nature i might further justify this practice by that excellent epilogue which be speak a few year since after the tragedy of phædra and hippolitus with a great many other in which the author have endeavor have to make the audience merry if they have not all succeed so well as the writer of this they have however shewn that it be not for want of good-will i must further observe that the gaiety of it may be still the more proper as it be at the end of a french play since every one know that nation who be generally esteem have to have as polite a taste as any in europe always close they tragick entertainment with what they call a petite piece which be purposely design have to raise mirth and send away the audience well please the same person who have support the chief character in the tragedy very often play the principal part in the petite piece so that i have my self see at paris oreste and lubin act the same night by the same man tragi-comedy indeed you have you self in a former speculation find fault with very justly because it break the tide of the passion while they be yet flow but this be nothing at all to the present case where they have already have they full course as the new epilogue be write conformable to the practice of we best poet so it be not such a one which as the duke of buckingham say in he rehearsal might serve for any other play but wholly rise out of the occurrence of the piece it be compose for the only reason you mournful correspondent give against this facetious epilogue as he call it be that he have mind to go home melancholy i wish the gentleman may not be more grave than wise for my own part i must confess i think it very sufficient to have the anguish of a fictitious piece remain upon I while it be represent but i love to be send home to bed in a good humor if physibulus be however resolv have to be inconsolable and not to have he tear dry up he need only continue he old custom and when he have have he half crown worth of sorrow slink out before the epilogue begin it be pleasant enough to hear this tragical genius complain of the great mischief andromache have do he : what be that why she make he laugh the poor gentleman 's suffering put I in mind of harlequin case who be tickle to death he tell we soon after thro a small mistake of sorrow for rage that during the whole action he be so very sorry that he think he could have attack would half a score of the fiercest mohock in the excess of he grief i can not but look upon it as a happy accident that a man who be so bloody-minded in he

rate in a old romance i shall readily grant he that he soul as he himself say would have make a very ridiculous figure have it quit the body and descend to the poetical shades in such a encounter as

of the reader than this discourse of we great ancestor as nothing can be more surprize and delightful to we than to hear the sentiment that arise in the first man while he be yet new and fresh from

that he might have a opportunity of expatiate upon it more at large before i enter on this part of the poem i can not but take notice of two shine passage in the dialogue between adam and the angel

torment and loud lament and furious rage adam then proceed to give a account of he condition and sentiment immediately after he creation how agreeably do he represent the posture in which he find himself the beautiful landskip that surround he and the gladness of heart which grow up in he on that occasion -- as new wake from soundest sleep soft on the flowry herb i find I lay in balmy sweat which with he beam the sun soon dry and on the reak moisture fed streight towards heavn my wondring eye i turn would and gaze awhile the ample sky till rai would by quick instinctive motion up i

without the conversation and society of some rational creature who should partake those blessing with he this dialogue which be support chiefly by the beauty of the thought without other poetical

longe antepono hæc est gravium hominum atque magnorum illum quasi assentatorum populus multitudinis levitatem voluptate quasus titillantium tull when we consider the office of humane life there be methinks something in what we ordinarily call generosity which when carefully examine seem to flow rather from a loose and unguarded temper than a honest and liberal mind for this reason it be absolutely necessary that all liberality should have for its basis and support frugality by this mean the beneficent spirit work in a man from the conviction of reason not from the impulse of passion the generous man in the ordinary acceptation without respect to the demand of he own family will soon find upon the foot of he account that he have sacrifice to fool knave flatterer or the deservedly unhappy all the opportunity of afford any future assistance where it ought to be let he therefore reflect that if to bestow be in it self laudable should not a man take care to secure ability to do thing praiseworthy as long as he live or could there be a more cruel piece of raillery upon a man who should have reduc would he fortune below the capacity of act accord to he natural temper than to say of he that gentleman be generous my beloved author therefore have in the sentence on the top of my paper turn he eye with a certain satiety from behold the address to the people by largess and publick entertainment which he assert to be in general vicious and be always to be regulate accord to the circumstance of time and a man 's own fortune a constant benignity in commerce with the rest of the world which ought to run through all a man 's action have effect more useful to those whom you oblige and less ostentatious in you self he turn he recommendation of this virtue in commercial life : and accord to he a citizen who be frank in he kindness and abhor severity in he demand he who in buy selling lending do act of good neighborhood be just and easy he who appear naturally averse to dispute and above the sense of little suffering bear a nobler character and do much more good to mankind than any other man 's fortune without commerce can possibly support for the citizen above all other man have opportunity of arrive at that highest fruit of wealth to be liberal without the least expence of a man 's own fortune it be not to be deny but such a practice be liable to hazard but this therefore add to the obligation that among trader he who oblige be as much concern to keep the favor a secret as he who receive it the unhappy distinction among we in england be so great that to celebrate the intercourse of commercial friendship -lrb- with which i be daily make acquaint -rrb- would be to raise the virtuous man so many enemy of the contrary party i be oblige to conceal all i know of tom the bounteous who lend at the ordinary interest to give man of less fortune opportunity of make greater advantage he conceal under a rough air and distant behavior a bleeding compassion and womanish tenderness this be govern by the most exact circumspection that there be no industry want in the person whom he be to serve and that he be guilty of no improper expence this i know of tom but who dare say it of so know a tory the same care i be force to use some time ago in the report of another virtue and say fifty instead of a hundred because the man i point at be a whig action of this kind be popular without be invidious : for every man of ordinary circumstance look upon a man who have this known benignity in he nature as a person ready to be he friend upon such term as he ought to expect it and the wealthy who may envy such a character can do no injury to its interest but by the imitation of it in which the good citizen will rejoice to be rival i know not how to form to myself a greater idea of humane life than in what be the practice of some wealthy man whom i could name that make no step to the improvement of they own fortune wherein they do not also advance those of other man who would languish in poverty without that munificence in a nation where there be so many publick fund to be support i know not whether he can be call a good subject who do not imbark some part of he fortune with the state to whose vigilance he owe the security of the whole this certainly be a immediate way of lay a obligation upon many and extend he benignity the furthest a man can possibly who be not engage in commerce but he who trade besides give the state some part of this sort of credit he give he banker may in all the occurrence of he life have he eye upon remove want from the door of the industrious and defend the unhappy upright man from bankruptcy without this benignity pride or vengeance will precipitate a man to chuse the receipt of half he demand from one whom he have undo rather than the whole from one to whom he have shewn mercy this benignity be essential to the character of a fair trader and any man who design to enjoy he wealth with honor and self-satisfaction : nay it would not be hard to maintain that the practice of support good and industrious man would carry a man further even to he profit than indulge the propensity of serve and oblige the fortunate my author argue on this subject in order to incline men mind to those who want they most after this manner we must always consider the nature of thing and govern we self accordingly the wealthy man when he have repay you be upon a ballance with you but the person whom you favor would with a loan if he be a good man will think himself in you debt after he have pay you the wealthy and the conspicuous be not oblige by the benefit you do they they think they confer a benefit when they receive one you good office be always suspect and it be with they the same thing to expect they favor as to receive it but the man below you who know in the good you have do he you respect himself more than he circumstance do not act like a obliged man only to he from whom he have receive a benefit but also to all who be capable of do he one and whatever little office he can do for you he be so far from magnify it that he will labor to extenuate it in all he action and expression moreover the regard to what you do to a great man at best be take notice of no further than by himself or he family but what you do to a man of a humble fortune -lrb- provide always that he be a good and a modest man -rrb- raise the affection towards you of all man of that character -lrb- of which there be many -rrb- in the whole city there be nothing gain a reputation to a preacher so much as he own practice i be therefore cast about what act of benignity be in the power of a spectator alas that lie but in a very narrow compass and i think the most immediate under my patronage be either player or such whose circumstance bear a affinity with theirs : all therefore i be able to do at this time of this kind be to tell the town that on Friday the 11th of this instant April there

use to shew at he table and upon lay he head on the block give instance of that good-humour with which he have always entertain he friend in the most ordinary occurrence he death be of a piece with he life there be nothing in it new force or affect he do not look upon the sever of he head from he body as a circumstance that ought to produce any change in the disposition of he mind and as he die

the ipswich man in a speaking-trumpet that he would not take he aboard and that he stay to see he sink the englishman at the same time observe a disorder in the vessel which he rightly judge to proceed from the disdain which the ship crew have of they captain inhumanity : with this hope he go into he boat and approach the enemy he be take in by the sailor in spite of they commander but though they receive he against he command they treat he when he be in the ship in the manner he direct pottiere cause he man to hold goodwin while he beat he with a stick till he faint with loss of

we may call true courage alas it be not so easy a thing to be a brave man as the unthinking part of mankind imagine : to dare be not all that there be in it the privateer we be just now talk of have boldness enough to attack he enemy but not greatness of mind enough to admire the same quality exert by that enemy in defend himself thus he base and little mind be wholly take up in the sordid regard

we may observe that they be build upon very slight foundation homer live near 300 year after the trojan war and as the writing of history be not then in use among the greek we may very well suppose that the tradition of achille and ulyss have bring down but very few particulars to he knowledge though there be no question but he have work into he two poem such of they remarkable adventure as be still talk of among he contemporary the story of æneas on which virgil found he poem be likewise very bare of circumstance and by that mean afford he a opportunity of embellish it with fiction and give a full range to he own invention we find however that he have interweave in the course of he fable the principal particulars which be generally believe among the roman of æneas he voyage and settlement in italy the reader may find a abridgment of the whole story as collect out of the ancient historian and as it be receive among the roman in dionysius halicarnasseus -lrb- 1 -rrb- since none of the critick have consider would virgil 's fable with relation to this history of æneas it may not perhaps be amiss to examine it in this light so far as regard my present purpose whoever look into the abridgment above mention will find that the character of æneas be fill with piety to the god and a superstitious observation of prodigy oracle and prediction virgil have not only preserved this character in the person of æneas but have give a place in he poem to those particular prophecy which he find record of he in history and tradition the poet take the matter of fact as they come down to he and circumstance they after he own manner to make they appear the more natural agreeable or surprizing i believe very many reader have be shock at that ludicrous prophecy which one of the harpye pronounce to the trojan in the third book namely that before they have build they intended city they should be reduce by hunger to eat they very table but when they hear that this be one of the circumstance that have be transmit to the roman in the history of æneas they will think the poet do very well in take notice of it the historian above mention acquaint we a prophetess have foretell æneas that he should take he voyage westward till he companion should eat they table and that accordingly upon he landing in italy as they be eat they flesh upon cake of bread for want of other convenience they afterwards feed on the cake themselves upon which one of the company say merrily we be eat we table they immediately take the hint say the historian and conclude the prophecy to be fulfil as virgil do not think it proper to omit so material a particular in the history of æneas it may be worth while to consider with how much judgment he have qualify it and take off every thing that might have appear improper for a passage in a heroick poem the prophetess who foretell it be a hungry harpy as the person who discover it be young ascanius -lrb- 2 -rrb- heus etiam mensas consumimus inquit inlus such a observation which be beautiful in the mouth of a boy would have be ridiculous from any other of the company i be apt to think that the change of the trojan fleet into water-nymph which be the most violent machine in the whole æneid and have give offence to several critick may be account for the same way virgil himself before he begin that relation premise that what he be go to tell appear incredible but that it be justify by tradition what further confirm I that this change of the fleet be a celebrated circumstance in the history of æneas be that ovid have give place to the same metamorphosis in he account of the heathen mythology none of the critick i have meet with have consider the fable of the æneid in this light and take notice how the tradition on which it be found authorize those part in it which appear the most exceptionable i hope the length of this reflection will not make it unacceptable to the curious part of my reader the history which be the basis of milton 's poem be still shorter than either that of the iliad or æneid the poet have likewise take care to insert every circumstance of it in the body of he fable the ninth book which we be here to consider be raise upon that brief account in scripture wherein we be tell that the serpent be more subtle than any beast of the field that he tempt the woman to eat of the forbid fruit that she be overcome by this temptation and that adam follow she example from these few particulars milton have form one of the most entertaining fable that invention ever produce he have dispose of these several circumstance among so many beautiful and natural fiction of he own that he whole story look only like a comment upon sacred writ or rather seem to be a full and compleat relation of what the other be only a epitome i have insist the longer on this consideration as i look upon the disposition and contrivance of the fable to be the principal beauty of the ninth book which have more story in it and be fuller of incident than any other in the whole poem satan 's traverse the globe and still keep within the shadow of the night as fear to be discover by the angel of the sun who have before detect he be one of those beautiful imagination with which he introduce this he second series of adventure have examine the nature of every creature and find out one which be the most proper for he purpose he again return to paradise and to avoid discovery sink by night with a river that run under the garden and rise up again through a fountain that -lrb- issue -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- from it by the tree of life the poet who as we have before take notice speak as little as possible in he own person and after the example of homer fill every part of he work with manners and character introduce a soliloquy of this infernal agent who be thus restless in the destruction of man he be then describ would as glide through the garden under the resemblance of a mist in order to find out that creature in which he design would to tempt we first parent this description have something in it very poetical and surprize so say through each thicket dank or dry like a black mist low creep he hold on he midnight search where soonest he might find the serpent : he fast sleep soon he find in labyrinth of many a round self-roll would he head the midst well stor would with subtle wiles the author afterwards give we a description of the morning which be wonderfully suitable to a divine poem and peculiar to that first season of nature : he represent the earth before it be curse as a great altar breathing out its incense from all part and send up a pleasant savor to the nostril of its creator to which he add a noble idea of adam and eve as offer they morning worship and fill up the universal consort of praise and adoration now when as sacred light begin to dawn in eden on the humid flower that breathe they morning incense when all thing that breathe from th ' earth 's great altar send up silent praise to the creator and he nostril fill with grateful smell forth come the human pair and join would they vocal worship to the choir of creature want voice -- the dispute which follow between we two first parent be represent with great art : it -lrb- proceeds -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- from a difference of judgment not of passion and be manage with reason not with heat : it be such a dispute as we may suppose might have happen in paradise have man continue happy and innocent there be a great delicacy in the morality which be intersperse in adam discourse and which the most ordinary reader can not but take notice of that force of love which the father of mankind so finely describe in the eighth book and which be insert in my last saturday paper shew it self here in many fine instance : as in those fond regard he cast towards eve at she parting from he she long with ardent look he eye pursue delighted but desire more she stay : oft he to she he charge of quick return repeat she to he as oft engage to be return would by noon amid the bower in he impatience and amusement during she absence -- adam the while wait desirous she return have wove of choicest flower a garland to adorn she tress and she rural labor crown : as reaper oft be wont they harvest queen great joy he promise to he thought and new solace in she return so long delay would but particularly in that passionate speech where see she irrecoverably lose he resolve to perish with she rather than to live without she -- some cursed fraud or enemy have beguil would thee yet unknown and I with thee have ruin would for with thee certain my resolution be to die how can i live without thee how forego thy sweet converse and love so dearly join would to live again in these wild wood forlorn should god create another eve and i another rib afford yet loss of thee would never from my heart no no i feel the link of nature draw I : flesh of flesh bone of my bone thou art and from thy state mine never shall be part bliss or woe the beginning of this speech and the preparation to it be animated with the same spirit as the conclusion which i have here quote the several wiles which be put in practice by the tempter when he find eve separate from she husband the many please image of nature which be intermix would in this part of the story with its gradual and regular progress to the fatal catastrophe be so very remarkable that it would be superfluous to point out they respective beauty i have avoid mention any particular similitude in my remark on this great work because i have give a general account of they in my paper on the first book there be one however in this part of the poem which i shall here quote as it be not only very beautiful but the closest of any in the whole poem i mean that where the serpent be describ as roll forward in all he pride animated by the evil spirit and conduct eve to she destruction while adam be at too great a distance from she to give she he assistance these several particulars be all of they work into the follow similitude -- hope elevate and joy brighten he crest as when a wander fire compact of unctuous vapor which the night condense and the cold inviron round kindle through agitation to a flame -lrb- which oft they say some evil spirit attend -rrb- hover and blaze with delusive light mislead th ' amaz would night-wanderer from he way to bog and mire and oft through pond or pool there swallow up and lose from succor far that secret intoxication of pleasure with all those transient flushing of guilt and joy which the poet represent in we first parent upon they eat the forbid fruit to -lrb- those -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- flagging of spirit damp of sorrow and mutual accusation which succeed it be conceiv would with a wonderful imagination and describe in very natural sentiment when dido in the fourth æneid yield to that fatal temptation which ruin she virgil tell we the earth tremble the heaven be fill with flash of lightning and the nymph howl upon the mountain-top milton in the same poetical spirit have describe all nature as disturb upon eve eat the forbid fruit so say she rash hand in evil hour forth reach to the fruit she pluckt she eat : earth feel the wound and nature from she seat sigh through all she work give sign of woe that all be lose -- upon adam fall into the same guilt the whole creation appear a second time in convulsion -- he scruple not to eat against he better knowledge not deceiv 's but fondly overcome with female charm earth tremble from she entrails as again in pang and nature give a second groan sky lowr and mutter thunder some sad drop weep at compleating of the mortal sin -- as all nature suffer would by the guilt of we first parent these symptom of trouble and consternation be wonderfully imagine not only as prodigy but as mark of she sympathizing in the fall of man adam converse with eve after have eat the forbid fruit be a exact copy of that between jupiter and juno in the fourteenth iliad juno there approach jupiter with the girdle which she have receive from venus upon which he tell she that she appear more charming and desirable than she -lrb- 6 -rrb- do before even when they love be at the highest the poet afterwards describe they as repose on a summet of mount ida which produce under they a bed of flower the loto the crocus and the hyacinth and conclude he description with they fall asleep let the reader compare this with the following passage in milton which begin with adam speech to eve for never do thy beauty since the day i see thee first and wed thee adorn would with all perfection so enflame my sense with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now than ever bounty of this virtuous tree so say he and forbear not glance or toy of

complain to I yesterday that the conversation of the town be so altered of late year that a fine gentleman be at a loss for matter to start discourse as well as unable to fall in with the talk he generally meet with will take notice that there be now a evil under the sun which he suppose to be entirely new because not mention by any satyrist or moralist in any age : man say he grow knave sooner than they ever do since the creation of the world before if you read the tragedy of the last age you find the artful man and person of intrigue be advanced very far in year and beyond the pleasure and sally of youth but now will observe that the young have take in the vice of the aged and you shall have a man of five and twenty crafty false and intriguing not ashamed to over-reach cozen and beguile my friend add that till about the latter end of king charle 's reign there be not a rascal of any eminence under forty : in the place of resort for conversation you now hear nothing but what relate to the improve men fortune without regard to the method toward it this be so fashionable that young man form themselves upon a certain neglect of every thing that be candid simple and worthy of true esteem and affect be yet worse than they be by acknowledge in they general turn of mind and discourse that they have not any remain value for true honor and honesty prefer the capacity of be artful to gain they end to the merit of despise those end when they come in competition with they honesty all this be due to the very silly pride that generally prevail of be value for the ability of carry they point in a word from the opinion that shallow and inexperienced people entertain of the short-liv would force of cunning but i shall before i enter upon the various face which folly cover would with artifice put on to impose upon the unthinking produce a great authority -lrb- 1 -rrb- for assert that nothing but truth and ingenuity have any lasting good effect even upon a man 's fortune and interest truth and reality have all the advantage of appearance and many more if the shew of any thing be good for any thing i be sure sincerity be better : for why do any man dissemble or seem to be that which he be not but because he think it good to have such a quality as he pretend to for to counterfeit and dissemble be to put on the appearance of some real excellency now the best way in the world for a man to seem to be any thing be really to be what he would seem to be besides that it be many time as troublesome to make good the pretence of a good quality as to have it and if a man have it not it be ten to one but he be discover would to want it and then all he pain and labor to seem to have it be lose there be something unnatural in painting which a skillful eye will easily discern from native beauty and complexion it be hard to personate and act a part long for where truth be not at the bottom nature will always be endeavor to return and will peep out and betray she self one time or other therefore if any man think it convenient to seem good let he be so indeed and then he goodness will appear to every body 's satisfaction so that upon all account sincerity be true wisdom particularly as to the affair of this world integrity have many advantage over all the fine and artificial way of dissimulation and deceit it be much the plainer and easier much the safer and more secure way of deal in the world it have less of trouble and difficulty of entanglement and perplexity of danger and hazard in it it be the shortest and nearest way to we end carry we thither in a straight line and will hold out and last longest the art of deceit and cunning do continually grow weaker and less effectual and serviceable to they that use they whereas integrity gain strength by use and the more and longer any man practiseth it the greater service it do he by confirm he reputation and encourage those with whom he have to do to repose the greatest trust and confidence in he which be a unspeakable advantage in the business and affair of life truth be always consistent with it self and need nothing to help it out it be always near at hand and sit upon we lip and be ready to drop out before we be aware : whereas a lye be troublesome and set a man 's invention upon the rack and one trick need a great many more to make it good it be like build upon a false foundation which continually stand in need of prop to shoar it up and prove at last more chargeable than to have raise a substantial building at first upon a true and solid foundation for sincerity be firm and substantial and there be nothing hollow and unsound in it and because it be plain and open fear no discovery of which the crafty man be always in danger and when he think he walk in the dark all he pretence be so transparent that he that run may read they he be the last man that find himself to be find out and whilst he take it for grant that he make fool of other he render himself ridiculous add to all this that sincerity be the most compendious wisdom and a excellent instrument for the speedy dispatch of business it create confidence in those we have to deal with save the labor of many enquiry and bring thing to a issue in few word : it be like travel in a plain beaten road which commonly bring a man sooner to he journey end than by-way in which man often lose themselves in a word whatsoever convenience may be think to be in falshood and dissimulation it be soon over but the inconvenience of it be perpetual because it bring a man under a everlasting jealousie and suspicion so that he be not believe when he speak truth nor trust when perhaps he mean honestly when a man have once forfeit the reputation of he integrity he be set fast and nothing will then serve he turn neither truth nor falshood and i have often think that god have in he great wisdom hide from man of false and dishonest mind the wonderful advantage of truth and integrity to the prosperity even of we worldly affair these man be so blind by they covetousness and ambition that they can not look beyond a present advantage nor forbear to seize upon it tho by way never so indirect they can not see so far as to the remote consequence of a steady integrity and the vast benefit and advantage which it will bring a man at last be but this sort of man wise and clear-sighted enough to discern this they would be honest out of very knavery not out of any love to honesty and virtue but with a crafty design to promote and advance more effectually they own interest and therefore the justice of the divine providence have hide this truest point of wisdom from they eye that bad man might not be upon equal term with the just and upright and serve they own wicked design by honest and lawful means indeed if a man be only to deal in the world for a day and should never have occasion to converse more with mankind never more need they good opinion or good word it be then no great matter -lrb- speaking as to the concernment of this world -rrb- if a man spend he reputation all at once and venture it at one throw : but if he be to continue in the world and would have the advantage of conversation whilst he be in it let he make use of truth and sincerity in all he word and action for nothing but this will last and hold out to the end all other art will fail but truth and integrity will carry a man through and bear he out to the last t -lrb- footnote 1 : archbishop tilotson 's sermon vol ii sermon i -lrb- folio edition -rrb- italics in first issue -rrb- \* \* \* \*

sir i take the liberty to send you a fourth letter upon the education of youth : in my last i give you my thought about some particular task which i conceiv would it might not be amiss to use with they usual exercise in order to give they a early seasoning of virtue i shall in this propose some other which i fancy might contribute to give they a right turn for the world and enable they to make they way in it the design of learning be as i take it either to render a man a agreeable companion to himself and teach he to support solitude with pleasure or if he be not bear to a estate to supply that defect and furnish he with the means of acquire one a person who apply himself to learn with the first of these view may be say to study for ornament as he who propose to himself the second properly study for use the one do it to raise himself a fortune the other to set off that which he be already possess of but as far the greater part of mankind be include in the latter class i shall only propose some method at present for the service of such who expect to advance themselves in the world by they learning : in order to which i shall premise that many more estate have be acquir 'd by little accomplishment than by extraordinary one those quality which make the greatest figure in the eye of the world not be always the most useful in themselves or the most advantageous to they owner the post which require man of shine and uncommon part to discharge they be so very few that many a great genius go out of the world without ever have have a opportunity to exert it self whereas person of ordinary endowment meet with occasion fit to they part and capacity every day in the common occurrence of life i be acquaint with two person who be formerly school-fellow -lrb- 1 -rrb- and have be good friend ever since one of they be not only think a impenetrable block-head at school but still maintain would he reputation at the university the other be the pride of he master and the most celebrated person in the college of which he be a member the man of genius be at present bury in a country parsonage of eightscore pound a year while the other with the bare ability of a common scrivener have get a estate of above a hundred thousand pound i fancy from what i have say it will almost appear a doubtful case to many a wealthy citizen whether or no he ought to wish he son should be a great genius but this i be sure of that nothing be more absurd than to give a lad the education of one whom nature have not favor would with any particular mark of distinction the fault therefore of we grammar-school be that every boy be push on to work of genius whereas it would be far more advantageous for the greatest part of they to be teach such little practical art and science as do not require any great share of part to be master of they and yet may come often into play during the course of a man 's life such be all the part of practical geometry i have know a man contract a friendship with a minister of state upon cut a dial in he window and remember a clergyman who get one of the best benefice in the west of england by set a country gentleman 's affair in some method and give he a exact survey of he estate while i be upon this subject i can not forbear mention a particular which be of use in every station of life and which methink every master should teach he scholar i mean the writing of english letter to this end instead of perplexing they with latin epistle theme and verse there might be a punctual correspondence establish between two boy who might act in any imaginary part of business or be allow would sometimes to give a range to they own fancy and communicate to each other whatever trifle they think fit provide neither of they ever fail would at the appoint time to answer he correspondent letter i believe i may venture to affirm that the generality of boy would find themselves more advantaged by this custom when they come to be man than by all the greek and latin they master can teach they in seven or eight year the want of it be very visible in many learn person who while they be admire the style of demosthene or cicero want phrase to express themselves on the most common occasion i have see a letter from one of these latin orator which would have be deservedly laugh would at by a common attorney under this head of write i can not omit account and short-hand which be learn with little pain and very properly come into the number of such art as i have be here recommend you must doubtless sir observe that i have hitherto chiefly insist upon these thing for such boy as do not appear to have any thing extraordinary in they natural talent and consequently be not qualify for the finer part of learn yet i believe i might carry this matter still further and venture to assert that a lad of genius have sometimes occasion for these little acquirement to be as it be the forerunner of he part and to introduce -lrb- he -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- into the world history be full of example of person who tho they have have the largest ability have be oblige to insinuate themselves into the favor of great man by these trivial accomplishment as the compleat gentleman in some of we modern comedy make he first advance to he mistress under the disguise of a painter or a dancing-master the difference be that in a lad of genius these be only so many accomplishment which in another be essential the one divert himself with they the other work at they in short i look upon a great genius with these little addition in the same light as i regard the grand signior who be oblige by a express command in the alcoran to learn and practice some handycraft trade tho i need not have go for my instance farther than germany where several emperor have voluntarily do the same thing leopold the last -lrb- 3 -rrb- work in wood and i have hear there be several handycraft work of he make to be see at vienna so neatly turn that the best joiner in europe might safely own they without any disgrace to he profession i would not be think by any thing i have say to be against improve a boy genius to the utmost pitch it can be carry

greater variety of person in it than any other in the whole poem the author upon the wind up of he action introduce all those who have any concern in it and shew with great beauty the influence which it have upon each of they it be like the last act of a well-written tragedy in which all who have a part in it be generally draw up before the audience and represent under those circumstance in which the determination of the action place they i shall therefore consider this book under four head in relation to the celestial the infernal the human and the imaginary person who have they respective part allot in it to begin with the celestial person : the guardian angel of paradise be describe as return to heaven upon the fall of man in order to approve they vigilance they arrival they manner of reception with the sorrow which appear would in themselves and in those spirit who be say to rejoice at the conversion of a sinner be very finely lay together in the follow line up into heaven from paradise in haste th ' angelick guard ascend mute and sad for man for of he state by this they know : much wonder how the subtle fiend have stoln entrance unseen soon as th ' unwelcome news from earth arriv would at heaven-gate displeased all be who hear : dim sadness do not spare that time celestial visage yet mixt with pity violate not they bliss about the new-arriv would in multitude th ' ethereal people run to hear and know how all befel : they tow ` rd the throne supreme accountable make haste to make appear with righteous plea they utmost vigilance and easily approve when the most high eternal father from he secret cloud amidst in thunder utter would thus he voice the same divine person who in the foregoing part of this poem intercede for we first parent before they fall overthrow the rebel angel and create the world be now represent as descend to paradise and pronounce sentence upon the three offender the cool of the evening be a circumstance with which holy writ introduce this great scene it be poetically describe by we author who have also keep religiously to the form of word in which the three several sentence be pass upon adam eve and the serpent he have rather choose to neglect the numerousness of he verse than to deviate from those speech which be record on this great occasion the guilt and confusion of we first parent stand naked before they judge be touch with great beauty upon the arrival of sin and death into the work of the creation the almighty be again introduce as speak to he angel that surround he see with what heat these dog of hell advance to waste and havock yonder world which i so fair and good create & c the following passage be form upon that glorious image in holy writ which compare the voice of a innumerable host of angel utter hallelujah to the voice of mighty thundering or of many water he end and the heavenly audience loud sing hallelujah as the sound of sea through multitude that sing : just be thy way righteous be thy decree in all thy work who can extenuate thee -- tho the author in the whole course of he poem and particularly in the book we be now examine have infinite allusion to place of scripture i have only take notice in my remark of such as be of a poetical nature and which be weave with great beauty into the body of this fable of this kind be that passage in the present book where describe sin and death as march thro the work of nature he add -- behind she death close follow pace for pace not mount yet on he pale horse -- which allude to that passage in scripture so wonderfully poetical and terrifying to the imagination and i look would and behold a pale horse and he name that sit on he be death and hell follow with he : and power be give unto they over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with sickness and with the beast of the earth -lrb- 1 -rrb- under this first head of celestial person we must likewise take notice of the command which the angel receiv would to produce the several change in nature and sully the beauty of the creation accordingly they be represent as infect the star and planet with malignant influence weakn the light of the sun bring down the winter into the milder region of nature plant wind and storm in several quarter of the sky store the cloud with thunder and in short pervert the whole frame of the universe to the condition of its criminal inhabitant as this be a noble incident in the poem the follow line in which we see the angel heave up the earth and place it in a different posture to the sun from what it have before the fall of man be conceive with that sublime imagination which be so peculiar to this great author some say he bid he angel turn ascanse the pole of earth twice ten degree and more from the sun axle they with labor push would oblique the centrick globe -- we be in the second place to consider the infernal agent under the view which milton have give we of they in this book it be observe by those who would set forth the greatness of virgil 's plan that he conduct he reader thro all the part of the earth which be discover would in he time asia africk and europe be the several scene of he fable the plan of milton 's poem be of a infinitely greater extent and fill the mind with many more astonishing circumstance satan have surround the earth seven time depart at length from paradise we then see he steer he course among the constellation and after have traverse the whole creation pursue he voyage thro the chaos and entr into he own infernal dominion he first appearance in the assembly of fall angel be work would up with circumstance which give a delightful surprize to the reader but there be no incident in the whole poem which do this more than the transformation of the whole audience that follow the account they leader give they of he expedition the gradual change of satan himself be describ would after ovid 's manner and may vie with any of those celebrated transformation which be look would upon as the most beautiful part in that poet work milton never fail of improve he own hint and bestow the last finishing touch to every incident which be admit into he poem the unexpected hiss which rise in this episode the dimension and bulk of satan so much superior to those of the infernal spirit who lay under the same transformation with the annual change which they be suppose to suffer be instance of this kind the beauty of the diction be very remarkable in this whole episode as i have observe in the sixth paper of these remark the great judgment with which it be contrived the part of adam and eve or the human person come next under we consideration milton 's art be no where more shewn than in he conduct the part of these we first parent the representation he give of they without falsify the story be wonderfully contriv have to influence the reader with pity and compassion towards they tho adam involve the whole species in misery he crime proceed from a weakness which every man be incline to pardon and commiserate as it seem rather the frailty of human nature than of the person who offend every one be apt to excuse a fault which he himself might have fall into it be the excess of love for eve that ruin would adam and he posterity i need not add that the author be justify would in this particular by many of the father and the most orthodox writer milton have by this mean fill a great part of he poem with that kind of write which the french critick call the tender and which be in a particular manner engage to all sort of reader adam and eve in the book we be now consider be likewise draw with such sentiment as do not only interest the reader in they affliction but raise in he the most melting passion of humanity and commiseration when adam see the several change in nature produce about he he appear in a disorder of mind suitable to one who have forfeit both he innocence and he happiness he be fill with horror remorse despair in the anguish of he heart he expostulate with he creator for have give he a unasked existence do i request thee maker from my clay to mould I man do i sollicite thee from darkness to promote I or here place in this delicious garden as my will concurr would not to my be twere but right and equal to reduce I to my dust desirous to resign and render back all i receive -- he immediately after recover from he presumption own he doom to be just and beg that the death which be threatn he may be inflict on he -- why delay he hand to execute what he decree fix would on this day why do i overlive why be i mock would with death and lengthen out to deathless pain how gladly would i meet mortality my sentence and be earth insensible how glad would lay I down as in my mother lap there should i rest and sleep secure he dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ear : no fear of worse to I and to my offspring would torment I with cruel expectation -- this whole speech be full of the like emotion and vary with all those sentiment which we may suppose natural to a mind so broken and disturb would i must not omit that generous concern which we first father shew in it for he posterity and which be so proper to affect the reader -- hide I from the face of god whom to behold be then my heighth of happiness yet well if here would end the misery i deserve it and would bear my own deserving : but this will not serve all that i eat or drink or shall beget be propagate curse o voice once hear delightfully increase and multiply now death to hear -- -- in I all posterity stand curst fair patrimony that i must leave ye son o be i able to waste it all my self and leave you none so disinherited how would you bless I now you curse ah why should all mankind for one man 's fault thus guiltless be condemn would if guiltless but from I what can proceed but all corrupt -- who can afterwards behold the father of mankind extend upon the earth utter he midnight complaint bewail he existence and wish for death without sympathize with he in he distress thus adam to himself lament loud thro the still night not now -lrb- as ere man fall -rrb- wholesome and cool and mild but with black air accompany with damp and dreadful gloom which to he evil conscience represent all thing with double terror on the ground outstretch he lay on the cold ground and oft cur have he creation death as oft accusd of tardy execution -- the part of eve in this book be no less passionate and apt to sway the reader in she favor she be represent with great tenderness as approach adam but be spurn d from he with a spirit of upbraid and indignation conformable to the nature of man whose passion have now gain the dominion over he the follow passage wherein she be describe as renew she address to he with the whole speech that follow it have something in they exquisitely move and pathetick he add not and from she turn : but eve not so repulst with tear that cea would not flow and tress all disorderd at he foot fall humble and embrace they besought he peace and thus proceed in she plaint forsake I not thus adam witness heav 'n what love sincere and reverence in my heart i bear thee and unweeting have offend unhappily deceive thy suppliant i beg and clasp thy knee bereave I not -lrb- whereon i live -rrb- thy gentle look thy aid thy counsel in this uttermost distress my only strength and stay forlorn of thee whither shall i betake I where subsist while yet we live -lrb- scarce one short hour perhaps -rrb- between we two let there be peace & c adam reconcilement to she be workd up in the same spirit of tenderness eve afterwards propose to she husband in the blindness of she despair that to prevent they guilt from descend upon posterity they should resolve to live childless or if that could not be do they should seek they own death by violent method as those sentiment naturally engage the reader to regard the mother of mankind with more than ordinary commiseration they likewise contain a very fine moral the resolution of die to end we misery do not shew such a degree of magnanimity as a resolution to bear they and submit to the dispensation of providence we author have therefore with great delicacy represent eve as entertaining this thought and adam as disapprove it we be in the last place to consider the imaginary person or -lrb- death and sin -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- who act a large part in this book such beautiful extended allegory be certainly some of the finest composition of genius : but as i have before observe be not agreeable to the nature of a heroick poem this of sin and death be very exquisite in its kind if not consider as a part of such a work the truth contain in it be so clear and open that i shall not lose time in explain they but shall only observe that a reader who know the strength of the english tongue will be amaze to think how the poet could find such apt word and phrase to describe the action -lrb- s -rrb- of those two imaginary person and particularly in that part where death be exhibit as form a bridge over the chaos a work suitable to the genius of milton since the subject i be upon give I a opportunity of speak more at large of such shadowy and imaginary person as may be introduce into heroick poem i shall beg leave to explain my self in a matter which be curious in its kind and which none of the critick have treat of it be certain homer and virgil be full of imaginary person who be very beautiful in poetry when they be just shewn without be engage in any series of action homer indeed represent sleep as a person and ascribe a short part to he in he iliad -lrb- 4 -rrb- but we must consider that tho we now regard such a person as entirely shadowy and unsubstantial the heathen make statue of he place he in they temple and look upon he as a real deity when homer make use of other such allegorical person it be only in short expression which convey a ordinary thought to the mind in the most please manner and may rather be look upon as poetical phrase than allegorical description instead of tell we that man naturally fly when they be terrify he introduce the person of flight and fear who he tell we be inseparable companion instead of say that the time be come when apollo ought to have receive he recompence he tell we that the hour bring he he reward instead of describe the effect which minerva ægis produce in battel he tell we that the brim of it be encompass by terror rout discord fury pursuit massacre and death in the same figure of speak he represent victory as follow diomede discord as the mother of funeral and mourning venus as dress by the grace bellona as wear terror and consternation like a garment i might give several other instance out of homer as well as a great many out of virgil milton have likewise very often make use of the same way of speak as where he tell we that victory sit on the right hand of the messiah when he march forth against the rebel angel that at the rising of the sun the hour unbarrd the gate of light that discord be the daughter of sin of the same nature be those expression where describe the singing of the nightingale he add silence be pleased and upon the messiah bidding peace to the chaos confusion hear he voice i might add innumerable instance of we poet write in this beautiful figure it be plain that these i have mention in which person of a imaginary nature be introduce be such short allegory as be not design to be take in the literal sense but only to convey particular circumstance to the reader after a unusual and entertaining manner but when such person be introduce as principal actor and engage in a series of adventure they take too much upon they and be by no means proper for a heroick poem which ought to appear credible in its principal part i can not forbear therefore think that sin and death be as improper agent in a work of this nature as strength and necessity in one of the tragedy of eschylus who represent those two person nail down prometheus to a rock -lrb- 5 -rrb- for which he have be justly censure by the greatest critick i do not know any imaginary person make use of in a more sublime manner of thinking than that in one of the prophet who describe god as descend from heaven and visit the sin of mankind add that dreadful circumstance before he go the pestilence -lrb- 6 -rrb- it be certain this imaginary person might have be describe in all she purple spot the fever might have march before she pain might have stand at she right hand phrenzy on she left and death in she rear she might have be introduce as glide down from the tail of a comet or dart upon the earth in a flash of lightning : she might have taint the atmosphere with she breath the very glaring of she eye might have scatter infection but i believe every reader will think that in such sublime writings the mention of she as it be do in scripture have something in it more just as well as great than all that the most fanciful poet could have bestow upon she in the richness of he imagination l -lrb- footnote 1 : reddere personæ scit convenientium cuique hor -rrb- -lrb- footnote

play call the humorous lieutenant -lrb- 1 -rrb- upon the rising of the curtain i be very much surprize with the great consort of cat-call which be exhibit that evening and begin to think with myself that i have make a mistake and go to a musick-meeting instead of the play-house it appear indeed a little odd to I to see so many person of quality of both sex assemble together at a kind of catterwawling for i can not look upon that performance to have be any thing better whatever the musician themselves might think of it as i have no acquaintance in the house to ask question of and be force to go out of town early the next morning i could not learn the secret of this matter what i would therefore desire of you be to give some account of this strange instrument which i find the company call a cat-call and particularly to let I know whether it be a piece of musick lately come from italy for my own part to be free with you i would rather hear a english fiddle though i durst not shew my dislike whilst i be in the play-house it be my chance to sit the very next man to one of the performer i be sir you most affectionate friend and servant john shallow esq in compliance with esquire shallows request i design this paper as a dissertation upon the cat-call in order to make myself a master of the subject i purchase one the beginning of last week though not without great difficulty be informd at two or three toyshop that the player have lately buy they all up i have since consult many learn antiquary in relation to its original and find they very much divide among themselves upon that particular a fellow of the royal society who be my good friend and a great proficient in the mathematical part of musick conclude from the simplicity of its make and the uniformity of its sound that the cat-call be older than any of the invention of jubal he observe very well that musical instrument take they first rise from the note of bird and other melodious animal and what say he be more natural than for the first age of mankind to imitate the voice of a cat that live under the same roof with they he add that the cat have contribute more to harmony than any other animal as we be not only beholden to she for this wind-instrument but for we string musick in general another virtuoso of my acquaintance will not allow the cat-call to be older than thespi and be apt to think it appear in the world soon after the antient comedy for which reason it have still a place in we dramatick entertainment : nor must i here omit what a very curious gentleman who be lately return from he travels have more than once assure I namely that there be lately dig up at rome the statue of momus who hold a instrument in he right-hand very much resemble we modern cat-call there be other who ascribe this invention to orpheus and look upon the cat-call to be one of those instrument which that famous musician make use of to draw the beast about he it be certain that the roasting of a cat do not call together a greater audience of that species than this instrument if dexterously play upon in proper time and place but notwithstanding these various and learn conjecture i can not forbear think that the cat-call be originally a piece of english musick its resemblance to the voice of some of we british songster as well as the use of it which be peculiar to we nation confirm I in this opinion it have at least receive great improvement among we whether we consider the instrument it self or those several quaver and grace which be throw into the playing of it every one might be sensible of this who hear that remarkable overgrown cat-call which be place in the center of the pit and preside over all the rest at -lrb- the -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- celebrated performance lately exhibit in drury-lane have say thus much concern the original of the cat-call we be in the next place to consider the use of it the cat-call exert it self to most advantage in the british theater : it very much improve the sound of nonsense and often go along with the voice of the actor who pronounce it as the violin or harpsichord accompany the italian recitativo it have often supply the place of the antient chorus in the work of mr -- in short a bad poet have as great a antipathy to a cat-call as many people have to a real cat mr collier in he ingenious essay upon musick -lrb- 3

shake the nerve and curdle the blood and inspire despair and cowardice and consternation at a surprizing rate ti probable the roaring of lion the warbling of cat and scritch-owl together with a mixture of the howling of dog judiciously imitate and compound might go a great way in this invention whether such anti-musick as this might not be of service in a camp i shall leave to the military man to consider what this learn gentleman suppose in speculation i have know actually verify in practice the cat-call have strike a damp into general and frighted hero off the stage at the first sound of it i have see a crown head tremble and a princess fall into fit the humorous lieutenant himself could not stand it nay i be tell that even almanzor look like a mouse and tremble at the voice of this terrifying instrument as it be of a dramatick nature and peculiarly appropriate to the stage i can by no means approve the thought of that angry lover who after a unsuccessful pursuit of some year take leave of he mistress in a serenade of cat-call i must conclude this paper with the account i have lately receive of a ingenious artist who have long study this instrument and be very well verse in all the rule of the drama he teach to play on it by book and to express by it the whole art of criticism he have he base and he treble cat-call the former for tragedy the latter for comedy only in tragy-comedy they may both play together in consort he have a particular squeak to denote the violation of each of the unity and have different sound to shew whether he aim at the poet or the player in short he teach the smut-note the fustian-note the stupid-note and have compose a kind of air that may serve as a act-tune to a incorrigible play and which take in the whole compass of the

prayer and hope to a perfect and compleat repentance at the end of the tenth book they be represent as prostrate themselves upon the ground and water the earth with they tear : to which the poet join this beautiful circumstance that they offerd up they penitential prayer on the very place where they judge appear to they when he pronounce they sentence -- they forthwith to the place repair where he judg would they prostrate fall before he reverent and both confess would humbly they fault and pardon begg would with tear water the ground -- -lrb- there be a beauty of the same kind in a tragedy of

passage in holy writ : and another angel come and stand at the altar have a golden censer and there be give unto he much incense that he should offer it with the prayer of all saint upon the golden altar which be before the throne : and the smoak of the incense which come with the prayer of the saint ascend up before god -- to heavn they prayer fly up nor miss would the way by envious wind blow

have the same thought express a second time in the intercession of the messiah which be conceive in very emphatick sentiment and expression among the poetical part of scripture which milton have so finely work into this part of he narration i must not omit that wherein ezekiel speaking of the angel who appear to he in a vision add that every one have four face and that they whole body and they back and they hand and they wing be full of eye round about -- the cohort bright of watchful cherubim four face each have like a double janus all they shape spangle with eye -- the assemble of all the

which be always agreeable in poetry but as it express that enmity which be now produce in the animal creation the poet to shew the like change in nature as well as to grace he fable with a noble prodigy represent the sun in a eclipse this particular incident have likewise a fine effect upon the imagination of the reader in regard to what follow for at the same time that the sun be under a eclipse a bright cloud descend in the western quarter of the heaven fill with a host of angel and more luminous than the sun it self the whole theater of nature be darkn that this glorious machine may

descend with something heavnly fraught he err would not for by this the heavenly band down from a sky of jasper light now in paradise and on a hill make halt a glorious apparition -- i need not observe how properly this author who always suit he part to the actor whom he introduce have employ michael in the expulsion of we first parent from paradise the archangel on this occasion neither appear in he proper shape nor in that familiar manner with which raphael the sociable spirit entertain the father of mankind before the fall he person he port and behavior be suitable to a spirit of the highest rank and exquisitely describd in the following passage -- th ' archangel soon draw nigh not in he shape celestial but as man clothe to meet man : over he lucid arm a military vest of

a lower world to this obscure and wild how shall we breathe in other air less pure accustomd to immortal fruit adam 's speech abound with thought which be equally move but of a more masculine and elevated turn nothing can be conceive more sublime and poetical than the following passage in it this most afflict I that depart hence as from he face i shall be hide deprive he bless countnance : here i could frequent with worship place by place where he vouchsaf would presence divine and to my son relate on this mount he appear would under this tree stand visible among these pine he voice i

now gladly behold though but he utmost skirt of glory and far off he step adore the angel afterwards lead adam to the highest mount of paradise and lay before he a whole hemisphere as a proper stage for those vision which be to be represent on it i have before observe how the plan of milton 's poem be in many particulars greater than that of the iliad or æneid virgil 's hero in the last of these poem be entertain with a sight of all those who be to descend from he but though that episode be justly admire as one of the noblest design in the whole æneid every one-must allow that this of milton be of a much higher nature adam 's vision be not confine to any particular tribe of mankind but extend to the whole species in this great review which adam take of all he son and daughter the first object he be present with exhibit to he the story of cain and abel which be draw together with much closeness and propriety of expression that curiosity and natural horror which arise in adam at the sight of the first die man be touch with great beauty but have i now see death be this the way i must return to native dust o sight of terror foul and ugly to behold horrid to think how horrible to feel the second vision set before he the image of death in a great variety of appearance the angel to give he a general idea of those effect which he guilt have bring upon he posterity place before he a large hospital or lazar-house fill with person lie under all kind of mortal disease how finely have the poet tell we that the sick person languish under linger and incurable distemper by a apt and judicious use of such imaginary being as those i mention in my last Saturday 's paper dire be the toss deep the groan despair tend the sick busy from couch to couch and over they triumphant death he dart shake but delay to strike though oft invoke with vow as they chief good and final hope the passion which likewise rise in adam on this occasion be very natural sight so deform what heart of rock could long dry-eyed behold adam could not but weep tho ' not of woman bear compassion quell would he best of man and give he up to tear the discourse between the angel and adam which follow abound with noble moral as there be nothing more delightful in poetry than a contrast and opposition of incident the author after this melancholy prospect of death and sickness raise up a scene of mirth love and jollity the secret pleasure that steal into adam heart as he be intent upon this vision be imagine with great delicacy i must not omit the description of the loose female troop who seduce the son of god as they be call in scripture for that fair female troop thou sawst that seem of goddess so blithe so smooth so gay yet empty of all good wherein consist woman 's domestick honor and chief praise breed only and compleat to the taste of lustful appetence to sing to dance to dress and troule the tongue and roll the eye : to these that sober race of man whose life religious title they the son of god shall yield up all they virtue all they fame ignobly to the train and to the smile of those fair atheist -- the next vision be of a quite contrary nature and fill with the horror of war adam at the sight of it melt into tear and break out in that passionate speech -- o what be these death 's minister not man who thus deal death inhumanly to man and multiply ten thousandfold the sin of he who slew he brother : for of whom such massacre make they but of they brethren man of man milton to keep up a agreeable variety in he vision after have raise in the mind of he reader the several idea of terror which be conformable to the description of war pass on to those softer image of triumph and festival in that vision of lewdness and luxury which usher in the flood as it be visible that the poet have he eye upon ovid 's account of the universal deluge the reader may observe with how much judgment he have avoid every thing that be redundant or puerile in the latin poet we do not here see the wolf swimming among the sheep nor any of those wanton imagination which seneca find fault with -lrb- 1 -rrb- as unbecoming -lrb- the -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- great catastrophe of nature if we poet have imitate that verse in which ovid tell we that there be nothing but sea and that this sea have no shore to it he have not set the thought in such a light as to incur the censure which critick have pass upon it the latter part of that verse in ovid be idle and superfluous but just and beautiful in milton ` jamque mare et tellus nullum discriman habebant nil nisus pontus erat deerant quoque littora ponto ' -lrb- ovid -rrb- ' -- sea cover would sea sea without shore -- ' -lrb- milton -rrb- in milton the former part of the description do not forestall the latter how much more great and solemn on this occasion be that which follow in we english poet -- and in they palace where luxury late reign would sea-monster whelp would and stable -- than that in ovid where we be tell that the sea-calfs lay in those place where the goat be use to browze the reader may find several other parallel passage in the latin and english description of the deluge wherein we poet have visibly the advantage the sky be overcharge with cloud the descend of the rain the rising of the sea and the appearance of the rainbow be such description as every one must take notice of the circumstance relate to paradise be so finely imagine and suitable to the opinion of many learn author that i can not forbear give it a place in this paper -- then shall this mount of paradise by might of wave be mov would out of he place push by the horn flood with all he verdure spoil would and tree adrift down the great river to the opning gulf and there take root a island salt and bare the haunt of seal and orc and sea-mew clang the transition which the poet make from the vision of the deluge to the concern it occasion in adam be exquisitely graceful and copy after virgil though the first thought it introduce be rather in the spirit of ovid how didst thou grieve then adam to behold the end of all thy offspring end so sad depopulation thee another flood of tear and sorrow a flood thee also drown

become invincibly persuade that she son be a great scholar and that to chain he down to the ordinary method of education with other of he age would be to cramp he faculty and do a irreparable injury to he wonderful capacity i happen to visit at the house last week and miss the young gentleman at the tea-table where he seldom fail to officiate could not upon so extraordinary a circumstance avoid inquire after he my lady tell I he be go out with she woman in order to make some preparation for they equipage for that she intend very speedily to carry he to travel the oddness of the expression

not remember you have yet take a turn in it i wish sir you would make people understand that travel be really the last step to be take in the institution of youth and to set out with it be to begin

segnius irritant animo demissa per aure quam quæ sunt oculi subjecta fidelibus -- ' hor milton after have represent in vision the history of mankind to the first great period of nature dispatch the remain part of it in narration he have devise a very handsome reason for the angel proceed with adam after this manner though doubtless the true reason be the difficulty which the poet would have find to have shadow out so mixed and complicate a story in visible object i could wish however that the author have do it whatever pain it might have cost he to give my opinion freely i think that the exhibit part of the history of mankind in vision and part in narrative be as if a history-painter should put in color one half of he subject and write down the remain part of it if milton 's poem flag any where it be in this narration where in some place the author have be so attentive to he divinity that he have neglect he poetry the narration however rise very happily on several occasion where the subject be capable of poetical ornament as particularly in the confusion which he describe among the builder of babel and in he short sketch of the plague of egypt the storm of hail and fire with the darkness that overspread the land for three day be describe with great strength the beautiful passage which follow be raise upon noble hint in scripture : -- thus with ten wound the river-dragon tame at length submit to let he sojourner depart and oft humble he stubborn heart but still as ice more harden would after thaw till in he rage pursue whom he late dismiss the sea swallow he with he host but they let pass as on dry land between two chrystal wall aw 'd by the rod of mose so to stand divide -- the river-dragon be a allusion to the crocodile which inhabit the nile from whence egypt derive she plenty this allusion be take from that sublime passage in ezekiel thus saith the lord god behold i be against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of he river which have say my river be mine own and i have make it for my self milton have give we another very noble and poetical image in the same description which be copy almost word for word out of the history of mose all night he will pursue but he approach darkness defend between till morning watch then through the fiery pillar and the cloud god look forth will trouble all he host and craze they chariot wheel : when by command mose once more he potent rod extend over the sea : the sea he rod obey : on they embattell would rank the wave return and overwhelm they war -- as the principal design of this episode be to give adam a idea of the holy person who be to reinstate human nature in that happiness and perfection from which it have fall the poet confines himself to the line of abraham from whence the messiah be to descend the angel be describe as see the patriarch actually travel towards the land of promise which give a particular liveliness to this part of the narration i see he but thou canst not with what faith he leave he god he friend he native soil ur of chaldæa pass now the ford to haran after he a cumbrous train of herd and flock and numerous servitude not wand ` ring poor but trust all he wealth with god who call would he in a land unknown canaan he now attain i see he tent pitch would about sechem and the neighbouring plain of moreh there by promise he receive gift to he progeny of all that land from hamath northward to the desart south -lrb- thing by they name i call though yet unnamed -rrb- as virgil 's vision in the sixth æneid probably give milton the hint of this whole episode the last line be a translation of that verse where anchise mention the name of place which they be to bear hereafter hæc tum nomina erunt nunc sunt sine nomine terræ the poet have very finely represent the joy and gladness of heart which rise in adam upon he discovery of the messiah as he see he day at a distance through type and shadow he rejoice in it : but when he find the redemption of man compleat and paradise again renew he break forth in rapture and transport o goodness infinite goodness immense that all this good of evil shall produce & c i have hint in my sixth paper on milton that a heroick poem accord to the opinion of the best critick ought to end happily and leave the mind of the reader after have conduct it through many doubt and fear sorrow and disquietude in a state of tranquility and satisfaction milton 's fable which have so many other qualification to recommend it be deficient in this particular it be here therefore that the poet have shew a most exquisite judgment as well as the finest invention by find out a method to supply this natural defect in he subject accordingly he leave the adversary of mankind in the last view which he give we of he under the lowest state of mortification and disappointment we see he chew ash grovel in the dust and loaden with supernumerary pain and torment on the contrary we two first parent be comfort by dream and vision chear with promise of salvation and in a manner raise to a greater happiness than that which they have forfeit : in short satan be represent miserable in the height of he triumph and adam triumphant in the height of misery milton 's poem end very nobly the last speech of adam and the arch-angel be full of moral and instructive sentiment the sleep that fall upon eve and the effect it have in quiet the disorder of she mind produce the same kind of consolation in the reader who can not peruse the last beautiful speech which be ascribe to the mother of mankind without a secret pleasure and satisfaction whence thou return ` st and whither go ` st i know for god be also in sleep and dream advise which he have send propitious some great good presaging since with sorrow and heart 's distress weary i fall asleep : but now lead on in I be no delay : with thee to go be to stay here without thee here to stay be to go hence unwilling : thou to I art all thing under heav 'n all place thou who for my wilful crime art banish would hence this farther consolation yet secure i carry hence though all by I be lose such favor i unworthy be vouchsafe by I the promise seed shall all restore the follow line which conclude the poem rise in a most glorious blaze of poetical image and expression heliodorus in he æthiopicks acquaint we that the motion of the god differ from that of mortal as the former do not stir they foot nor proceed step by step but slide o'er the surface of the earth by a uniform swimming of the whole body the reader may observe with how poetical a description milton have attribute the same kind of motion to the angel who be to take possession of paradise so spake we mother eve and adam hear well plea would but answer not for now too nigh th ' archangel stand and from the other hill to they fix would station all in bright array the cherubim descend on the ground glide meteorous as evening mist ri 'n from a river o'er the marish glide and gather ground fast at the lab ` rer 's heel homeward return high in front advance the brandishd sword of god before they blaz would fierce as a comet -- the author help he invention in the following passage by reflect on the behavior of the angel who in holy writ have the conduct of lot and he family the circumstance draw from that relation be very gracefully make use of on this occasion in either hand the hast ` ning angel catch we ling ` ring parent and to th ' eastern gate lead they direct and down the cliff as fast to the subject plain then disappear would they look back & c the scene -lrb- 1 -rrb- which we first parent be surprize with upon they look back on paradise wonderfully strike the reader 's imagination as nothing can be more natural than the tear they shed on that occasion they look back all th ' eastern side beheld of paradise so late they happy seat wav would over by that flaming brand the gate with dreadful face throng would and fiery arm : some natural tear they drop but wipe they soon the world be all before they where to chuse they place of rest and providence they guide if i might presume to offer at the smallest alteration in this divine work i should think the poem would end better with the passage here quote than with the two verse which follow : they hand in hand with wander step and slow through eden take they solitary way these two verse though they have they beauty fall very much below the foregoing passage and renew in the mind of the reader that anguish which be pretty well lay by that consideration the world be all before they where to chuse they place of rest and providence they guide the number of book in paradise lose be equal to those of the æneid we author in he first edition have divide he poem into ten book but afterwards break the seventh and the eleventh each of they into two different book by the help of some small addition this second division be make with great judgment as any one may see who will be at the pain of examine it it be not do for the sake of such a chimerical beauty as that of resemble virgil in this particular but for the more just and regular disposition of this great work those who have read bossu and many of the critick who have write since he time will not pardon I if i do not find out the particular moral which be inculcate in paradise lose though i can by no means think with the last mention french author that a epick writer first of all pitch upon a certain moral as the ground-work and foundation of he poem and afterwards find out a story to it : i be however of opinion that no just heroick poem ever be or can be make from whence one great moral may not be deduce that which reign in milton be the most universal and most useful that can be imagine it be in short this that obedience to the will of god make man happy and that disobedience make they miserable this be visibly the moral of the principal fable which turn upon adam and eve who continue in paradise while they keep the command that be give they and be drive out of it as soon as they have transgress this be likewise the moral of the principal episode which shew we how a innumerable multitude of angel fall from they state of bliss and be cast into hell upon they disobedience besides this great moral which may be look upon as the soul of the fable there be a infinity of under-moral which be to be draw from the several part of the poem and which make this work more useful and instructive than any other poem in any language those who have criticize on the odyssey the iliad and æneid have take a great deal of pain to fix the number of month and day contain in the action of each of those poem if any one think it worth he while to examine this particular in milton he will find that from adam 's first appearance in the fourth book to he expulsion from paradise in the twelfth the author reckon ten day as for that part of the action which be describe in the three first book as it do not pass within the region of nature i have before observe that it be not subject to any calculation of time i have now finish my observation on a work which do a honor to the english nation i have take a general view of it under these four head the fable the character the sentiment and the language and make each of they the subject of a particular paper i have in the next place speak of the censure which we author may incur under each of these head which i have confine to two papers though i might have enlarged the number if i have be dispose to dwell on so ungrateful a subject i believe however that the severest reader will not find any little fault in heroick poetry which this author have fall into that do not come under one of those head among which i have distribute he several blemish after have thus treat at large of paradise lose i could not think it sufficient to have celebrate this poem in the whole without descend to particulars i have therefore bestow a paper upon each book and endeavor not only to -lrb- prove -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- that the poem be beautiful in general but to point out its particular beauty and to determine wherein they consist i have endeavor to shew how some passage be beautiful by be sublime other by be soft other by be natural which of they be recommend by the passion which by the moral which by the sentiment and which by the expression i have likewise endeavor to shew how the genius of the poet shine by a happy invention a distant allusion or a judicious imitation how he have copy or improve homer or virgil and raise he own imagination by the use which he have make of several poetical passage in scripture i might have insert also several passage of tasso which we author -lrb- have -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- imitate but as i do not look upon tasso to be a sufficient voucher i would not perplex my reader with such quotation as might do more honor to the italian than the english poet in short i have endeavor to particularize those innumerable kind of beauty which it would be tedious to recapitulate but which be essential to poetry and which may be meet with in the work of this great author have i think at my first engaging in this design that it would have lead I to so great a length i believe i should never have enter upon it but the kind reception which it have meet with among those whose judgment i have a value for as

that as there be no moral in these jest they ought to be discourage and look upon rather as piece of unluckiness than wit however as it be natural for one man to refine upon the thought of another and

so inconstant and unsteady in the application of they that we sometimes use they to signify one idea sometimes another he add that the result of we contemplation and reasoning while we have no precise idea fix to we word must need be very confused and absurd to avoid this inconvenience more especially in moral discourse where the same word should constantly be use in the same sense he earnestly recommend the use of definition a definition say he be the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral word can be know he therefore accuse those of great negligence who discourse of moral thing with the least obscurity in the term they make use of since upon the foremention ground he do not scruple to say that he think morality be capable of demonstration as well as the mathematick i know no two word that have be more abused by the different and wrong interpretation which be put upon they than those two modesty and assurance to say such a one be a modest man sometimes indeed pass for a good character but at present be very often use to signify a sheepish awkard fellow who have neither good-breeding politeness nor any knowledge of the world again a man of assurance tho at first it only denote a person of a free and open carriage be now very usually apply to a profligate wretch who can break through all the rule of decency and morality without a blush i shall endeavor therefore in this essay to restore these word to they true meaning to prevent the idea of modesty from be confound with that of sheepishness and to hinder impudence from pass for assurance if i be put to define modesty i would call it the reflection of a ingenuous mind either when a man have commit a action for which he censure himself or fancy that he be expose to the censure of other for this reason a man truly modest be as much so when he be alone as in company and as subject to a blush in he closet as when the eye of multitude be upon he i do not remember to have meet with any instance of modesty with which i be so well pleased as that celebrate one of the young prince whose father be a tributary king to the roman have several complaint lay against he before the senate as a tyrant and oppressor of he subject the prince go to rome to defend he father but come into the senate and hear a multitude of crime prove upon he be so oppress when it come to he turn to speak that he be unable

generally give a man assurance be a moderate knowledge of the world but above all a mind fix and determine in it self to do nothing against the rule of honor and decency a open and assure behavior be the natural consequence of such a resolution a man thus arm if he word or action be at any time misinterpret retire within himself and from the consciousness of he own integrity assume force enough to despise the little censure of ignorance or malice every one ought to cherish and encourage in himself the modesty and assurance i have here mention a man without assurance be liable to be make uneasy by the folly or ill-nature of every one he converse with a man without modesty be lose to all sense of honor and virtue it be more than probable that the prince above-mentioned possess both these qualification in a very eminent degree without assurance he would never have undertake to speak before the most August assembly in the world without modesty he would have plead the cause he have take upon he tho it have appear ever so scandalous from what have be say it be plain that modesty and assurance be both amiable and may very well meet in the same person when they be thus mixed and blended together they compose what we endeavor to express when we say a modest assurance by which we understand the just mean between bashfulness and impudence i shall conclude with observe that as the same man may be both modest and assure so it be also possible for the same person to be both impudent and bashful we have frequent instance of this odd kind of mixture in people of depraved mind and mean education who tho ' they be not able to meet a man 's eye or pronounce a sentence without confusion can voluntarily commit the greatest villany or most indecent action such a person seem to have make a resolution to do ill even in spite of himself and in defiance of all those check and restraint he temper and complection seem to have lay in he way upon the whole i would endeavor to establish this

not give the mind such a exquisite gladness prevent we from fall into any depths of sorrow mirth be like a flash of lightning that break thro a gloom of cloud and glitter for a moment chearfulness keep up a kind of day-light in the mind and fill it with a steady and perpetual serenity man of austere principle look upon mirth as too wanton and dissolute for a state of probation and as fill with a certain triumph and insolence of heart that be inconsistent with a life which be every moment obnoxious to the greatest danger writer of this complexion have observe that the sacred person who be the great pattern of perfection be never see to laugh chearfulness of mind be not liable to any of these exception it be of a serious and compose nature it do not throw the mind into a condition improper for the present state of humanity and be very conspicuous in the character of those who be look upon as the greatest philosopher among the heathen as well as among those who have be deservedly esteem as saint and holy man among christian if we consider chearfulness in three light with regard to we self to those we converse with and to the great author of we be it will not a little recommend it self on each of these account the man who be possess of this excellent frame of mind be not only easy in he thought but a perfect master of all the power and faculty of he soul : he imagination be always clear and he judgment undisturbed : he temper be even and unruffle whether in action or in solitude he come with a relish to all those goods which nature have provide for he taste all the pleasure of the creation which be pour about he and do not feel the full weight of those accidental evil which may befal he if we consider he in relation to the person whom he converse with it naturally produce love and good-will towards he a chearful mind be not only disposed to be affable and oblige but raise the same good humor in those who come within its influence a man find himself pleased he do not know why with the chearfulness of he companion : it be like a sudden sun-shine that awaken a secret delight in the mind without she attend to it the heart rejoice of its own accord and naturally flow out into friendship and benevolence towards the person who have so kindly a effect upon it when i consider this chearful state of mind in its third relation i can not but look upon it as a constant habitual gratitude to the great author of nature a inward chearfulness be a implicit praise and thanksgiving to providence under all its dispensation it be a kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we be place and a secret approbation of the divine will in he conduct towards man there be but two thing which in my opinion can reasonably deprive we of this chearfulness of heart the first of these be the sense of guilt a man who live in a state of vice and impenitence can have no title to that evenness and tranquillity of mind which be the health of the soul and the natural effect of virtue and innocence chearfulness in a ill man deserve a harder name than language can furnish we with and be many degree beyond what we commonly call folly or madness atheism by which i mean a disbelief of a supreme be and consequently of a future state under whatsoever title it shelter it self may likewise very reasonably deprive a man of this chearfulness of temper there be something so particularly gloomy and offensive to human nature in the prospect of non-existence that i can not but wonder with many excellent writer how it be possible for a man to out-live the expectation of it for my own part i think the being of a god be so little to be doubt that it be almost the only truth we be sure of and such a truth as we meet with in every object in every occurrence and in every thought if we look into the character of this tribe of infidel we generally find they be make up of pride spleen and cavil : it be indeed no wonder that man who be uneasy to themselves should be so to the rest of the world and how be it possible for a man to be otherwise than uneasy in himself who be in danger every moment of lose he entire existence and drop into nothing the vicious man and atheist have therefore no pretence to chearfulness and would act very unreasonably should they endeavor after it it be impossible for any one to live in good-humour and enjoy he present existence who be apprehensive either of torment or of annihilation of be miserable or of not be at all after have mention would these two great principle which be destructive of chearfulness in they own nature as well as in right reason i can not think of any other that ought to banish this happy temper from a virtuous mind pain and sickness shame and reproach poverty and old age nay death it self consider the shortness of they duration and the advantage we may reap from they do not deserve the name of evil a good mind may bear up under they with fortitude with indolence and with chearfulness of heart the toss of a tempest do not discompose he which he be sure will bring he to a joyful harbor a man who use he best endeavor to live accord to the dictate of virtue and

existence which be so lately bestow upon he and which after million of age will be still new and still in its begin how many self-congratulation naturally arise in the mind when it reflect on this its

increase of perfection and consequently a increase of happiness the consciousness of such a be spread a perpetual diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man and make he look upon himself

egregious error in he conduct my correspondent receive the obligation from a unknown hand with the candor which be natural to a ingenuous mind and promise a contrary behavior in that point for the future : he will offend he monitor with no more error of that kind but thanks he for he benevolence this frank carriage make I reflect upon the amiable atonement a man make in a ingenuous acknowledgment of a fault : all such miscarriage as flow from inadvertency be more than repay by it for reason though not concern in the injury employ all its force in the atonement he that say he do not design to disoblige you in such a action do as much as if he should tell you that tho ' the circumstance which displeased be never in he thought he have that respect for you that he be unsatisfied till it be wholly out of yours it must be confess that when a acknowledgment of offence be make out of poorness of spirit and not conviction of heart the circumstance be quite different : but in the case of my correspondent where both the notice be take and the return make in private the affair begin and end with the highest grace on each side to make the acknowledgment of a fault in the highest manner graceful it be lucky when the circumstance of the offender place he above any ill consequence from the resentment of the person offend a dauphin of france upon a review of the army and a

man against rule to urge what he have a mind to be pardonable only when you sue for another when you be confident in preference of you self to other of equal merit every man that love virtue and modesty ought in defense of those quality to oppose you : but without consider the morality of the thing let we at this time behold only the natural consequence of candor when we speak of ourselves

piece under he title he be barely the publisher there be nothing but what a man really perform can be a honor to he what he take more than he ought in the eye of the world he lose in the conviction of he own heart and a man must lose he consciousness that be he very self before he can rejoice in any falshood without inward mortification who have not see a very criminal at the bar when he counsel and friend have do all that they could for he in vain prevail upon the whole assembly to pity he and he judge to recommend he case to the mercy of the throne without offer any thing new in he defense but that he whom before we wish convict become so out of he own mouth and take upon himself all the shame and sorrow we be just before prepare for he the great opposition to this kind of candor arise from the unjust idea people ordinarily have of what we call a high spirit it be far from greatness of spirit to persist in the wrong in any thing nor be it a diminution of greatness of spirit to have be in the wrong : perfection be not the attribute of man therefore he be not degrade by the acknowledgment of a imperfection : but it be the work of little mind to imitate the fortitude of great spirit on worthy occasion by obstinacy in the wrong this obstinacy prevail so far upon they that they make it extend to the defense of fault in they very servant it would swell this paper to too great

lay whether justly or unjustly be not my business to determine but i resolve for my own particular part to deliver my self as well as i could from the reproach and the curse of posterity by publickly declare to all the world that although in the constant course of my ministry i have never fail on proper occasion to recommend urge and insist upon the loving honor and the reverence the prince 's person and hold it accord to the law inviolable and sacred and pay all obedience and submission to the law though never so hard and inconvenient to private people : yet do i never think my self at liberty or authorize to tell the people that either christ st peter or st paul or any other holy writer have by any doctrine deliver by they subvert the law and constitution of the country in which they live or put they in a worse condition with respect to they civil liberty than they would have be have they not be christian i ever think it a most impious blasphemy against that holy religion to father any thing upon it that might encourage tyranny oppression or injustice in a prince or that easily tend to make a free and happy people slave and miserable no : people may make themselves as wretched as they will but let not god be call into that wicked party when force and violence and hard necessity have bring the yoak of servitude upon a people 's neck religion will supply they with a patient and submissive spirit under it till they can innocently shake it off but certainly religion never put it on this always be and this at present be my judgment of these matter : and i would be transmit to posterity -lrb- for the little share of time such name as mine can live -rrb- under the character of one who lov would he country and would be think a good englishman as well as a good clergyman this character i think would be transmit by the follow sermon which be make for and preach in a private audience when i could think of nothing else but do my duty on the occasion that be then offer by god 's providence without any manner of design of make they publick : and for that reason i give they now as they be then deliver by which i hope to satisfie those people who have object a change of principle to I as if i be not now the same man i formerly be i never have but one opinion of these matter and that i think be so reasonable and well-grounded that i believe i never can have any other another reason of my publish these sermon at this time be that i have a mind to do my self some honor by do what honor i could to the memory of two most excellent prince and who have very highly deserve at the hand of all the people of these dominion who have any true value for the protestant religion and the constitution of the english government of which they be the great deliverer and defender i have live to see they illustrious name very rudely handle and the great benefit they do this nation treat slightly and contemptuously i have live to see we deliverance from arbitrary power and popery traduced and vilify by some who formerly think it be they greatest merit and make it part of they boast and glory to have have a little hand and share in bring it about and other who without it must have liv would in exile poverty and misery meanly disclaim it and use ill the glorious instrument thereof who could expect such a requital of such merit i have i own it a ambition of exempt my self from the number of unthankful people : and as i loved and honor those great prince live and lament over they when dead so i would gladly raise they up a monument of praise as lasting as any thing of mine can be and i chuse to do it at this time when it be so unfashionable a thing to speak honourably of they the sermon that be preach upon the duke of gloucester 's death

of one another tho ' the pleasure and advantage of friendship have be largely celebrate by the best moral writer and be consider by all as great ingredient of human happiness we very rarely meet with the practice of this virtue in the world every man be ready to give in a long catalogue of those virtue and good quality he expect to find in the person of a friend but very few of we be careful to cultivate they in we self love and esteem be the first principle of friendship which always be imperfect where either of these two be want as on the one hand we be soon ashamed of love a man whom we can not esteem : so on the other tho we be truly sensible of a man 's ability we can never raise ourselves to the warmth of friendship without a affectionate good-will towards he person friendship immediately banish envy under all its disguise a man who can once doubt whether he should rejoice in he friend be happier than himself may depend upon it that he be a utter stranger to this virtue there be something in friendship so very great and noble that in those fictitious story which be invent to the honor of any particular person the author have think it as necessary to make they hero a friend as a lover achille have he patroclus and æneas he achate in the first of these instance we may observe for the reputation of the subject i be treat of that greece be almost ruin would by the hero 's love but be preserve by he friendship the character of achate suggest to we a observation we may often make on the intimacy of great man who frequently chuse they companion rather for the quality of the heart than those of the head and prefer fidelity in a easy inoffensive comply temper to those endowment which make a much greater figure among mankind i do not remember that achate who be represent as the first favorite either give he advice or strike a blow thro ' the whole æneid a friendship which make the least noise be very often most useful : for which reason i should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one atticus one of the best man of ancient rome be a very remarkable instance of what i be here speak this extraordinary person amidst the civil war of he country when he see the design of all party equally tend to the subversion of liberty by constantly preserve the esteem and affection of both the competitor find means to serve he friend on either side : and while he send money to young marius whose father be declare a enemy of the commonwealth he be himself one of syllum 's chief favorite and always near that general during the war between cæsar and pompey he still maintain the same conduct after the death of cæsar he send money to brutus in he trouble and do a thousand good office to antony 's wife and friend when that party seem ruin lastly even in that bloody war between antony and augustus atticus still keep he place in both they friendship insomuch that the first say cornelius nepo whenever he be absent from rome in any part of the empire writ punctually to he what he be do what he read and whither he intend to go and the latter give he constantly a exact account of all he affair a likeness of inclination in every particular be so far from be requisite to form a benevolence in two mind towards each other as it be generally imagine that i believe we shall find some of the firmest friendship to have be contract between person of different humor the mind be often pleased with those perfection which be new to it and which it do not find among its own accomplishment besides that a man in some measure supply he own defect and fancy himself at second hand possess of those good quality and endowment which be in the possession of he who in the eye of the world be look on as he other self the most difficult province in friendship be the let a man see he fault and error which should if possible be so contrived that he may perceive we advice be give he not so much to please ourselves as for he own advantage the reproach therefore of a friend should always be strictly just and not too frequent the violent desire of please in the person reprove may otherwise change into a despair of do it while he find himself censur would for fault he be not conscious of a mind that be soften and humanize by friendship can not bear frequent reproach either it must quite sink under the oppression or abate considerably of the value and esteem it have for he who bestow they the proper business of friendship be to inspire life and courage and a soul thus support outdo itself : whereas if it be unexpectedly deprive of these succor it droop and languish we be in some measure more inexcusable if we violate we duty to a friend than to a relation : since the former arise from a voluntary choice the latter from a necessity to which we could not give we own consent as it have be say on one side that a man ought not to break with a faulty friend that he may not expose the weakness of he choice it will doubtless hold much stronger with respect to a worthy one that he may never be upbraid for have lose so valuable a treasure which be once in he possession x \* \* \* \* \* no 386 Friday may 23 1712 steele ` cum tristibus severe cum remissis

with the wanton lasciviously the two last instance of he complaisance i forbear to consider have it in my thought at present only to speak of obsequious behavior as it sit upon a companion in pleasure not a man of design and intrigue to vary with every humor in this manner can not be agreeable except it come from a man 's own temper and natural complection to do it out of a ambition to excel that way be the most fruitless and unbecoming prostitution imaginable to put on a artful part to obtain no other end but a unjust praise from the undiscerning be of all endeavor the most despicable a man must be sincerely pleased to become pleasure or not to interrupt that of other : for this reason it be a most calamitous circumstance that many people who want to be alone or should be so will come into conversation it be certain that all man who be the least give to reflection be seize with a inclination that way when perhaps they have rather be incline to company : but indeed they have better go home and be tire with themselves than force themselves upon other to recover they good humor in all this the case of communicate to a friend a sad thought or difficulty in order to relieve -lrb- a

learning would be painful to the generality of mankind instead of be please witty man be apt to imagine they be agreeable as such and by that mean grow the worst companion imaginable they deride the absent or rally the present in a wrong manner not know that if you pinch or tickle a man till he be uneasy in he seat or ungracefully distinguish from the rest of the company you equally hurt he i be go to say the true art of be agreeable in company -lrb- but there can be no such thing as art in it -rrb- be to appear well please with those you be engage with and rather to seem well entertain than to bring entertainment to other a man thus disposed be not indeed what we ordinarily call a good companion but essentially be such and in all the part of he conversation have something friendly in he behavior which conciliate man 's mind more than the highest sally of wit or start of humor can possibly do the feebleness of age in a man of this turn have something which should be treat with respect

-rrb- wear well that have not at least a certain indolence in they humor if not a more than ordinary gaiety and chearfulness of heart the truth of it be health and chearfulness mutually beget each

chearfulness bear the same friendly regard to the mind as to the body : it banish all anxious care and discontent sooth and compose the passion and keep the soul in a perpetual calm but have already touch on this last consideration i shall here take notice that the world in which we be place be fill with innumerable object that be proper to raise and keep alive this happy temper of mind if we

in we the idea of green fall upon the eye in such a due proportion that they give the animal spirit they proper play and by keep up the struggle in a just ballance excite a very please and agreeable sensation let the cause be what it will the effect be certain for which reason the poet ascribe to this particular color the epithet of chearful to consider further this double end in the work of nature and how they be at the same time both useful and entertaining we find that the most important part in the vegetable world be those which be the most beautiful these be the seed by which the

smile about he whilst in reality he think of nothing but of the harvest and encrease which be to arise from it we may further observe how providence have take care to keep up this chearfulness in the mind of man by have form it after such a manner as to make it capable of conceive delight from several object which seem to have very little use in they as from the wildness of rock and desart and the like grotesque part of nature those who be verse in philosophy may still carry this consideration higher by observe that if matter have appear to we endow only with those real quality which it actually possess it would have make but a very joyless and uncomfortable figure and why have providence give it a power of produce in we such imaginary quality as taste and color sound and smell heat and cold but that man while he be conversant in the lower station of nature might have he mind cheared and delighted with agreeable sensation in short the whole universe be a kind of theater fill with

nature make good she engagement for as she never promise what she be not able to perform so she never fail of perform what she promise but the misfortune be man despise what they may be master of and affect what they be not fit for they reckon themselves already possess of what they genius incline they to and so bend all they ambition to excel in what be out of they reach : thus they destroy the

hear he actually throw out such a storm of eloquence how cold and dead a figure in comparison of these two great man do a orator often make at the british bar hold up he head with the most insipid serenity and streak the side of a long wigg that reach down to he middle the truth of it be there be often nothing more ridiculous than the gesture of a english speaker you see some of they run they

human nature i always think the most useful object of human reason and to make the consideration of it pleasant and entertaining i always think the best employment of human wit : other part of philosophy may perhaps make we wiser but this not only answer that end but make we better too hence it be that the oracle pronounce socrate the wisest of all man live because he judiciously make choice of human nature for the object of he thought a enquiry into which as much exceed all other learning as it be of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measure of right and wrong than to settle the distance of the planet and compute the time of they circumvolution one good effect that will immediately arise from a near observation of human nature be that we shall cease to wonder at those action which man be use to reckon wholly unaccountable for as nothing be produce without a cause so by observe the nature and course of the passion we shall be able to trace every action from its first conception to its death we shall no more admire at the proceedings of catiline or tiberius when we know the one be actuate by a cruel jealousie the other by a furious ambition for the action of man follow they passion as naturally as light do heat or as any other effect flow from its cause reason must be employ in adjust the passion but they must ever remain the principle of action the strange and absurd variety that be so apparent in man 's action shew plainly they can never proceed immediately from reason so pure a fountain emit no such troubled water : they must necessarily arise from the passion which be to the mind as the wind to a ship they only can move it and they too often destroy it if fair and gentle they guide it into the harbor if contrary and furious they overset it in the wave : in the same manner be the mind assist or endanger by the passion reason must then take the place of pilot and can never fail of secure she charge if she be not want to she self : the strength of the passion will never be accept as a excuse for comply with they they be design for subjection and if a man suffer they to get the upper hand he then betray the liberty of he own soul as nature have frame the several species of being as it be in a chain so man seem to be place as the middle link between angel and brute : hence he participate both of flesh and spirit by a admirable tie which in he occasion perpetual war of passion and as a man incline to the angelick or brute part of he constitution he be then denominate good or bad virtuous or wicked if love mercy and good-nature prevail they speak he of the angel if hatred cruelty and envy predominate they declare he kindred to the brute hence it be that some of the ancient imagine that as man in this life incline more to the angel or brute so after they death they should transmigrate into the one or the other : and it would be no unpleasant notion to consider the several species of brute into which we may imagine that tyrant miser the proud malicious and ill-natured might be change as a consequence of this original all passion be in all man but all appear not in all constitution education custom of the country reason and the like cause may improve or abate the strength of they but still the seed remain which be ever ready to sprout forth upon the least encouragement i have hear a story of a good religious man who have be breed with the milk of a goat be very modest in publick by a careful reflection he make on he action but he frequently have a hour in secret wherein he have he frisk and caper and if we have a opportunity of examine the retirement of the strictest philosopher no doubt but we should find perpetual return of those passion they so artfully conceal from the publick i remember matchiavel observe that every state should entertain a perpetual jealousie of its neighbor that so it should never be unprovided when a emergency happen -lrb- 1 -rrb- in like manner should the reason be perpetually on its guard against the passion and never suffer they to carry on any design that may be destructive of its security yet at the same time it must be careful that it do not so far break they strength as to render they contemptible and consequently it self unguard the understanding being of its self too slow and lazy to exert it self into action its necessary it should be put in motion by the gentle gale of the passion which may preserve it from stagnate and corruption for they be as necessary to the health of the mind as the circulation of the animal spirit be to the health of the body they keep it in life and strength and vigor nor be it possible for the mind to perform its office without they assistance : these motion be give we with we be they be little spirit that be bear and dye with we to some they be mild easie and gentle to other wayward and unruly yet never too strong for the rein of reason and the guidance of judgment we may generally observe a pretty nice proportion between the strength of reason and passion the greatest genius 's have commonly the strongest affection as on the other hand the weaker understanding have generally the weaker passion and ` tis fit the fury of the courser should not be too great for the strength of the charioteer young man whose passion be not a little unruly give small hope of they ever be considerable the fire of youth will of course abate and be a fault if it be a fault that mend every day but surely unless a man have fire in youth he can hardly have warmth in old age we must therefore be very cautious lest while we think to regulate the passion we should quite extinguish they which be put out the light of the soul : for to be without passion or to be hurry away with it make a man equally blind the extraordinary severity use in most of we school have this fatal effect it break the spring of the mind and most certainly destroy more good genius 's than it can possibly improve and surely ` tis a mighty mistake that the passion should be so intirely subdue for little irregularity be sometimes not only to be bear with but to be cultivate too since they be frequently attend with the greatest perfection all great genius 's have fault mixed with they virtue and resemble the flaming bush which have thorn amongst light since therefore the passion be the principle of human action we must endeavor to manage they so as to retain they vigor yet keep they under strict command we must govern they rather like free subject than slave lest while we intend to make they obedient they become abject and unfit for those great purpose to which they be design for my part i must confess i could never have any regard to that sect of philosopher who so much insist upon a absolute indifference

which diversify he from all other author with the several foreign infusion of thought and language and the particular author from whom they be borrow after have thus far explain what be generally mean by a fine taste in write and shew the propriety of the metaphor which be use on this occasion i think i may define it to be that faculty of the soul which discern the beauty of a author with pleasure and the imperfection with dislike if a man would know whether he be possess of this faculty i would have he read over the celebrated work of antiquity which have stand the test of so many different age and country or those work among the modern which have the sanction of the politer part of we contemporary if upon the perusal of such writings he do not find himself delighted in a extraordinary manner or if upon read the admire passage in such author he find a coldness and indifference in he thought he ought to conclude not -lrb- as be too usual among tasteless reader -rrb- that the author want those perfection which have be admire in he but that he himself want the faculty of discover they he should in the second place be very careful to observe whether he taste the distinguish

deliver by a person of a ordinary genius for there be as much difference in apprehend a thought cloathe in cicero 's language and that of a common author as in see a object by the light of a taper or by the light of the sun it be very difficult to lay down rule for the acquirement of such a taste as that i be here speak of the faculty must in some degree be bear with we and it very often happen

faculty must in some measure be bear with we there be several method for cultivate and improve it and without which it will be very uncertain and of little use to the person that possess it the most natural method for this purpose be to be conversant among the writings of the most polite author a man who have any relish for fine write either discover new beauty or receive stronger impression from the masterly stroke of a great author every time he peruse he besides that he naturally wear himself into the same manner of speaking and think conversation with man of a polite genius be another method for improve we natural taste it be impossible for a man of the greatest part to consider anything in its whole extent and in all its variety of light every man besides those general observation which be to be make upon a author form several reflection that be peculiar to he own manner of think so that conversation will naturally furnish we with hint which we do not attend to and make we enjoy other man 's part and reflection as well as we own this be the best reason i can give for the observation which several have make that man of great genius in the same way of write seldom rise up singly but at certain period of time appear together and in a body as they do at rome in the reign of augustus and in greece about the age of socrate i can not think that corneille racine moliere

they in the thread of my follow speculation that the reader may conceive rightly what be the subject which i proceed upon i must therefore desire he to remember that by the pleasure of the imagination i mean only such pleasure as arise originally from sight and that i divide these pleasure into two kind : my design be first of all to discourse of those primary pleasure of the imagination which entirely proceed from such object as be -lrb- before we -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- eye -lrb- s -rrb- and in the next place to speak of those secondary pleasure of the imagination which flow from the idea of visible object when the object be not actually before the eye but be call up into we memory or form into agreeable vision of thing that be either absent or fictitious the pleasure of the imagination take in the full extent be not so gross as those of sense nor so refine as those of the understand the last be indeed more preferable because they be found on some new knowledge or improvement in the mind of man yet it must be confest that those of the imagination be as great and as transport as the other a beautiful prospect delight the soul as much as a demonstration and a description in homer have charm more reader than a chapter in aristotle besides the pleasure of the imagination have this advantage above those of the understanding that they be more obvious and more easie to be acquire it be but open the eye and the scene enter the color paint themselves on the fancy with very little attention of thought or application of mind in the beholder we be strike we know not how with the symmetry of any thing we see and immediately assent to the beauty of a object without enquire into the particular cause and occasion of it a man of a polite imagination be let into a great many pleasure that the vulgar be not capable of receive he can converse with a picture and find a agreeable companion in a statue he meet with a secret refreshment in a description and often feel a greater satisfaction in the prospect of field and meadow than another do in the possession it give he indeed a kind of property in every thing he see and make the most rude uncultivated part of nature administer to he pleasure : so that he look upon the world as it be in another light and discover in it a multitude of charm that conceal themselves from the generality of mankind there be indeed but very few who know how to be idle and innocent or have a relish of any pleasure that be not criminal every diversion they take be at the expence of some one virtue or another and they very first step out of business be into vice or folly a man should endeavor therefore to make the sphere of he innocent pleasure as wide as possible that he may retire into they with safety and find in they such a satisfaction as a wise man would not blush to take of this nature be those of the imagination which do not require such a bent of think as be necessary to we more serious employment nor at the same time suffer the mind to sink into that negligence and remissness which be apt to accompany we more sensual delight but like a gentle exercise to the faculty awaken they from sloth and idleness without put they upon any labor or difficulty we might here add that the pleasure of the fancy be more conducive to health than those of the understanding which be work out by dint of thinking and attend with too violent a labor of the brain delightful scene whether in nature painting or poetry have a kindly influence on the body as well as the mind and not only serve to clear and brighten the imagination but be able to disperse grief and melancholy and to set the animal spirit in pleasing and agreeable motion for this reason sir franci bacon in he essay upon health have not think it improper to prescribe to he reader a poem or a prospect where he particularly dissuade he from knotty and subtile disquisition and advise he to pursue study that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious object as history fable and contemplation of nature i have in this paper by way of introduction settle the notion of those pleasure of the imagination which be the subject of my present undertaking and

which arise from the actual view and survey of outward object : and these i think all proceed from the sight of what be great uncommon or beautiful there may indeed be something so terrible or offensive that the horror or loathsomeness of a object may over-bear the pleasure which result from its greatness novelty or beauty but still there will be such a mixture of delight in the very disgust it give we as any of these three qualification be most conspicuous and prevailing by greatness i do not only mean the bulk of any single object but the largeness of a whole view consider as one entire piece such be the prospects of a open champain country a vast uncultivated desart of huge heap of mountain high rock and precipice or a wide expanse of water where we be not strike with the novelty or beauty of the sight but with that rude kind of magnificence which appear in many of these stupendous work of nature we imagination love to be fill with a object or to grasp at any thing that be too big for its capacity we be fling into a please astonishment at such unbounded view and feel a delightful stillness and amazement in the soul at the apprehension -lrb- s -rrb- of they the mind of man naturally hate every thing that look like a restraint upon it and be apt to fancy it self under a sort of confinement when the sight be pen up in a narrow compass and shortn on every side by the neighborhood of wall or mountain on the contrary a spacious horizon be a image of liberty where the eye have room to range abroad to expatiate at large on the immensity of its view and to lose it self amidst the variety of object that offer themselves to its observation such wide and undetermined prospects be as pleasing to the fancy as the speculation of eternity or infinitude be to the understanding but if there be a beauty or uncommonness join with this grandeur as in a troubled ocean a heaven adorn with star and meteor or a spacious landskip cut out into river wood rock and meadow the pleasure still grow upon we as it rise from more than a single principle every thing that be new or uncommon raise a pleasure in the imagination because it fill the soul with a agreeable surprize gratify its curiosity and give it a idea of which it be not before possest we be indeed so often conversant with one set of object and tire out with so many repeat show of the same thing that whatever be new or uncommon contribute a little to vary human life and to divert we mind for a while with the strangeness of its appearance : it serve we for a kind of refreshment and take off from that satiety we be apt to complain of in we usual and ordinary entertainment it be this that bestow charm on a monster and make even the imperfection of nature -lrb- please -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- we it be this that recommend variety where the mind be every instant call off to something new and the attention not suffer to dwell too long and waste it self on any particular object it be this likewise that improve what be great or beautiful and make it afford the mind a double entertainment grove field and meadow be at any season of the year pleasant to look upon but never so much as in the opening of the spring when they be all new and fresh with they first gloss upon they and not yet too much accustomed and familiar to the eye for this reason there be nothing that more enliven a prospect than river jetteaus or fall of water where the scene be perpetually shift and entertain the sight every moment with something that be new we be quickly tire with look upon hill and vally where every thing continue fix and settle in the same place and posture but find we thought a little agitate and relieve at the sight of such object as be ever in motion and slide away from beneath the eye of the beholder but there be nothing that make its way more directly to the soul than beauty which immediately diffuse a secret satisfaction and complacency through the imagination and give a finish to any thing that be great or uncommon the very first discovery of it strike the mind with a inward joy and spread a chearfulness and delight through all its faculty there be not perhaps any real beauty or deformity more in one piece of matter than another because we might have be so make that whatsoever now appear loathsome to we might have shewn it self agreeable but we find by experience that there be several modification of matter which the mind without any previous consideration pronounce at first sight beautiful or deform thus we see that every different species of sensible creature have its different notion of beauty and that each of they be most affect with the beauty of its own kind this be no where more remarkable than in bird of the same shape and proportion where we often see the male determine in he courtship by the single grain or tincture of a feather and never discover any charm but in the color of its species scit thalamo servare fidem sanctasque veretur connubius lege

there be a second kind of beauty that we find in the several product of art and nature which do not work in the imagination with that warmth and violence as the beauty that appear in we proper species but be apt however to raise in we a secret delight and a kind of fondness for the place or object in which we discover it this consist either in the gaiety or variety of color in the symmetry and proportion of part in the arrangement and disposition of body or in a just mixture and concurrence of all together among these several kind of beauty the eye take most delight in color we no where meet with a more glorious or pleasing show in nature than what appear in the heaven at the rise and set of the sun which be wholly make up of those different stain of light that shew themselves in cloud of a different situation for this reason we find the poet who be always address themselves to the imagination borrow more of they epithet from color than from any other topic as the fancy delight in every thing that be great strange or beautiful and be still more pleased the more it find of these perfection in the same object so be it capable of receive a new satisfaction by the assistance of another sense thus any continued sound as the musick of bird or a fall of water awaken every moment the mind of the beholder and make he more attentive to the several beauty of the place that lye before he thus if there arise a fragrancy of smell or perfume they heighten the pleasure of the imagination and make even the color and verdure of the landskip appear more agreeable for the idea of both sens recommend each other and be pleasanter together than when they enter the mind separately : as the different color of a picture when they be well disposed set off one another and

that be great new or beautiful be apt to affect the imagination with pleasure we must own that it be impossible for we to assign the necessary cause of this pleasure because we know neither the nature of a idea nor the substance of a human soul which might help we to discover the conformity or disagreeableness of the one to the other and therefore for want of such a light all that we can do in speculation of this kind be to reflect on those operation of the soul that be most agreeable and to range under they proper head what be please or displease to the mind without be able to trace out the several necessary and efficient cause from whence the pleasure or displeasure arise final cause lye more bare and open to we observation as there be often a great variety that belong to the same effect and these tho ' they be not altogether so satisfactory be generally more useful than the other as they give we greater occasion of admire the goodness and wisdom of the first contriver one of the final cause of we delight in any thing that be great may be this the supreme author of we being have so form the soul of man that nothing but himself can be its last adequate and proper happiness because therefore a great part of we happiness must arise from the contemplation of he be that he might give we soul a just relish of such a contemplation he have make they naturally delight in the apprehension of what be great or unlimited we admiration which be a very please motion of the mind immediately rise at the consideration of any object that take up a great deal of room in the fancy and by consequence will improve into the highest pitch of astonishment and devotion when we contemplate he nature that be neither circumscribe by time nor place nor to be comprehend by the largest capacity of a create be he have annex a secret pleasure to the idea of any thing that be new or uncommon that he might encourage we in the pursuit after knowledge and engage we to search into the wonder of he creation for every new idea bring such a pleasure along with it as reward any pain we have take in its acquisition and consequently serve as a motive to put we upon fresh discovery he have make every thing that be beautiful in we own species pleasant that all creature might be tempt to multiply they kind and fill the world with inhabitant for ` tis very remarkable that where-ever nature be crost in the production of a monster -lrb- the result of any unnatural mixture -rrb- the breed be incapable of propagate its likeness and of found a new order of creature so that unless all animal be allure by the beauty of they own species generation would be at a end and the earth unpeopled in the last place he have make every thing that be beautiful in all other object pleasant or rather have make so many object appear beautiful that he might render the whole creation more gay and delightful he have give almost every thing about we the power of raise a agreeable idea in the imagination : so that it be impossible for we to behold he work with coldness or indifference and to survey so many beauty without a secret satisfaction and complacency thing would make but a poor appearance to the eye if we see they only in they proper figure and motion : and what reason can we assign for they exciting in we many of those idea which be different from any thing that exist in the object themselves -lrb- for such be light and color -rrb- be it not to add supernumerary ornament to the universe and make it more agreeable to the imagination we be every where entertain with pleasing show and apparition we discover imaginary glory in the heaven and in the earth and see some of this visionary beauty pour out upon the whole creation but what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be entertain with do all she coloring disappear and the several distinction of light and shade vanish in short we soul be at present delightfully lose and bewilder in a please delusion and we walk about like the enchanted hero of a romance who see beautiful castle wood and meadow and at the same time hear the warbling of bird and the purling of stream but upon the finish of some secret spell the fantastick scene break up and the disconsolate knight find himself on a barren heath or in a solitary desart it be not improbable that something like this may be the state of the soul after its first separation in respect of the image it will receive from matter tho indeed the idea of color be so please and beautiful in the imagination that it be possible the soul will not be deprive of they but perhaps find they excite by some other occasional cause as they be at present by the different impression of the subtle matter on the organ of sight i have here suppose that my reader be acquaint with that great modern discovery which be at present universally acknowledge by all the enquirer into natural philosophy : namely that light and color as apprehend by the imagination be only idea in the mind and not quality that have any existence in matter as this be a truth which have be prove incontestably by many modern philosopher and be indeed one of the finest speculation in that science if the english reader would see the notion explain at large he may find it in the eighth chapter of the second book of mr lock 's essay on human understanding o -lrb- to

we consider the work of nature and art as they be qualify to entertain the imagination we shall find the last very defective in comparison of the former for though they may sometimes appear as beautiful or strange they can have nothing in they of that vastness and immensity which afford so great a entertainment to the mind of the beholder the one may be as polite and delicate as the other but can never shew she self so August and magnificent in the design there be something more bold and masterly in the rough careless stroke of nature than in the nice touch and embellishment of art the beauty of the most stately garden or palace lie in a narrow compass the imagination immediately run they over and require something else to gratifie she but in the wide field of nature the sight wander up and down without confinement and be feed with a infinite variety of image without any certain stint or number for this reason we always find the poet in love with a country-life where nature appear in the greatest perfection and furnish out all those scene that be most apt to delight the imagination ` scriptorum chorus omni amat nemus et fugit urbe ' hor ` hic secura quie et nescia fallere vita dive opum variarum hic lati otium fundi speluncæ vivique lacus hic frigida tempe mugitusque boum mollesque sub arbore somnus ' virg but tho ' there be several of these wild scene that be more delightful than any artificial show yet we find the work of nature still more pleasant the more they resemble those of art : for in this case we pleasure rise from a double principle from the agreeableness of the object to the eye and from they similitude to other object : we be pleased as well with compare they beauty as with survey they and can represent they to we mind either as copy or original hence it be that we take delight in a prospect which be well lay out and diversify with field and meadow wood and river in those accidental landskip of tree cloud and city that be sometimes find in the vein of marble in the curious fret-work of rock and grotto and in a word in any thing that have such a variety or regularity as may seem the effect of design in what we call the work of chance if the product of nature rise in value accord as they more or less resemble those of art we may be sure that artificial work receive a greater advantage from they resemblance of such as be natural because here the similitude be not only pleasant but the pattern more perfect the prettiest landskip i ever saw be one draw on the wall of a dark room which stand opposite on one side to a navigable river and on the other to a park the experiment be very common in optick here you might discover the wave and fluctuation of the water in strong and proper color with the picture of a ship enter at one end and sailing by degree through the whole piece on another there appear the green shadow of tree wave to and fro with the wind and herd of deer among they in miniature leap about upon the wall i must confess the novelty of such a sight may be one occasion of its pleasantness to the imagination but certainly the chief reason be its near resemblance to nature as it do not only like other picture give the color and figure but the motion of the thing it represent we have before observe that there be generally in nature something more grand and August than what we meet with in the curiosity of art when therefore we see this imitate in any measure it give we a nobler and more exalted kind of pleasure than what we receive from the nicer and more accurate production of art on this account we english garden be not so entertaining to the fancy as those in france and italy where we see a large extent of ground cover over with a agreeable mixture of garden and forest which represent every where a artificial rudeness much more charming than that neatness and elegancy which we meet with in those of we own country it might indeed be of ill consequence to the publick as well as unprofitable to private person to alienate so much ground from pasturage and the plow in many part of a country that be so well peopled and cultivate to a far greater advantage but why may not a whole estate be throw into a kind of garden by frequent plantation that may turn as much to the profit as the pleasure of the owner a marsh overgrown with willow or a mountain shaded with oak be not only more beautiful but more beneficial than when they lie bare and unadorned field of corn make a pleasant prospect and if the walk be a little take care of that lie between they if the natural embroidery of the meadow be helpt and improve by some small addition of art and the several row of hedge set off by tree and flower that the soil be capable of receive a man might make a pretty landskip of he own possession writer who have give we a account of china tell we the inhabitant of that country laugh at the plantation of we european which be lay out by the rule and line because they say any one may place tree in equal row and uniform figure they chuse rather to shew a genius in work of this nature and therefore always conceal the art by which they direct themselves they have a word it seem in they language by which they express the particular beauty of a plantation that thus strike the imagination at first sight without discover what it be that have so agreeable a effect

assist and compleat each other in form such scene and prospects as be most apt to delight the mind of the beholder i shall in this paper throw together some reflection on that particular art which have a more immediate tendency than any other to produce those primary pleasure of the imagination which have hitherto be the subject of this discourse the art i mean be that of architecture which i shall consider only with regard to the light in which the foregoing speculation have place it without entr into those rule and maxim which the great master of architecture have lay down and explain at large in numberless treatise upon that subject greatness in the work of architecture may be consider as relate to the bulk and body of the structure or to the manner in which it be build as for the first we find the ancient especially among the eastern nation of the world infinitely superior to the modern not to mention the tower of babel of which a old author say there be the foundation to be see in he time which look like a spacious mountain what could be more noble than the wall of babylon its hanging garden and its temple to jupiter belus that rise a mile high by eight several story each story a furlong in height and on the top of which be the babylonian observatory i might here likewise take notice of the huge rock that be cut into the figure of semiramis with the smaller rock that lay by it in the shape of tributary king the prodigious basin or artificial lake which take in the whole euphrate till such time as a new canal be form for its reception with the several trench through which that river be convey i know there be person who look upon some of these wonder of art as fabulous but i can not find any -lrb- grand -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- for such a suspicion unless it be that we have no such work among we at present there be indeed many greater advantage for building in those time and in that part of the world than have be meet with ever since the earth be extremely fruitful man live generally on pasturage which require a much smaller number of hand than agriculture : there be few trade to employ the busie part of mankind and fewer art and science to give work to man of speculative temper and what be more than all the rest the prince be absolute so that when he go to war he put himself at the head of a whole people : as we find semiramis lead she -lrb- three -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- million to the field and yet over-powered by the number of she enemy ` tis no wonder therefore when she be at peace and turn she thought on building that she could accomplish so great work with such a prodigious multitude of labourer : besides that in she climate there be small interruption of frost and winter which make the northern workman lie half the year idle i might mention too among the benefit of the climate what historian say of the earth that it sweat out a bitumen or natural kind of mortar which be doubtless the same with that mention in holy writ as contribute to the structure of babel slime they use instead of mortar in egypt we still see they pyramid which answer to the description that have be make of they and i question not but a traveller might find out some remains of the labyrinth that cover a whole province and have a hundred temple dispose among its several quarter and division the wall of china be one of these eastern piece of magnificence which make a figure even in the map of the world altho a account of it would have be think fabulous be not the wall it self still extant we be oblige to devotion for the noblest building that have adornd the several country of the world it be this which have set man at work on temple and publick place of worship not only that they might by the magnificence of the building invite the deity to reside within it but that such stupendous work might at the same time open the mind to vast conception and fit it to converse with the divinity of the place for every thing that be majestick imprint a awfulness and reverence on the mind of the beholder and strike in with the natural greatness of the soul in the second place we be to consider greatness of manner in architecture which have such force upon the imagination that a small building where it appear shall give the mind nobler idea than one of twenty time the bulk where the manner be ordinary or little thus perhaps a man would have be more astonished with the majestick air that appear in one of -lrb- lysippus 's -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- statue of alexander tho ' no bigger than the life than he might have be with mount atho have it be cut into the figure of the hero accord to the proposal of phidia -lrb- 4 -rrb- with a river in one hand and a city in the other let any one reflect on the disposition of mind he find in himself at he first entrance into the pantheon at rome and how he imagination be fill with something great and amazing and at the same time consider how little in proportion he be affect with the inside of a gothick cathedral tho ' it be five time larger than the other which can arise from nothing else but the greatness of the manner in the one and the meanness in the other i have see a observation upon this subject in a french author which very much pleased I it be in monsieur freart 's parallel of the ancient and modern architecture i shall give it the reader with the same term of art which he have make use of i be observe -lrb- say he -rrb- a thing which in my opinion be very curious whence it proceed that in the same quantity of superficies the one manner seem great and magnificent and the other poor and trifling the reason be fine and uncommon i say then that to introduce into architecture this grandeur of manner we ought so to proceed that the division of the principal member of the order may consist but of few part that they be all great and of a bold and ample relievo and swell and that the eye behold nothing little and mean the imagination may be more vigorously touch and affect with the work that stand before it for example in a cornice if the golum or cynatium of the corona the cope the modillion or dentellus make a noble show by they graceful projection if we see none of that ordinary confusion which be the result of those little cavity quarter round of the astragal and i know not how many other intermingled particulars which produce no effect in great and massy work and which very unprofitably take up place to the prejudice of the principal member it be most certain that this manner will appear solemn and great as on the contrary that it will have but a poor and mean effect where there be a redundancy of those smaller ornament which divide and scatter the angle of the sight into such a multitude of ray so press together that the whole will appear but a confusion among all the figure in architecture there be none that have a greater air than the concave and the convex and we find in all the ancient and modern architecture as well in the remote part of china as in country nearer home that round pillar and vaulted roof make a great part of those building which be design for pomp and magnificence the reason i take to be because in these figure we generally see more of the body than in those of other kind there be indeed figure of body where the eye may take in two third of the surface but as in such body the sight must split upon several angle it do not take in one uniform idea but several idea of the same kind look upon the outside of a dome you eye half surround it look up into the inside and at one glance you have all the prospect of it the entire concavity fall into you eye at once the sight be as the center that collect and gather into it the line of the whole circumference : in a square pillar the sight often take in but a fourth part of the surface : and in a square concave must move up and down to the different side before it be master of all the inward surface for this reason the fancy be infinitely more strike with the view of the open air and sky that pass through a arch than what come through a square or any other figure the figure of the rainbow do not contribute less to its magnificence than the color to its beauty as it be very poetically describe by the son of sirach : look upon the rainbow and praise he that make it very beautiful it be in its brightness it encompass the heaven with a glorious circle

which i have hitherto consider i shall not trouble my reader with any reflection upon it it be sufficient for my present purpose to observe that there be nothing in this whole art which please the imagination but as it be great uncommon or beautiful o -lrb- footnote 1 : grounds -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : two -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : protogene 's -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : dinocrate -rrb- -lrb-

into such as arise from object that be actually before we eye or that once enter in at we eye and be afterwards call up into the mind either barely by its own operation or on occasion of something without we as statue or description we have already consider the first division and shall therefore enter on the other which for distinction sake i have call the secondary pleasure of the imagination when i say the idea we receive from statue description or such like occasion be the same that be once actually in we view it must not be understand that we have once see the very place action or person which be carve or describe it be sufficient that we have see place person or action in general which bear a resemblance or at least some remote analogy with what we find represent since it be in the power of the imagination when it be once stock with particular idea to enlarge compound and vary they at she own pleasure among the different kind of representation statuary be the most natural and shew we something likest the object that be represent to make use of a common instance let one who be bear blind take a image in he hand and trace out with he finger the different furrow and impression of the chissel and he will easily conceive how the shape of a man or beast may be represent by it but should he draw he hand over a picture where all be smooth and uniform he would never be able to imagine how the several prominency and depression of a human body could be shewn on a plain piece of canvas that have in it no unevenness or irregularity description run yet further from the thing it represent than painting for a picture bear a real resemblance to its original which letter and syllable be wholly void of color speak of language but word be understand only by such a people or nation for this reason tho ' man 's necessity quickly put they on find out speech writing be probably of a later invention than painting particularly we be tell that in america when the spaniard first arrive there express be send to the emperor of mexico in paint and the news of he country delineate by the stroke of a pencil which be a more natural way than that of write tho ' at the same time much more imperfect because it be impossible to draw the little connexion of speech or to give the picture of a conjunction or a adverb it would be yet more strange to represent visible object by sound that have no idea annex to they and to make something like description in musick yet it be certain there may be confuse imperfect notion of this nature raise in the imagination by a artificial composition of note and we find that great master in the art be able sometimes to set they hearer in the heat and hurry of a battel to overcast they mind with melancholy scene and apprehension of death and funeral or to lull they into please dream of grove and elisium in all these instance this secondary pleasure of the imagination proceed from that action of the mind which compare the idea arise from the original object with the idea we receive from the statue picture description or sound that represent they it be impossible for we to give the necessary reason why this operation of the mind be attend with so much pleasure as i have before observe on the same occasion but we find a great variety of entertainment derive from this single principle : for it be this that not only give we a relish of statuary painting and description but make we delight in all the action and art of mimickry it be this that make the several kind of wit pleasant which consist as i have formerly shewn in the affinity of idea : and we may add it be this also that raise the little satisfaction we sometimes find in the different sort of false wit whether it consist in the affinity of letter as in anagram acrostick or of syllable as in doggerel rhime eccho or of word as in punn quibble or of a whole sentence or poem to wing and altar the final cause probably of annex pleasure to this operation of the mind be to quicken and encourage we in we search after truth since the distinguish one thing from another and the right discerning betwixt we idea depend wholly upon we compare they together and observe the congruity or disagreement that appear among the several work of nature but i shall here confine my self to those pleasure of the imagination -lrb- which -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- proceed from idea raise by word because most of the observation that agree with description be equally applicable to painting and statuary word when well choose have so great a force in they that a description often give we more lively idea than the sight of thing themselves the reader find a scene draw in stronger color and paint more to the life in he imagination by the help of word than by a actual survey of the scene which they describe in this case the poet seem to get the better of nature he take indeed the landskip after she but give it more vigorous touch heighten its beauty and so enliven the whole piece that the image which flow from the object themselves appear weak and faint in comparison of those that come from the expression the reason probably may be because in the survey of any object we have only so much of it paint on the imagination as come in at the eye but in its description the poet give we as free a view of it as he please and discover to we several part that either we do not attend to or that lay out of we sight when we first behold it as we look on any object we idea of it be perhaps make up of two or three simple idea but when the poet represent it he may either give we a more complex idea of it or only raise in we such idea as be most apt to affect the imagination it may be here worth we while to examine how it come to pass that several reader who be all acquaint with the same language and know the meaning of the word they read should nevertheless have a different relish of the same description we find one transport with a passage which another run over with coldness and indifference or find the representation extreamly natural where another can perceive nothing of likeness and conformity this different taste must proceed either from the perfection of imagination in one more than in another or from the different idea that several reader affix to the same word for to have a true relish and form a right judgment of a description a man should be bear with a good imagination and must have well weigh the force and energy that lye in the several word of a language so as to be able to distinguish which be most significant and expressive of they proper idea and what additional strength and beauty they be capable of receive from conjunction with other the fancy must be warm to retain the print of those image it have receive from outward object and the judgment discerning to know what expression be most proper to cloath and adorn they to the best advantage a man who be deficient in either of these respects tho ' he may receive the general notion of a description can never see distinctly all its particular beauty : as a person with a weak sight may have the confused prospect of a place that lie before he without enter into its several part or discerning the variety of its color in they full glory and perfection o -lrb- footnote 1 : -lrb- that -rrb- -rrb- end of project gutenberg 's the spectator volume 2 by addison and
