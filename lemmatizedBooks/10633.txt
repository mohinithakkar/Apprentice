service render by thoma clarkson to the great question of the slave trade in all its branch have be universally acknowledge both at home and abroad and have gain he a high place among the greatest benefactor of mankind the history of the abolition which this volume contain afford some means of appreciate the extent of he sacrifice and he labor in this cause but after these with the unwearied exertion of william wilberforce have conduct its friend to they final triumph in 1807 they do not then rest from they labor there remain four most important object to which the anxious attention of all abolitionist be now direct _ first _ -- the law have be pass force upon the planter the trader and the parliament by the voice of the people and there be a necessity for keep a watchful eye over its execution _ secondly _ -- the statute however rigorously it might be enforce left of course the whole amount of the foreign slave traffic untouched and it be infinitely to be desire that mean should be adopt for extend we abolition to other nation _ thirdly _ -- some compensation be due to africa for the countless misery which we criminal conduct have for age inflict upon she and strict justice to say nothing of common humanity and christian charity demand that every means should be use for aid in the progress of she civilization and efface as far as possible the dreadful mark which have be leave upon she by we crime _ lastly _ -- many of those whom we have transport by fraud and violence from they native country and still more of the descendant of other who have fall a sacrifice to we cruelty and perish in the course of nature slave in a foreign land remain to suffer the dreadful evil of west indium bondage it seem to follow that the earliest opportunity consistent with they own condition should be take to free those unhappy being the victim of we sordid cruelty and all the more to be pity as we be all the more to be blame because one result of we transgression be the have place they in so unnatural a position that they enemy might seem to be furnish with a argument more plausible than sound draw from the negro 's suppose unfitness for immediate emancipation in order to promote these four great object a society be form in may 1807 call the african institution and although at first its labor be chiefly direct to the portion of the subject relate to africa by degree as the extinction of the british slave trade be accomplish its care be chiefly bestow on west indium matter which be more within the power of this country than the slave traffic still carry on by foreign nation but it be necessary in the first place to recite the measure by which we own share in that enormous crime be surrender and the stigma partially obliterate which it have bring upon we national character thoma clarkson bear a forward and important part in all these useful and virtuous proceedings he health be now by rest among the lake of westmoreland for several year comparatively restore and he mind once more bent itself to the accomplishment of the grand object of he life we may he permit reverently to suggest the end of he existence mr stephen and other at first deem the certainty of the act pass in march 1807 be evade under the stimulus and the insurance against capture afford by the enormous profit of the traffic so clear that they expect the law to become almost from the time of its be enact a dead letter there soon appear the strongest reason to concur in this opinion the result of long and close observation in the island where mr stephen have pass part of he life the slave-dealer know the risk of penalty and forfeiture which they run but they also know that if one voyage in three or four be successful they be abundantly remunerate for all they loss and therefore they be no more restrain by the abolition act than by any moderate increase of the cost or the risk attend they wicked adventure this be sure to be the case as long as the law only treated slavetrading as a contraband commerce subject those who drive it to nothing but pecuniary penalty but it be equally evident that the same person who make these calculation of profit and risk while they only could lose the ship or the money by a seizure would hesitate before they encounter the hazard of be try as for a crime and surely if ever these be a act which deserve to be declare felony and deal with as such it be this of slave-trading accordingly in 1810 mr brougham then a member of the house of common in move a address to the crown -lrb- which be unanimously agree to -rrb- for more vigorous measure against the traffic both british and foreign give notice of the bill which he next year carry through parliament and which declare the traffic to be a felony punishable with transportation some year afterwards it be by another act make capital under the name of piracy but this have since be repeal several conviction have take place under the former act -lrb- of 1811 -rrb- and there can not be the least doubt that the law have prove effectual and that the slave trade have long cease to exist as far as the british dominion be concern that foreign state continue shamefully to carry it on be no less certain there be yearly transport to cuba and brazil above 100000 unhappy being by the two weakest nation in europe and these two most entirely subject to the influence and even direct control of england the inevitable consequence be that more misery be now inflict on africa by the criminal gently call slave-trader of these two guilty nation than if there be no treaty for the abolition of the traffic the number require be always carry over and hence as many perish by a miserable death in escape from the cruiser as reach they destination the recital of horror which have be make to parliament and the country on this dreadful subject be enough to curdle the blood in the vein and heart of any one endue with the common feeling of humanity the whole system of prevention or rather of capture after the crime have be commit seem frame with a view to exasperate the evil of the infernal traffic to scourge africa with more intolerable torment and to make human blood be spill like water we cruiser be excite to a active discharge of they duty by the benefit of share in the price fetch when the capture ship be condemn and sell but this be a small sum indeed compare with the rich reward of head-money hold out be so much for every slave take on board it be thus make the direct interest of these cruiser that the vessel should have they human cargo on board rather than be prevent from ship they true this vile policy may prove less mischievous where no treaty exist give a right to seize when there be no slave in the vessel because here a slave ship be suffer to pass how clear soever she destination might be yet even here the inducement to send in boat and seize as soon as a slave or two may be on board be remove and the cruiser be tell only let all these wretched being be tear from they country and safely lodge in the vessel 's hold and you reward be great and sure then whenever there be a outfit clause that be a power to seize vessel fit for the traffic this mischievous plan tend directly to make the cruiser let the slaver make ready and put to sea or it have no tendency or meaning at all accordingly the course be for the cruiser to stand out to sea and not allow herself to be see in the offing -- the crime be consummate -- the slave be stow away -- the pirate -- captain weigh anchor -- the pirate-vessel freight with victim and man by criminal fare forth -- the cruiser the british cruiser give chace -- and then begin those scene of horror surpass all that the poet ever conceive whose theme be the torment of the damned and the wickedness of the fiend cask be fill with the slave and in these they be stow away or to lighten the vessel they be fling overboard by the score sometimes they be fling overboard in cask that the chasing ship may be detain by endeavor to pick they up the die and the dead strew the deck woman give birth to the fruit of the womb amidst the corpse of they husband and they child and other yet worse and nameless atrocity fill up the terrible picture of impotent justice and triumphant guilt but the guilt be not all spanish and portuguese the english government can enforce its demand on the puny cabinet of madrid and lisbon scarce conscious of a substantive existence in all that concern we petty interest : wherever justice and mercy to mankind demand we interference there we voice sink within we and no sound be utter that any treaty without a outfit clause should be suffer to exist between power so situate be a outrage upon all justice all reason all common sense but one thing be certain that unless we be to go further we have go too far and must in mercy to hapless africa retrace we step unless we really put the traffic down with a strong hand and instantly we must instantly repeal the treaty that pretend to abolish it for these exacerbate the evil a hundred fold and be ineffectual to any one purpose but put money into the pocket of we man of war the fact be as unquestionable as it be appalling that all we anxious endeavor to extinguish the foreign slave trade have end in make it incomparably worse than it be before we pretend to put it down that owe to we effort there be thrice the number of slave yearly tear from africa and that wholly because of we effort two third of these be murder on the high sea and in the hold of the pirate vessel it be say that when these scene be describe to a indignant nation last session of parliament the actual effect of this bad system be deny though its tendency could not be dispute it be aver that no british seaman could be capable of neglect he duty for the sake of increase the gain of the station but nothing could be more absurd than this can the direct and inevitable tendency of the head-money system be doubt be cruiser the only man over whom motive have no influence then why offer a reward at all when they want no stimulus to perform they duty why tell they that if the ship be empty they get a hundred pound : if laden five thousand they know the rule of arithmetic -- they understand the force of number but in truth there be not a individual on all the coast of africa who will be mislead by such appeal or suffer all this to divert they from they purpose of denounce the system there be person high in rank among the best servant of the crown who know the fact from they own observation and who be ready to bear witness to the truth in spite of all the attempt that have be make to silence they the other great object of the african institution regard the west indy the preparation of the negro for that freedom which be they absolute right and could only be withhold for a hour on the ground of they not be prepare for it and therefore be better without it be the first thing to be accomplish here the friend of the abolition all but mr stephen suffer a great disappointment he alone have uniformly-foretold that the hope hold out as it seem very reasonably of better treatment result from the stoppage of the supply of hand be fallacious all else have suppose that interest might operate on man whom principle have fail to sway that they whom no feeling of compassion for they fellow-creature could move to do they duty might be touch by a feeling of they own advantage when interest coincide with duty the slave-mart be now close it be say surely the stock on hand will be save by all means and not waste when it can no longer be replace the argument be purposely rest on the low ground of regard human being as cattle or even as inanimate chattel and it be conceive that human life would be regard of as much value as the wear and tear of beast of furniture or of tool hence it be expect that a better system of treatment would follow from the law which close the african market and warn every planter that he stock must be spare by better treatment and keep up by breed since it no longer could be as it hitherto have be maintain by new supplies two consideration be in these argument keep out of view both of a practical nature and both know to mr stephen -- the cultivation of the island by agent have wholly different interest from they master and the gambling spirit of trading and culture which long habit have implant in the west indian nature the comfort of the slave depend infinitely more upon the agent on the spot than the owner generally resident in the mother country and though the interest of the latter might lead to the saving of negro life and care for negro comfort the agent have no such motive to influence he conduct besides it be with the eye of this agent that the planter must see and he give no credence to any account but he now the consequence of cruelty be to make man at war with its object no one but a most irritable person feel angry with he beast and even the anger of such a person be of a moment 's duration but towards a inanimate chattel even the most irritable of sane man can feel nothing like rage why because in the one case there be little in the other no conflict or resistance at all it be otherwise with a slave he be human and can disobey -- can even resist this feeling always rankle in he oppressor 's bosom and make the tyrannical superior hate and the more oppress he slave the agent on the spot feel thus and thus act nor can the voice of the owner at a distance be hear even if interest clearly prove be to prompt another course but the chief cause of the evil be the spirit of speculation and it affect and rule resident owner even more than absentee let sugar rise in price and all cold calculation of ultimate loss to the gang be lose in the vehement thirst of great present gain all or nearly all planter be in distressed circumstance they look to the next few year as they time and if the sun shine they must make hay they be in the mine toiling for a season with every desire to escape and realize something to spend elsewhere therefore they make haste to be rich and care little should the speculation answer and much sugar bring in great gain what become of the gang ten year hence add to all this that any interference of the local legislature to discourage sordid or cruel management to clothe the slave with rights to prepare they for freedom by better education to pave the way for emancipation by restrain the master 's power to create a intermediate state of transition from slavery to freedom by partial liberty as by attach they to the soil and place they in the preparatory state through which we ancestor in europe pass from bondage in gross to entire independence -- all such measure be in the absolute discretion not of the planter but of the resident agent one of the worst community in the world who have little interest in prepare for a event which they deprecate and whose feeling of party as well as individually be all range on the oppressor 's side all this mr stephen enlighten by experience and wise by long reflection clearly and alone foresee all this vision of the future be too surely realize by the event no improvement of treatment take place no additional liberality in the supplies be show no abstinence in the exaction of labor appear no interference of the colonial legislature to check misconduct be witness far less be the least disposition perceive to give any rights to the slave any security against oppression any title independent of he master any intermediate state or condition which might prepare he for freedom it be enough to say that a measure which every man except mr stephen have regard as the natural almost the necessary effect of the abolition -- attach the slave to the soil -- be not so much as propounded far less adopt it may be even say be never mention in any one local assembly of any of we numerous colony during the thirty year which elapse between the abolition and the emancipation this be unquestionable and it be decisive as soon as it begin to be perceive that such be likely to be the result of the abolition in regard to the emancipation mr stephen 's authority with he coadjutor always high rise in proportion to the confirmation which the event have lend he prediction and he zealous endeavor and unwearied labor for the subversion of the accursed system become both more extensive and more effectual if however strict justice require the tribute which we have pay to this eminent person 's distinguished service justice also render it imperative on the historian of the abolition in all its branch to record a error into which he fall have originally maintain that the traffic would survive the act of 1807 in which he be right that act only impose pecuniary penalty he persist in the same opinion after the act of 1811 have make slave-trading a felony and long after it have be effectually put down in the british dominion he continue to maintain that it be carry on nearly as much as ever reasoning upon calculation draw from the island return hence he insist upon a general registry act as essential to prevent the continuance of a importation which have little or no real existence the importance of such a measure be undeniable with a view to secure the good treatment of the negro in the island but the extinction of the slave trade have long before be effectually accomplish in the effort to obtain negro emancipation all the abolitionist be now prepare to join the conduct of the colonial assembly have long show the fallacy of those expectation which have be entertain of the good work be do in the island as soon as the supply of new hand should be stop by the abolition there remain no longer any doubt whatever that the mother country alone could abate a nuisance hateful in the sight of god and man constant opportunity be therefore offer to agitate this great question which be take up by the enlighten the humane and the religious all over the empire the magnitude of the subject be indeed worthy of all the interest it excite the destiny of nearly a million of human being -- nay the question whether they should be treat as man with rational soul or as the beast which perish -- should enjoy the liberty to which all god 's creature be entitle as of right or be harass oppressed tormented and stint both as regard bodily food and spiritual instruction -- whether the colony should be people with tyrant and barbarian or inhabit by civilized and improve christian community -- be one calculate to put in action all the best principle of we nature and to move all the noblest feeling of the human heart thoma clarkson as far as he means extend aid this great excitement he renew he committee of correspondence all over the country aid by the society of friend he early and steady coadjutor in this pious work he recommence the epistolary intercourse with the province hold for so many hopeless year on the slave trade but now make far more promising by the victory which have be obtain and by the unanimity with which all abolitionist now be resolve to procure emancipation he also recommence he journey through the different part of the island and visit in succession part of scotland almost all england and the whole of wale encourage and interesting the friend of humanity wherever he go and form local society and committee for further the common object but it be after all in parliament that the battle must be fight and mr buxton of whose invaluable service in the house of common the cause have lately be deprive repeatedly with the support of messr wilberforce william smith brougham lushington and other urge the necessity of interference upon the representative of a people unanimous in demand it and he repeatedly urge it in vain the government always lean towards the planter and the most flimsy excuse be constantly give for prefer to the effectual measure propound by the abolitionist the most flimsy of expedient useless for any one purpose save that of make pretence and gain time at length come the great case of the missionary smith 's persecution trial and untimely death when all the form of judicature have be prostitute all the rule of law break all the principle of justice outrage by man assume to sit in judgment as a court of criminal jurisprudence and though assist by legal functionary exhibit such a spectacle of daring violation of the most receive and best know canon of procedure as no civilized community ever before be call upon to endure this subject be immediately bring before parliament by mr brougham and he motion of censure which might have be a impeachment of the governor and the court of demerara be powerfully support by mr wilberforce the amiable eloquent and venerable leader of the party mr denman mr william and dr lushington but reject by a majority of the common whom mr canning lead in a speech little worthy of he former exertion against the slave trade and far from be creditable either to he judgment or to he principle yet this memorable debate be of singular service to the cause the great speech deliver be spread through all part of the country the nakedness of the horrid system be expose the corruption as well as cruelty of slavery be lay bare the determination of colony to protect its worst abuse be demonstrate necessity of the mother-country interfere with a strong hand be declare and even the loss of the motion show the people of england how much they own exertion be still require if they would see slavery extirpate by prove that upon they alone the fate of the execrable system hang the effect of this great debate can not be over estimate the case of the missionary become the universal topic the name of the martyred smith the general rally cry the superior interest excite by individual suffering to any general misery inflict upon mass of the people or any evil however gigantic which operate over a large space and in a course of time have always be observe the remark be peculiarly applicable in this instance although all reflect man have for many long year be well aware of the evil pervade we colonial system and though the iniquity and perverseness of west indian judicature have long be the topic of universal comment yet this single case of a persecute individual fall a victim to those gross perversion of law and justice which be familiar to the colonial people produce a impression far more general and more deep than all that have ever be write or declaim against system of west indium slavery and look back on the consummation of all we hope in 1833 and 1838 we at once revert from this auspicious era to that ever memorable occasion as have lay the solid foundation of we ultimate triumph in this important day which have thus by its effect prove decisive of the emancipation question mr stephen bear no part he have long cease to adorn and enlighten the house of common he retirement be the result of honest difference of opinion respect west indium slavery with he political friend then in the plenitude of they power those difference cause he to take the noble part so rarely act by politician of withdraw from parliament rather than lend he great support to man with whom he differ upon a question admit no compromise and he devote he exertion in private life to the furtherance of the cause ever nearest he heart the publication of he able and elaborate work on the colonial slave law be the fruit of he leisure and have he never lend any other aid to the emancipation this would alone have place he high among its most able and effective supporter in all the consultation which be hold before mr brougham 's motion in 1824 he bear a active and useful part in push the advantage gain by the debate he be unwearied and successful unhappily it pleased providence that he should not receive here below the final reward of he long and value labor for he be call to he final repose some month before the emancipation bill pass into a law there remain little to add except that this measure which be carry with little opposition in 1833 owe its success in parliament to the ample bribe of twenty million by which the acquiescence of the west indian be purchase the measure have hardly come into operation when all man perceive that the intermediate state of apprenticeship be anything rather than a preparation for freedom and anything rather than a mitigation of slavery it be due to some able and distinguished friend of the negro race to state that they all along be averse to this plan of a transition state lord howick then in the colonial office as under-secretary go so far as to leave the department from he dislike of this part of the measure mr buxton and other protest against it even its friend intimate that they wish the period of apprenticeship to end in 1838 instead of 1840 but there be a general belief of the preparatory step be necessary -- a belief apparently found on experience of the negro character and indeed of the vicious tendency of all slavery to extinguish the power of voluntary labor as well as to make the sudden change to freedom unsafe for the peace of the community the fact soon disperse these opinion antigua in a minute emancipate all she slave to the number of thirty thousand and upward not a complaint be ever hear of idleness or indolence and far from any breach of the peace be induce by the sudden change in the condition of the people the christmas of 1833 be the first for the last twenty year that martial law be not proclaim in order to preserve the public peace similar evidence from jamaica and other island prove the industrious and peaceable habit of the apprentice show that there be nothing peculiar in the circumstance of antigua a important occurrence be now to be record as have exercise a powerful influence upon the question of immediate emancipation joseph sturge of birmingham a member of the society of friend stricken with a sense of the injustice perpetrate against the african race repair to the west indy in order that he might examine with he own eye the real state of the question between the two class he be accompany by john scoble and thoma harvey and these able excellent and zealous man return in a few month with such ample evidence of the effect produce by apprenticeship and the fitness of the negro for liberty that the attention of the community be soon awaken to the subject even more strenuously than it ever before have be and the wall of parliament be soon make once more to ring with the suffering of the slave only emancipate in name and the injustice of withholding from he any longer the freedom which be he indefeasible right as soon as he be show capable of enjoy it beneficially for himself and safely for the rest of the community in these transaction both in jamaica where he be one of the largest planter and in parliament where he be one of the most respected member the marquess of sligo bear a eminent and a honorable part he praise have be justly sound by all who have support the cause of negro freedom and he conduct be by all admit to be as much mark by the disinterested virtue of a good citizen and amiable man as it be by the sagacity and ability of a enlighten statesman both as governor of jamaica as the owner of slave whom he voluntarily liberate and as a peer of parliament he patriotism he humanity and he talent shine conspicuously through this severe and glorious struggle while such be the conduct of those eminent philanthropist some difference of opinion prevail among the other and older leader of the cause chiefly ground upon doubt whether the arrangement make by parliament in 1833 might not be regard as a compact with the planter which it would be unjust to violate by terminate they right to the labor of the apprentice at a period earlier than the one fix in the emancipation act a little consideration of the question at issue soon dispel those doubt and remove every obstacle to unite exertion by restore entire unanimity of opinion the slave it be triumphantly affirm be no party to the compact but moreover the whole arrangement of the apprenticeship be intend as a benefit to they by give they the preparation think to be require before they could safely for themselves be admit to unrestricted freedom -- not as a benefit to the planter whose acquiescence be purchase with the grant of twenty million experience have show that no preparation at all be require it be preposterous to continue the restraint upon natural liberty a hour longer as regard the negro -- the only party whom we have any right to consider in the question and as for the planter there be the grossest absurdity in further regard any interest or any claim of theirs the arrangement of 1833 as far as regard the transition or intermediate state have be make under a error in fact a error propagate by the representation of the master that error be now at a end and a immediate alteration of the provision to which it have give rise be thus a matter of strict justice -- not to mention that the planter have fail to perform they part of the contract the colonial assembly have except in antigua do nothing for the slave in return for the large sum bestow upon the west indium body so that in any view there be a end of all pretext for the further delay of right and justice the ground now take by the whole abolitionist therefore both in and out of parliament be that the two year which remain of the indentured apprenticeship must immediately be cut off and freedom give to the slave in August 1838 instead of 1840 the peace of the west indian community and the real interest of the planter be affirm to be as much concern in this change as the rights of the negro themselves far from prepare they for become peaceable subject and contented member of society at the end of they apprenticeship those two year of compulsory labor would it be justly observe be a period of heart-burning and discontent between master and servant which must in the mean while be dangerous to the peace of society and must leave at the end of the time a feeling of mutual ill-will and distrust the question could no longer be keep from the cognizance of the negro people indeed they most anxious expectation be already pointed towards immediate liberty and they strongest feeling be rouse to obtain it of these sentiment the whole community partook meeting be everywhere hold petition crowd the table of parliament the press pour forth innumerable tract which be eagerly receive the pulpit lend its aid to this holy cause and discussion upon petition and upon incidental motion shake the wall of parliament while they stimulate the zeal of the people the government adopt a unfortunate course which contribute greatly to weaken they hold on the confidence and affection of the country they resist all the motion that be make on behalf of the slave and appear to regard only the interest of the master turn a deaf ear to the argument of right and of justice it be find during the course of these debate that a new slave trade have spring up in the east indy with the sanction of a english order in council under pretence that hand be want to cultivate they estate the demerara planter have obtain permission to import what they term with a delicacy borrow from the vocabulary of the african slave trade labourer from asia and from africa east of the cape and to make they indentured apprentice for a term of year no restriction whatever be impose by this unheard-of order no tonnage be require in proportion to the number ship no amount of provision no medical assistance no precaution be take or so much as thought of to prevent kidnapping and fraud nay to prevent main force be use in any part of eastern africa or of all asia in carry on board the victim of west indian avarice in short a worse slave trade than the african be establish and all the dominion of the east indium company with all the african and asiatic coast as yet independent be give over to its ravages this be repeatedly denounce by lord brougham in the house of lord and although he motion for rescind the order be support by lord lyndhurst lord ellenborough and lord wharncliffe the influence of the government and the planter prevail and the house reject it a bill be afterwards bring in to check the enormity complain of but no remedy at all effectual be as yet apply the official document however prove that already man have be inveigle on board by the agent of the mauritius planter in different part of the east and that the mortality on that comparatively short voyage exceed even the dreadful waste of life which have characterize and impress with mark of horrid atrocity the accursed middle passage this subject as might well be expect once more rouse the energy of thoma clarkson : he address a able and convincing letter to lord brougham he old friend and coadjutor in the sacred cause and it be print and universally circulate the subject still remain unsettled : and the labor of the enlighten philanthropist can not now be direct to one more important or more urgent meanwhile in the spring of 1838 the question of immediate emancipation be agitate throughout the country the government prove hostile immense meeting be hold at exeter hall which be attend by many member of parliament over which lord brougham preside among other who be present and bear a distinguished part be certain representative of ireland who promise they strenuous support it be a painful duty to add that they fellow-member from ireland do not on this great occasion follow they good example for eleven only of those on whose vote reliance have be place oppose the government while no less than twenty-seven give they support the question be reject by the house of lord when bring forward by lord brougham but in spite of the effort of the government the defalcation of the irish of a still greater proportion of the scotch representative two hundred and seventeen member of the house of common vote for immediate abolition out of four hundred and eighty-nine who be present on the occasion a second effort in the same session place minister in a minority but they immediately give notice they should strenuously oppose any attempt to carry into practical effect this decision of the house and in this determination they be support by a majority on a third division the word however have go forth all over england that the _ slave should be free _ it have not only pervaded europe it have reach america and the west indian at length perceive that they could no longer resist the voice of the british people when it speak the accent of humanity and of justice the slave would have meet the dawn of the first of August -- the day which all the motion in parliament and all the prayer of the petition have fix -- with perfect quiet but with a resolute determination to do no work the peace would not have be break but no more would a clod have be turn after that appoint sun have rise a handful of whites surround by myriad of negro -- now substantially free and free without a blow -- must have be overwhelm in a hour after sunrise on that day have they resist the colonial legislature therefore _ now _ listen to the voice of reason and they one after another emancipate they slave the first of August see not a bondsman under whatever appellation in any part of the western sea which own the british rule the mauritius however still hold out and on the mauritius the hand of the imperial parliament must and will be lay to enforce mercy and justice on those to whom mercy and justice have so long call aloud in vain in truth if the case for instant emancipation be strong everywhere it be in no quarter half so strong as in the mauritius and the distribution of the grant by parliament to this colony be the most unjustifiable and even incomprehensible for elsewhere there exist at least a title to the slave over whom a unjust and unchristian law recognize the right of property but in the mauritius there be not nor be there now one negro to whom a good title be clearly provable the atrocious conduct of governor and other functionary in connive at the slave trade of eastern africa have fill that colony with thousand of negro every one of whom be carry there by the commission of felony long after slave trading have be declare a capital crime by the law of the land as by the law of nature it always be sir george murray when colonial secretary of state have admit that at least thirty thousand of the negro in the settlement be nominally slave but in reality free have be carry thither contrary to law he understate it by twenty thousand or more : yet on all these negro in respect of property be two million and more claim : for all these the compensation money be give and take which parliament have lavishly bestow how then be it possible to doubt that every slave in the mauritius should receive he freedom when the only ground allege for not single out and liberating this fifty thousand be the inability to distinguish they from the rest if ten man be try for a offence and it be clear that five be innocent though you can not distinguish they from they companion what jury will hesitate in acquit the whole on the ordinary principle of its be better five guilty should escape than five guiltless suffer the same be still the state of the case in that most criminal settlement which have far surpass all other in the enormity of its guilt be now the only one where no attempt have be make to evince repentance by amendment of conduct but the government which have the power of compelling justice will share the crime which they refuse to prevent and the legislature must compel the government if they guilty reluctance shall continue or it will take that guilt upon itself -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : it be truly gratifying to state that the late secretary for the colony lord glenelg have since this be write give the most satisfactory assurance of order have be send over for immediate emancipation in case the former instruction to the governor of mauritius should have fail to make the colonist themselves adopt the measure lord glenelg 's conduct on this occasion be most creditable to he -rrb- the latest act of thoma clarkson 's life have be one which or rather the occasion for which it be truly painful to contemplate but this too must be record or the present historical sketch would be incomplete he whose day have all be spend in act of kindness and of justice to other be at last force to exert he power suppose by some and erroneously suppose to be enfeebled by age in obtain redress for he own wrong he whose thought have all be devote to the service of he fellow-creature be now oblige to think of himself a life spend in work of genuine philanthropy alike stand aloof from party and retire with genuine humility from the public gaze might have well hope to escape that detraction which be the lot of those who assume the lead station among they contemporary and mingle in the contentious scene of worldly affair or at least it might have be expect that he traducer would only be find among the oppressor of the new world or the slave-trader of the old this felicity have not be he lot and the evening of he day have be overcast by a assault upon he character proceed from the quarter of all other the most unexpected and the most strange the son of he old and dear friend william wilberforce -- whose incomparable merit he have ever be the first to acknowledge whom he love as a brother and revere as the great leader of the cause to which he whole life have be devote -- in publish a life of they illustrious parent think fit to charge thoma clarkson with have suppress he service while he exaggerate he own and not content with bring a charge utterly groundless -lrb- as it be instantly prove -rrb- they deem it worthy of they subject and of they name to drag forth into the light of day a private correspondence of a delicate nature with the purpose of prove that they father and other have assist he with money and that he have be press in he demand of a subscription two extract of letter of he be print by these reverend gentleman upon which a statement be afterwards ground in the _ edinburgh review _ of they book that the subscription be raise to remunerate he for he service in the abolition they further assert that they father be in the field before he and that it be under they father 's direction that he and the abolition committee of 1786 act in the whole history of controversy we venture to affirm there never be a instance of so triumphant a refutation as that by which these slanderous aspersion be instantly refute and they author and they accomplice reduce to a silence as prudent as discreditable the venerable philanthropist take up he pen wear down in the cause of humanity and of justice _ first _ he show by incontrovertible evidence the utter falsehood of the charge that he have underrate the merit of other and exalt he own these proof be the reference to he volume themselves which it really seem as if the two reverend author have never even look into he then prove to demonstration that he have take the field earlier than william wilberforce this be show first by known date matter of history next by letter from the friend of both party as archdeacon corbet and william smith but lastly by the word of william wilberforce himself as well privately as at public meeting assert that he -lrb- william wilberforce -rrb- come into the field after he value friend but a striking fact may be cite as a sample at once of the course pursue by the assailant and the completeness of the defense the reverend author in proof of they unqualified assertion that thoma clarkson and the committee act from the first under william wilberforce 's direction refer to m minute of the committee for they authority but the friend who so ably superintend the publication of thoma clarkson 's defense and who add to that tract a appendix of singular merit and great interest -lrb- hc robinson -rrb- show that the part refer to by the reverend author in proof of they assertion completely disprove it and that six month after the committee have be work william wilberforce apply to they for any information of which they might be possess on the subject of the slave trade but the publication of the letter and the color give to the transaction be far worse the preservation of that correspondence at all by the son could only be justify by the belief of its be accidentally keep by the father but of course never intend to be make public least of all without the usual precaution of ask the writer 's leave and give he the opportunity of explain it the biographer print it without any kind of communication with he and he see it for the first time in print then the attempt be make to represent this pure and valuable and disinterested man as a mendicant philanthropist who for he exertion in the cause of justice stoop to the humiliating attitude of collect a remuneration from he friend the word of william wilberforce and other abolition leader prove that he have expend a very considerable portion of he own small patrimony in the cause and that the subscription be to pay a debt -- a just and lawful debt not to confer a bounty or reward or remuneration for service perform it be also prove that after be reimburse to the amount of the sum contribute or rather levy on those for whom the poorest of they body have advance he own money he remain out of pocket far more than other have ever give after they share of the repayment be credit to they in this debtor and creditor account but this be not all : mr wilberforce himself then a man of ample fortune and member for yorkshire have in 1807 publish a pamphlet in the cause the minute of the committee for 6th June 1811 contain a entry of a order to pay 83_l _ out of the subscription fund to mr cadell be mr wilberforce 's share of the loss sustain by that publication there have be no mention at all of this in he life by these reverend author who scruple not to print the garbled letter with the manifest design of lower the character of they father 's friend by rank he among venal stipendiary pretender to philanthropy and job mendicant patriot wherefore it may be ask be this matter at all drag forth to light except to effect that unworthy purpose and to give pain to a man as eminently as deservedly respect and beloved the false pretext be the vindication of they father 's memory -- but it have never be attack they affect to suppose such a attack that they may have a pretext for inflict a wound in a fictitious and almost a fraudulent defense -- but if it have be ever so rudely attack the letter be no defense for the only possible pretence of attack be the notion of thoma clarkson have assume the priority and these letter can have no earthly relation to that point whether wilberforce or clarkson or neither of they first begin the abolition struggle be a question as utterly wide of the subscription as any one private matter in the life of either party can be of any one public transaction in which both be engage the indignation of mankind be awaken by this disgraceful proceeding and it be in vain that the friend of the wilberforce urge as some extenuation of they offence the zeal which they naturally cherish for the memory of they parent man of reflection feel that no well-regulated mind can ever engage in slander one person for the purpose of elevate another man of ordinary discernment perceive that the assault on clarkson 's reputation have no possible tendency to raise wilberforce 's reputation man of observation see at once that there lurk behind the wish to praise the one party a desire to wind the other and give they far less credit for over-anxiety to gratify they filial affection than eagerness to indulge they hostile feeling it be plain too that they seek this gratification at the hazard of bring a stain upon the memory of they father for what could be more natural than the suspicion that they have obtain from he the material out of which they web of detraction be weave and what more discreditable to the author of the affectionate and familiar letter of wilberforce to clarkson than they discrepancy with the charge now urge against he it be due to the memory of this venerable man now go to he rest to say that no one who know he ever so slightly could believe in the possibility of he hold one language to he friend and another to he child : far less of he bequeath to they anything like material for the attack upon one to whom he profess the most warm and steady attachment but if such be the conclusion of all who know the man assuredly in arrive at it they have derive no help from the light afford by he family the vindication of thoma clarkson have be triumphant the punishment of he traducer have be exemplary he character stand higher than ever he name be lofty and it be unsullied they have a character to retrieve -- a name which they have tarnish since it descend upon they they have to restore by they own future desert the astonishment of the world be at its pitch when the champion of abolition the steady ally of thoma clarkson and granville sharpe the _ edinburgh review _ be see attempt to rescue these party and take part against the injured man the patriarch of a cause defend by that celebrated journal during a brilliant period of much above thirty year the boldness display in its page on this occasion be excessive as if feeling that the weak and indefensible part in the assault be the publishing of the letter it have the confidence to affirm that this proceeding be call for in justice to wilberforce 's memory so daring a attempt upon the integrity of fact have not often be witness what the publication of these letter which have no possible connexion with wilberforce 's character -lrb- a character indeed that no one have assail -rrb- letter which be absolutely foreign even to the question of priority in the abolition cause -- the publication of these necessary to the defense of wilberforce then upon what ground necessary how have he be attack where be he to be defend but if attack how do the letter aid -- how connect themselves with -- how in any manner of way bear upon the defense or any defense or any portion of wilberforce 's character and life they show he to have contribute towards the payment of a debt he have contract to clarkson but who have ever charge he with refuse to pay he debt with he merit as to the abolition -lrb- if that be what be mean by he character -rrb- -- merit which it be a mere fabrication to pretend that clarkson have ever be slow to acknowledge -- those letter have absolutely no possible connexion and whoever on this score affect to defend this publication be capable of vindicate the print any private letter upon the most delicate subject by any man who write the history of any other affair or who write on any subject from which the correspondence be wholly foreign it be proper to add that the editor of this journal have most properly publish a retractation of the charge make in they ignorance of the whole fact of the case the acute and sagacious editor of t clarkson 's vindication have give he reason for suspect that this criticism in the _ edinburgh review _ must have proceed from some party directly concern in the publication of wilberforce 's life we enter into no discussion of the circumstantial evidence adduce in favor of this supposition the editor of the journal be the party to whom we look and as they after be to all appearance mislead by some partial writer have make the best reparation for a involuntary error by do justice to the injured party we can have no further remark to make upon the subject but it be impossible to close these page without mention the extraordinary merit of this latest and in all likelihood this last production of clarkson 's pen it be indeed a most able performance and have be admire by some of the ablest controversial writer of the age as a model of excellence in controversial write plain vigorous convincing perfectly calm and temperate devoid of all acrimony barely say enough to repel unjust aggression without one word of retaliation never lose sight for a moment of its purely defensive object and accordingly from the singleness of purpose with which that object be pursue attain it with the most triumphant success -- no wonder that the public judgment have be loudly and universally pronounce in its favor that its adversary have be reduce to absolute silence that its author 's name have be exalt even higher than before it stand but the wonder be to see such unimpaired vigor at four-score year of age after a life of unwearied labor latterly cloud by domestic calamity and a spirit as young as ever in zeal for justice temper only by the mellowness which the kindly heart spread over the fruit of the manly understanding there want no testimonial of esteem from he country to consummate the venerable philanthropist 's renown yet these too have be add various meeting have address they gratulation to he of these the great corporation of london claim the first regard and after present he with the freedom of the city they have order to be erect in they hall as a memorial of he extraordinary virtue a likeness of the mortal form of thoma clarkson \* \* \* \* \* history of the abolition of the slave trade \* \* \* \* \* chapter i no subject more please than that of the removal of evil -- evil have exist almost from the beginning of the world but there be a power in we nature to counteract they -- this power increase by christianity -- of the evil remove by christianity one of the greatest be the slave trade -- the joy we ought to feel on its abolition from a contemplation of the nature of it and of the extent of it and of the difficulty of subdue it -- usefulness also of the contemplation of this subject i scarcely know of any subject the contemplation of which be more please than that of the correction or of the removal of any of the acknowledged evil of life for while we rejoice to think that the suffering of we fellow-creature have be thus in any instance relieve we must rejoice equally to think that we own moral condition must have be necessarily improve by the change that evil both physical and moral have exist long upon earth there can be no doubt one of the sacred writer to whom we more immediately appeal for the early history of mankind inform we that the state of we first parent be a state of innocence and happiness but that soon after they creation sin and misery enter into the world the poet in they fable most of which however extravagant they may seem have they origin in truth speak the same language some of these represent the first condition of man by the figure of the golden and he subsequent degeneracy and subjection to suffer by that of the silver and afterwards of the iron age other tell we that the first female be make of clay that she be call pandora because every necessary gift qualification or endowment be give to she by the god but that she receive from jupiter at the same time a box from which when open a multitude of disorder spring and that these spread themselves immediately afterwards among all of the human race thus it appear whatever authority we consult that those which may be term the evil of life exist in the earliest time and what do subsequent history combine with we own experience tell we but that these have be continue or that they have come down in different degree through successive generation of man in all the known country of the universe to the present day but though the inequality visible in the different condition of life and the passion interweave into we nature -lrb- both which have be allot to we for wise purpose and without which we could not easily afford a proof of the existence of that which be denominate virtue -rrb- have a tendency to produce vice and wretchedness among we yet we see in this we constitution what may operate partially as preventive and corrective of they if there be a radical propensity in we nature to do that which be wrong there be on the other hand a counteract power within it or a impulse by means of the action of the divine spirit upon we mind which urge we to do that which be right if the voice of temptation clothe in musical and seduce accent charm we one way the voice of holiness speak to we from within in a solemn and powerful manner command we another do one man obtain a victory over he corrupt affection a immediate perception of pleasure like the feeling of a reward divinely confer upon he be notice do another fall prostrate beneath they power a painful feeling and such as pronounce to he the sentence of reproof and punishment be find to follow if one by suffer he heart to become harden oppress a fellow-creature the tear of sympathy start up in the eye of another and the latter instantly feel a desire involuntarily generate of fly to he relief thus impulse feeling and disposition have be implant in we nature for the purpose of prevent and rectify the evil of life and as these have operate so as to stimulate some man to lessen they by the exercise of a amiable charity so they have operate to stimulate other in various other way to the same end hence the philosopher have leave moral precept behind he in favor of benevolence and the legislator have endeavor to prevent barbarous practice by the introduction of law in consequence then of these impulse and feeling by which the pure power in we nature be thus make to act as a check upon the evil part of it and in consequence of the influence which philosophy and legislative wisdom have have in they respective province there have be always in all time and country a counteract energy which have oppose itself more or less to the crime and misery of mankind but it seem to have be reserve for christianity to increase this energy and to give it the widest possible domain it be reserve for she under the same divine influence to give the best view of the nature and of the present and future condition of man to afford the best moral precept to communicate the most benign stimulus to the heart to produce the most blameless conduct and thus to cut off many of the cause of wretchedness and to heal it wherever it be find at she command wherever she have be duly acknowledge many of the evil of life have already flee the prisoner of war be no longer lead into the amphitheatre to become a gladiator and to imbrue he hand in the blood of he fellow-captive for the sport of a thoughtless multitude the stern priest cruel through fanaticism and custom no longer lead he fellow-creature to the altar to sacrifice he to fictitious god the venerable martyr courageous through faith and the sanctity of he life be no longer hurry to the flame the haggard witch pore over she incantation by moon-light no longer scatter she superstitious poison among she miserable neighbor nor suffer for she crime but in whatever way christianity may have operate towards the increase of this energy or towards a diminution of human misery it have operate in none more powerfully than by the new view and consequent duty which it introduce on the subject of charity or practical benevolence and love man in ancient time look upon they talent of whatever description as they own which they might use or cease to use at they discretion but the author of we religion be the first who teach that however in a legal point of view the talent of individual might belong exclusively to themselves so that no other person have a right to demand the use of it by force yet in the christian dispensation they be but the steward of it for good that so much be expect from this stewardship that it be difficult for those who be intrust with it to enter into he spiritual kingdom that these have no right to conceal they talent in a napkin but that they be bind to dispense a portion of it to the relief of they fellow-creature and that in proportion to the magnitude of it they be accountable for the extensiveness of its use he be the first who pronounce the misapplication of it to be a crime and to be a crime of no ordinary dimension he be the first who break down the boundary between jew and gentile and therefore the first who point out to man the inhabitant of other country for the exercise of they philanthropy and love hence a distinction be to be make both in the principle and practice of charity as exist in ancient or in modern time though the old philosopher historian and poet frequently inculcate benevolence we have no reason to conclude from any fact they have leave we that person in they day do anything more than occasionally relieve a unfortunate object who might present himself before they or that however they might deplore the existence of public evil among they they join in association for they suppression or that they carry they charity as body of man into other kingdom to christianity alone we be indebted for the new and sublime spectacle of see man go beyond the bound of individual usefulness to each other of see they associate for the extirpation of private and public misery and of see they carry they charity as a unite brotherhood into distant land and in this wider field of benevolence it would be unjust not to confess that no country have shine with more true lustre than we own there be scarcely any case of acknowledged affliction for which some of she christian child have not unite in a attempt to provide relief among the evil correct or subdue either by the general influence of christianity on the mind of man or by particular association of christian the african -lrb- a -rrb- slave trade appear to I to have occupy the foremost place the abolition of it therefore of which it have devolve upon I to write the history should be account as one of the greatest blessing and as such should be one of the most copious source of we joy : indeed i know of no evil the removal of which should excite in we a higher degree of pleasure for in consideration of this kind be we not usually influence by circumstance be not we feeling usually affect accord to the situation or the magnitude or the importance of these be they not more or less elevated as the evil under we contemplation have be more or less productive of misery or more or less productive of guilt be they not more or less elevated again as we have find it more or less considerable in extent we sensation will undoubtedly be in proportion to such circumstance or we joy to the appreciation or mensuration of the evil which have be remove -lrb- footnote a : slavery have be before annihilate by christianity i mean in the west of europe at the close of the twelfth century -rrb- to value the blessing of the abolition as we ought or to appreciate the joy and gratitude which we ought to feel concern it we must enter a little into the circumstance of the trade we statement however of these need not be long : a few page will do all that be necessary a glance only into such a subject as this will be sufficient to affect the heart -- to arouse we indignation and we pity -- and to teach we the importance of the victory obtain the first subject for consideration towards enable we to make the estimate in question will be that of the nature of the evil belong to the slave trade this may be see by examine it in three point of view first as it have be prove to arise on the continent of africa in the course of reduce the inhabitant of it to slavery secondly in the course of convey they from thence to the land or colony of other nation and thirdly in continue they there as slave to see it as it have be show to arise in the first case let we suppose ourselves on the continent just mention well then we be land -- we be already upon we travels -- we have just pass through one forest -- we be now come to a more open place which indicate a approach to habitation and what object be that which first obtrude itself upon we sight who be that wretched woman whom we discover under that noble tree wring she hand and beat she breast as if in the agony of despair three day have she be there at interval to look and to watch and this be the fourth morning and no tiding of she child yet beneath its spreading bough they be accustom to play : but alas the savage man-stealer interrupt they playful mirth and have take they for ever from she sight but let we leave the cry of this unfortunate woman and hasten into another district and what do we first see here who be he that just now start across the narrow pathway as if afraid of a human face what be that sudden rustling among the leaf why be those person fly from we approach and hide themselves in yon darkest thicket behold as we get into the plain a desert village the rice-field have be just trodden down around it a aged man -- venerable by he silver beard -- lie wounded and die near the threshold of he hut war suddenly instigate by avarice have just visit the dwelling which we see the old have be butcher because unfit for slavery and the young have be carry off except such as have fall in the conflict or have escape among the wood behind we but let we hasten from this cruel scene which give rise to so many melancholy reflection let we cross yon distant river and enter into some new domain but be we relieve even here from afflict spectacles look at that immense crowd which appear to be gather in a ring see the accuse innocent in the middle the ordeal of poisonous water have be administer to he as a test of he innocence or he guilt : he begin to be sick and pale alas yon mournful shriek of he relative confirm that the loss of he freedom be now seal and whither shall we go now the night be approach fast let we find some friendly hut where sleep may make we forget for a while the sorrow of the day behold a hospitable native ready to receive we at he door let we avail ourselves of he kindness and now let its give ourselves to repose but why when we eyelid be but just close do we find ourselves thus suddenly awaken what be the meaning of the noise around we of the trampling of people 's foot of the rustling of the bow the quiver and the lance let we rise up and inquire behold the inhabitant be all alarm a wakeful woman have show they yon distant column of smoke and blaze the neighbouring village be on fire : the prince unfaithful to the sacred duty of the protection of he subject have surround they he be now burn they habitation and seize as saleable booty the fugitive from the flame such then be some of the scene that have be pass in africa in consequence of the existence of the slave trade or such be the nature of the evil as it have show itself in the first of the case we have notice let we now estimate it as it have be prove to exist in the second or let we examine the state of the unhappy african reduce to slavery in this manner while on board the vessel which be to convey they across the ocean to other land and here i must observe at once that as far as this part of the evil be concerned i be at a loss to describe it where shall i find word to express properly they sorrow as arise from the reflection of be part for ever from they friend they relative and they country where shall i find language to paint in appropriate color the horror of mind bring on by thought of they future unknown destination of which they can augur nothing but misery from all that they have yet see how shall i make know they situation while labor under painful disease or while struggle in the suffocate hold of they prison like animal enclose in a exhaust receiver how shall i describe they feeling as expose to all the personal indignity which lawless appetite or brutal passion may suggest how shall i exhibit they suffering as determine to refuse sustenance and die or as resolve to break they chain and disdain to live as slave to punish they oppressor how shall i give a idea of they agony when under various punishment and torture for they reputed crime indeed every part of this subject defy my power and i must therefore satisfy myself and the reader with a general representation or in the word of a celebrated member of parliament that never be so much human suffering condensed in so small a space i come now to the evil as it have be prove to arise in the third case or to consider the situation of the unhappy victim of the trade when they painful voyage be over or after they have be land upon they destine shore and here we be to view they first under the degrading light of cattle : we be to see they examine handle select separated and sell alas relative be separate from relative as if like cattle they have no rational intellect no power of feel the nearness of relationship nor sense of the duty belong to the tie of life we be next to see they labor and this for the benefit of those to whom they be under no obligation by any law either natural or divine to obey we be to see they if refuse the command of they purchaser however weary or feeble or indisposed subject to corporal punishment and if forcibly resist they to death : we be to see they in a state of general degradation and misery the knowledge which they oppressor have of they own crime in have violate the rights of nature and of the disposition of the injure to seek all opportunity of revenge produce a fear which dictate to they the necessity of a system of treatment by which they shall keep up a wide distinction between the two and by which the noble feeling of the latter shall be keep down and they spirit break we be to see they again subject to individual persecution as anger or malice or any bad passion may suggest : hence the whip the chain the iron-collar hence the various mode of private torture of which so many account have be truly give nor can such horrible cruelty be discover so as to be make punishable while the testimony of any number of the oppressed be invalid against the oppressor however they may be offence against the law and lastly we be to see they innocent offspring against whose personal liberty the shadow of a argument can not be advance inherit all the misery of they parent ' lot the evil then as far as it have be hitherto view present to we in its three several department a measure of human suffering not to be equal -- not to be calculate -- not to be describe but would that we could consider this part of the subject as dismiss would that in each of the department now examine there be no counterpart leave we to contemplate but this can not be for if there be person who suffer unjustly there must be other who oppress : and if there be those who oppress there must be to the suffering which have be occasion a corresponding portion of immorality or guilt we be oblige then to view the counterpart of the evil in question before we can make a proper estimate of the nature of it and in examine this part of it we shall find that we have a no less frightful picture to behold than in the former case or that while the misery endure by the unfortunate african excite we pity on the one hand the vice which be connect with they provoke we indignation and abhorrence on the other the slave trade in this point of view must strike we as a immense mass of evil on account of the criminality attach to it as display in the various branch of it which have already be examine for to take the counterpart of the evil in the first of these can we say that no moral turpitude be to be place to the account of those who live on the continent of africa give birth to the enormity which take place in consequence of the prosecution of this trade be not that man make morally worse who be induce to become a tiger to he species or who instigate by avarice lie in wait in the thicket to get possession of he fellow-man be no injustice manifest in the land where the prince unfaithful to he duty seize he innocent subject and sell they for slave be no moral evil produce among those community which make war upon other community for the sake of plunder and without any previous provocation or offence do no crime attach to those who accuse other falsely or who multiply and divide crime for the sake of the profit of the punishment and who for the same reason continue the use of barbarous and absurd ordeal as a test of innocence or guilt in the second of these branch the counterpart of the evil be to be see in the conduct of those who purchase the miserable native in they own country and convey they to distant land and here question similar to the former may be ask do they experience no corruption of they nature or become chargeable with no violation of right who when they go with they ship to this continent know the enormity which they visit there will occasion who buy they fellow-creature man and this know the way in which he come into they hand and who chain and imprison and scourge he do the moral feeling of those person escape without injury whose heart be harden and can the heart of those be otherwise than harden who be familiar with the tear and groan of innocent stranger forcibly tear away from every thing that be dear to they in life who be accustom to see they on board they vessel in a state of suffocation and in the agony of despair and who be themselves in the habit of the cruel use of arbitrary power the counterpart of the evil in its third branch be to be see in the conduct of those who when these miserable people have be land purchase and carry they to they respective home and let we see whether a mass of wickedness be not generate also in the present case can those have nothing to answer for who separate the faithful tie which nature and religion have create can they feeling be otherwise than corrupt who consider they fellow-creature as brute or treat those as cattle who may become the temple of the holy spirit and in whom the divinity disdain not himself to dwell be there no injustice in force man to labor without wages be there no breach of duty when we be command to clothe the naked and feed the hungry and visit the sick and in prison in expose they to want in torture they by cruel punishment and in grind they down by hard labor so as to shorten they day be there no crime in adopt a system which keep down all the noble faculty of they soul and which positively debase and corrupt they nature be there no crime in perpetuate these evil among they innocent offspring and finally besides all these crime be there not naturally in the familiar sight of the exercise but more especially in the exercise itself of uncontrolled power that which vitiate the internal man in see misery stalk daily over the land do not all become insensibly harden by give birth to that misery themselves do they not become abandon in what state of society be the corrupt appetite so easily so quickly and so frequently indulge and where else by means of frequent indulgence do these experience such a monstrous growth where else be the temper subject to such frequent irritation or passion to such little control yes -- if the unhappy slave be in a unfortunate situation so be the tyrant who hold he action and reaction be equal to each other as well in the moral as in the natural world you can not exercise a improper dominion over a fellow-creature but by a wise order of providence you must necessarily injure yourself have now consider the nature of the evil of the slave trade in its three separate department of suffering and in its corresponding counterpart of guilt i shall make a few observation on the extent of it on this subject it must strike we that the misery and the crime include in the evil as it have be find in africa be not like common malady which make a short or periodical visit and then be go but that they be continue daily nor be they like disease which from local cause attack a village or a town and by the skill of the physician under the blessing of providence be remove but they affect a whole continent the trade with all its horror begin at the river senegal and continue wind with the coast through its several geographical division to cape negro a distance of more than three thousand mile in various line or path form at right angle from the shore and pass into the heart of the country slave be procure and bring down the distance which many of they travel be immense those who have be in africa have assure we that they come as far as from the source of they largest river which we know to be many hundred mile inland and the native have tell we in they way of computation that they come a journey of many moon it must strike we again that the misery and the crime include in the evil as it have be show in the transportation have no ordinary bound they be not to be see in the cross of a river but of a ocean they do not begin in the morning and end at night but be continue for many week and sometimes by casualty for a quarter of the year they be not limit to the precinct of a solitary ship but be spread among many vessel and these be so constantly pass that the ocean itself never cease to be a witness of they existence and it must strike we finally that the misery and crime include in the evil as it have be find in foreign land be not confine within the shore of a little island most of the island of a continent and many of these of considerable population and extent be fill with they and the continent itself to which these geographically belong be widely polluted by they domain hence if we be to take the vast extent of space occupy by these crime and suffering from the heart of africa to its shore and that which they fill on the continent of america and the island adjacent and be to join the crime and suffering in one to those in the other by the crime and suffering which take place in the track of the vessel successively cross the atlantic we should behold a vast belt as it be of physical and moral evil reach through land and ocean to the length of nearly half the circle of the globe the next view which i shall take of this evil will be as it relate to the difficulty of subdue it this difficulty may be suppose to have be more than ordinarily great many evil of a public nature which exist in former time be the offspring of ignorance and superstition and they be subdue of course by the progress of light and knowledge but the evil in question begin in avarice it be nurse also by worldly interest it do not therefore so easily yield to the usual corrective of disorder in the world we may observe also that the interest by which it be thus support be not that of a few individual nor of one body but of many body of man it be interwoven again into the system of the commerce and of the revenue of nation hence the merchant -- the planter -- the mortgagee -- the manufacturer -- the politician -- the legislator -- the cabinet-minister -- lift up they voice against the annihilation of it for these reason the slave trade may be consider like the fabulous hydra to have a hundred head every one of which it be necessary to cut off before it could be subdue and as none but hercule be fit to conquer the one so nothing less than extraordinary prudence courage labor and patience could overcome the other to protection in this manner by he hundred interest it be owe that the monster stalk in security for so long a time he stalk too in the open day commit he mighty depredation and when good man whose duty it be to mark he as the object of they destruction begin to assail he he do not fly but gnash he tooth at they growl savagely at the same time and put himself into a posture of defiance we see then in whatever light we consider the slave trade whether we examine into the nature of it or whether we look into the extent of it or whether we estimate the difficulty of subdue it we must conclude that no evil more monstrous have ever exist upon earth but if so then we have prove the truth of the position that the abolition of it ought to be account by we as one of the greatest blessing and that it ought to be one of the most copious source of we joy indeed i do not know how we can sufficiently express what we ought to feel upon this occasion it become we as individual to rejoice it become we as a nation to rejoice it become we even to perpetuate we joy to we posterity i do not mean however by anniversary which be to be celebrate by the ringing of bell and convivial meeting but by hand down this great event so impressively to we child as to raise in they if not continual yet frequently renew thanksgiving to the great creator of the universe for the manifestation of this he favor in have dispose we legislator to take away such a portion of suffer from we fellow-creature and such a load of guilt from we native land and as the contemplation of the removal of this monstrous evil should excite in we the most please and grateful sensation so the perusal of the history of it should afford we lesson which it must be useful to we to know or to be remind of for it can not be otherwise than useful to we to know the means which have be use and the different person who have move in so great a cause it can not be otherwise than useful to we to be impressively remind of the simple axiom which the perusal of this history will particularly suggest to we that the greatest work must have a beginning because the foster of such a idea in we mind can not but encourage we to undertake the removal of evil however vast they may appear in they size or however difficult to overcome it can not again be otherwise than useful to we to be assure -lrb- and this history will assure we of it -rrb- that in any work which be a work of righteousness however small the beginning may be or however small the progress may be that we may make in it we ought never to despair for that whatever check and discouragement we may meet with no virtuous effort be ever ultimately lose and finally it can not be otherwise than useful to we to form the opinion which the contemplation of this subject must always produce namely that many of the evil which be still leave among we may by a union of wise and virtuous individual be greatly alleviate if not entirely do away for if the great evil of the slave trade so deeply entrench by its hundred interest have fall prostrate before the effort of those who attack it what evil of a less magnitude shall not be more easily subdue o may reflection of this sort always enliven we always encourage we always stimulate we to we duty may we never cease to believe that many of the misery of life be still to be remedy or to rejoice that we may be permit if we will only make ourselves worthy by we endeavor to heal they may we encourage for this purpose every generous sympathy that arise in we heart as the offspring of the divine influence for we good convinced that we be not bear for ourselves alone and that the divinity never so fully dwell in we as when we do he will and that we never do he will more agreeably as far as it have be reveal to we than when we employ we time in work of charity towards the rest of we fellow-creatures chapter ii as it be desirable to know the true source of event in history so this will be realize in that of the abolition of the slave trade -- inquiry as to those who favor the cause of the african previously to the year 1787 -- all these to be consider as necessary forerunner in that cause -- first forerunner be cardinal ximene the emperor charle the fifth pope leo the tenth elizabeth queen of england loui the thirteenth of france it would be consider by many who have stand at the mouth of a river and witness its torrent there to be both a interesting and a please journey to go to the fountain head and then to travel on its bank downward and to mark the different stream in each side which should run into it and feed it so i presume the reader will not be a little interested and entertain in view with I the course of the abolition of the slave trade in first find its source and then in trace the different spring which have contribute to its increase and here i may observe that in do this we shall have advantage which historian have not always have in develop the cause of thing many have hand down to we event for the production of which they have give we but they own conjecture there have be often indeed such a distance between the event themselves and the life of those who have record they that the different means and motive belong to they have be lose through time on the present occasion however we shall have the peculiar satisfaction of know that we communicate the truth or that those which we unfold be the true cause and mean for the most remote of all the human spring which can be trace as have any bearing upon the great event in question will fall within the period of three century and the most powerful of they within the last twenty year these circumstance indeed have have they share in induce I to engage in the present history have i measure it by the importance of the subject i have be deter but believe that most reader love the truth and that it ought to be the object of all writer to promote it and believe moreover that i be in possession of more fact on this subject than any other person i think i be peculiarly call to undertake it in trace the different stream from whence the torrent arise which have now happily sweep away the slave trade i must begin with a inquiry as to those who favor the cause of the injured african from the year 1516 to the year 1787 at which latter period a number of person associate themselves in england for its abolition for though they who belong to this association may in consequence of have pursue a regular system be call the principal actor yet it must be acknowledge that they effort would never have be so effectual if the mind of man have not be prepare by other who have move before they great event have never take place without previously dispose cause so it be in the case before we hence they who live even in early time and favor this great cause may be say to have be necessary precursor in it and here it may be proper to observe that it be by no means necessary that all these should have be themselves actor in the production of this great event person have contribute towards it in different way : -- some have write expressly on the subject who have have no opportunity of promote it by personal exertion other have only mention it incidentally in they writings other in a elevated rank and station have cry out publicly concern it whose saying have be record all these however may be consider as necessary forerunner in they day for all of they have bring the subject more or less into notice they have more or less enlighten the mind upon it they have more or less impressed it and therefore each may be say to have have he share in diffusing and keep up a certain portion of knowledge and feeling concern it which have be eminently useful in the promotion of the cause it be rather remarkable that the first forerunner and coadjutor should have be man in power so early as in the year 1503 a few slave have be send from the portuguese settlement in africa into the spanish colony in america in 1511 ferdinand the fifth king of spain permit they to be carry in great number ferdinand however must have be ignorant in these early time of the piratical manner in which the portuguese have procure they he could have know nothing of they treatment when in bondage nor could he have view the few uncertain adventurous transportation of they into he dominion in the western world in the light of a regular trade after he death however a proposal be make by bartholomew de las casas the bishop of chiapa to cardinal ximene who hold the reign of the government of spain till charle the fifth come to the throne for the establishment of a regular system of commerce in the person of the native african the object of bartholomew de las casas be undoubtedly to save the american indian whose cruel treatment and almost extirpation he have witness during he residence among they and in whose behalf he have undertake a voyage to the court of spain it be difficult to reconcile this proposal with the humane and charitable spirit of the bishop of chiapa but it be probable he believe that a code of law would soon be establish in favor both of african and of the native in the spanish settlement and that he flatter himself that be about to return and to live in the country of they slavery he could look to the execution of it the cardinal however with a foresight a benevolence and a justice which will always do honor to he memory refuse the proposal not only judge it to be unlawful to consign innocent people to slavery at all but to be very inconsistent to deliver the inhabitant of one country from a state of misery by consign to it those of another ximene therefore may be consider as one of the first great friend of the african after the partial beginning of the trade this answer of the cardinal as it show he virtue as a individual so be it peculiarly honorable to he as a public man and ought to operate as a lesson to other statesman how they admit any thing new among political regulation and establishment which be connect in the smallest degree with injustice for evil when once sanction by government spread in a tenfold degree and may unless seasonably check become so ramify as to effect the reputation of a country and to render its own removal scarcely possible without detriment to the political concern of the state in no instance have this be verify more than in the case of the slave trade never be we national character more tarnished and we prosperity more cloud by guilt never be there a monster more difficult to subdue even they who hear as it be the shriek of oppression and wish to assist the sufferer be fearful of join in they behalf while they acknowledge the necessity of remove one evil they be terrify by the prospect of introduce another and be therefore only able to relieve they feeling by lament in the bitterness of they heart that this traffic have ever be begin at all after the death of cardinal ximene the emperor charle the fifth who have come into power encourage the slave trade in 1517 he grant a patent to one of he flemish favorite contain a exclusive right of import four thousand african into america but he live long enough to repent of what he have thus inconsiderately do for in the year 1542 he make a code of law for the better protection of the unfortunate indian in he foreign dominion and he stop the progress of african slavery by a order that all slave in he american island should he make free this order be execute by pedro de la gasca manumission take place as well in hispaniolum as on the continent but on the return of gasca to spain and the retirement of charle into a monastery slavery be revive it be impossible to pass over this instance of the abolition of slavery by charle in all he foreign dominion without some comment it show he first to have be a friend both to the indian and the african as a part of the human race it show he be ignorant of what he be do when he give he sanction to this cruel trade it show when legislator give one set of man undue power over another how quickly they abuse it or he never would have find himself oblige in the short space of twenty-five year to undo that which he have countenance as a great state measure and while it confirm the former lesson to statesman of watch the beginning or principle of thing in they political movement it should teach they never to persist in the support of evil through the false shame of be oblige to confess that they have once give they they sanction nor to delay the cure of they because politically speak neither this nor that be the proper season but to do they away instantly as there can only be one fit or proper time in the eye of religion namely on the conviction of they existence from the opinion of cardinal ximene and of the emperor charle the fifth i hasten to that which be express much about the same time in a public capacity by pope leo the tenth the dominican in spanish america witness the cruel treatment which the slave undergo there consider slavery as utterly repugnant to the principle of the gospel and recommend the abolition of it the franciscan do not favor the former in this they scheme of benevolence and the consequence be that a controversy on this subject spring up between they which be carry to this pope for he decision leo exert himself much to he honor in behalf of the poor sufferer and declare that not only the christian religion but that nature herself cry out against a state of slavery this answer be certainly worthy of one who be deem the head of the christian church it must however be confess that it would have be strange if leo in he situation as pontiff have make a different reply he could never have deny that god be no respecter of person he must have acknowledge that man be bind to love each other as brethren and if he admit the doctrine that all man be accountable for they action hereafter he could never have prevent the deduction that it be necessary they should be free nor could he as a man of high attainment live early in the sixteenth century have be ignorant of what have take place in the twelfth or that by the latter end of this latter century christianity have obtain the undisputed honor of have extirpate slavery from the western part of the european world from spain and italy i come to england the first importation of slave from africa by we countryman be in the reign of elizabeth in the year 1562 this great princess seem on the very commencement of the trade to have question its lawfulness she seem to have entertain a religious scruple concern it and indeed to have revolt at the very think of it she seem to have be aware of the evil to which its continuance might lead or that if it be sanction the most unjustifiable means might be make use of to procure the person of the native of africa and in what light she would have view any act of this kind have they take place we may conjecture from this fact -- that when captain -lrb- afterwards sir john -rrb- hawkin return from he first voyage to africa and hispaniolum whither he have carry slave she send for he and as we learn from hill 's _ naval history _ express she concern lest any of the african should be carry off without they free consent declare that it would be detestable and call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertaker captain hawkin promise to comply with the injunction of elizabeth in this respect but he do not keep he word for when he go to africa again he seize many of the inhabitant and carry they off as slave which occasion hill in the account he give of he second voyage to use these remarkable word : -- here begin the horrid practice of force the african into slavery a injustice and barbarity which so sure as there be vengeance in heaven for the worst of crime will some time be the destruction of all who allow or encourage it that the trade should have be suffer to continue under such a princess and after such solemn expression as those which she have be describe to have utter can be only attribute to the pain take by those concern in it to keep she ignorant of the truth from england i now pass over to france labat a roman missionary in he account of the isle of america mention that loui the thirteenth be very uneasy when he be about to issue the edict by which all african come into he colony be to be make slave and that this uneasiness continue till he be assure that the introduction of they in this capacity into he foreign dominion be the readiest way of convert they to the principle of the christian religion these then be the first forerunner in the great cause of the abolition of the slave trade : nor have they service towards it be of small moment for in the first place they have enable those who come after they and who take a active interest in the same cause to state the great authority of they opinion and of they example they have enable they again to detail the history connect with these in consequence of which circumstance have be lay open which it be of great importance to know for have they not enable they to state that the african slave trade never would have be permit to exist but for the ignorance of those in authority concern it -- that at its commencement there be a revolting of nature against it -- a suspicion a caution a fear both as to its unlawfulness and its effect have they not enable they to state that falsehood be advance and these conceal under the mask of religion to deceive those who have the power to suppress it have they not enable they to state that this trade begin in piracy and that it be continue upon the principle of force and finally have not they who have be enable to make these statement know all the circumstance connect with they find they own zeal increase and they own courage and perseverance strengthen and have they not by the communication of they to other produce many friend and even labourer in the cause chapter iii forerunner continue to 1787 divide from this time into four class -- first class consist principally of person in great britain of various description : godwyn baxter tryon southern primatt montesquieu hutcheson sharp ramsay and a multitude of other whose name and service follow i have hitherto trace the history of the forerunner in this great cause only up to about the year 1640 if i be to pursue my plan i be to trace it to the year 1787 but in order to show what i intend in a clearer point of view i shall divide those who have live within this period and who will now consist of person in a less elevated station into four class : and i shall give to each class a distinct consideration by itself several of we old english writer though they have not mention the african slave trade or the slavery consequent upon it in they respective work have yet give they testimony of condemnation against both thus we great milton : -- o execrable son so to aspire above he brethren to himself assume authority usurpt from god not give he give we only over beast fish fowl dominion absolute that right we hold by he donation but man over man he make not lord such title to himself reserve human leave from human free i might mention bishop saunderson and other who bear a testimony equally strong against the lawfulness of trading in the person of man and of hold they in bondage but as i mean to confine myself to those who have favor the cause of the african specifically i can not admit they name into any of the class which have be announce of those who compose the first class define as it have now be i can not name any individual who take a part in this cause till between the year 1670 and 1680 for in the year 1640 and for a few year afterwards the nature of the trade and of the slavery be but little known except to a few individual who be concern in they and it be obvious that these would neither endanger they own interest nor proclaim they own guilt by expose it the first whom i shall mention be morgan godwyn a clergyman of the established church this pious divine write a treatise upon the subject which he dedicate to the then archbishop of canterbury he give it to the world at the time mention under the title of _ the negro ' and indian ' advocate _ in this treatise he lay open the situation of these oppressed people of whose suffering he have be a eye-witness in the island of barbado he call forth the pity of the reader in a affect manner and expose with a nervous eloquence the brutal sentiment and conduct of they oppressor this seem to have be the first work undertake in england expressly in favor of the cause the next person whom i shall mention be richard baxter the celebrated divine among the nonconformist in he _ christian directory _ publish about the same time as _ the negro ' and indian ' advocate _ he give advice to those master in foreign plantation who have negro and other slave in this he protest loudly against this trade he say expressly that they who go out as pirate and take away poor african or people of another land who never forfeit life or liberty and make they slave and sell they be the worst of robber and ought to be consider as the common enemy of mankind and that they who buy they and use they as mere beast for they own convenience regardless of they spiritual welfare be fitter to be call demon than christian he then propose several query which he answer in a clear and forcible manner show the great inconsistency of this traffic and the necessity of treat those then in bondage with tenderness and a due regard to they spiritual concern the _ directory _ of baxter be succeed by a publication call _ friendly advice to the planter _ in three part the first of these be _ a brief treatise of the principal fruit and herb that grow in barbado jamaica and other plantation in the west indy _ the second be _ the negro ' complaint or they hard servitude and the cruelty practice upon they by diver of they master profess christianity _ and the third be _ a dialogue between a ethiopian and a christian he master in america _ in the last of these thoma tryon who be the author inveigh both against the commerce and the slavery of the african and in a striking manner examine each by the touchstone of reason humanity justice and religion in the year 1696 southern bring forward he celebrated tragedy of _ oronooko _ by means of which many become enlighten upon the subject and interested in it for this tragedy be not a representation of fictitious circumstance but of such as have occur in the colony and as have be communicate in a publication by mr behn the person who seem to have notice the subject next be dr primatt in he _ dissertation on the duty of mercy and on the sin of cruelty to brute animal _ he take occasion to advert to the subject of the african slave trade it have please god say he to cover some man with white skin and other with black but as there be neither merit nor demerit in complexion the white man notwithstanding the barbarity of custom and prejudice can have no right by virtue of he color to enslave and tyrannize over the black man for whether a man be white or black such he be by god 's appointment and abstractly consider be neither a subject for pride nor a object of contempt after dr primatt we come to baron montesquieu slavery say he be not good in itself it be neither useful to the master nor to the slave not to the slave because he can do nothing from virtuous motive not to the master because he contract among he slave all sort of bad habit and accustom himself to the neglect of all the moral virtue he become haughty passionate obdurate vindictive voluptuous and cruel and with respect to this particular species of slavery he proceed to say it be impossible to allow the negro be man because if we allow they to be man it will begin to be believe that we ourselves be not christian hutcheson in he _ system of moral philosophy _ endeavor to show that he who detain another by force in slavery can make no good title to he and add strange that in any nation where a sense of liberty prevail and where the christian religion be profess custom and high prospect of gain can so stupify the conscience of man and all sense of natural justice that they can hear such computation make about the value of they fellow-men and they liberty without abhorrence and indignation foster in he _ discourse on natural religion and social virtue _ call the slavery under we consideration a criminal and outrageous violation of the natural rights of mankind i be sorry that i have not room to say all that he say on this subject perhaps the follow beautiful extract may suffice : -- but notwithstanding this we ourselves who profess to be christian and boast of the peculiar advantage we enjoy by means of a express revelation of we duty from heaven be in effect these very untaught and rude heathen country with all we superior light we instil into those whom we call savage and barbarous the most despicable opinion of human nature we to the utmost of we power weaken and dissolve the universal tie that bind and unite mankind we practice what we should exclaim against as the utmost excess of cruelty and tyranny if nation of the world differ in color and form of government from ourselves be so possess of empire as to be able to reduce we to a state of unmerited and brutish servitude of consequence we sacrifice we reason we humanity we christianity to a unnatural sordid gain we teach other nation to despise and trample under foot all the obligation of social virtue we take the most effectual method to prevent the propagation of the gospel by represent it as a scheme of power and barbarous oppression and a enemy to the natural privilege and rights of man perhaps all that i have now offer may be of very little weight to restrain this enormity this aggravate iniquity however i shall still have the satisfaction of have enter my private protest against a practice which in my opinion bid that god who be the god and father of the gentile unconverted to christianity most daring and bold defiance and spurn at all the principle both of natural and reveal religion the next author be sir richard steele who by means of the affect story of inkle and yarico hold up this trade again to we abhorrence in the year 1735 atkin who be a surgeon in the navy publish he _ voyage to guinea brazil and the west indy in he majesty 's ship swallow and weymouth _ in this work he describe openly the manner of make the native slave such as by kidnapping by unjust accusation and trial and by other nefarious means he state also the cruelty practice upon they by the white people and the iniquitous way and dealings of the latter and answer they argument by which they insinuate that the condition of the african be improve by they transportation to other country from this time the trade begin to be better know a multitude of person of various station and character spring up who by expose it be to be mention among the forerunner and coadjutor in the cause pope in he _ essay on man _ where he endeavor to show that happiness in the present depend among other thing upon the hope of a future state take a opportunity of exciting compassion in behalf of the poor african while he censure the avarice and cruelty of he master : -- lo the poor indian whose untutored mind see god in cloud or hear he in the wind he soul proud science never teach to stray far as the solar walk or milky-way yet simple nature to he hope be give behind the cloud-topt hill a humbler heaven some safer world in depth of wood embrace some happier island in the watery waste where slave once more they native land behold no fiend torment no christian thirst for gold thomson also in he _ season _ mark this traffic as destructive and cruel introduce the well-known fact of shark follow the vessel employ in it : -- increase still the sorrow of those storm he jaw horrific arm would with three-fold fate here dwell the direful shark lure by the scent of steam crowd of rank disease and death behold he rush cut the briny flood swift as the gale can bear the ship along and from the partner of that cruel trade which spoil unhappy guinea of she son demand he share of prey demand themselves the stormy fate descend : one death involve tyrant and slave when straight they mangled limb crash at once he dye the purple sea with gore and riot in the vengeful meal neither be richard savage forgetful in he poem of the _ injure african _ : he warn they oppressor of a day of retribution for they barbarous conduct have personify public spirit he make she speak on the subject in the follow manner : -- let by my specious name no tyrant rise and cry while they enslave they civilize know liberty and i be still the same congenial -- ever mingle flame with flame why must i afric 's sable child see vend for slave though bear by nature free the nameless torture cruel mind invent those to subject whom nature equal mean if these you dare -lrb- although unjust success empower you now unpunished to oppress -rrb- revolving empire you and yours may doom -- -lrb- rome all subdu would -- yet vandal vanquish would rome -rrb- yes -- empire may revolt -- give they the day and yoke may yoke and blood may blood repay walli in he _ system of the law of scotland _ maintain that neither man nor government have a right to sell those of they own species man and they liberty be neither purchaseable nor saleable and after argue the case he say this be the law of nature which be obligatory on all man at all time and in all place -- would not any of we who should be snatch by pirate from he native land think himself cruelly abuse and at all time entitle to be free have not these unfortunate african who meet with the same cruel fate the same right be they not man as well as we and have they not the same sensibility let we not therefore defend or support a usage which be contrary to all the law of humanity in the year 1750 the reverend griffith hughe rector of st lucy in barbado publish he natural history of that island he take a opportunity in the course of it of lay open to the world the miserable situation of the poor african and the waste of they by hard labor and other cruel means and he have the generosity to vindicate they capacity from the charge which they who hold they in bondage bring against they as a justification of they own wickedness in continue to deprive they of the rights of man edmund burke in he account of the european settlement -lrb- for this work be usually attribute to he -rrb- complain that the negro in we colony endure a slavery more complete and attend with far worse circumstance than what any people in they condition suffer in any other part of the world or have suffer in any other period of time proof of this be not want the prodigious waste which we experience in this unhappy part of we species be a full and melancholy evidence of this truth and he go on to advise the planter for the sake of they own interest to behave like good man good master and good christian and to impose less labor upon they slave and to give they recreation on some of the grand festival and to instruct they in religion as certain preventive of they decrease a anonymous author of a pamphlet entitle _ a essay in vindication of the continental colony of america _ seem to have come forward next speaking of slavery there he say it be shocking to humanity violative of every generous sentiment abhorrent utterly from the christian religion -- there can not be a more dangerous maxim than that necessity be a plea for injustice for who shall fix the degree of this necessity what villain so atrocious who may not urge this excuse or as milton have happily express it and with necessity the tyrant 's plea excuse he devilish deed that we colony he continue want people be a very weak argument for so inhuman a violation of justice -- shall a civilized a christian nation encourage slavery because the barbarous savage lawless african have do it to what end do we profess a religion whose dictate we so flagrantly violate wherefore have we that pattern of goodness and humanity if we refuse to follow it how long shall we continue a practice which policy reject justice condemn and piety revolt at the poet shenstone who come next in order seem to have write a elegy on purpose to stigmatize this trade of this elegy i shall copy only the follow part : -- see the poor native quit the libyan shore ah not in love 's delightful fetter bind no radiant smile he die peace restore no love nor fame nor friendship heal he wound let vacant bard display they boast woe shall i the mockery of grief display no let the muse he pierce pang disclose who bleed and weep he sum of life away on the wild heath in mournful guise he stand ere the shrill boatswain

medicine every wound in the year 1755 dr hayter bishop of norwich preach a sermon before the _ society for the propagation of the gospel _ in which he bear he testimony against the continuance of this trade dyer in he poem call _ the fleece _ express he sorrow on account of this barbarous trade and look forward to a day of retributive justice on account of the introduction of such a evil in the year 1760 a pamphlet appear entitle _ two dialogue on the man-trade _ by john philmore this name be suppose to be a assume one the author however discover himself to have be both a able and a zealous advocate in favor of the african race malachus postlethwaite in he _ universal dictionary of trade and commerce _ propose a number of query on the subject of the slave trade i have not room to insert they at full length but i shall give the follow as the substance of some of they to the reader : whether this commerce be not the cause of incessant war among the african -- whether the african if it be abolish might not become as ingenious as humane as industrious and as capable of art manufacture and trade as even the bulk of european -- whether if it be abolish a much more profitable trade might not be substitute and this to the very center of they extended country instead of the trifling portion which now subsist upon they coast -- and whether the great hindrance to such a new and advantageous commerce have not wholly proceed from that unjust inhuman unchristianlike traffic call the slave trade which be carry on by the european the public proposal of these and other query by a man of so great commercial knowledge as postlethwaite and by one who be himself a member of the african committee be of great service in expose the impolicy as well as immorality of the slave trade in the year 1761 thoma jeffery publish a account of a part of north america in which he lay open the miserable state of the slave in the west indy both as to they clothing they food they labor and they punishment but without go into particulars the general account be give of they be affect : it be impossible he say for a human heart to reflect upon the slavery of these dregs of mankind without in some measure feeling for they misery which end but with they life -- nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this people sterne in he account of the negro girl in he _ life of tristram shandy _ take decidedly the part of the oppressed african the pathetic witty and sentimental manner in which he handle this subject occasion many to remember it and procure a certain portion of feeling in they favor rousseau contribute not a little in he day to the same end bishop warburton preach a sermon in the year 1766 before the society for the propagation of the gospel in which he take up the cause of the miserable african and in which he severely reprobate they oppressor the language in this sermon be so striking that i shall make a extract from it from the free savage say he i now come to the savage in bond by these i mean the vast multitude yearly steal from the opposite continent and sacrifice by the colonist to they great idol the god of gain but what then say these sincere worshipper of mammon they be we own property which we offer up -- gracious god to talk as of herd of cattle of property in rational creature creature endue with all we faculty possess all we quality but that of color we brethren both by nature and grace shock all the feeling of humanity and the dictate of common sense but alas what be there in the infinite abuse of society which do not shock they yet nothing be more certain in itself and apparent to all than that the infamous traffic for slave directly infringe both divine and human law nature create man free and grace invite he to assert he freedom in excuse of this violation it have be pretend that though indeed these miserable outcast of humanity be tear from they home and native country by fraud and violence yet they thereby become the happier and they condition the more eligible but who be you who pretend to judge of another man 's happiness that state which each man under the guidance of he maker form for himself and not one man for another to know what constitute mine or you happiness be the sole prerogative of he who create we and cast we in so various and different mould do you slave ever complain to you of they unhappiness amidst they native wood and desert or rather let I ask do they ever cease complain of they condition under you they lordly master where they see indeed the accommodation of civil life but see they all pass to other themselves unbenefited by they be so gracious then ye petty tyrant over human freedom to let you slave judge for themselves what it be which make they own happiness and then see whether they do not place it in the return to they own country rather than in the contemplation of you grandeur of which they misery make so large a part a return so passionately long for that despairing of happiness here that be of escape the chain of they cruel task-master they console themselves with feign it to be the gracious reward of heaven in they future state about this time certain cruel and wicked practice which must now be mention have arrive at such a height and have become so frequent in the metropolis as to produce of themselves other coadjutor to the cause before the year 1700 planter merchant and other resident in the west indy but come to england be accustom to bring with they certain slave to act as servant with they during they stay the latter see the freedom and the happiness of servant in this country and consider what would be they own hard fate on they return to the island frequently abscond they master of course make search after they and often have they seize and carry away by force it be however throw out by many on these occasion that the english law do not sanction such proceedings for that all person who be baptize become free the consequence of this be that most of the slave who come over with they master prevail upon some pious clergyman to baptize they they take of course godfather of such citizen as have the generosity to espouse they cause when they be seize they usually send to these if they have a opportunity for they protection and in the result they godfather maintain that they have be baptize and that they be free on this account as well as by the general tenor of the law of england dare those who have take possession of they to send they out of the kingdom the planter merchant and other be thus circumstanced know not what to do they be afraid of take they slave away by force and they be equally afraid of bring any of the case before a public court in this dilemma in 1729 they apply to york and talbot the attorney and solicitor-general for the time be and obtain the follow strange opinion from they : -- we be of opinion that a slave by come from the west indy into great britain or ireland either with or without he master do not become free and that he master 's right and property in he be not thereby determine or vary and that baptism doth not bestow freedom on he nor make any alteration in he temporal condition in these kingdom we be also of opinion that the master may legally compel he to return again to the plantation this cruel and illegal opinion be deliver in the year 1729 the planter merchant and other give it of course all the publicity in they power and the consequence be as might easily have be apprehend in a little time slave abscond be advertise in the london papers as runaway and reward offer for the apprehension of they in the same brutal manner as we find they advertise in the land of slavery they be advertise also in the same papers to be sell by auction sometimes by themselves and at other with horse chaise and harness they be seize also by they master or by person employ by they in the very street and drag from thence to the ship and so unprotected now be these poor slave that person in nowise concern with they begin to institute a trade in they person make agreement with captain of ship go to the west indy to put they on board at a certain price this last instance show how far human nature be capable of go and be a answer to those person who have deny that kidnapping in africa be a source of supply the slave trade it show as all history do from the time of joseph that where there be a market for the person of human being all kind of enormity will be practice to obtain they these circumstance then as i observe before do not fail of produce new coadjutor in the cause and first they produce that able and indefatigable advocate mr granville sharp this gentleman be to be distinguish from those who precede he by this particular that whereas these be only writer he be both a writer and a actor in the cause in fact he be the first labourer in it in england by the word actor and labourer i mean that he determine upon a plan of action in behalf of the oppressed african to the accomplishment of which he devote a considerable portion of he time talent and substance what mr sharp have do to merit the title of coadjutor in this high sense i shall now explain the following be a short history of the beginning and of the course of he labor : -- in the year 1765 mr david lisle have bring over from barbado jonathan strong a african slave as he servant he use the latter in a barbarous manner at he lodgings in wapping but particularly by beat he over the head with a pistol which occasion he head to swell when the swell go down a disorder fall into he eye which threaten the loss of they to this a ague and fever succeed and a lameness in both he leg jonathan strong have be bring into this deplorable situation and be therefore wholly useless be leave by he master to go whither he please he apply accordingly to mr william sharp the surgeon for he advice as to one who give up a portion of he time to the healing of the disease of the poor it be here that mr granville sharp the brother of the former see he suffice it to say that in process of time he be cure during this time mr granville sharp pity he hard case supply he with money and he afterwards get he a situation in the family of mr brown a apothecary to carry out medicine in this new situation when strong have become healthy and robust in he appearance he master happen to see he the latter immediately form the design of possess he again accord when he have find out he residence he procure john ross keeper of the poultry-counter and william miller a officer under the lord mayor to kidnap he this be do by send for he to a public-house in fenchurch-street and then seize he by these he be convey without any warrant to the poultry-counter where he be sell by he master to john kerr for thirty pound strong in this situation send as be usual to he godfather john london and stephen nail for they protection they go but be refuse admittance to he at length he send for mr granville sharp : the latter go but they still refuse access to the prisoner he insist however upon see he and charge the keeper of the prison at he peril to deliver he up till he have be carry before a magistrate mr sharp immediately upon this wait upon sir robert kite the then lord mayor and entreat he to send for strong and to hear he case a day be accordingly appoint mr sharp attend and also william mcbean a notary public and david laird captain of the ship thame which be to have convey strong to jamaica in behalf of the purchaser john kerr a long conversation ensue in which the opinion of york and talbot be quote mr sharp make he observation certain lawyer who be present seem to be stagger at the case but inclined rather to recommit the prisoner : the lord mayor however discharge strong as he have be take up without a warrant as soon as this determination be make know the party begin to move off captain laird however who keep close to strong lay hold of he before he have quit the room and say aloud then i now seize he as my slave upon this mr sharp put he hand upon laird 's shoulder and pronounce these word : i charge you in the name of the king with a assault upon the person of jonathan strong and all these be my witness laird be greatly intimidate by this charge make in the presence of the lord mayor and other and fear a prosecution let he prisoner go leave he to be convey away by mr sharp mr sharp have be greatly affect by this case and foresee how much he might be engage in other of a similar nature think it time that the law of the land should be know upon this subject : he apply therefore to dr blackstone afterwards judge blackstone for he opinion upon it he be however not satisfy with it when he receive it nor could he obtain any satisfactory answer from several other lawyer to whom he afterwards apply the truth be that the opinion of york and talbot which have be make public and act upon by the planter merchant and other be consider of high authority and scarcely any one dare to question the legality of it in this situation mr sharp saw no means of help but in he own industry and he determine immediately to give up two or three year to the study of the english law that he might the better advocate the cause of these miserable people the result of these study be the publication of a book in the year 1769 which he call _ a representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerate slavery in england _ in this work he refute in the clearest manner the opinion of york and talbot : he produce against it the opinion of the lord chief justice holt who many year before have determine that every slave come into england become free : he attack and refute it again by a learn and laborious inquiry into all the principle of villenage he refute it again by show it to be a axiom in the british constitution that every man in england be free to sue for and defend he rights and that force could not be use without a legal process leave it to the judge to determine whether a african be a man he attack also the opinion of judge blackstone and show where he error lay this valuable book contain these and other kind of argument on the subject he distribute but particularly among the lawyer give they a opportunity of refute or acknowledge the doctrine it contain while mr sharp be engage in this work another case offer in which he take a part : this be in the year 1768 hyla a african slave prosecute a person of the name of newton for have kidnap he wife and send she to the west indy the result of the trial be that damages to the amount of a shilling be give and the defendant be bind to bring back the woman either by the first ship or in six month from this decision of the court but soon after the work just mention be out and when mr sharp be better prepare a third case occur : this happen in the year 1770 robert stapylton who live at chelsea in conjunction with john malony and edward armstrong two waterman seize the person of thoma lewi a african slave in a dark night and drag he to a boat lie in the thame they then gag he and tie he with a cord and row he down to a ship and put he on board to be sell as a slave in jamaica this base action take place near the garden of mr bank the mother of the late sir joseph bank lewi it appear on be seize scream violently the servant of mr bank who hear he cry run to he assistance but the boat be go on inform they mistress of what have happen she send for mr sharp who begin now to be know as the friend of the helpless african and profess she willingness to incur the expense of bring the delinquent to justice mr sharp with some difficulty procure a _ habea corpus _ in consequence of which lewi be bring from gravesend just as the vessel be on the point of sail a action be then commence against stapylton who defend himself on the plea that lewi belong to he as he slave in the course of the trial mr dunning who be counsel for lewi pay mr sharp a handsome compliment for he hold in he hand mr sharp 's book on the _ injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerate slavery in england _ while he be plead and in he address to the jury he speak and act thus : -- i shall submit to you say mr dunning what my idea be upon such evidence reserve to myself a opportunity of discuss it more particularly and reserve to myself a right to insist upon a position which i will maintain -lrb- and here he hold up the book to the notice of those present -rrb- in any place and in any court of the kingdom that we law admit of no such property -lrb- a -rrb- the result of the trial be that the jury pronounce the plaintiff not to have be the property of the defendant several of they cry out no property no property -lrb- footnote a : it be lamentable to think that the same mr dunning in a cause of this kind which come on afterwards take the opposite side of the question -rrb- after this one or two other trial come on in which the oppressor be defeat and several case occur in which poor slave be liberate from the hold of vessel and other place of confinement by the exertion of mr sharp one of these case be singular the vessel on board which a poor african have be drag and confine have reach the downs and have actually get under weigh for the west indy : in two or three hour she would have be out of sight but just at this critical moment the writ of _ habeas corpus _ be carry on board the officer who serve it on the captain see the miserable african chained to the mainmast bath in tear and cast a last mournful look on the land of freedom which be fast recede from he sight the captain on receive the writ become outrageous but know the serious consequence of resist the law of the land he give up he prisoner whom the officer carry safe but now cry for joy to the shore but though the injured african whose cause have be try escape slavery and though many who have be forcibly carry into dungeon ready to be transport into the colony have be deliver out of they mr sharp be not easy in he mind : not one of the case have yet be plead on the broad ground whether a african slave come into england become free this great question have be hitherto studiously avoid it be still therefore leave in doubt mr sharp be almost daily act as if it have be determine and as if he have be follow the known law of the land : he wish therefore that the next cause might be argue upon this principle lord mansfield too who have be biass by the opinion of york and talbot begin to waver in consequence of the different pleading he have hear on this subject : he see also no end of trial like these till the law should be ascertain and he be anxious for a decision on the same basis as mr sharp in this situation the follow case offer which be agree upon for the determination of this important question jame somerset a african slave have be bring to england by he master charle stewart in November 1769 somerset in process of time leave he stewart take a opportunity of seize he and have he convey on board the ann and mary captain knowle to be carry out of the kingdom and sell as a slave in jamaica : the question be whether a slave by come into england become free in order that time might be give for ascertain the law fully on this head the case be argue at three different sitting first in January 1772 secondly in February 1772 and thirdly in may 1772 and that no decision otherwise than what the law warrant might be give the opinion of the judge be take upon the pleading the great and glorious result of the trial be that as soon as ever any slave set he foot upon english territory he become free thus end the great case of somerset which have be determine after so deliberate a investigation of the law can never be reverse while the british constitution remain the eloquence display in it by those who be engage on the side of liberty be perhaps never exceed on any occasion and the name of the counsellor davy glynn hargrave mansfield and alleyne ought always to be remember with gratitude by the friend of this great cause for when we consider in how many crowded court they plead and the number of individual in these whose mind they enlighten and whose heart they interested in the subject they be certainly to be put down as no small instrument in the promotion of it but chiefly to he under divine providence be we to give the praise who become the first great actor in it who devote he time he talent and he substance to this christian undertaking and by whose laborious research the very pleader themselves be instruct and benefit by means of he almost incessant vigilance and attention and unwearied effort the poor african cease to be hunt in we street as a beast of prey miserable as the roof might be under which he sleep he sleep in security he walk by the side of the stately ship and he fear no dungeon in she hold nor ought we as englishman to be less grateful to this distinguished individual than the african ought to be upon this occasion to he we owe it that we no longer see we public papers polluted by hateful advertisement of the sale of the human species or that we be no longer distressed by the perusal of impious reward for bring back the poor and the helpless into slavery or that we be prohibit the disgusting spectacle of see man buy by he fellow-man to he in short we owe this restoration of the beauty of we constitution -- this prevention of the continuance of we national disgrace i shall say but little more of mr sharp at present than that he feel it he duty immediately after the trial to write to lord north then principal minister of state warn he in the most earnest manner to abolish immediately both the trade and the slavery of the human species in all the british dominion as utterly irreconcileable with the principle of the british constitution and the established religion of the land among other coadjutor whom the cruel and wicked practice which have now be so amply detailed bring forward be a worthy clergyman whose name i have not yet be able to learn he endeavor to interest the public feeling in behalf of the injured african by write a epilogue to the _ padlock _ in which mungo appear as a black servant this epilogue be so appropriate to the case that i can not but give it to the reader mungo enter and thus address the audience : -- thank you my massa have you laugh you fill then let I speak nor take that freedom ill e ` en from _ my _ tongue some heart-felt truth may fall and outraged nature claim the care of all my tale in _ any _ place would force a tear but call for stronger deeper feeling here for whilst i tread the free-born british land whilst now before I crowd briton stand -- vain vain that glorious privilege to I i be a slave where all thing else be free yet be i bear as you be no man 's slave a heir to all that liberal nature give my mind can reason and my limb can move the same as yours like yours my heart can love alike my body food and sleep sustain and e ` en like yours -- feel pleasure want and pain one sun roll o'er we common sky surround one globe support we and one grave must bind why then be i devoid of all to live that manly comfort to a man can give to live -- untaught religion 's soothing balm or life 's choice art to live -- unknown the calm of soft domestic ease those sweet of life the duteous offspring and th ' endearing wife to live -- to property and rights unknown not e ` en the common benefit my own no arm to guard I from oppression 's rod my will subservient to a tyrant 's nod no gentle hand when life be in decay to soothe my pain and charm my care away but helpless leave to quit the horrid stage harass in youth and desolate in age but i be bear in afric 's tawny strand and you in fair britannium 's fairer land come freedom then from color -- blush with shame and let strong nature 's crimson mark you blame i speak to briton -- briton -- then behold a man by briton _ snare _ and _ seize _ and _ sell _ and yet no british statute damn the deed nor do the more than murderous villain bleed o son of freedom equalize you law be all consistent plead the negro 's cause that all the nation in you code may see the british negro like the briton free but should he supplicate you law in vain to break for ever this disgraceful chain at least let gentle usage so abate the galling terror of its pass state that he may share kind heaven 's all social plan for though no briton mungo be -- a man i may now add that few theatrical piece have a greater run than the _ padlock _ and that this epilogue which be attach to it soon after it come out procure a good deal of feeling for the unfortunate sufferer whose cause it be intend to serve another coadjutor to whom these cruel and wicked practice give birth be thomas day the celebrated author of _ sandford and merton _ and whose virtue be well know among those who have the happiness of he friendship in the year 1773 he publish a poem which he write expressly in behalf of the oppressed african he give it the name of _ the die negro _ the preface to it be write in a able manner by he friend counsellor bicknell who be therefore to be rank among the coadjutor in this great cause the poem be found on a simple fact which have take place a year or two before a poor negro have be seize in london and forcibly put on board a ship where he destroy himself rather than return to the land of slavery to the poem be affix a frontispiece in which the negro be represent he be make to stand in a attitude of the most earnest address to heaven in the course of which with the fatal dagger in he hand he break forth in the follow word : to you this unpolluted blood i pour to you that spirit which ye give restore this poem which be the first ever write expressly on the subject be read extensively and it add to the sympathy in favor of suffer humanity which be now begin to show itself in the kingdom about this time the first edition of the _ essay a truth _ make its appearance in the world dr beattie take a opportunity in this work of vindicate the intellectual power of the african from the aspersion of hume and of condemn they slavery as a barbarous piece of policy and as inconsistent with the free and generous spirit of the british nation in the year 1774 john wesley the celebrated divine to whose pious labor the religious world will long be indebted undertake the cause of the poor african he have be in america and have see and pity they hard condition the work which he give to the world in consequence be entitle _ thought on slavery _ mr wesley have this great cause much at heart and frequently recommend it to the support of those who attend he useful ministry in the year 1776 the abb proyart bring out at paris he _ history of loango _ and other kingdom in africa in which he do ample justice to the moral and intellectual character of the native there the same year produce two new friend in england in the same cause but in a line in which no one have yet move david hartley then a member of parliament for hull and the son of dr hartley who write the _ essay on man _ find it impossible any longer to pass over without notice the case of the oppressed african he have long feel for they wretched condition and avail himself of he legislative situation he make a motion in the house of common that the slave trade be contrary to the law of god and the rights of man in order that he might interest the member as much as possible in he motion he have previously obtain some of the chain in use in this cruel traffic and have lay they upon the table of the house of common he motion be second by that great patriot and philanthropist sir george saville but though i be now to state that it fail i can not but consider it as a matter of please reflection that this great subject be first introduce into parliament by those who be worthy of it by those who have clean hand and a irreproachable character and to whom no motive of party or faction could be imputed but only such as must have arise from a love of justice a true feeling of humanity and a proper sense of religion about this time two other man of great talent and learn promote the cause of the injured african by the manner in which they introduce they to notice in they respective work dr adam smith in he _ theory of moral sentiment _ have so early as the year 1759 hold they up in a honorable and they tyrant in a degrading light there be not a negro from the coast of africa who do not in this respect possess a degree of magnanimity which the soul of he sordid master be too often scarce capable of conceive fortune never exert more cruelly she empire over mankind than when she subject those nation of hero to the refuse of the gaol of europe to wretch who possess the virtue neither of the country they come from nor of those they go to and whose levity brutality and baseness so justly expose they to the contempt of the vanquish and now in 1776 in he _ wealth of nation _ he show in a forcible manner -lrb- for he appeal to the interest of those concerned -rrb- the dearness of african labor or the impolicy of employ slave professor millar in he _ origin of rank _ follow dr smith on the same ground he explain the impolicy of slavery in general by its bad effect upon industry population and moral these effect he attach to the system of agriculture as follow in we island he show besides how little pain be take or how few contrivance be think of to ease the labourer there he contend that the african ought to be better treat and to be raise to a better condition and he ridicule the inconsistency of those who hold they in bondage it afford say he a curious spectacle to observe that the same people who talk in a high strain of political liberty and who consider the privilege of impose they own tax as one of the unalienable rights of mankind should make no scruple of reduce a great proportion of they fellow-creature into circumstance by which they be not only deprive of property but almost of every species of right fortune perhaps never produce a situation more calculate to ridicule a liberal hypothesis or to show how little the conduct of man be at the bottom direct by any philosophical principle it be a great honor to the university of glasgow that it should have produce before any public agitation of this question three professor -lrb- a -rrb- all of whom bear they public testimony against the continuance of the cruel trade -lrb- footnote a : the other be professor hutcheson before mention in p 56 -rrb- from this time or from about the year 1776 to about the year 1782 i be to put down three other coadjutor whose labor seem to have come in a right season for the promotion of the cause the first of these be dr robertson in he _ history of america _ he lay open many fact relative to this subject he show himself a warm friend both of the indian and african he lose no opportunity of condemn that trade which bring the latter into bondage : a trade say he which be no less repugnant to the feeling of humanity than to the principle of religion and in he _ charle the fifth _ he show in a manner that be clear and never to be controvert that christianity be the great cause in the twelfth century of extirpate slavery from the west of europe by the establishment of this fact he render important service to the oppressed african for if christianity when it begin to be feel in the heart dictate the abolition of slavery it certainly become those who live in a christian country and who profess the christian religion to put a end to this cruel trade the second be the abb raynal this author give a account of the law government and religion of africa of the produce of it of the manners of its inhabitant of the trade in slave of the manner of procure these with several other particulars relate to the subject and at the end of he account fear lest the good advice he have give for make the condition of the slave more comfortable should be construe into a approbation of such a traffic he employ several page in show its utter inconsistency with sound policy justice reason humanity and religion i will not here say he so far debase myself as to enlarge the ignominious list of those writer who devote they ability to justify by policy what morality condemn in a age where so many error be boldly lay open it would be unpardonable to conceal any truth that be interesting to humanity if whatever i have hitherto advanced have seemingly tend only to alleviate the burden of slavery the reason be that it be first necessary to give some comfort to those unhappy being whom we can not set free and convince they oppressor that they be cruel to the prejudice of they real interest but in the mean time till some considerable revolution shall make the evidence of this great truth feel it may not be improper to pursue this subject further i shall then first prove that there be no reason of state which can authorize slavery i shall not be afraid to cite to the tribunal of reason and justice those government which tolerate this cruelty or which even be not ashamed to make it the basis of they power and a little further on he observe -- will it be say that he who want to make I a slave do I no injury but that he only make use of he rights where be those rights who have stamp upon they so sacred a character as to silence mine in the beginning of the next paragraph he speak thus : -- he who support the system of slavery be the enemy of the whole human race he divide it into two society of legal assassin the oppressor and the oppressed it be the same thing as proclaim to the world if you would preserve you life instantly take away mine for i want to have yours go on two page further we find these word : -- but the negro they say be a race bear for slavery they disposition be narrow treacherous and wicked they themselves allow the superiority of we understanding and almost acknowledge the justice of we authority yes the mind of the negro be contract because slavery destroy all the spring of the soul they be wicked but not equally so with you they be treacherous because they be under no obligation to speak truth to they tyrant they acknowledge the superiority of we understanding because we have abuse they ignorance they allow the justice of we authority because we have abuse they weakness but these negro it be further urge be bear slave barbarian will you persuade I that a man can be the property of a sovereign a son the property of a father a wife the property of a husband a domestic the property of a master a negro the property of a planter but i have no time to follow this animated author even by short extract through the varied strain of eloquence which he display upon this occasion i can only say that he labor entitle he to a high station among the benefactor to the african race the third be dr paley whose genius talent and learn have be so eminently display in he writings in the cause of natural and reveal religion dr paley do not write any essay expressly in favor of the african but in he _ moral philosophy _ where he treat on slavery he take a opportunity of condemn in very severe term the continuance of it in this work he define what slavery be and how it might arise consistently with the law of nature but he make a exception against that which arise from the african trade the slave trade say he upon the coast of africa be not excuse by these principle when slave in that country be bring to market no question i believe be ask about the origin or justice of the vendor 's title it may be presume therefore that this title be not always if it be ever found in any of the cause above assign but defect of right in the first purchase be the least crime with which this traffic be chargeable the native be excite to war and mutual depredation for the sake of supply they contract or furnish the market with slave with this the wickedness begin the slave tear away from they parent wife and child from they friend and companion from they field and flock from they home and country be transport to the european settlement in america with no other accommodation on ship-board than what be provide for brute this be the second stage of the cruelty from which the miserable exile be deliver only to be place and that for life in subjection to a dominion add system of law the most merciless and tyrannical that ever be tolerate upon the face of the earth : and from all that can be learn by the account of people upon the spot the inordinate authority which the plantation-law confer upon the slaveholder be exercise by the english slaveholder especially with rigor and brutality but necessity be pretend the name under which every enormity be attempt to be justified and after all what be the necessity it have never be prove that the land could not be cultivate there as it be here by hire servant it be say that it could not be cultivate with quite the same conveniency and cheapness as by the labor of slave by which mean a pound of sugar which the planter now sell for sixpence could not be afford under sixpence-halfpenny -- and this be the necessity the great revolution which have take place in the western world may probably conduce -lrb- and who know but that it be design -rrb- to accelerate the fall of this abominable tyranny : and now that this contest and the passion which attend it be no more there may succeed perhaps a season for reflect whether a legislature which have so long lend its assistance to the support of a institution replete with human misery be fit to be trust with a empire the most extensive that ever obtain in any age or quarter of the world the publication of these sentiment may be suppose to have produce a extensive effect for _ the moral philosophy _ be adopt early by some of the college in we university into the system of they education it soon find its way also into most of the private library of the kingdom and it be besides generally read and approve dr paley therefore must be consider as have be a considerable coadjutor in interesting the mind of the public in favor of the oppressed african in the year 1783 we find mr sharp come again into notice we find he at this time take a part in a cause the knowledge of which in proportion as it be disseminate produce a earnest desire among all disinterested person for the abolition of the slave trade in this year certain underwriter desire to be hear against gregson and other of liverpool in the case of the ship zong captain collingwood allege that the captain and officer of the say vessel throw overboard one hundred and thirty-two slave alive into the sea in order to defraud they by claim the value of the say slave as if they have be lose in a natural way in the course of the trial which afterwards come on it appear that the slave on board the zong be very sickly that sixty of they have already die and several be ill and likely to die when the captain propose to jame kelsall the mate and other to throw several of they overboard state that if they die a natural death the loss would fall upon the owner of the ship but that if they be throw into the sea it would fall upon the underwriter he select accordingly one hundred and thirty-two of the most sickly of the slave fifty-four of these be immediately throw overboard and forty-two be make to be partaker of they fate on the succeed day in the course of three day afterwards the remain twenty-six be bring upon deck to complete the number of victim the first sixteen submit to be throw into the sea but the rest with a noble resolution would not suffer the officer to touch they but leap after they companion and share they fate the plea which be set up in behalf of this atrocious and unparalleled act of wickedness be that the captain discover when he make the proposal that he have only two hundred gallon of water on board and that he have miss he port it be prove however in answer to this that no one have be put upon short allowance and that as if providence have determine to afford a unequivocal proof of the guilt a shower of rain fall and continue for three day immediately after the second lot of slave have be destroy by means of which they might have fill many of they vessel -lrb- a -rrb- with water and thus have prevent all necessity for the destruction of the third -lrb- footnote a : it appear that they fill six -rrb- mr sharp be present at this trial and procure the attendance of a short-hand writer to take down the fact which should come out in the course of it these he give to the public afterwards he communicate they also with a copy of the trial to the lord of the admiralty as the guardian of justice upon the sea and to the duke of portland as principal minister of state no notice however be take by any of these of the information which have be thus send they but though nothing be do by the person then in power in consequence of the murder of so many innocent individual yet the publication of a account of it by mr sharp in the newspaper make such a impression upon other that new coadjutor rise up for soon after this we find thoma day enter the list again as the champion of the injured african he have live to see he poem of _ the die negro _ which have be publish in 1773 make a considerable impression in 1776 he have write a letter to a friend in america who be the possessor of slave to dissuade he by a number of argument from hold such property and now when the knowledge of the case of the ship zong be spread he publish that letter under the title of fragment of a original letter on the slavery of the negro in this same year dr porteus bishop of chester but now bishop of london come forward as a new advocate for the native of africa the way in which he render they service be by preach a sermon in they behalf before the society for the propagation of the gospel of the wide circulation of this sermon i shall say something in another place but much more of the enlighten and pious author of it who from this time never fail to aid at every opportunity the cause which he have so ably undertake in the year 1784 dr gregory produce he _ essay historical and moral _ he take a opportunity of disseminate in these a circumstantial knowledge of the slave trade and a equal abhorrence of it at the same time he explain the manner of procure slave in africa the treatment of they on the passage -lrb- in which he mention the case of the ship zong -rrb- and the wicked and cruel treatment of they in the colony he recite and refute also the various argument adduce in defense of the trade he show that it be destructive to we seaman he produce many weighty argument also against the slavery itself he propose clause for a act of parliament for the abolition of both show the good both to england and she colony from such a measure and that a trade might be substitute in africa in various article for that which he propose to suppress by means of the diffusion of light like this both of a moral and political nature dr gregory be entitle to be rank among the benefactor to the african race in the same year gilbert wakefield preach a sermon at richmond in surrey where speaking of the people of this nation he say have we be as renowned for a liberal communication of we religion and we law as for the possession of they have we navigate and conquer to save to civilize and to instruct or to oppress to plunder and to destroy let indium and africa give the answer to these question the one we have exhaust of she wealth and she inhabitant by violence by famine and by every species of tyranny and murder the child of the other we daily carry from off the land of they nativity like sheep to the slaughter to return no more we tear they from every object of they affection or sad alternative drag they together to the horror of a mutual servitude we keep they in the profoundest ignorance we gall they in a tenfold chain with a unrelenting spirit of barbarity inconceivable to all but the spectator of it unexampled among former and other nation and unrecorded even in the bloody register of heathen persecution such be the conduct of we enlighten englishman reform christian thus have we profit by we superior advantage by the favor of god by the doctrine and example of a meek and lowly savior will not the blessing which we have abuse loudly testify against we will not the blood which we have shed cry from the ground for vengeance upon we sin in the same year jame ramsay vicar of teston in kent become also a able zealous and indefatigable patron of the african cause this gentleman have reside nineteen year in the island of st christopher where he have observe the treatment of the slave and have study the law relate to they on he return to england yield to he own feeling of duty and the solicitation of some amiable friend he publish a work which he call _ a essay on the treatment and conversion of the african slave in the british sugar colony _ after have give a account of the relative situation of master and slave in various part of the world he explain the low and degrading situation which the african hold in society in we own island he show that they importance would be increase and the temporal interest of they master promote by give they freedom and by grant they other privilege he show the great difficulty of instruct they in the state in which they then be and such as he himself have experience both in he private and public attempt and such as other have experience also he state the way in which private attempt of this nature might probably be successful he then answer all objection against they capacity as draw from philosophy form anatomy and observation and vindicate these from he own experience and lastly he throw out idea for the improvement of they condition by a establishment of a greater number of spiritual pastor among they by give they more privilege than they then possess and by extend towards they the benefit of a proper police mr ramsay have no other motive for give this work to the public than that of humanity of a wish to serve this much-injured part of the human species for he compile it at the hazard of forfeit that friendship which he have contract with many during he residence in the island and of suffer much in he private property as well as subject himself to the ill-will and persecution of numerous individual the publication of this book by one who profess to have be so long resident in the island and to have be a eyewitness of fact produce as may easily be suppose a good deal of conversation and make a considerable impression but particularly at this time when a storm be visibly gather over the head of the oppressor of the african race these circumstance occasion one or two person to attempt to answer it and these answer bring mr ramsay into the first controversy ever enter into on this subject during which as be the case in most controversy the cause of truth be spread the work which mr ramsay write upon this subject be the essay just mention in 1784 _ a inquiry _ also _ into the effect of the abolition of the slave trade _ in 1784 _ a reply to personal invective and objection _ in 1785 _ a letter to jame tobin esq _ in 1787 _ objection to the abolition of the slave trade with answer _ and _ a examination of harri 's scriptural research on the licitness of the slave trade _ in 1788 and _ a address on the propose bill for the abolition of the slave trade _ in 1789 in short from the time when he first take up the cause he be engage in it till he death which be not a little accelerate by he exertion he live however to see this cause in a train of parliamentary inquiry and he die satisfied be convince as he often express that the investigation must inevitably lead to the total abolition of the slave trade in the next year that be in the year 1785 another advocate be see in monsieur necker in he celebrated work on the _ french finances _ which have just be translate into the english language from the original work in 1784 this virtuous statesman after have give he estimate of the population and revenue of the french west indian colony proceed thus : -- the colony of france contain as we have see near five hundred thousand slave and it be from the number of these poor wretch that the inhabitant set a value on they plantation what a dreadful prospect and how profound a subject for reflection alas how little be we both in we morality and we principle we preach up humanity and yet go every year to bind in chain twenty thousand native of africa we call the moor barbarian and ruffian because they attack the liberty of european at the risk of they own yet these european go without danger and as mere speculator to purchase slave by gratify the avarice of they master and excite all those bloody scene which be the usual preliminary of this traffic he go on still further in the same strain he then show the kind of power which have support this execrable trade he throw out the idea of a general compact by which all the european nation should agree to abolish it and he indulge the please hope that it may take place even in the present generation in the same year we find other coadjutor come before we view but these in a line different from that in which any other belong to this class have yet move mr george white a clergyman of the established church and mr john chubb suggest to mr william tucket the mayor of bridgewater where they reside and to other of that town the propriety of petition parliament for the abolition of the slave trade this petition be agree upon and when draw up be as follow : -- the humble petition of the inhabitant of bridgewater showeth that you petitioner reflect with the deepest sensibility on the deplorable condition of that part of the human species the african negro who by the most flagitious means be reduce to slavery and misery in the british colony beg leave to address this honorable house in they behalf and to express a just abhorrence of a system of oppression which no prospect of private gain no consideration of public advantage no plea of political expediency can sufficiently justify or excuse that satisfied as you petitioner be that this inhuman system meet with the general execration of mankind they flatter themselves the day be not far distant when it will be universally abolish and they most ardently hope to see a british parliament by the extinction of that sanguinary traffic extend the blessing of liberty to million beyond this realm hold up to a enlighten world a glorious and merciful example and stand in the defense of the violate rights of human nature this petition be present by the honorable ann poulet and alexander hood esq -lrb- afterwards lord bridport -rrb- who be the member for the town of bridgewater it be order to lie on the table the answer which these gentleman give to they constituent relative to the reception of it in the house of common be worthy of notice : -- there do not appear say they in they common letter the least disposition to pay any further attention to it every one almost say that the abolition of the slave trade must immediately throw the west indian island into convulsion and soon complete they utter ruin thus they will not trust providence for its protection for so pious a undertaking in the year 1786 captain j smith of the royal navy offer himself to the notice of the public in behalf of the african cause mr ramsay as i have observe before have become involve in a controversy in consequence of he support of it he opponent not only attack he reputation but have the effrontery to deny he fact this circumstance occasion captain smith to come forward he write a letter to he friend mr hill in which he state that he have see those thing while in the west indy which mr ramsay have assert to exist but which have be so boldly deny he give also permission to mr hill to publish this letter too much praise can not be bestow on captain smith for thus stand forth in a noble cause and in behalf of a injured character the last of the necessary forerunner and coadjutor of this class whom i be to mention be we much-admired poet cowper and a great coadjutor he be when we consider what value be put upon he sentiment and the extraordinary circulation of he work there be few person who have not be properly impress by the follow line : -- my ear be pain would my soul be sick with every day 's report of wrong and outrage with which earth be fill would there be no flesh in man 's obdurate heart it do not feel for man the natural bond of brotherhood be sever would as the flax that fall asunder at the touch of fire he find he fellow guilty of a skin not color would like he own and have power to inforce the wrong for such a worthy cause doom and devote he as he lawful prey land intersect by a narrow frith abhor each other mountain interpo would make enemy of nation who have else like kindred drop be mingle into one thus man devote he brother and destroy and worse than all and most to be deplore as human nature 's broadest foulest blot -- chain he and task he and exact he sweat with stripe that mercy with a bleeding heart weep when she see inflict on a beast then what be man and what man see this and have human feeling do not blush and hang he head to think himself a man i would not have a slave to till my ground to carry I to fan I while i sleep and tremble when i wake for all the wealth that sinew buy and sell have ever earn would no : dear as freedom be -- and in my heart 's just estimation prize above all price -- i have much rather be myself the slave and wear the bond than fasten they on he we have no slave at home -- then why abroad and they themselves once ferry o'er the wave that part we be emancipate and loo would slave can not breathe in england if they lung receive we air that moment they be free they touch we country and they shackle fall -lrb- a -rrb- that be noble and bespeak a nation proud and jealous of the blessing spread it then and let it circulate through every vein of all you empire -- that where britain 's power be feel mankind may feel she mercy too -lrb- footnote a : expression use in the great trial when mr sharp obtain the verdict in favor of somerset -rrb- chapter iv -- second class of forerunner and coadjutor up to may 1787 consist of the quaker in england -- of george fox and other -- of the body of the quaker assemble at the yearly meeting in 1727 and at various other time -- quaker as a body petition parliament and circulate book on the subject -- individual among they become labourer and associate in behalf of the african dilwyn harrison and other -- this the first association ever form in england for the purpose the second class of the forerunner and coadjutor in this great cause up to may 1787 will consist of the quaker in england the first of this class be george fox the venerable founder of this benevolent society george fox be contemporary with richard baxter be bear not long after he and die much about the same time like he he leave he testimony against this wicked trade when he be in the island of barbado in the year 1671 he deliver himself to those who attend he religious meeting in the follow manner : -- consider with yourselve say he if you be in the same condition as the poor african be -- who come stranger to you and be sell to you as slave -- i say if this should be the condition of you or yours you would think it a hard measure yea and very great bondage and cruelty and therefore consider seriously of this and do you for they and to they as you would willingly have they or any other do unto you be you in the like slavish condition and bring they to know the lord christ and in he journal speaking of the advice which he give he friend at barbado he say i desire also that they would cause they overseer to deal mildly and gently with they negro and not to use cruelty towards they as the manner of some have be and that after certain year of servitude they should make they free william edmundson who be a minister of the society and indeed a fellow-traveller with george fox have the boldness in the same island to deliver he sentiment to the governor on the same subject have be bring before he and accuse of make the african christian or in other word of make they rebel and destroy they owner he reply that it be a good thing to bring they to the knowledge of god and christ jesus and to believe in he who die for they and all man and that this would keep they from rebel or cut any person 's throat but if they do rebel and cut they throat as the governor insinuate they would it would be they own do in keep they in ignorance and under oppression in give they liberty to be common with woman like brute and on the other hand in starve they for want of meat and clothes convenient thus give they liberty in that which god restrain and restrain they in that which be meat and clothing i do not find any individual of this society move in this cause for some time after the death of george fox and william edmundson the first circumstance of moment which i discover be a resolution of the whole society on the subject at they yearly meeting hold in london in the year 1727 the resolution be contain in the follow word : -- it be the sense of this meeting that the import of negro from they native country and relation by friend be not a commendable nor allowed practice and be therefore censure by this meeting in the year 1758 the quaker think it they duty as a body to pass another resolution upon this subject at this time the nature of the trade begin to be better know we find they more animated upon it as the follow extract will show : -- we fervently warn all in profession with we that they carefully avoid be any way concern in reap the unrighteous profit arise from the iniquitous practice of deal in negro or other slave whereby in the original purchase one man selleth another as he doth the beast that perish without any better pretension to a property in he than that of superior force in direct violation of the gospel rule which teacheth all to do as they would be do by and to do good to all be the reverse of that covetous disposition which furnisheth encouragement to those poor ignorant people to perpetuate they savage war in order to supply the demand of this most unnatural traffic by which great number of mankind free by nature be subject to inextricable bondage and which have often be observe to fill they possessor with haughtiness tyranny luxury and barbarity corrupt the mind and debase the moral of they child to the unspeakable prejudice of religion and virtue and the exclusion of that holy spirit of universal love meekness and charity which be the unchangeable nature and the glory of true christianity we therefore can do no less than with the greatest earnestness impress it upon friend everywhere that they endeavor to keep they hand clear of this unrighteous gain of oppression the quaker hitherto as appear by the two resolution which have be quote do nothing more than seriously warn all those in religious profession with they against be concern in this trade but in three year afterwards or at the yearly meeting in 1761 they come to a resolution as we find by the follow extract from they minute that any of they member hay a concern in it should be disown : -- this meeting have reason to apprehend that diver under we name be concern in the unchristian traffic in negro doth recommend it earnestly to the care of friend everywhere to discourage as much as in they lie a practice so repugnant to we christian profession and to deal with all such as shall persevere in a conduct so reproachful to christianity and to disown they if they desist not therefrom the yearly meeting of 1761 have thus agree to exclude from membership such as should be find concern in this trade that of 1763 endeavor to draw the cord still tighter by attach criminality to those who should aid and abet the trade in any manner by the minute which be make on this occasion i apprehend that no one belong to the society could furnish even material for such voyage we renew we exhortation that friend everywhere be especially careful to keep they hand clear of give encouragement in any shape to the slave trade it be evidently destructive of the natural rights of mankind who be all ransom by one savior and visit by one divine light in order to salvation a traffic calculate to enrich and aggrandize some upon the misery of other in its nature abhorrent to every just and tender sentiment and contrary to the whole tenor of the gospel some pleasing intelligence have be send on this subject by the society in america to the society in england the yearly meeting of 1772 think it they duty to notice it and to keep they former resolution alive by the follow minute : -- it appear that the practice of hold negro in oppressive and unnatural bondage have be so successfully discourage by friend in some of the colony as to be considerably lessen we can not but approve of these salutary endeavor and earnestly intreat that they may be continue that through the favor of divine providence a traffic so unmerciful and unjust in its nature to a part of we own species make equally with ourselves for immortality may come to be consider by all in its proper light and be utterly abolish as a reproach to the christian name i must beg leave to stop here for a moment just to pay the quaker a due tribute of respect for the proper estimation in which they have uniformly hold the miserable outcast of society who have be the subject of these minute what a contrast do it afford to the sentiment of many other concern they how have we be compel to prove by a long chain of evidence that they have the same feeling and capacity as ourselves how many profess themselves enlighten even now view they as of a different species but in the minute which have be cite we have see they uniformly represent as person ransom by one and the same savior as visit by one and the same light for salvation and as make equally for immortality as other these practical view of mankind as they be highly honorable to the member of this society so they afford a proof both of the reality and of the consistency of they religion but to return : -- from this time there appear to have be a grow desire in this benevolent society to step out of its ordinary course in behalf of this injured people it have hitherto confine itself to the keep of its own member unpolluted by any gain from they oppression but it be now ready to make a appeal to other and to bear a more public testimony in they favor accordingly in the month of June 1783 when a bill have be bring into the house of common for certain regulation to be make with respect to the african trade the society send the follow petition to that branch of the legislature : -- you petitioner meet in this they annual assembly have solemnly consider the state of the enslaved negro conceive themselves engage in religious duty to lay the suffering situation of that unhappy people before you as a subject loudly call for the humane interposition of the legislature you petitioner regret that a nation profess the christian faith should so far counteract the principle of humanity and justice as by the cruel treatment of this oppressed race to fill they mind with prejudice against the mild and beneficent doctrine of the gospel under the countenance of the law of this country many thousand of these we fellow-creature entitle to the natural rights of mankind be hold as personal property in cruel bondage and you petitioner be inform that a bill for the regulation of the african trade be now before the house contain a clause which restrain the officer of the african company from export negro you petitioner deeply affect with a consideration of the rapine oppression and bloodshed attend this traffic humbly request that this restriction may be extend to all person whomsoever or that the house would grant such other relief in the premise as in its wisdom may seem meet this petition be present by sir cecil wray who on introduce it speak very respectfully of the society he declare he hearty approbation of they application and say he hope he should see the day when not a slave would remain within the dominion of this realm lord north second the motion say he could have no objection to the petition and that its object ought to recommend it to every humane breast that it do credit to the most benevolent society in the world but that the session be so far advance the subject could not then be take into consideration and he regret that the slave trade against which the petition be so justly direct be in a commercial view become necessary to almost every nation of europe the petition be then bring up and read after which it be order to lie on the table this be the first petition -lrb- be two year earlier than that from the inhabitant of bridgewater -rrb- which be ever present to parliament for the abolition of the slave trade but the society do not stop here for have at the yearly meeting of 1783 particularly recommend the cause to a standing committee appoint to act at interval call the meeting for suffering the latter in this same year resolve upon a address to the public entitle _ the case of we fellow-creature the oppressed african respectfully recommend to the serious consideration of the legislature of great britain by the people call quaker _ : in which they endeavor in the most pathetic manner to make the reader acquaint with the cruel nature of this trade and they order 2000 copy of it to be print in the year 1784 they begin the distribution of this case the first copy be send to the king through lord carmarthen and the second and the third through proper officer to the queen and the prince of wale other be send by a deputation of two member of the society to mr pitt as prime-minister to the lord chancellor thurlow to lord

and to report the success of they labor in the ensue year order be also give for the reprinting and circulation of 10000 other copy of _ the case _ in the year 1785 the society interested itself again in a similar manner for the meeting for suffering as represent it recommend to the quarterly meeting to distribute a work write by anthony benezet in america call _ a caution to great britain and she

several public body the regular and dissenting clergy justice of the peace and particularly among the great school of the kingdom that the rise youth might acquire a knowledge and at the same time a

charter-house st paul merchant-taylor eton winchester and harrow be among those visit several academy also be visit for this purpose but i must now take my leave of the quaker as a public body -lrb- a -rrb- and go back to the year 1783 to record a event which will be find of great importance in the present history and in which only individual belong to the society be concern this event seem to have arise naturally out of exist or past circumstance for the society as i have before state have send a petition to parliament in this year pray for the abolition of the slave trade it have also lay the foundation for a public distribution of the book as just mention with a view of enlighten other on this great subject the case of the ship zong which i have before have occasion to explain have occur this same year a letter also have be present much about the same time by benjamin west from anthony benezet before mention to we queen in behalf of the injured african which she have receive graciously these subject occupy at this time the attention of many quaker family and among other that of a few individual who be in close intimacy with each other these when they meet together frequently converse upon they they perceive as fact come out in conversation that there be a grow knowledge and hatred of the slave trade and that the temper of the time be ripen towards its abolition hence a disposition manifest itself among these to unite as labourer for the furtherance of so desirable a object a union be at length propose and approve of and the follow person -lrb- place in alphabetical order -rrb- come together to execute the office grow out of it : -- -lrb- footnote a : the quaker as a public body keep the subject alive at they yearly meeting in 178417851787 & c -rrb- william dillwyn thoma knowle md george harrison john lloyd samuel hoare joseph wood the first meeting be hold on the seventh of July 1783 at this they assemble to consider what step they should take for the relief and liberation of the negro slave in the west indy and for the discouragement of the slave trade on the coast of africa to promote this object they conceive it necessary that the public mind should be enlighten respect it they have recourse therefore to the public papers and they appoint they member in turn to write in these and to see that they production be insert they keep regular minute for this purpose it be not however know to the world that such a association exist it appear that they have several meeting in the course of this year before the close of it they have secure a place in the _ general evening post _ in _ lloyd 's evening post _ in the norwich bath york bristol sherborne liverpool newcastle and other provincial papers for such article as they choose to send to they these consist principally of extract from such author both in prose and verse as they think would most enlighten and interest the mind upon the subject of they institution in the year 1784 they pursue the same plan but they begin now to print book the first be from a manuscript compose by joseph wood one of the committee it be entitle _ thought on the slavery of the negro _ this manuscript be well put together it be a manly and yet feel address in behalf of the oppressed african it contain a sober and dispassionate appeal to the reason of all without offend the prejudice of any it be distribute at the expense of the association and prove to be highly useful to the cause which it be intend to promote a communication have be make to the committee that dr porteus then bishop of chester have preach a sermon before the society for the propagation of the gospel in behalf of the injured african -lrb- which sermon be notice in the last chapter -rrb- samuel hoare be depute to obtain permission to publish it this lead he to a correspondence with mr ramsay before mention the latter apply in consequence to the bishop and obtain he consent thus this valuable sermon be also give to the world in the year 1785 the association continue they exertion as before but i have no room to specify they i may observe however that david barclay a grandson of the great apologist of that name assist at one of they meeting and -lrb- what be singular -rrb- that he be in a few year afterwards unexpectedly call to a trial of he principle on this very subject for he and he brother john become in consequence of a debt due to they possess of a large grazing farm or pen in jamaica which have thirty-two slave upon it convinced however that the retain of they fellow-creature in bondage be not only irreconcilable with the principle of christianity but subversive of the rights of human nature they determine upon the emancipation of these and they -lrb- a -rrb- perform this generous office to the satisfaction of they mind to the honor of they character to the benefit of the public and to the happiness of the slave -lrb- b -rrb- i mention this anecdote not only to gratify myself by pay a proper respect to those generous person who sacrifice they interest to principle but also to show the sincerity of david barclay -lrb- who be now the only survive brother -rrb- as he actually put in practice what at one of these meeting he be desirous of recommend to other -lrb- footnote a : they engage a agent to embark for jamaica in 1796 to effect this business and have the slave convey to philadelphium where they be kindly receive by the society for improve the condition of free black people suitable situation be find for the adult and the young one be bind out apprentice to handicraft trade and to receive school learning -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : jame pemberton of philadelphium make the follow observation in a letter to a friend in england : -- david barclay 's humane view towards the black from jamaica have be so far realize that these object of he concern enjoy they freedom with comfort to themselves and be respectable in they character keep up a friendly intercourse with each other and avoid to intermix with the common black of this city be sober in they conduct and industrious in they business -rrb- have now bring up the proceedings of this little association towards the year 1786 i shall take my leave of it remark that it be the first ever form in england for the promotion of the abolition of the slave trade that quaker have have this honor be unquestionable nor be it extraordinary that they should have take the lead on this occasion when we consider how advantageously they have be situate for so do for the slave trade as we have not long ago see come within the discipline of the society in the year 1727 from thence it continue to be a object of it till 1783 in 1783 the society petition parliament and in 1784 it distribute book to enlighten the public concern it thus we see that every quaker bear since the year 1727 be nourish as it be in a fix hatred against it he be teach that any concern in it be a crime of the deepest dye he be teach that the bearing of he testimony against it be a test of unity with those of the same religious profession the discipline of the quaker be therefore a school for bring they up as advocate for the abolition of this trade to this it may be add that the quaker know more about the trade and the slavery of the african than any other religious body of man who have not be in the land of they suffering for there have be a correspondence between the society in america and that in england on the subject the contents of which must have be know to the member of each american minister also be frequently cross the atlantic on religious mission to england these when they travel through various part of we island frequently related to the quaker family in they way the cruelty they have see and hear of in they own country english minister be also frequently go over to america on the same religious errand these on they return seldom fail to communicate what they have learn or observe but more particularly relative to the oppressed african in they travels the journal also of these which give occasional account of the suffering of the slave be frequently publish thus situate in point of knowledge and bring up moreover from they youth in a detestation of the trade the quaker be ready to act whenever a favourable opportunity should present itself chapter v third

the forerunner and coadjutor up to the year 1787 will consist first of the quaker in america and then of other as they be unite to these for the same object it may be ask how the quaker live there should have become forerunner and coadjutor in the great work now under we consideration i reply first that it be a object for many year with these to do away the slave trade as it be carry on in they own port but this trade be conduct in part both before and after the independence of america by we own countryman it be secondly a object with these to annihilate slavery in america and this they have be instrument in accomplish to a considerable extent but any abolition of slavery within give boundary must be a blow to the slave trade there the american quaker lastly live in a land where both the commerce and slavery exist be in the way of obtain a number of important fact relative to both which make for they annihilation and communicate many of these fact to those in england who espouse the same cause they become fellow-labourer with these in produce the event in question the quaker in america it must be own do most of they originally as other settler there with respect to the purchase of slave they have land without a sufficient number of labourer and family without a sufficient number of servant for they work african be pour in to obviate these difficulty and these be buy promiscuously by all in these day indeed the purchase of they be deem favourable to both party for there be little or no knowledge of the manner in which they have be procure as slave there be no charge of inconsistency on this account as in later time but though many of the quaker engage without they usual consideration in purchase of this kind yet those constitutional principle which belong to the society occasion the member of it in general to treat those whom they purchase with great tenderness consider they though of a different color as brethren and as person for whose spiritual welfare it become they to be concern so that slavery except as to the power legally belong to it be in general little more than servitude in they hand this treatment as it be thus mild on the continent of america where the member of this society be the owner of slave so it be equally mild in the west indium island where they have a similar property in the latter country however where only a few of they live it begin soon to be productive of serious consequence for it be so different from that which the rest of the inhabitant consider to be proper that the latter become alarm at it hence in barbado a act be pass in 1676 under governor atkin which be entitle a act to prevent the people call quaker from bring they negro into they meeting for worship though they hold these in they own house this act be found on the pretence that the safety of the island might be endanger if the slave be to imbibe the religious principle of they master under this act ralph fretwell and richard sutton be fine in the different sum of eight hundred and of three hundred pound because each of they have suffer a meeting of the quaker at he own house at the first of which eighty negro and at the second of which thirty of they be present but this matter be carry still further for in 1680 sir richard dutton then governor of the island issue a order to the deputy provost marshal and other to prohibit all meeting of this society in the island of nevi the same bad spirit manifest itself so early as in 1661 a law be make there prohibit member of this society from come on shore negro be put in iron for be present at they meeting and they themselves be fine also at length in 1677 another act be pass lay a heavy penalty on every master of a vessel who should even bring a quaker to the island in antigua and bermuda similar proceedings take place so that the quaker be in time expel from this part of the world by these mean a valuable body of man be lose to the community in these island whose example might have be highly useful and the poor slave who see nothing but misery in he temporal prospects be deprive of the only balm which could have soothe he sorrow -- the comfort of religion but to return to the continent of america though the treatment which the quaker adopt there towards those african who fall into they hand be so highly commendable it do not prevent individual among they from become uneasy about hold they in slavery at all some of these bear they private testimony against it from the beginning as a wrong practice and in process of time bring it before the notice of they brethren as a religious body so early as in the year 1688 some emigrant from krieshiem in germany who have adopt the principle of william penn and follow he into pennsylvanium urge in the yearly meeting of the society there the inconsistency of buy selling and hold man in slavery with the principle of the christian religion in the year 1696 the yearly meeting for that province take up the subject as a public concern and the result be advice to the member of it to guard against future-importation of african slave and to be particularly attentive to the treatment of those who be then in they possession in the year 1711 the same yearly meeting resume the important subject and confirm and renew the advice which have be before give from this time it continue to keep the subject alive but find at length that though individual refuse to purchase slave yet other continue the custom and in greater number than it be apprehend would have be the case after the public declaration which have be make it determine in the year 1754 upon a fuller and more serious publication of its sentiment and therefore it issue in the same year the follow pertinent letter to all the member within its jurisdiction : -- dear friend it have frequently be the concern of we yearly meeting to testify they uneasiness and disunity with the importation and purchasing of negro and other slave and to direct the overseer of the several meeting to advise and deal with such as engage therein and it have likewise be the continual care of many weighty friend to press those who bear we name to guard as much as possible against be in any respect concern in promote the bondage of such unhappy people yet as we have with sorrow to observe that they number be of late increase among we we have think it proper to make we advice and judgment more public that none may plead ignorance of we principle therein and also again earnestly to exhort all to avoid in any manner encourage that practice of make slave of we fellow-creature now dear friend if we continually bear in mind the royal law of do to other as we would be do by we should never think of bereave we fellow-creature of that valuable blessing -- liberty nor endure to grow rich by they bondage to live in ease and plenty by the toil of those whom violence and cruelty have put in we power be neither consistent with christianity nor common justice and we have good reason to believe draw down the displeasure of heaven it be a melancholy but true reflection that where slave-keeping prevail pure religion and sobriety decline as it evidently tend to harden the heart and render the soul less susceptible of that holy spirit of love meekness and charity which be the peculiar characteristic of a true christian how then can we who have be concern to publish the gospel of universal love and peace among mankind be so inconsistent with ourselves as to purchase such as be prisoner of war and thereby encourage this anti-christian practice and more especially as many of these poor creature be steal away parent from child and child from parent and other who be in good circumstance in they native country inhumanly tear from what they esteem a happy situation and compel to toil in a state of slavery too often extremely cruel what dreadful scene of murder and cruelty those barbarous ravages must occasion in these unhappy people 's country be too obvious to mention let we make they case we own and consider what we should think and how we should feel be we in they circumstance remember we bless redeemer 's positive command -- to do unto other as we would have they do unto we -- and that with what measure we mete it shall be measure to we again and we intreat you to examine whether the purchasing of a negro either bear here or import doth not contribute to a further importation and consequently to the uphold of all the evil above mention and to the promote of man-steal the only theft which by the mosaic law be punish with death -- he that stealeth a man and selleth he or if he be find in he hand he shall surely be put to death ' the characteristic and badge of a true christian be love and continual exercise of they : ` love one another ' say he ` as i have love you ' but how can we be say to love we brethren who bring or for selfish end keep they in bondage do we act consistently with this noble principle who lay such heavy burden on we fellow creature do we consider that they be call and do we sincerely desire that they may become heir with we in glory and that they may rejoice in the liberty of the son of god whilst we be withhold from they the common liberty of mankind or can the spirit of god by which we have always profess to be lead be the author of these oppressive and unrighteous measure or do we not thereby manifest that temporal interest have more influence on we conduct herein than the dictate of that merciful holy and unerring guide and we likewise earnestly recommend to all who have slave to be careful to come up in the performance of they duty towards they and to be particularly watchful over they own heart it be by sorrowful experience remarkable that custom and a familiarity with evil of any kind have a tendency to bias the judgment and to deprave the mind and it be obvious that the future welfare of these poor slave who be now in bondage be generally too much disregard by those who keep they if they daily task of labor be but fulfil little else perhaps be think of : nay even that which in other would be look upon with horror and detestation be little regard in they by they master such as the frequent separation of husband from wife and wife from husband whereby they be tempt to break they marriage covenant and live in adultery in direct opposition to the law of god and man although we believe that christ die for all man without respect of person how fearful then ought we to be of engage in what have so natural a tendency to lesson we humanity and of suffer ourselves to be inure to the exercise of hard and cruel measure lest thereby in any degree we lose we tender and feeling sense of the misery of we fellow-creature and become worse than those who have not believe and dear friend you who by inheritance have slave bear in you family we beseech you to consider they as soul commit to you trust whom the lord will require at you hand and who as well as you be make partaker of the spirit of grace and call to be heir of salvation and let it be you constant care to watch over they for good instruct they in the fear of god and the knowledge of the gospel of christ that they may answer the end of they creation and that god may be glorified and honor by they as well as by we and so train they up that if you should come to behold they unhappy situation in the same light that many worthy man who be at rest have do and many of you brethren now do and should think it you duty to set they free they may be the more capable of make proper use of they liberty finally brethren we intreat you in the bowels of gospel-love seriously to weigh the cause of detain they in bondage if it be for you own private gain or any other motive than they good it be much to be fear that the love of god and the influence of the holy spirit be not the prevail principle in you and that you heart be not sufficiently redeem from the world which that you with ourselves may more and more come to witness through the cleanse virtue of the holy spirit of jesus christ be we earnest desire with the salutation of we love we be you friend and brethren : -- _ sign in behalf of the yearly meeting by _ john evan abraham farringdon john smith joseph noble thoma carleton jame daniel william trimble joseph gibson john scarborough john shotwell joseph hampton joseph parker this truly christian letter which be write in the year 1754 be design as we collect from the contents of it to make the sentiment of the society better know and attend to on the subject of the slave trade it contain as we see exhortation to all the member within the yearly meeting of pennsylvanium and the jersey to desist from purchase and import slave and where they possess they to have a tender consideration of they condition but that the first part of the subject of this exhortation might be enforce the yearly meeting for the same province come to a resolution in 1755 that if any of the member belong to it buy or import slave the overseer be to inform they respective monthly meeting of it that these might treat with they as they might be direct in the wisdom of truth in the year 1774 we find the same yearly meeting legislating again on the same subject by the precede resolution they who become offender be subject only to exclusion from the meeting for discipline and from the privilege of contribute to the pecuniary occasion of the society but by the resolution of the present year all member concern in import sell purchase give or transfer negro or other slave or otherwise act in such manner as to continue they in slavery beyond the term limit by law -lrb- a -rrb- or custom be direct to be exclude from membership or disown at this meeting also all the member of it be caution and advise against act as executor or administrator to estate where slave be bequeath or likely to be detain in bondage -lrb- footnote a : this allude to the term of servitude for white person in these province -rrb- in the year 1776 the same yearly meeting carry the matter still further it be enact that the owner of slave who refuse to execute proper instrument for give they they freedom be to be disown likewise in 1778 it be enact by the same meeting that the child of those who have be set free by member should be tenderly advise and have a suitable education give they it be not necessary to proceed further on this subject it may be sufficient to say that from this time the minute of the yearly meeting for pennsylvanium and the jersey exhibit proof of a almost incessant attention year after year -lrb- b -rrb- to the means not only of wipe away the stain of slavery from they religious community but of promote the happiness of those restore to freedom and of they posterity also and as the yearly meeting of pennsylvanium and the jersey set this bright example so those of new england new york maryland virginium and of the carolina and georgium in process of time follow it -lrb- footnote b : thus in 1778-17821784-1786 the member also of this meeting petition they own legislature on this subject both in 1783 and in 1786 -rrb- but whilst the quaker be make these exertion at they different yearly meeting in america as a religious body to get rid both of the commerce and slavery of they fellow-creature other in the same profession be act as individual -lrb- that be on they own grounds and independently of any influence from they religious communion -rrb- in the same cause whose labor it will now be proper in a separate narrative to detail the first person of this description in the society be william burling of long island he have conceive a abhorrence of slavery from early youth in process of time he begin to bear he testimony against it by represent the unlawfulness of it to those of he own society when assemble at one of they yearly meeting this expression of he public testimony he continue annually on the same occasion he write also several tract with the same design one of which publish in the year 1718 he address to the elder of he own church on the inconsistency of compelling people and they posterity to serve they continually and arbitrarily and without any proper recompense for they service the next be ralph sandiford a merchant in philadelphium this worthy person have many offer of pecuniary assistance which would have advance he in life but he decline they all because they come from person who have acquire they independence by the oppression of they slave he be very earnest in endeavor to prevail upon he friend both in and out of the society to liberate those whom they hold in bondage at length he determine upon a work call the _ mystery of iniquity _ in a brief examination of the practice of the time this he publish in the year 1780 though the chief judge have threaten he if he should give it to the world and he circulate it free of expense wherever he believe it would be useful the above work be excellent as a composition the language of it be correct the style manly and energetic and it abound with fact sentiment and quotation which while they show the virtue and talent of the author render it a valuable appeal in behalf of the african cause the next public advocate be benjamin lay -lrb- a -rrb- who live at abington at the distance of twelve or fourteen mile from philadelphium benjamin lay be know when in england to the royal family of that day into whose private presence he be admit on he return to america he take a active part in behalf of the oppressed african in the year 1737 he publish a _ treatise on slave-keeping _ this he give away among he neighbor and other but more particularly among the rise youth many of whom he visit in they respective school he apply also to several of the governor for interview with whom he hold conference on the subject benjamin lay be a man of strong understanding and of great integrity but of warm and irritable feeling and more particularly so when he be call forth on any occasion in which the oppressed african be concern for he have live in the island of barbado and he have witness there scene of cruelty towards they which have greatly disturbed he mind and which unhinge it as it be whenever the subject of they suffering be bring before he hence if other do not think precisely as he do when he converse with they on the subject he be apt to go out of due bound in bear what he believe to be he testimony against this system of oppression he adopt sometimes a singularity of manner by which as convey demonstration of a certain eccentricity of character he diminish in some degree he usefulness to the cause which he have undertake as far indeed as this eccentricity might have the effect of prevent other from join he in he pursuit lest they should be think singular also so far it must be allow that he cease to become beneficial but there can be no question on the other hand that he warm and enthusiastic manners awaken the attention of many to the cause and give they first impression concern it which they never afterwards forget and which render they useful to it in the subsequent part of they life -lrb- footnote a : benjamin lay attend the meeting for worship or associate himself with the religious society of the quaker he wife too be a approve minister of the gospel in that society but i believe he be not long a acknowledged member of it himself -rrb- the person who labor next in the society in behalf of the oppressed african be john woolman john woolman be bear at northampton in the county of burlington and province of western new jersey in the year 1720 in he very early youth he attend in a extraordinary manner to the religious impression which he perceive upon he mind and begin to have a earnest solicitude about tread in the right path from what i have read and hear say he in he journal -lrb- a -rrb- i believe there have be in past age people who walk in uprightness before god in a degree exceed any that i know or hear of now live and the apprehension of there be less steadiness and firmness among people of this age than in past age often trouble I while i be a child a anxious desire to do away as far as himself be concern this merit reproach operate as one among other cause to induce he to be particularly watchful over he thought and action and to endeavor to attain that purity of heart without which he conceive there could be no perfection of the christian character accordingly in the twenty-second year of he age he have give such proof of the integrity of he life and of he religious qualification that he become a acknowledged minister of the gospel in he own society -lrb- footnote a : this short sketch of the life and labor of john woolman be make up from he journal -rrb- at a time prior to he enter upon the ministry be in low circumstance he agree for wages to attend shop for a person at mount holly and to keep he book in this situation we discover by a occurrence that happen that he have think seriously on the subject and that he have conceive proper view of the christian unlawfulness of slavery my employer say he have a negro woman sell she and desire I to write a bill of sale the man be wait who buy she the thing be sudden and though the thought of write a instrument of slavery for one of my fellow-creature make I feel uneasy yet i remembered i be hire by the year that it be my master who direct I to do it and that it be a elderly man a member of we society who buy she so through weakness i give way and write but at execute it i be so afflict in my mind that i say before my master and the friend that i believe slave-keeping to be a practice inconsistent with the christian religion this in some degree abate my uneasiness yet as often as i reflect seriously upon it i think i should have be clearer if i have desire to have be excuse from it as a thing against my conscience for such it be and some time after this a young man of we society speak to I to write a conveyance of a slave to he he have lately take a negro into he house i tell he i be not easy to write it for though many of we meeting and in other place keep slave i still believe the practice be not right and desire to be excuse from the write i speak to he in good-will and he tell I that keep slave be not altogether agreeable to he mind but that the slave be a gift to he wife he have accept of she we may easily conceive that a person so scrupulous and tender on this subject -lrb- as indeed john woolman be on all other -rrb- be in the way of become in time more eminently serviceable to he oppressed fellow-creature we have see already the good seed sown in he heart and it seem to have want only providential season and occurrence to be bring into productive fruit accordingly we find that a journey which he take as a minister of the gospel in 1746 through the province of maryland virginium and north carolina which be then more note than other for the number of slave in they contribute to prepare he as a instrument for the advancement of this great cause the follow be he own observation upon this journey : -- two thing be remarkable to I in this journey first in regard to my entertainment when i eat drink and lodge free-cost with people who live in ease on the hard labor of they slave i feel uneasy and as my mind be inward to the lord i find from place to place this uneasiness return upon I at time through the whole visit where the master bear a good share of the burden and live frugally so that they servant be well provide for and they labor moderate i feel more easy but where they live in a costly way and lay heavy burden on they slave my exercise be often great and i frequently have conversation with they in private concern it secondly this trade of import slave from they native country be much encouraged among they and the white people and they child so generally live without much labor be frequently the subject of my serious thought : and i saw in these southern province so many vice and corruption increase by this trade and this way of life that it appear to I as a gloom over the land from the year 1747 to the year 1758 he seem to have be occupy chiefly as a minister of religion but in the latter year he publish a work upon slave-keeping and in the same year while travel within the compass of he own monthly meeting a circumstance happen which keep alive he attention to the same subject about this time say he a person at some distance lie sick he brother come to I to write he will i know he have slave and ask he brother be tell he intend to leave they as slave to he child as writing be a profitable employ and as offend sober people be disagreeable to my inclination i be straiten in my mind but as i look to the lord he incline my heart to he testimony and i tell the man that i believe the practice of continue slavery to this people be not right and that i have a scruple in my mind against do writings of that kind that though many in we society keep they as slave still i be not easy to be concern in it and desire to be excuse from go to write the will i speak to he in the fear of the lord and he make no reply to what i say but go away : he also have some concern in the practice and i think he be displeased with I in this case i have a confirmation that act contrary to present outward interest from a motive of divine love and in regard to truth and righteousness open the way to a treasure better than silver and to a friendship exceed the friendship of man from 1753 to 1755 two circumstance of a similar kind take place which contribute greatly to strengthen he in the path he have take for in both these case the person who request he to make they will be so impressed by the principle upon which he refuse they and by he manner of do it that they bequeath liberty to they slave in the year 1756 he make a religious visit to several of the society in long island here it be that the seed now long foster by the genial influence of heaven begin to burst forth into fruit till this time he seem to have be a passive instrument attend only to such circumstance as come in he way on this subject but now he become a active one look out for circumstance for the exercise of he labor my mind say he be deeply engage in this visit both in public and private and at several place observe that member keep slave i find myself under a necessity in a friendly way to labor with they on that subject expressing as the way open the inconsistency of that practice with the parity of the christian religion and the ill effect of it as manifest amongst we in the year 1757 he feel he mind so deeply interested on the same subject that he resolve to travel over maryland virginium and north carolina in order to try to convince person principally in he own society of the inconsistency of hold slave he join he brother with he in this arduous service have pass the susquehanna into maryland he begin to experience great agitation of mind soon after i enter this province say he a deep and painful exercise come upon I which i often have some feeling of since my mind be draw towards these part and with which i have acquaint my brother before we agree to join as companion as the people in this and the southern province live much on the labor of slave many of whom be use hardly my concern be that i might attend with singleness of heart to the voice of the true shepherd and be so support as to remain unmoved at the face of man it be impossible for I to follow he in detail through this long and interesting journey when i consider the bound i have prescribe to myself in this work i shall say therefore what i propose to offer generally and in a few word it appear that he converse with person occasionally who be not of he own society with a view of answer they argument and of endeavor to evince the wickedness and impolicy of slavery in discourse with these however strenuous he might appear he seem never to have depart from a calm modest and yet dignified and even friendly demeanor at the public meeting for discipline hold by he own society in these province he endeavor to display the same truth and in the same manner but particularly to the elder of he own society exhort they as the most conspicuous rank to be careful of they conduct and to give a bright example in the liberation of they slave he visit also family for the same purpose : and he have the well-earned satisfaction of find he admonition kindly receive by some and of see a disposition in other to follow the advice he have give they in the year 1758 he attend the yearly meeting at philadelphium where he address he brethren on the propriety of deal with such member as should hereafter purchase slave on the discussion of this point he speak a second time and this to such effect that he have the satisfaction at this meeting to see minute make more fully than any before and a committee appoint for the advancement of the great object to which he have now be instrumental in turn the attention of many and to witness a considerable spreading of the cause in the same year also he join himself with two other of the society to visit such member of it as possess slave in chester county in this journey he describe himself to have meet with several who be please with he visit but to have find difficulty with other towards whom however he feel a sympathy and tenderness on account of they be entangled by the spirit of the world in the year 1759 he visit several of the society who hold slave in philadelphium in about three month afterwards he travel there again in company with john churchman to see other under similar circumstance he then go to different place on the same errand in this last journey he go alone after this he join himself to john churchman again but he confine he labor to he own province here he have the pleasure of find that the work prosper soon after this he take samuel eastburne as a coadjutor and plead the cause of the poor african with many of the society in buck county who hold they in bondage there in the year 1760 he travel in company with he friend samuel eastburne to rhode island to promote the same object this island have be long note for its trade to africa for slave he find at newport the great sea-port town belong to it that a number of they have be lately import he feel he mind deeply impressed on this account he be almost over-powered in consequence of it and become ill he think once of prompt a petition to the legislature to discourage all such importation in future he then think of go and speak to the house of assembly which be then sit but he be discourage from both these proceedings he hold however conference with many of he own society in the meeting-house chamber where the subject of he visit be discuss on both side with a calm and peaceable spirit many of those present manifest the concern they feel at they former practice and other a desire of take suitable care of they slave at they decease from newport he proceed to nantucket but observe the member of the society there to have few or no slave he exhort they to persevere in abstain from the use of they and return home in the year 1761 he visit several family in pennsylvanium and in about three month afterwards other about shrewsbury and squan in new jersey on he return he add a part to the treatise before publish on the keep of care which have be grow upon he for some year in the year 1762 he print publish and distribute this treatise in 1767 he go on foot to the western shore of the same province on a religious visit after have cross the susquehanna he old feeling return to he for come amongst people live in outward ease and greatness chiefly on the labor of slave he heart be much affect and he wait with humble resignation to learn how he should further perform he duty to this injured people the travel on foot though it be agreeable to the state of he mind he describe to have be wearisome to he body he feel himself weakly at time in consequence of it but yet continue to travel on at one of the quarterly meeting of the society be in great sorrow and heaviness and under deep exercise on account of the misery of the poor african he express himself freely to those present who hold they in bondage he expatiate on the tenderness and loving-kindness of the apostle as manifest in labor peril and suffering towards the poor gentile and contract they treatment of the gentile with it whom he describe in the person of they slave and be much satisfied with the result of he discourse from this time we collect little more from he journal concern he than that in 1772 he embark for england on a religious visit after he arrival there he travel through many county preach in different meeting of the society till he come to the city of york but even here though he be far remove from the sight of those whose interest he have so warmly espouse he be not forgetful of they wretched condition at the quarterly meeting for that county he bring they case before those present in a affect manner he exhort these to befriend they cause he remark that as they the society when under outward suffering have often find a concern to lay they before the legislature and thereby in the lord 's time have obtain relief so he recommend this oppressed part of the creation to they notice that they might as the way open represent they suffering as individual if not as a religious society to those in authority in this land this be the last opportunity that he have of interesting himself in behalf of this injured people for soon afterwards he be seize with the small-pox at the house of a friend in the city of york where he die the next person belong to the society of the quaker who labor in behalf of the oppressed african be anthony benezet he be bear before and he live after john woolman of course he be contemporary with he i place he after john woolman because he be not so much know as a labourer till two or three year after the other have begin to move in the same cause anthony benezet be bear at st quintin in picardy of a respectable family in the year 1713 he father be one of the many protestant who in consequence of the persecution which follow the revocation of the edict of nantz seek a asylum in foreign country after a short stay in holland he settle with he wife and child in london in 1715 anthony benezet have receive from he father a liberal education serve a apprenticeship in a eminent mercantile house in london in 1731 however he remove with he family to philadelphium where he join in profession with the quaker he three brother then engage in trade and make considerable pecuniary acquisition in it he himself might have partake both of they concern and of they prosperity but he do not feel himself at liberty to embark in they undertaking he consider the accumulation of wealth as of no importance when compare with the enjoyment of do good and he choose the humble situation of a schoolmaster as accord best with this notion believe that by endeavor to train up youth in knowledge and virtue he should become more extensively useful than in any other way to he fellow-creature he have not be long in he new situation before he manifest such a uprightness of conduct such a courtesy of manners such a purity of intention and such a spirit of benevolence that he attract the notice and gain the good opinion of the inhabitant among whom he live he have ready access to they in consequence upon all occasion and if there be any whom he fail to influence at any of these time he never go away without the possession of they respect in the year 1756 when a considerable number of french family be remove from acadium into pennsylvanium on account of some political suspicion he feel deeply interested about they in a country where few understand they language they be wretched and helpless but anthony benezet endeavor to soften the rigor of they situation by he kind attention towards they he exert himself also in they behalf by procure many contribution for they which by the consent of he fellow-citizen be intrust to he care as the principle of benevolence when duly cultivate bring forth fresh shoot and become enlarged so we find this amiable person extend the sphere of he usefulness by become a advocate for the oppressed african race for this service he seem to have be peculiarly qualify indeed as in all great work a variety of talent be necessary to bring they to perfection so providence seem to prepare different man as instrument with disposition and qualification so various that each in pursue that line which seem to suit he best contribute to furnish those part which when put together make up a complete whole in this point of view john woolman find in anthony benezet the coadjutor whom of all other the cause require the former have occupy himself principally on the subject of slavery the latter go to the root of the evil and more frequently attack the trade the former chiefly confine he labor to america and chiefly to those of he own society there the latter when he write do not write for america only but for europe also and endeavor to spread a knowledge and hatred of the traffic through the great society of the world one of the means which anthony benezet take to promote the cause in question -lrb- and a effectual one it prove as far as it go -rrb- be to give he scholar a due knowledge and proper impression concern it situate as they be likely to be in after-life in a country where slavery be a custom he thus prepare many and this annually for the promotion of he plan to enlighten other and to give they a similar bias he have recourse to different measure from time to time in the almanac publish annually in philadelphium he procure article to be insert which he believe would attract the notice of the reader and make he pause at least for a while as to the licitness of the slave trade he write also as he see occasion in the public papers of the day from small thing he proceed to greater he collect at length further information on the subject and wind it up with observation and reflection he produce several little tract which he circulate successively -lrb- but generally at he own expense -rrb- as he consider they adapt to the temper and circumstance of the time in the course of this he employment have find some who have approve he tract and to whom on that account he wish to write and send he tract to other to whom he think it proper to introduce they by letter he find himself engage in a correspondence which much engross he time but which prove of great importance in procure many advocate for he cause in the year 1762 when he have obtain a still greater store of information he publish a larger work this however he entitle _ a short account of that part of africa inhabit by the negro _ in 1767 he publish _ a caution and warn to great britain and she colony on the calamitous state of the enslaved negro in the british dominion _ and soon after this appear _ a historical account of guinea its situation produce and the general disposition of its inhabitant : with a inquiry into the rise and progress of the slave trade its nature and calamitous effect _ this pamphlet contain a clear and distinct development of the subject from the best authority it contain also the sentiment of many enlighten upon it and it become instrumental beyond any other book ever before publish in disseminate a proper knowledge and detestation of this trade anthony benezet may be consider as one of the most zealous vigilant and active advocate which the cause of the oppressed african ever have he seem to have be bear and to have live for the promotion of it and therefore he never omit any the least opportunity of serve it if a person call upon he who be go a journey he first thought usually be how he could make he a instrument in its favor he either give he tract to distribute or he send letter by he or he give he some commission on the subject so that he be the means of employ several person at the same time in various part of america in advance the work he have undertake in the same manner he avail himself of every other circumstance as far as he could to the same end when he hear that mr granville sharp have obtain in the year 1772 the noble verdict in the cause of somerset the slave he open a correspondence with he which he keep up that there might be a union of action between they for the future as far as it could be effect and that they might each give encouragement to the other to proceed he open also a correspondence with george whitfield and john wesley that these might assist he in promote the cause of the oppressed he write also a letter to the countess of huntingdon on the follow subject : -- she have found a college at the recommendation of george whitfield call the orphan-house near savannah in georgium and have endow it the object of this institution be to furnish scholastic instruction to the poor and to prepare some of they for the ministry george whitfield ever attentive to the cause of the poor african think that this institution might have be useful to they also but soon after he death they who succeed he buy slave and these in unusual number to extend the rice and indigo plantation belong to the college the letter then in question be write by anthony benezet in order to lay before the countess as a religious woman the misery she be occasion in africa by allow the manager of she college in georgium to give encouragement to the slave trade the countess reply that such a measure should never have she countenance and that she would take care to prevent it on discover that the abb raynal have bring out he celebrated work in which he manifest a tender feeling in behalf of the injured african he enter into a correspondence with he hope to make he yet more useful to they cause finding also in the year 1783 that the slave trade which have greatly decline during the american war be revive he address a pathetic letter to we queen -lrb- as i mention in the last chapter -rrb- who on hear the high character of the writer of it from benjamin west receive it with mark of peculiar condescension and attention the follow be a copy of it : -- to charlotte queen of great britain impressed with a sense of religious duty and encourage by the opinion generally entertain of thy benevolent disposition to succor the distressed i take the liberty very respectfully to offer to thy perusal some tract which i believe faithfully describe the suffering condition of many hundred thousand of we fellow-creature of the african race great number of whom rent from every tender connexion in life be annually take from they native land to endure in the american island and plantation a most rigorous and cruel slavery whereby many very many of they be bring to a melancholy and untimely end when it be consider that the inhabitant of great britain who be themselves so eminently bless in the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty have long be and yet be very deeply concern in this flagrant violation of the common rights of mankind and that even its national authority be exert in support of the african slave trade there be much reason to apprehend that this have be and as long as the evil exist will continue to be a occasion of draw down the divine displeasure on the nation and its dependency may these consideration induce thee to interpose thy kind endeavor in behalf of this greatly injured people whose abject situation give they a additional claim to the pity and assistance of the generous mind inasmuch as they be altogether deprive of the means of solicit effectual relief for themselves that so thou mayest not only be a bless instrument in the hand of he ` by whom king reign and prince decree justice ' to avert the awful judgment by which the empire have already be so remarkably shake but that the blessing of thousand ready to perish may come upon thee at a time when the superior advantage attendant on thy situation in this world will no longer be of any avail to thy consolation and support to the tract on this subject to which i have thus venture to crave thy particular attention i have add some which at different time i have believe it my duty to publish -lrb- a -rrb- and which i trust will afford thee some satisfaction they design be for the furtherance of that universal peace and good-will amongst man which the gospel be intend to introduce -lrb- footnote a : these related to the principle of the religious society of the quaker -rrb- i hope thou wilt kindly excuse the freedom use on this occasion by a ancient man whose mind for more than forty year past have be much separate from the common intercourse of the world and long painfully exercise in the consideration of the misery under which so large a part of mankind equally with we the object of redeeming love be suffer the most unjust and grievous oppression and who sincerely desire thy temporal and eternal felicity and that of thy royal consort anthony benezet anthony benezet besides the care he bestow upon forwarding the cause of the oppressed african in different part of the world find time to promote the comfort and improve the condition of those in the state in which he live apprehend that much advantage would arise both to they and the public from instruct they in common learning he zealously promote the establishment of a school for that purpose much of the two last year of he life he devote to a personal attendance on this school be earnestly desirous that they who come to it might be better qualify for the enjoyment of that freedom to which great number of they have be then restore to this he sacrifice the superior emolument of he former school and he bodily ease also although the weakness of he constitution seem to demand indulgence by he last will he direct that after the decease of he widow he whole little fortune -lrb- the savings of the industry of fifty year -rrb- should except a few very small legacy be apply to the support of it during he attendance upon it he have the happiness to find -lrb- and he situation enable he to make the comparison -rrb- that providence have be equally liberal to the african in genius and talent as to other people after a few day ' illness this excellent man die at philadelphium in the spring of 1784 the interment of he remains be attend by several thousand of all rank profession and party who unite in deplore they loss the mournful procession be close by some hundred of those poor african who have be personally benefit by he labor and whose behavior on the occasion show the gratitude and affection they consider to be due to he as they own private benefactor as well as the benefactor of they whole race such then be the labor of the quaker in america of individual from 1718 to 1784 and of the body at large from 1696 to 1787 in this great cause of humanity and religion nor be the effect produce from these otherwise than correspond with what might have be expect from such a union of exertion in such a cause for both the evil that be the evil of buying and selling and the evil of use slave cease at length with the member of this benevolent society the leave off all concern with the slave trade take place first the abolition of slavery though it follow be not so speedily accomplish for besides the loss of property when slave be manumit without any pecuniary consideration in return they owner have to struggle in make they free against the law and custom of the time in pennsylvanium where the law in this respect be the most favourable the party wish to give freedom to a slave be oblige to enter into a bond for the payment of thirty pound currency in case the say slave should become chargeable for maintenance in new jersey the term be far less favorable as the estate of the owner remain liable to the consequence of misconduct in the slave or even in he posterity in the southern part of america manumission be not permit but on term amount nearly to a prohibition but notwithstanding these difficulty the quaker could not be deter as they become convinced of the unlawfulness of hold man in bondage from do that which they believe to be right many liberate they slave whatever the consequence be and some give the most splendid example in do it not only by consent as other do thus to give up they property and to incur the penalty of manumission but by calculate and give what be due to they over and above they food and clothing for wages -lrb- a -rrb- from the beginning of they slavery to the day when they liberation commence thus manumission go on some sacrifice more and other less some grant it sooner and other later till in the year 1787 -lrb- b -rrb- there be not a slave in the possession of a acknowledged quaker -lrb- footnote a : one of the brightest instance be that afford by warner mifflin he give unconditional liberty to he slave he pay all the adult on they discharge the sum which arbitrator mutually choose award they -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : previously to the year 1787 several of the state have make the term of manumission more easy -rrb- have give to the reader the history of the third class of forerunner and coadjutor as it consist of the quaker in america i be now to continue it as it consist of a union of these with other on the same continent in the year 1774 in behalf of the african race to do this i shall begin with the cause which lead to the production of this great event and in the first place as example be more powerful than precept we can not suppose that the quaker could have show these noble instance of religious principle without suppose also that individual of other religious denomination would be morally instruct by they they who live in the neighborhood where they take place must have become acquaint with the motive which lead to they some of they must at least have praise the action though they might not themselves have be ripe to follow the example : nor be it at all improbable that these might be lead in the course of the workings of they own mind to a comparison between they own conduct and that of the quaker on this subject in which they themselves might appear to be less worthy in they own eye and as there be sometimes a spirit of rivalship among the individual of religious sect where the character of one be sound forth as higher than that of another this if excite by such a circumstance would probably operate for good it must have be manifest also to many after a lapse of time that there be no danger in what the quaker have do and that there be even sound policy in the measure but whatever be the several cause certain it be that the example of the quaker in leave off all concern with the slave trade and in liberating they slave -lrb- scatter as they be over various part of america -rrb- contribute to produce in many of a different religious denomination from themselves a more tender disposition than have be usual towards the african race but a similar disposition towards these oppressed people be create in other by means of other circumstance or cause in the early part of the eighteenth century judge sewell of new england come forward as a zealous advocate for they : he address a memorial to the legislature which he call _ the selling of joseph _ and in which he plead they cause both as a lawyer and a christian this memorial produce a effect upon many but particularly upon those of he own persuasion and from this time the presbyterian appear to have encourage a sympathy in they favor in the year 1739 the celebrated george whitfield become a instrument in turn the attention of many other to they hard case and of beget in these a fellow sympathy towards they this laborious minister have be deeply affect with what he have see in the course of he religious travels in america think it he duty to address a letter from georgium to the inhabitant of maryland virginium and north and south carolina this letter be print in the year above mention and be in part as follow : -- as i lately pass through you province in my way hither i be sensibly touch with a fellow-feeling for the misery of the poor negro whether it be lawful for christian to buy slave and thereby encourage the nation from whom they be buy to be at perpetual war with each other i shall not take upon I to determine sure i be it be sinful when they have buy they to use they as bad as though they be brute nay worse and whatever particular exception there may be -lrb- as i would charitably hope there be some -rrb- i fear the generality of you who own negro be liable to such a charge for you slave i believe work as hard if not harder than the horse whereon you ride these after they have do they work be feed and take proper care of but many negro when wearied with labor in you plantation have be oblige to grind they corn after they return home : you dog be caress and fondle at you table but you slave who be frequently style dog or beast have not a equal privilege they be scarce permit to pick up the crumb which fall from they master 's table : not to mention what number have be give up to the inhuman usage of cruel taskmaster who by they unrelenting scourge have plough they back and make long furrow and at length bring they even unto death when pass along i have view you plantation clear and cultivate many spacious house build and the owner of they fare sumptuously every day my blood have frequently almost run cold within I to consider how many of you slave have neither convenient food to eat nor proper raiment to put on notwithstanding most of the comfort you enjoy be solely owe to they indefatigable labor the letter from which this be a extract produce a desirable effect upon many of those who peruse it but particularly upon such as begin to be seriously disposed in these time and as george whitfield continue a firm friend to the poor african never lose a opportunity of serve they he interested in the course of he useful life many thousand of he follower in they favor to this account it may be add that from the year 1762 minister who be in the connection of john wesley begin to be settle in america and that as these be friend to the oppressed african also so they contribute in they turn -lrb- a -rrb- to promote a softness of feeling towards they among those of they own persuasion -lrb- footnote a : it must not be forget that the example of the moravian have its influence also in direct man to they duty towards these oppressed people for though when they visit this part of the world for they conversion they never meddle with the political state of thing by recommend it to master to alter the condition of they slave as believe religion could give comfort in the most abject situation in life yet they uniformly free those slave who come into they own possession -rrb- in consequence then of these and other cause a considerable number of person of various religious denomination have appear at different time in america besides the quaker who though they have not distinguish themselves by resolution and manumission as religious body be yet highly friendly to the african cause this friendly disposition begin to manifest itself about the year 1770 for when a few quaker as individual begin at that time to form little association in the middle province of north america to discourage the introduction of slave among people in they own neighborhood who be not of they own society and to encourage the manumission of those already in bondage they be join as colleague by several person of this description -lrb- a -rrb- who co-operate with they in the promotion of they design -lrb- footnote a : it then appear that individual among those of the church of england roman catholic presbyterian methodist and other have begin in a few instance to liberate they slave -rrb- this disposition however become more manifest in the year 1772 for the house of burgess of virginium present a petition to the king beseech he majesty to remove all those restraint on he governor of that colony which inhibit they assent to such law as might check that inhuman and impolitic commerce the slave trade : and it be remarkable that the refusal of the british government to permit the virginian to exclude slave from among they by law be enumerate afterwards among the public reason for separate from the mother country but this friendly disposition be greatly increase in the year 1773 by the literary labor of dr benjamin rush of philadelphium -lrb- b -rrb- who i believe be a member of the presbyterian church : for in this year at the instigation of anthony benezet he take up the cause of the oppressed african in a little work which he entitle _ a address to the inhabitant of the british settlement on the slavery of the negro _ and soon afterwards in another which be a vindication of the first in answer to a acrimonious attach by a west indian planter these publication contain many new observation they be write in a polished style and while they exhibit the erudition and talent they show the liberality and benevolence of the author have have a considerable circulation they spread conviction among many and promote the cause for which they have be so laudably undertake of the great increase of friendly disposition towards the african cause in this very year we have this remarkable proof : that when the quaker live in east and west jersey wish to petition the legislature to obtain a act of assembly for the more equitable manumission of slave in that province so many other of different persuasion join they that the petition be sign by upward of three thousand person -lrb- footnote b : dr rush have be better know since for he other literary work such as he _ medical dissertation _ he _ treatise on the discipline of school _ _ criminal law _ & c -rrb- but in the next year or in the year 1774 -lrb- a -rrb- the increase good-will towards the african become so apparent but more particularly in pennsylvanium where the quaker be more numerous than in any other state that they who consider themselves more immediately as the friend of these injured people think it right to avail themselves of it : and accordingly jame pemberton one of the most conspicuous of the quaker in pennsylvanium and dr rush one of the most conspicuous of those belong to the various other religious community in that province undertake in conjunction with other the important task of bring those into a society who be friendly to this cause in this undertaking they succeed and hence arise that union of the quaker with other to which i have be direct the attention of the reader and by which the third class of forerunner and coadjutor become now complete this society which be confine to pennsylvanium be the first ever form in america in which there be a union of person of different religious denomination in behalf of the african race -lrb- footnote a : in this year elhanan winchester a supporter of the doctrine of universal redemption turn the attention of many of he hearer to this subject both by private interference and by preach expressly upon it -rrb- but this society have scarcely begin to act when the war break out between england and america which have the effect of check its operation this be consider as a severe blow upon it but as those thing which appear most to we disadvantage turn out often the most to we benefit so the war by give birth to the independence of america be ultimately favourable to its progress for as this contrast have produce during its continuance so it leave when it be over a general enthusiasm for liberty many talk of little else but of the freedom they have gain these be naturally lead to the consideration of those among they who be groan in bondage they begin to feel for they hard case they begin to think that they should not deserve the new blessing which they have acquire if they deny it to other thus the discussion which originate in this contest become the occasion of turn the attention of many who might not otherwise have think of it towards the miserable condition of the slave nor be writer want who influence by consideration on the war and the independence result from it make they work subservient to the same benevolent end a work entitle _ a serious address to the ruler of america on the inconsistency of they conduct respect slavery form a contrast between the encroachment of england on american liberty and american injustice in tolerate slavery _ which appear in 1783 be particularly instrumental in produce this effect this excite a more than usual attention to the case of these oppressed people and where most of all it could be useful for the author compare in two opposite column the animated speech and resolution of the member of congress in behalf of they own liberty with they conduct in continue slavery to other hence the legislature begin to feel the inconsistency of the practice and so far have the sense of this inconsistency spread there that when the delegate meet from each state to consider of a federal union there be a desire that the abolition of the slave trade should be one of the article in it this be however oppose by the delegate from north and south carolina virginia maryland and georgium the five state which have the greatest concern in slave but even these offer to agree to the article provide a condition be annex to it -lrb- which be afterwards do -rrb- that the power of such abolition should not commence in the legislature till the 1st of January 1808 in consequence then of these different circumstance the society of pennsylvanium the object of which be for promote the abolition of slavery and the relief of free negro unlawfully hold in bondage become so popular that in the year 1787 it be think desirable to enlarge it accordingly several new member be admit into it the celebrated dr franklin who have long warmly espouse the cause of the injured african be appoint president jame pemberton and jonathan penrose be appoint vice-president dr benjamin rush and tench coxe secretary jame star treasurer william lewis john d coxe mier fisher and william rawle counsellor thoma harrison nathan boy jame whiteall jame reed john todd thoma armatt norri jone samuel richards franci bayley andrew carson john warner and jacob shoemaker junior a elect committee and thoma shield thoma parker john oldden william zane john warner and william mcelhenny a act committee for carry on the purpose of the institution i shall now only observe further upon this subject that as a society consist of a union of the quaker with other of other religious denomination be establish for pennsylvanium in behalf of the oppressed african so different society consist each of a similar union of person be establish in new york connecticut new jersey delaware maryland and other state for the same object and that these afterwards hold a correspondence and personal communion with each other for the promotion of it chapter vi observation on the three class already introduce -- coincidence of extraordinary circumstance -- individual in each of these class who seem to have have a education as it be to qualify they for promote the cause of the abolition sharp and ramsay in the first dillwyn in the second pemberton and rush in the third -- these with they respective class act on motive of they own and independently of each other and yet from circumstance neither foresee nor know by they they be in the way of be easily unite in 1787 -- william dillwyn the great medium of connexion between they all if the reader will refer to he recollection he will find that i have give the history of three of the class of the forerunner and coadjutor in the great cause of the abolition of the slave trade up to the time propose he will of course expect that i should proceed with the history of the fourth but as i foresee that by make certain observation upon the class already introduce in the present rather than in any future place i shall be able to give he clearer view on the subject i shall postpone the history of the remain class to the next chapter the account which i shall now give will exhibit a concurrence of extraordinary and important circumstance it will show first that in each of the three class now introduce there be individual in the year 1787 who have be educate as it be for the purpose of become peculiarly qualify to act together for the promotion of the abolition of the slave trade it will show secondly that these with they respective class act upon they own principle distinctly and independently of each other and lastly that by means of circumstance which they themselves have neither foresee nor contrived a junction between they be render easily practicable and that it be begin to take place at the period assign the first class of forerunner and coadjutor consist principally as it have appear of person in england of various description these i may observe have no communication with each other as to any plan for the abolition of the slave trade there be two individual however among they who be more conspicuous than the rest namely granville sharp the first labourer and mr ramsay the first controversial writer in the cause that granville sharp receive a education as if to become qualify to unite with other in the year 1787 for this important object must have appear from the history of he labor as detail in several of the precede page the same may be say of mr ramsay for it have already appear that he live in the island of st christopher where he make he observation and study the law relative to the treatment of slave for nineteen year that granville sharp act on grounds distinct from those in any of the other class be certain for he know nothing at this time either of the quaker in england or of those in america any more than that they exist by name have it not be for the case of jonathan strong he might never have attach himself to the cause a similar account may be give of mr ramsay for if it have not be for what he have see in the island of st christopher he have never embark in it it be from scene which he have witness there that he begin to feel on the subject these feeling he communicate to other on he return to england and these urge he into action with respect to the second class the reader will recollect that it consist of the quaker in england : first of george fox then of the quaker as a body then of individual belong to that body who form themselves into a committee independently of it for the promotion of the object in question this committee it may he remember consist of six person of whom one be william dillwyn that william dillwyn become fit for the station which he be afterwards to take will be see shortly he be bear in america and be a pupil of the venerable benezet who take pain very early to interest he feeling on this great subject benezet employ he occasionally i mean in a friendly manner as he amanuensis to copy he manuscript for publication as well as several of he letter write in behalf of the cause this give he scholar a insight into the subject who live besides in the land where both the slave trade and slavery be establish obtain a additional knowledge of they so as to be able to refute many of those objection to which other for want of local observation could never have reply in the year 1772 anthony benezet introduce william dillwyn by letter to several of the principal people of carolina with whom he have himself correspond on the suffering of the poor african and desire he to have interview with they on the subject he charge he also to be very particular in make observation as to what he should see there this journey be of great use to the latter in fix he as the friend of these oppressed people for he see so much of they cruel treatment in the course of it that he feel a anxiety ever afterwards amount to a duty to do every thing in he power for they relief in the year 1773 william dillwyn in conjunction with richard smith and daniel well two of he own society write a pamphlet in answer to argument then prevail that the manumission of slave would be injurious this pamphlet -- which be entitle _ brief consideration on slavery and the expediency of its abolition with some hint on the means whereby it may be gradually effect _ -- prove that in lieu of the usual security require certain sum pay at the several period of manumission would amply secure the public as well as the owner of the slave from any future burden in the same year also when the society join by several hundred of other in new jersey present a petition to the legislature -lrb- as mention in the former chapter -rrb- to obtain a act of assembly for the more equitable manumission of slave in that province william dillwyn be one of a deputation which be hear at the bar of the assembly for that purpose in 1774 he come to england but he attention be still keep alive to the subject for he be the person by whom anthony benezet send he letter to the countess of huntingdon as before related he be also the person to whom the same venerable defender of the african race send he letter before speak of to be forward to the queen that william dillwyn and those of he own class in england act upon motive very distinct from those of the former class may be say with truth for they act upon the constitutional principle of they own society as incorporate into its discipline : which principle would always have incite they to the subversion of slavery as far as they themselves be concerned whether any other person have abolish it or not to which it may be add as a further proof of the originality of they motive that the quaker have have ever since they institution as a religious body but little intercourse with the world the third class to which i now come consist as we have see first of the quaker in america and secondly of a union of these with other on the same continent the principal individual concern in this union be jame pemberton and dr rush the former of these have take a active part in several of the yearly meeting of he own society relative to the oppressed african and have be in habit of intimacy and friendship with john woolman and anthony benezet with the result of whose labor he be acquaint may be suppose to have become qualify to take a lead station in the promotion of they cause dr rush also have show himself as have appear a able advocate and have even sustain a controversy in they favor that the two last mention act also on motive of they own or independently of those belong to the other two class when they form they association in pennsylvanium will be obvious from these circumstance first that most of those of the first class who contribute to throw the greatest light and odium upon the slave trade have not then make they public appearance in the world and with respect to the second class the little committee belong to it have neither be form nor think of and as the individual in each of the three class who have now be mention have a education as it be to qualify they for act together in this great cause and have move independently of each other so it will appear that by means of circumstance which they themselves have neither foresee nor contrived a junction between they be render easily practicable and that it be begin to take place at the period assign to show this i must first remind the reader that anthony benezet as soon as he hear of the result of the case of somerset open a correspondence with granville sharp which be keep up to the encouragement of both in the year 1774 when he learn that william dillwyn be go to england he give he letter to that gentleman thus one of the most conspicuous of the second class be introduce accidentally as it be to one of the most conspicuous of the first in the year 1775 william dillwyn go back to america but on he return to england to settle he renew he visit to granville sharp thus the connexion be continue to these observation i may now add that samuel hoare of the same class as william dillwyn have in consequence of the bishop of chester 's sermon begin a correspondence in 1784 as before mention with mr ramsay who be of the same class as mr sharp thus four individual of the two first class be in the way of a union with one another but circumstance equally natural contribute to render a union between the member of the second and the third class easily practicable also for what be more natural than that william dillwyn who be bear and who have reside long in america should have connexion there he have long cultivate a friendship -lrb- not then know to what it would lead -rrb- with jame pemberton he intimacy with he be like that of a family connexion they correspond together they correspond also as kindred heart relative to the slave trade thus two member of the second and third class have open a intercourse on the subject and thus be william dillwyn the great medium through whom the member of the two class now mention as well as the member of all the three might be easily unite also if a fit occasion should offer chapter vii fourth class of forerunner and coadjutor up to 1787 -- dr peckard vice-chancellor of the university of cambridge the first of these give out the slave trade as the subject for one of the annual prize -- author write and obtain the first of these read he dissertation in the senate-house in the summer of 1785 he feeling on the subject during he return home be desirous of aid the cause of the african but see great difficulty determine to publish he prize essay for this purpose be accidentally throw into the way of jame phillip who introduce he to w dillwyn the connect medium of the three class before mention and to g sharp and mr ramsay and to r phillip i proceed now to the fourth class of forerunner and coadjutor up to the year 1787 in the great cause of the abolition of the slave trade the first of these be dr peckard this gentleman have distinguish himself in the earlier part of he life by certain publication on the intermediate state of the soul and by other in favor of civil and religious liberty to the latter cause he be a warm friend seldom omit any opportunity of declare he sentiment in its favor in the course of he preferment he be appoint by sir john griffin afterwards lord howard of walden to the mastership of magdalen college in the university of cambridge in this high office he consider it to be he duty to support those doctrine which he have espouse when in a inferior station and accordingly when in the year 1784 it devolve upon he to preach a sermon before the university of cambridge he choose he favorite subject : in the handling of which he take a opportunity of speaking of the slave trade in the follow nervous manner : -- now whether we consider the crime with respect to the individual concern in this most barbarous and cruel traffic or whether we consider it as patronize and encourage by the law of the land it present to we view a equal degree of enormity a crime found on a dreadful pre-eminence in wickedness -- a crime which be both of individual and the nation must sometime draw down upon we the heaviest judgment of almighty god who make of one blood all the son of man and who give to all equally a natural right to liberty and who rule all the kingdom of the earth with equal providential justice can not suffer such deliberate such monstrous iniquity to pass long unpunished but dr peckard do not consider this delivery of he testimony though it be give before a learn and religious body as a sufficient discharge of he duty while any opportunity remain of renew it with effect and as such a one offer in the year 1785 when he be vice-chancellor of the university he embrace it in consequence of he office it devolve upon he to give out two subject for latin dissertation one to the middle bachelor and the other to the senior bachelor of art they who produce the best be to obtain the prize to the latter he propose the following : _ anne liceat invito in servitutem dare _ or _ be it right to make slave of other against they will _ this circumstance of give out subject for the prize though only a ordinary measure become the occasion of my own labor or of the real honor which i feel in be able to consider myself as the next coadjutor of this class in the cause of the injured african for it happen in this year that be of the order of senior bachelor i become qualify to write i have gain a prize for the best latin dissertation in the former year and therefore it be expect that i should obtain one in the present or i should be consider as have lose my reputation both in the eye of the university and of my own college it have happen also that i have be honor with the first of the prize -lrb- a -rrb- in that year and therefore it be expect again that i should obtain the first on this occasion the acquisition of the second however honorable would have be consider as a fall off or as a loss of former fame i feel myself therefore particularly call upon to maintain my post and with feeling of this kind i begin to prepare myself for the question -lrb- footnote a : there be two prize on each subject one for the best and the other for the second-best essay -rrb- in study the thesis i conceive it to point directly to the african slave trade and more particularly as i know that dr peckard in the sermon which i have mention have pronounce so warmly against it at any rate i determine to give it this construction but alas i be wholly ignorant of this subject and what be unfortunate a few week only be allow for the composition i be determine however to make the best use of my time i get access to the manuscript papers of a deceased friend who have be in the trade i be acquaint also with several officer who have be in the west indy and from these i gain something but i still feel myself at a loss for material and i do not know where to get they when go by accident into a friend 's house i take up a newspaper then lie on he table one of the article which attract my notice be a advertisement of anthony benezet 's _ historical account of guinea _ i soon leave my friend and he paper and to lose no time hasten to london to buy it in this precious book i find almost all i want i obtain by means of it a knowledge of and access to the great authority of adanson moore barbot smith bosman and other it be of great consequence to know what these person have say upon this subject for have be themselves either long resident in africa or very frequently there they knowledge of it could not be question have be concern also in the trade it be not likely that they would criminate themselves more than they could avoid write too at a time when the abolition be not even think of they could not have be biass with any view to that event and lastly have be dead many year they could not have be influence as live evidence may be suppose to have be either to conceal or exaggerate as they own interest might lead they either by be concern in the continuance of the trade or by support the opinion of those of they patron in power who be on the different side of this question furnished then in this manner i begin my work but no person can tell the severe trial which the writing of it prove to I i have expect pleasure from the invention of the argument from the arrangement of they from the put of they together and from the think in the interim that i be engage in a innocent contest for literary honor but all my pleasure be damp by the fact which be now continually before I it be but one gloomy subject from morning to night in the day-time i be uneasy in the night i have little rest i sometimes never close my eye-lid for grief it become now not so much a trial for academical reputation as for the production of a work which might be useful to injured africa and keep this idea in my mind ever after the perusal of benezet i always sleep with a candle in my room that i might rise out of my bed and put down such thought as might occur to I in the night if i judge they valuable conceive that no argument of any moment should be lose in so great a cause have at length finish this painful task i send my essay to the vice-chancellor and soon afterwards find myself honor as before with the first prize as it be usual to read these essay publicly in the senate-house soon after the prize be adjudge i be call to cambridge for this purpose i go and perform my office on return however to london the subject of it almost wholly engrossed my thought i become at time very seriously affect while upon the road i stop my horse occasionally and dismount and walk i frequently try to persuade myself in these interval that the contents of my essay could not be true the more however i reflect upon they or rather upon the authority on which they be found the more i give they credit come in sight of wade mill in hertfordshire i sit down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and hold my horse here a thought come into my mind that if the contents of the essay be true it be time some person should see these calamity to they end agitate in this manner i reach home this be in the summer of 1785 in the course of the autumn of the same year i experience similar impression i walk frequently into the wood that i might think on the subject in solitude and find relief to my mind there but there the question still recur be these thing true still the answer follow as instantaneously they be still the result accompany it then surely some person should interfere i then begin to envy those who have seat in parliament and who have great riches and widely extended connexion which would enable they to take up this cause finding scarcely any one at that time who think of it i be turn frequently to myself but here many difficulty arise it strike I among other that a young man of only twenty-four year of age could not have that solid judgment or knowledge of man manners and thing which be requisite to qualify he to undertake a task of such magnitude and importance -- and with whom be i to unite i believe also that it look so much like one of the feigned labor of hercule that my understanding would be suspect if i propose it on ruminate however on the subject i find one thing at least practicable and that this also be in my power i could translate my latin dissertation i could enlarge it usefully i could see how the public receive it or how far they be likely to favor any serious measure which should have a tendency to produce the abolition of the slave trade upon this then i determine and in the middle of the month of November 1785 i begin my work by the middle of January i have finish half of it though i have make considerable addition i now think of engage with some bookseller to print it when finish for this purpose i call upon mr cadell in the strand and consult he about it he say that as the original essay have be honor by the university of cambridge with the first prize this circumstance would insure it a respectable circulation among person of taste i own i be not much pleased with he opinion i wish the essay to find its way among useful people and among such as would act and think with I accordingly i leave mr cadell after have thank he for he civility and determine as i think i have time sufficient before dinner to call upon a friend in the city in go past the royal exchange mr joseph hancock one of the religious society of the quaker and with whose family my own have be long unite in friendship suddenly meet I he first accost I by say that i be the person whom he be wish to see he then ask I why i have not publish my prize essay i ask he in return what have make he think of that subject in particular he reply that he own society have long take it up as a religious body and individual among they be wish to find I out i ask he who he answer jame phillip a bookseller in georgeyard lombard-street and william dillwyn of walthamstow and other have but little time to spare i desire he to introduce I to one of they in a few minute he take I to jame phillip who be then the only one of they in town by whose conversation i be so much interested and encourage that without any further hesitation i offer he the publication of my work this accidental introduction of I to jame phillip be i find afterwards a most happy circumstance for the promotion of the cause which i have then so deeply at heart as it lead I to the knowledge of several of those who become afterwards material coadjutor in it it be also of great importance to I with respect to the work itself : for he possess a acute penetration a solid judgment and a literary knowledge which he prove by the many alteration and addition he propose and which i believe i uniformly adopt after mature consideration from a sense of they real value it be advantageous to I also inasmuch as it lead I to he friendship which be never interrupted but by he death on my second visit to jame phillip at which time i bring he about half my manuscript for the press i desire he to introduce I to william dillwyn as he also have mention he to I on my first visit and as i have not see mr hancock since matter be accordingly arrange and a day appoint before i leave he on this day i have my first interview with my new friend two or three other of he own religious society be present but who they be i do not now recollect there seem to be a great desire among they to know the motive by which i have be actuate in contend for the prize i tell they frankly that i have no motive but that which other young man in the university have on such occasion namely the wish of be distinguish or of obtain literary honor but that i have feel so deeply on the subject of it that i have lately interested myself in it from a motive of duty my conduct seem to be highly approve by those present and much conversation ensue but it be of a general nature as william dillwyn wish very much to see I at he house at walthamstow i appoint the 13th of march to spend the day with they there we talk for the most part during my stay on the subject of my essay i soon discover the treasure i have meet with in he local knowledge both of the slave trade and of slavery as they exist in the united state and i gain from he several fact which with he permission i afterwards insert in my work but how surprised be i to hear in the course of we conversation of the labor of granville sharp of the writings of ramsay and of the controversy in which the latter be engage of all which i have hitherto know nothing how surprised be i to learn that william dillwyn himself have two year before associate himself with five other for the purpose of enlighten the public mind upon this great subject how astonished be i to find that a society have be form in america for the same object with some of the principal member of which he be intimately acquaint and how still more astonished at the inference which instantly rush upon my mind that he be capable of be make the great medium of connexion between they all these thought almost overpower I i believe that after this i talk but little more to my friend my mind be overwhelm with the thought that i have be providentially direct to he house that the finger of providence be begin to be discernible that the day-star of african liberty be rise and that probably i might be permit to become a humble instrument in promote it in the course of attend to my work as now in the press jame phillip introduce I also to granville sharp with whom i have afterwards many interesting interview from time to time and whom i discover to be a distant relation by my father 's side he introduce I also by letter to a correspondence with mr ramsay who in a short time afterwards come to london to see I he introduce I also to he cousin richard phillip of lincoln 's inn who be at that time on the point of join the religious society of quaker in he i find much sympathy and a willingness to co-operate with I when dull and disconsolate he encourage I when in spirit he stimulate I further he i be now to mention as a new but soon afterwards as a active and indefatigable coadjutor in the cause but i shall say more concern he in a future chapter i shall only now add that my work be at length print that it be entitle _ a essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species particularly the african translate from a latin dissertation which be honor with the first prize in the university of cambridge for the year 1785 with addition _ and that it be usher into the world in the month of June 1786 or in about a year after it have be read in the senate-house in its first form chapter viii continuation of the fourth class of forerunner and coadjutor up to 1787 bennet langton dr baker lord and lady scarsdale -- author visit ramsay at teston -- lady middleton and sir charle -lrb- afterward lord barham -rrb- -- author declare himself at the house of the latter ready now to devote himself to the cause reconsider this declaration or pledge he reasoning and struggle upon it persist in it return to london and pursue the work as now a business of he life i have purpose as i say before when i determine to publish my essay to wait to see how the world would receive it or what disposition there would be in the public to favor my measure for the abolition of the slave trade but the conversation which i have hold on the 13th of march with william dillwyn continue to make such a impression upon I that i think now there could be no occasion for wait for such a purpose it seem now only necessary to go forward other i find have already begin the work i have be throw suddenly among these as into a new world of friend i believe also that a way be open under providence for support and i now think that nothing remain for I but to procure as many coadjutor as i could i have long have the honor of the friendship of mr bennet langton and i determine to carry he one of my book and to interest he feeling in it with a view of procure he assistance in the cause mr langton be a gentleman of a ancient family and respectable fortune in lincolnshire but reside then in queen square westminster he be know as the friend of dr johnson jona hanway edmund burke sir joshua reynold and other among he acquaintance indeed be most of the literary and eminent professional and public-spirited man of the time at court also he be well know and have the esteem of he majesty -lrb- george iii -rrb- with whom he frequently converse he friend be numerous also in both house of the legislature as to himself he be much note for he learning but most of all for the great example he give with respect to the usefulness and integrity of he life by introduce my work to the sanction of a friend of such high character and extensive connexion i think i should be do great thing and so the event prove for when i go to he after he have read it i find that it have make a deep impression upon he mind as a friend to humanity he lament over the misery of the oppressed african and over the crime of they tyrant as a friend to morality and religion he caution I however against be too sanguine in my expectation as so many thousand be interested in continue the trade justice however which he say weigh with he beyond all private or political interest demand a public inquiry and he would assist I to the utmost of he power in my attempt towards it from this time he become a zealous and active coadjutor in the cause and continue so to the end of he valuable life the next person to whom i give my work with a like view be dr baker a clergyman of the establishment and with whom i have be in habit of intimacy for some time dr baker be a learn and pious man he have perform the duty of he profession from the time of he initiation into the church in a exemplary manner not only by pay a proper attention to the customary service but by the frequent visitation of the sick and the instruction of the poor this he have do too to admiration in a particularly extensive parish at the time i know he he have may-fair chapel of which a unusual portion of the congregation consist then of person of rank and fortune with most of these he have a personal acquaintance this be of great importance to I in the promotion of my view have leave he my book for a month i call upon he the result be that which i expect from so good a man he do not wait for I to ask he for he co-operation but he offer he service in any way which i might think most eligible feeling it he duty as he express it to become a instrument in expose such a complication of guilt and misery to the world dr baker become from this time a active coadjutor also and continue so to he death the person to whom i send my work next be the late lord scarsdale whose family i have know for about two year both he and he lady read it with attention they inform I after the perusal of it that both of they be desirous of assist I in promote the cause of the poor african lady scarsdale lament that she might possibly offend near and dear connexion who have interest in the west indy by so do but that conscious of no intention to offend these and consider the duty of religion to be the first to be attend to she should be please to become useful in so good a cause lord scarsdale also assure I that if the subject should ever come before the house of lord it should have he constant support while attempt to make friend in this manner i receive a letter from mr ramsay with a invitation to spend a month at he house at teston near maidstone in kent this i accept that i might communicate to he the progress i have make that i might gain more knowledge from he on the subject and that i might acquire new strength and encouragement to proceed on hearing my account of my proceedings which i detail to he on the first evening of we meeting he seem almost overpower with joy he say he have be long of opinion that the release of the african from the scourge of this cruel trade be within the determine view of providence and that by turn the public attention to they misery we should be the instrument of begin the good work he then inform I how long he himself have have they cause at heart that communicate he feeling to sir charle middleton -lrb- afterwards lord barham -rrb- and he lady the latter have urge he to undertake a work in they behalf that she importunity be great respect it and that he have on this account and in obedience also to he own feeling as have be before mention begin it but that foresee the censure and abuse which such a subject treat in any possible manner must bring upon the author he have lay it aside for some time he have however resume it at the solicitation of dr porteus then bishop of chester after which in the year 1784 it make its appearance in the world i be delighted with this account on the first evening of my arrival but more particularly as i collect from it that i might expect in the bishop of chester and sir charle middleton two new friend to the cause this expectation be afterwards fully realize as the reader will see in its proper place but i be still more delighted when i be inform that sir charle and lady middleton with mr bouverie live at teston hall in a park which be but a few yard from the house in which i then be in the morning i desire a introduction to they which accordingly take place and i find myself much encouraged and support by this visit it be not necessary nor indeed be there room to detail my employment in this village or the lonely walk i take there or the meditation of my mind at such season i will therefore come at once to a particular occurrence when at dinner one day with the family at teston hall i be much pleased with the turn which the conversation have take on the subject and in the joy of my heart i exclaimed that i be ready to devote myself to the cause this bring great commendation from those present and sir charle middleton add that if i want any information in the course of my future inquiry relative to africa which he could procure I as comptroller of the navy such as extract from the journal of the ship of war to that continent or from other papers i should have free access to he office this offer i receive with thankfulness and it operate as a new encouragement to I to proceed the next morning when i awake one of the first thing that strike I be that i have give a pledge to the company the day before that i would devote myself to the cause of the oppressed african i become a little uneasy at this i question whether i have consider matter sufficiently to be able to go so far with propriety i determine therefore to give the subject a full consideration and accordingly i walk to the place of my usual meditation -- the wood have now reach a place of solitude i begin to balance everything on both side of the question i consider first that i have not yet obtain information sufficient on the subject to qualify I for the undertaking of such a work but i reflect on the other hand that sir charle middleton have just open to I a new source of knowledge that i should be back by the local information of dillwyn and ramsay and that surely by take pain i could acquire more i then consider that i have not yet a sufficient number of friend to support I this occasion I to review they i have now sir charle middleton who be in the house of common i be sure of dr porteus who be in the house of lord i could count upon lord scarsdale who be a peer also i have secure mr langton who have a most extensive acquaintance with member of both house of the legislature i have also secure dr baker who have similar connexion i could depend upon granville sharp jame phillips richard phillip ramsay dillwyn and the little committee to which he belong as well as the whole society of the quaker i think therefore upon the whole that consider the short time i have be at work i be well off with respect to support i believe also that there be still several of my own acquaintance whom i could interest in the question and i do not doubt that by exert myself diligently person who be then stranger to I would be raise up in time i consider next that it be impossible for a great cause like this to be forward without large pecuniary fund i question whether some thousand pound would not be necessary and from whence be such a sum to come in answer to this i persuade myself that generous people would be find who would unite with I in contribute they mite towards the undertaking and i seem confident that as the quaker have take up the cause as a religious body they would not be behind-hand in support it i consider lastly that if i take up the question i must devote myself wholly to it i be sensible that a little labor now and then would be inadequate to the purpose or that where the interest of so many thousand person be likely to be affect constant exertion would be necessary i feel certain that if ever the matter be to be take up there could be no hope of success except it should be take up by some one who would make it a object or business of he life i think too that a man 's life might not be more than adequate to the accomplishment of the end but i know of no one who could devote such a portion of time to it sir charle middleton though he be so warm and zealous be greatly occupy in the discharge of he office mr langton spend a great portion of he time in the education of he child dr baker have a great deal to do in the performance of he parochial duty the quaker be almost all of they in trade i could look therefore to no person but myself and the question be whether i be prepare to make the sacrifice in favor of the undertaking i urge to myself that never be any cause which have be take up by man in any country or in any age so great and important that never be there one in which so much misery be hear to cry for redress that never be there one in which so much good could be do never one in which the duty of christian charity could be so extensively exercise never one more worthy of the devotion of a whole life towards it and that if a man think properly he ought to rejoice to have be call into existence if he be only permit to become a instrument in forwarding it in any part of its progress against these sentiment on the other hand i have to urge that i have be design for the church that i have already advance as far as deacon 's order in it that my prospects there on account of my connexion be then brilliant that by appear to desert my profession my family would be dissatisfy if not unhappy these thought press upon I and render the conflict difficult but the sacrifice of my prospects stagger I i own the most when the other objection which i have relate occur to I my enthusiasm instantly like a flash of lightning consume they but this stick to I and trouble I i have ambition i have a thirst after worldly interest and honor and i could not extinguish it at once i be more than two hour in solitude under this painful conflict at length i yield not because i see any reasonable prospect of success in my new undertaking -lrb- for all cool-headed and cool-hearted man would have pronounce against it -rrb- but in obedience i believe to a higher power and i can say that both on the moment of this resolution and for some time afterwards i have more sublime and happy feeling than at any former period of my life have now make up my mind on the subject i inform mr ramsay that in a few day i should be leave teston that i might begin my labor accord to the pledge i have give he chapter ix continuation of the fourth class of forerunner and coadjutor up to 1787 -- author resolve upon the distribution of he book -- mr sheldon sir herbert mackworth lord newhaven lord balgonie -lrb- afterwards leven -rrb- lord hawke bishop porteus -- author visit african vessel in the thame and various person for further information -- visit also member of parliament sir richard hill mr powy -lrb- late lord lilford -rrb- mr wilberforce and other conduct of the latter on this occasion on my return to london i call upon william dillwyn to inform he of the resolution i have make at teston and find he at he town lodgings in the poultry i inform he also that i have a letter of introduction in my pocket from sir charle middleton to samuel hoare with whom i be to converse on the subject the latter gentleman have interested himself the year before as one of the committee for the black poor in london whom mr sharp be send under the auspices of government to sierra leone he be also as the reader may see by look back a member of the second class of coadjutor or of the little committee which have branch out of the quaker in england as before describe william dillwyn say he would go with I and introduce I himself on we arrival in lombard-street i see my new friend with whom we converse for some time from thence i proceed accompany by both to the house of jame phillip in george-yard to whom i be desirous of communicate my resolution also we find he at home converse with a friend of the same religious society whose name be joseph gurney bevan i then repeat my resolution before they all we have much friendly and satisfactory conversation together i receive much encouragement on every side and i fix to meet they again at the place where we then be in three day on the evening of the same day i wait upon granville sharp to make the same communication to he he receive it with great pleasure and he hope i should have strength to proceed from thence i go to the baptist-head coffee-house in chancery-lane and have engage with the master of the house that i should always have one private room to myself when i want it i take up my abode there in order to be near my friend richard phillip of lincoln 's inn from whose advice and assistance i have form considerable expectation the first matter for we deliberation after we have thus become neighbor be what plan i ought to pursue to give effect to the resolution i have take after have discuss the matter two or three time at he chamber it seem to be we opinion that as member of the legislature could do more to the purpose in this question than any other person it would be proper to circulate all the remain copy of my work among these in order that they might thus obtain information upon the subject secondly that it would be proper that i should wait personally upon several of these also and thirdly that i should be endeavor in the interim to enlarge my own knowledge that i might thus be enable to answer the various objection which might be advance on the other side of the question as well as become qualify to be a manager of the cause on the third day or at the time appoint i go with richard phillip to george-yard lombard-street where i meet all my friend as before i communicate to they the opinion we have form at lincoln 's inn relative to my future proceedings in the three different branch as now detail they approve the plan on desire a number of my book to be send to I at my new lodgings for the purpose of distribution joseph gurney bevan who be state to have be present at the former interview seem uneasy and at length ask I if i be go to distribute these at my own expense i reply i be he appeal immediately to those present whether it ought to be allow he ask whether when a young man be give up he time from morning till night they who applaud he pursuit and seem desirous of co-operate with he should allow he to make such a sacrifice or whether they should not at least secure he from loss and he propose directly that the remain part of the edition should be take off by subscription and in order that my feeling might not be hurt from any suppose stain arise from the thought of gain any thing by such a proposal they should be pay for only at the prime cost i feel myself much oblige to he for this tender consideration about I and particularly for the latter part of it under which alone i accept the offer samuel hoare be charge with the management of the subscription and the book be to be distribute as i have propose and in any way which i myself might prescribe this matter have be determine upon my first care be that the book should be put into proper hand accordingly i go round among my friend from day to day wish to secure this before i attend to any of the other object in this i be much assist by my friend richard phillip mr langton begin the distribution of they he make a point either of write to or of call upon those to whom he send they dr baker take the charge of several for the same purpose lord and lady scarsdale of other sir charle and lady middleton of other mr sheldon at the request of richard phillip introduce I by letter to several member of parliament to whom i wish to deliver they myself sir herbert mackworth when speak to by the latter offer he service also he seem to be particularly interested in the cause he go about to many of he friend in the house of common and this from day to day to procure they favor towards it lord newhaven be apply to and distribute some lord balgonie take a similar charge the late lord hawke who tell I that he have long feel for the suffering of the injured african desire to be permit to take he share of the distribution among member of the house of lord and dr porteus now bishop of london become another coadjutor in the same work this distribution of my book have be consign to proper hand i begin to qualify myself by obtain further knowledge for the management of this great cause as i have obtain the principal part of it from read i think i ought now to see what could be see and to know from live person what could be know on the subject with respect to the first of these point the river thame present itself as at hand ship be go occasionally from the port of london to africa and why could i not get on board they and examine for myself after diligent inquiry i hear of one which have just arrive i find she to be a little wood-vessel call the lively captain williamson or one which trade to africa in the natural production of the country such as ivory bee ' - wax malaguetta pepper palm-oil and dye-wood i obtain specimen of some of these so that i now become possess of some of those thing of which i have only read before on converse with the mate he show I one or two piece of the cloth make by the native and from they own cotton i prevail upon he to sell I a piece of each here new feeling arise and particularly when i consider that person of so much apparent ingenuity and capable of such beautiful work as the african should be make slave and reduce to a level with the brute creation my reflection here on the better use which might be make of africa by the substitution of another trade and on the better use which might be make of she inhabitant serve greatly to animate and to sustain I amidst the labor of my pursuit the next vessel i boarded be the fly captain colley here i find myself for the first time on the deck of a slave-vessel the sight of the room below and of the grating above and of the barricado across the deck and the explanation of the use of all these fill I both with melancholy and horror i find soon afterwards a fire of indignation kindling within I i have now scarce patience to talk with those on board i have not the coolness this first time to go leisurely over the place that be open to I i get away quickly but that which i think i see horrible in this vessel have the same effect upon I as that which i think i have see agreeable in the other namely to animate and to invigorate I in my pursuit but i will not trouble the reader with any further account of my water-expedition while attempt to perfect my knowledge on this subject i be equally assiduous in obtain intelligence wherever it could be have and be now always on the watch i be frequently fall in with individual from whom i gain something my object be to see all who have be in africa but more particularly those who have never be interested or who at any rate be not then interested in the trade i gain accordingly access very early to general rooke to lieutenant dalrymple of the army to captain fidde of the engineer to the reverend mr newton to mr nisbett a surgeon in the minory to mr devayne who be then in parliament and to many other and i make it a rule to put down in write after every conversation what have take place in the course of it by these means thing begin to unfold themselves to I more and more and i find my stock of knowledge almost daily on the increase while however i be forwarding this i be not inattentive to the other object of my pursuit which be that of wait upon member personally the first i call upon be sir richard hill at the first interview he espouse the cause i wait then upon other and they profess themselves friendly but they seem to make this profession more from the emotion of good heart revolt at the bare mention of the slave trade than from any knowledge concern it one however whom i visit mr powy -lrb- the late lord lilford -rrb- with whom i have be before acquaint in northamptonshire seem to doubt some of the fact in my book from a belief that human nature be not capable of proceed to such a pitch of wickedness i ask he to name he fact he select the case of the hundred and thirty-two slave who be throw alive into the sea to defraud the underwriter i promise to satisfy he fully upon this point and go immediately to granville sharp who lend I he account of the trial as report at large from the note of the short-hand writer whom he have employ on the occasion mr powy read the account he become in consequence of it convinced as indeed he could not otherwise be of the truth of what i have assert and he declare at the same time that if this be true there be nothing so horrible related of this trade which might not immediately be believe mr powy have be always friendly to this question but now he take a part in the distribution of my book among those whom i visit be mr wilberforce on my first interview with he he state frankly that the subject have often employ he thought and that it be near he heart he seem earnest about it and also very desirous of take the trouble of inquire further into it have read my book which i have deliver to he in person he send for I he express a wish that i would make he acquaint with some of my authority for the assertion in it which i do afterwards to he satisfaction he ask I if i could support it by any other evidence i tell he i could i mention mr newton mr nisbett and several other to he he take the trouble of send for all these he make memorandum of they conversation and send for I afterwards show they to I on learn my intention to devote myself to the cause he pay I many handsome compliment he then desire I to call upon he often and to acquaint he with my progress from time to time he express also he willingness to afford I any assistance in he power in the prosecution of my pursuit the carrying on of these different object together with the writing which be connect with they prove very laborious and occupied almost all my time i be seldom engage less than sixteen hour in the day when i leave teston to begin the pursuit as a object of my life i promise my friend mr ramsay a weekly account of my progress at the end of the first week my letter to he contain little more than a sheet of paper at the end of the second it contain three at the end of the third six and at the end of the fourth i find it would be so voluminous that i be oblige to decline write it chapter x continuation of the fourth class of forerunner and coadjutor up to 1787 -- author go on to enlarge he knowledge in the different department of the subject communicate more frequently with mr wilberforce -- meeting now appoint at the house of the latter -- dinner at mr langton 's -- mr wilberforce pledge himself there to take up the subject in parliament remarkable junction in consequence of all the four class of forerunner and coadjutor before-mentioned -- committee form out of these on the 22nd of may 1787 for the abolition of the slave trade the manner in which mr wilberforce have receive I and the pain which he have take and be still take to satisfy himself of the truth of those enormity which have be charge upon the slave trade tend much to enlarge my hope that they might become at length the subject of a parliamentary inquiry richard phillip also to whom i make a report at he chamber almost every evening of the proceedings of the day have begin to entertain a similar expectation of course we unfold we thought to one another from hence a desire naturally spring up in each of we to inquire whether any alteration in consequence of this new prospect should be make in my pursuit on deliberate upon this point it seem proper to both of we that the distribution of the book should be continue that i should still proceed in enlarge my own knowledge and that i should still wait upon member of the legislature but with this difference that i should never lose sight of mr wilberforce but on the other hand that i should rather omit visit some other than pay a proper attention to he one thing however appear now to be necessary which have not yet be do this be to inform we friend in the city upon whom i have all along occasionally call that we believe the time be approach when it would be desirable that we should unite we labor if they see no objection to such a measure for if the slave trade be to become a subject of parliamentary inquiry with a view to the annihilation of it no individual could perform the work which would be necessary for such a purpose this work must be a work of many and who so proper to assist in it as they who have before so honourably labor in it in the case of such a event large fund also would be want and who so proper to procure and manage they as these a meeting be accordingly call at the house of jame phillip when these we view be lay open when i state that from the very time of my hope begin to rise i have always have those present in my eye as one day to be fellow-labourers william dillwyn reply that from the time they have first hear of the _ prize essay _ they also have have they eye upon I and from the time they have first see I have conceive : a desire of make the same use of I as i have now express a wish of making of they but that matter do not appear ripe at we first interview we proposal however be approve and a assurance be give that a union should take place as soon as it be judge to be seasonable it be resolve also that one day in the week -lrb- a -rrb- should be appoint for a meeting at the house of jame phillip where as many might attend as have leisure and that i should be there to make a report of my progress by which we might all judge of the fitness of the time of call ourselves a unite body pleased now with the thought that matter be put into such a train i return to my former object -lrb- footnote a : at these weekly meeting i meet occasionally joseph wood george harrison and john lloyd three of the other member who belong to the committee of the second class of forerunner and coadjutor as before describe i have see all of they before but i do not recollect the time when i first meet they -rrb- it be not necessary to say anything more of the first of these object which be that of the further distribution of my book than that it be continue and chiefly by the same hand with respect to the enlargement of my knowledge it be promote likewise i now gain access to the custom-house in london where i pick up much valuable information for my purpose have have reason to believe that the slave trade be peculiarly fatal to those employ in it i wish much to get copy of many of the muster-roll from the custom-house at liverpool for a give time jame phillips write to he friend william rathbone who be one of he own religious society and who reside there to procure they they be accordingly send up the examination of these which take place at the chamber of richard phillip be long and tedious we look over they together we usually meet for this purpose at nine in the evening and we seldom part till one and sometimes not till three in the morning when we eye be inflamed by the candle or tire by fatigue we use to relieve ourselves by walk out within the precinct of lincoln 's inn when all seem to be fast asleep and thus as it be in solitude and in stillness to converse upon they as well as upon the best means of the further promotion of we cause these scene of we early friendship and exertion i shall never forget i often think of they both with astonishment and with pleasure have recruit ourselves in this manner we use to return to we work from these muster-roll i may now observe that we gain the most important information : we ascertain beyond the power of contradiction that more than half of the seaman who go out with the ship in the slave trade do not return with they and that of these so many perish as amount to one-fifth of all employ as to what become of the remainder the muster-roll do not inform we this therefore be leave to we as a subject for we future inquiry in endeavor to enlarge my knowledge my thought be frequently turn to the west indian part of the question and in this department my friend richard phillip gain I important intelligence he put into my hand several document concern estate in the west indy which he have mostly from the proprietor themselves where the slave by mild and prudent usage have so increase in population as to supersede the necessity of the slave trade by attend to these and to various other part of the subject i begin to see as it be with new eye i be enable to make several necessary discrimination to reconcile thing before seemingly contradictory and to answer many objection which have hitherto put on a formidable shape but most of all be i rejoice at the thought that i should soon be able to prove that which i have never doubt but which have hitherto be beyond my power in this case that providence in ordain law relative to the agency of man have never make that to be wise which be immoral and that the slave trade would be find as impolitic as it be inhuman and unjust in keep up my visit to member of parliament i be particularly attentive to mr wilberforce whom i find daily become more interested in the fate of africa i now make to he a regular report of my progress of the sentiment of those in parliament whom i have visit of the disposition of my friend in the city of whom he have often hear I speak of my discovery from the custom-house of london and liverpool of my document concern west indium estate and of all indeed that have occur to I worth mention he have himself also be make he inquiry which he communicate to I in return we intercourse have now become frequent no one week elapse without a interview : at one of these i suggest to he the propriety of have occasional meeting at he own house consist of a few friend in parliament who might converse on the subject : of this he approve the person present at the first meeting be mr wilberforce the honorable john villier mr powy sir charle middleton sir richard hill mr granville sharp mr ramsay dr gregory -lrb- who have write on the subject as before mention -rrb- and myself at this meeting i read a paper give a account of the light i have collect in the course of my inquiry with observation as well on the impolicy as on the wickedness of the trade many question arise out of the reading of this little essay many answer follow objection be start and canvass in short this measure be find so useful that certain other evening as well as morning be fix upon for the same purpose on report my progress to my friend in the city several of whom now assemble once in the week as i mention before to have be agree upon and particularly on report the different meeting which have take place at the house of mr wilberforce on the subject they be of opinion that the time be approach when we might unite and that this union might prudently commence as soon as ever mr wilberforce would give he word that he would take up the question in parliament upon this i desire to observe that though the latter gentleman have pursue the subject with much earnestness he have never yet drop the least hint that he would proceed so far in the matter but i would take care that the question should be put to he and i would bring they he answer in consequence of the promise i have now make i go to mr wilberforce but when i see he i seem unable to inform he of the object of my visit whether this inability arise from any sudden fear that he answer might not be favourable or from a fear that i might possibly involve he in a long and arduous contest upon this subject or whether it arise from a awful sense of the importance of the mission as it related to the happiness of hundred of thousand then alive and of million then unborn i can not say but i have a feeling within I for which i could not account and which seem to hinder I from proceed and i actually go away without inform he of my errand in this situation i begin to consider what to do when i think i would call upon mr langton tell he what have happen and ask he advice i find he at home we consult together the result be that he be to invite mr wilberforce and some other to meet I at a dinner at he own house in two or three day when he say he have no doubt of be able to procure a answer by some means or other to the question which i wish to have resolve on receive a card from mr langton i go to dine with he i find the party consist of sir charle middleton mr wilberforce mr hawkin browne mr windham sir joshua reynold and mr boswell the latter be then know as the friend of dr johnson and afterwards as the writer of he _ tour to the hebride _ after dinner the subject of the slave trade be purposely introduce many question be put to I and i dilate upon each in my answer that i might inform and interest those present as much as i could they seem to be greatly impressed with my account of the loss of seaman in the trade and with the little sample of african cloth which i have procure for they inspection sir joshua reynold give he unqualified approbation of the abolition of this cruel traffic mr hawkin browne join heartily with he in sentiment he speak with much feeling upon it and pronounce it to be barbarous and contrary to every principle of morality and religion mr boswell after say the planter would urge that the african be make happier by be carry from they own country to the west indy observe be it so but we have no right to make people happy against they will mr windham when it be suggest that the great importance of we west indian island and the grandeur of liverpool would be bring against those who should propose the abolition of the slave trade reply we have nothing to do with the policy of the measure rather let liverpool and the island be swallow up in the sea than this monstrous system of iniquity be carry on -lrb- a -rrb- while such conversation be pass and when all appear to be interested in the cause mr langton put the question about the proposal of which i have be so diffident to mr wilberforce in the shape of a delicate compliment the latter reply that he have no objection to bring forward the measure in parliament when he be better prepare for it and provide no person more proper could be find upon this mr hawkin browne and mr windham both say they would support he there before i leave the company i take mr wilberforce aside and ask he if i might mention this he resolution to those of my friend in the city of whom he have often hear I speak as desirous of aid he by become a committee for the purpose he reply i might i then ask mr langton privately if he have any objection to belong to a society of which there might be a committee for the abolition of the slave trade he say he should be please to become a member of it have receive these satisfactory answer i return home -lrb- footnote a : i do not know upon what grounds after such strong expression mr boswell in the next year and mr windham after have support the cause for three or four year become inimical to it -rrb- the next day have previously take down the substance of the conversation at the dinner i go to jame phillip and desire that we friend might be call together as soon as they conveniently could to hear my report in the interim i write to dr peckard and wait upon lord scarsdale dr baker and other to know -lrb- suppose a society be form for the abolition of the slave trade -rrb- if i might say they would belong to it all of they reply in the affirmative and desire I to represent they if there should be any meeting for this purpose at the time appoint i meet my friend i read over the substance of the conversation which have take place at mr langton 's no difficulty occur all be unanimous for the formation of a committee on the next day we meet by agreement for this purpose it be then resolve unanimously among other thing -- that the slave trade be both impolitic and unjust it be resolve also -- that the follow person be a committee for procure such information and evidence and publish the same as may tend to the abolition of the slave trade and for direct the application of such money as have be already and may hereafter be collect for the above purpose : -- all these be present granville sharp who stand at the head of the list and who as the father of the cause in england be call to the chair maybe consider as represent the first class of forerunner and coadjutor as it have be before describe the five next of whom samuel hoare be choose as the treasurer be they who have be the committee of the second class or of the quaker in england with the exception of dr knowle who be then die but who have hear of we meeting send a message to we to exhort we to proceed the third class or that of the quaker in america may be consider as represent by william dillwyn by whom they be afterwards join to we in correspondence the two who stand next and in which i be include may be consider as represent the fourth most of the member of which we have be the means of raise thus on the 22nd of may 1787 the representative of all the four class of which i have be give a history from the year 1516 meet together and be unite in that committee to which i have be all along direct the attention of the reader a committee which labor afterwards with mr wilberforce as a parliamentary head do under providence in the space of twenty year contribute to put a end to a trade which measure its magnitude by its crime and suffering be the greatest practical evil that ever afflict the human race after the formation of the committee -lrb- a -rrb- notice be send to mr wilberforce of the event and a friendship begin which have continue uninterruptedly between they from that to the present day -lrb- footnote a : all the member be of the society of the quaker except mr sharp sansom and myself joseph gurney bevan be present on the day before this meeting he desire to belong to the society but to be excuse from belong to the committee -rrb- chapter xi the precede history of the different class of the forerunner and coadjutor to the time of the formation of the committee collect into one view by means of a map -- explanation of this map and observation upon it as the precede history of the different class of the forerunner and coadjutor to the time of they junction or to the formation of the committee as just explain may be think interesting by many i have endeavor by means of the annexed map so to bring it before the reader that he may comprehend the whole of it at a single view the figure beginning at a and reach down to x represent the first class of forerunner and coadjutor up to the year 1787 as consist of so many spring or rivulet which assist in make and swell the torrent which sweep away the slave trade the figure from b to c and from c to x represent the second class or that of the quaker in england up to the same time the stream on the right-hand represent they as a body and that on the leave the six individual belong to they who form the committee in 1783 the figure from b to d represent the third class or that of the quaker in america when join with other in 1774 the stream pass from d through e to x show how this class be convey down as it be so as to unite with the second that pass from d to y show its course in its own country to its enlargement in 1787 and here i may observe that as the different stream which form a junction at x be instrumental in produce the abolition of the slave trade in england in the month of march 1807 so those whose effect be find unite at y contribute to produce the same event in america in the same month of the same year the figure from f to x represent the fourth class up to 1787 -lrb- illustration : first class of forerunner and coadjutor -rrb- -lrb- illustration : second class of forerunner and coadjutor -rrb- -lrb- illustration : third class of forerunner and coadjutor -rrb- x represent the junction of all the four class in the committee institute in london on the twenty-second day of may 1787 the parallel line g h i k represent different period of time show when the forerunner and coadjutor live the space between g and h include the space of fifty year in which we find but few labourer in this cause that between h and i include the same portion of time in which we find they considerably increase or nearly double that between i and k represent the next thirty-seven year but here we find they increase beyond all expectation for we find four time more labourer in this short term than in the whole of the preceding century in look over the map as thus explain a number of thought suggest themselves some of which it may not be improper to detail and first in look between the first and second parallel we perceive that morgan godwyn richard baxter and george fox the first a clergyman of the established church the second a divine at the head of the nonconformist and the third the founder of the religious society of the quaker appear each of they the first in he own class and all of they about the same time in behalf of the oppressed african we see then this great truth first apparent that the abolition of the slave trade take its rise not from person who set up a cry for liberty when they be oppressor themselves nor from person who be lead to it by ambition or a love of reputation among man but where it be most desirable namely from the teacher of christianity in those time this account of its rise will furnish we with some important lesson and first it show we the great value of religion we see when moral disorder become know that the virtuous be they who rise up for the removal of they thus providence seem to have appoint those who devote themselves most to he service to the honorable office of become so many agent under he influence for the correction of the evil of life and as this account of the rise of the abolition of the slave trade teach we the necessity of a due cultivation of religion so it should teach we to have a brotherly affection for those who though they may differ from we in speculative opinion concern it do yet show by they conduct that they have a high reward for it for though godwyn and baxter and fox differ as to the article of they faith we find they impel by the spirit of christianity which be of infinitely more importance than a mere agreement in creed to the same good end in look over the different stream in the map as they be discoverable both in europe and america we be impressed with another truth on the same subject which be that the christian religion be capable of produce the same good fruit in all land however man may differ on account of climate or language or government or law or however they may be situate in different quarter of the globe it will produce in they the same virtuous disposition and make they instrument for the promotion of happiness in the world in look between the two first parallel where we see so few labourer and in contemplate the great increase of these between the other we be teach the consoling lesson that however small the beginning and slow the progress may appear in any good work which we may undertake we need not be discourage as to the ultimate result of we labor for though we cause may appear stationary it may only become so in order that it may take a deeper root and thus be enable to stand better against the storm which may afterwards beat about it in take the same view again we discover the manner in which light and information proceed under a free government in a good cause a individual for example begin he communicate he sentiment to other thus while alive he enlighten when dead he leave he work behind he thus though depart he yet speak and he influence be not lose of those enlighten by he some become author and other actor in they turn while live they instruct like they predecessor when dead they speak also thus a number of dead person be encourage we in library and a number of living be converse and diffuse zeal among we at the same time this however be not true in any free and enlighten country with respect to the propagation of evil the living find no permanent encouragement and the dead speak to no purpose in such a case this account of the manner in which light and information proceed in a free country furnish we with some valuable knowledge it show we first the great importance of education for all they who can read may become enlighten they may gain as much from the dead as from the live they may see the sentiment of former age thus they may contract by degree habit of virtuous inclination and become fit to join with other in the removal of any of the evil of life it show we secondly how that encouraging maxim may become true that no good effort be ever lose for if he who make the virtuous attempt should be prevent by death from succeed in it can he not speak though in the tomb will not he work still breathe he sentiment upon it may not the opinion and the fact which he have record meet the approbation of ten thousand reader of whom it be probable in the common course of thing that some will branch out of he as author and other as actor or labourer in the same cause and lastly it will show we the difficulty -lrb- if any attempt should be make -rrb- of reverse permanently the late noble act of the legislature for the abolition of the slave trade for let we consider how many both of the living and the dead could be make to animate we let we consider too that this be the cause of mercy justice and religion that as such it will always afford renew means of rally and that the dead will always be hear with interest and the living with enthusiasm upon it chapter xii author devote this chapter to consideration relative to himself fear that by the frequent introduction of himself to the notice of the reader he may incur the charge of ostentation -- observation on such a charge have bring my history of the abolition of the slave trade up to the month of may 1787 i purpose take the liberty before i proceed with it to devote this chapter to consideration relative to myself this indeed seem to be now necessary for i have be fearful for some page past and indeed from the time when i begin to introduce myself to the notice of the reader as one of the forerunner and coadjutor in this great cause that i might appear to have put myself into a situation too prominent so as even to have incur the charge of ostentation but if there should be some who in consequence of what they have already read of this history should think thus unfavourably of I what must they opinion ultimately be when unfortunately i must become still more prominent in it nor do i know in what manner i shall escape they censure : for if to avoid egotism i should write as many have do in the third person what would this profit I the delicate situation therefore in which i feel myself to be place make I desirous of say a few word to the reader on this subject and first i may observe that several of my friend urge I from time to time and this long before the abolition of the slave trade have be effect to give a history of the rise and progress of the attempt as far as it have be then make but i uniformly resist they application when the question be decide last year they renew they request they represent to I that no person know the beginning and progress of this great work so well as myself that it be a pity that such knowledge should die with I that such a history would be useful that it would promote good feeling among man that it would urge they to benevolent exertion that it would supply they with hope in the midst of these that it would teach they many valuable lesson -- these and other thing be say to I but encourage as they be i never lose sight of the objection which be the subject of this chapter nor do i ever fail to declare that though consider the part i have take in this great cause i might be qualify better than some other yet it be a task too delicate for I to perform i always foresee that i could not avoid make myself too prominent a object in such a history and that i should be liable on that account to the suspicion of write it for the purpose of sound my own praise with this objection my friend be not satisfy they answer that i might treat the history of the abolition of the slave trade as a species of biography or as the history of a part of my own life : that people who have much less weighty matter to communicate write they own history and that no one charge they with vanity for so do i own i be not convince by this answer i determine however in compliance with they wish to examine the objection more minutely and to see if i could overcome it more satisfactorily to my own mind with this view i endeavor to anticipate the course which such a history would take i see clearly in the first place that there be time for month together when the committee for the abolition of the slave trade be labor without I and when i myself for a equal space of time be labor in distant part of the kingdom without they hence i perceive that if my own exertion be leave out there would be repeat chasm in this history and indeed that it could not be complete without the frequent mention of myself and i be willing to hope that this would be so obvious to the good sense of the reader that if he should think I vain-glorious in the early part of it he would afterwards when he advance in the perusal of it acquit I of such a charge this consideration be the first which remove my objection on this head that there can be no ground for any charge of ostentation as far as the origin of this history be concern so i hope to convince he there can be none by show he in what light i have always view myself in connexion with the committee to which i have have the honor to belong i have uniformly consider we committee for the abolition of the slave trade as we usually consider the human body that be as make up of a head and of various member which have different office to perform thus if one man be a eye another be a ear another a arm and another a foot and here i may say with great truth that i believe no committee be ever make up of person whose varied talent be better adapt to the work before they view then the committee in this light and myself as in connexion with it i may deduce those truth with which the analogy will furnish I and first it will follow that if every member have perform he office faithfully though one may have do something more than another yet no one of they in particular have any reason to boast with what propriety could the foot though in the execution of its duty it have become weary say to the finger thou hast do less than i when the finger could reply with truth i have do all that have be give I to do it will follow also that as every limb be essentially necessary for the completion of a perfect work so in the case before we every one be as necessary in he own office or department as another for what for example could i myself have do if i have not derive so much assistance from the committee what could mr wilberforce have do in parliament if i on the other hand have not collect that great body of evidence to which there be such a constant appeal and what could the committee have do without the parliamentary aid of mr wilberforce and in mention this necessity of distinct office and talent for the accomplishment of the great work in which we have be all of we engage i feel myself bind by the feeling of justice to deliver it as my opinion in this place -lrb- for perhaps i may have no other opportunity -rrb- that know as i have do so many member of both house of we legislature for many of whom i have have a sincere respect there be never yet one who appear to I to be so properly qualify in all respects for the management of the great cause of the abolition of the slave trade as he whose name i have just mention he connexion but more particularly he acquaintance with the first minister of state be of more service in the promotion of it than they who be but little acquaint with political movement can well appreciate he habit also of diligent and persevere inquiry make he master of all the knowledge that be requisite for conduct it he talent both in and out of parliament make he a powerful advocate in its favor he character free from the usual spot of human imperfection give a appropriate lustre to the cause make it look yet more lovely and entice other to its support but most of all the motive on which he undertake it insure its progress for this do not originate in view of selfishness or of party or of popular applause but in a awful sense of he duty as a christian it be this which give he alacrity and courage in he pursuit it be this which make he continue in he elevated situation of a legislator though it be unfavourable if not to he health at least to he ease and comfort it be this which make he incorporate this great object among the pursuit of he life so that it be daily in he thought it be this which when year after year of unsuccessful exertion return occasion he to be yet fresh and vigorous in spirit and to persevere till the day of triumph but to return : -- there be yet another consideration which i shall offer to the reader on this subject and with which i shall conclude it it be this that no one ought to be accuse of vanity until he have be find to assume to himself some extraordinary merit this be admit i shall now freely disclose the view which i have always be desirous of take of my own conduct on this occasion in the follow word : -- as robert barclay the apologist for the quaker when he dedicate he work to charle the second intimate to this prince that any merit which the work might have would not be derive from he patronage of it but from the author of all spiritual good so i say to the reader with respect to myself that i disclaim all praise on account of any part i may have take in the promotion of this great cause for that i be desirious above all thing to attribute my best endeavor in it to the influence of a superior power of he i mean who give I a heart to feel -- who give I courage to begin -- and perseverance to proceed -- and that i be thankful to he and this with the deepest feeling of gratitude and humility for have permit I to become useful in any degree to my fellow-creatures chapter xiii author return to he history -- committee form as before-mentioned its proceedings -- author produce a summary view of the slave trade and of the probable consequence of its abolition -- wrong of africa by mr roscoe generously present to the committee -- important discussion as to the object of the committee -- emancipation declare to be no part of it -- committee decide on its public title -- author request to go to bristol liverpool and lancaster to collect further information on the subject of the trade i return now after this long digression to the continuation of my history it be show in the latter part of the tenth chapter that twelve individual all of whom be then name meet together by means which no one could have foresee on the 22d of may 1787 and that after have vote the slave trade to be both unjust and impolitic they form themselves into a committee for procure such information and evidence and for publish the same as might tend to the abolition of it and for direct the application of such money as have be already and might hereafter be collect for that purpose at this meeting it be resolve also that no less than three member should form a quorum that samuel hoare should be the treasurer that the treasurer should pay no money but by order of the committee and that copy of these resolution should be print and circulate in which it should be insert that the subscription of all such as be willing to forward the plan of the committee should be receive by the treasurer or any member of it on the 24th of may the committee meet again to promote the object of its institution the treasurer report at this meeting that the subscription already receive amount to one hundred and thirty-six pound as i have foresee long before this time that my _ essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species _ be too large for general circulation and yet that a general circulation of knowledge on this subject be absolutely necessary i determine directly after the formation of the committee to write a short pamphlet consist only of eight or ten page for this purpose i call it _ a summary view of the slave trade and of the probable consequence of its abolition _ it begin by exhibit to the reader the various unjustifiable way in which person live on the coast of africa become slave it then explain the treatment which these experience on they passage the number die in the course of it and the treatment of the survivor in the colony of those nation to which they be carry it then announce the speedy publication of a work on the impolicy of the trade the contents of which as far as i could then see i give generally under the follow head : -- part the first it be say would show that africa be capable of offer to we a trade in its own natural production as well as in the person of man that the trade in the person of man be profitable but to a few that its value be diminish from many commercial consideration that it be also highly destructive to we seaman and that the branch of it by which we supply the island of st domingo with slave be peculiarly impolitic on that account part the second it be say would show that if the slave be kindly treat in we colony they would increase that the abolition of the trade would necessarily secure such a treatment to they and that it would produce many other advantage which would be then detail this little piece i present to the committee at this they second meeting it be then duly read and examine and the result be that after some little correction it be approve and that two thousand copy of it be order to be print with list of the subscriber and of the committee and to be send to various part of the kingdom on June the 7th the committee meet again for the despatch of business when among other thing they vote they thanks to dr baker of lower grosvenor-street who have be one of my first assistant for he service to the cause at this committee john barton one of the member of it state that he be commission by the author of a poem entitle _ the wrong of africa _ to offer the profit which might arise from the sale of that work to the committee for the purpose of enable they to pursue the object of they institution this circumstance be not only agreeable inasmuch as it show we that there be other who feel with we for the injured african and who be willing to aid we in we design but it be render still more so when we be give to understand that the poem be write by mr roscoe of liverpool and the preface to it by the late dr currie who then live in the same place to find friend to we cause rise up from a quarter where we expect scarcely anything but opposition be very consolatory and encouraging as this poem be well write but can not now be have i shall give the introductory part of it which be particularly beautiful to the perusal of the reader it begin thus : -- offspring of love divine humanity to whom he eldest bear th ' eternal give dominion o'er the heart and teach to touch its varied stop in sweetest unison and strike the string that from a kindred breast responsive vibrate from the noisy haunt of mercantile confusion where thy voice be hear not from the meretricious glare of crowded theater where in thy place sit sensibility with wat ` ry eye drop o'er fancy woe she useless tear come thou and weep with I substantial ill and execrate the wrong that afric 's son tear from they natal shore and doom have to bear the yoke of servitude in foreign clime sustain nor vainly let we sorrow flow nor let the strong emotion rise in vain but may the land contagion widely spread till in its flame the unrelenting heart of avarice melt in softest sympathy -- and one bright blaze of universal love in grateful incense rise up to heaven form would with the same capacity of pain the same desire of pleasure and of ease why feel not man for man when nature shrink from the slight puncture of a insect 's sting faint if not screen would from sultry sun und pine beneath the hardship of a hour 's delay of needful nutriment -- when liberty be priz would so dearly that the slightest breath that ruffle but she mantle can awake to arm unwarlike nation and can rouse confed ` rate state to vindicate she claim : -- how shall the suff ` rer man he fellow doom to ill he mourn and spurn at tear with stripe he quiv ` ring flesh with hunger and with thirst waste he emaciate frame in ceaseless toil exhaust he vital power and bind he limb in galling chain shall he whose fragile form demand continual blessing to support its complicated texture air and food raiment alternate rest and kindly sky and healthful season dare with impious voice to ask those mercy whilst he selfish aim arrest the general freedom of they course and gratify beyond he utmost wish debar another from the bounteous store in this manner be the subject of this beautiful poem introduce to the notice of the public but i have no room for any further extract nor time to make any further comment upon it i can only add that the committee be duly sensible as well of its merit as of the virtuous and generous disposition of the author and that they request john barton to thank he in a appropriate manner for he offer which he be to say they accept gratefully at this sit at which ten member be present out of the twelve a discussion unexpectedly arise on a most important subject the committee finding that they meeting begin to be approve by many and that the cause under they care be likely to spread and foresee also the necessity there would soon be of make themselves know as a public body throughout the kingdom think it right that they should assume some title which should be a permanent one and which should be expressive of they future view this give occasion to they to reconsider the object for which they have associate and to fix and define it in such a manner that there should be no misunderstanding about it in the public mind in look into the subject it appear to they that there be two evil quite distinct from each other which it might become they duty to endeavor to remove the first be the evil of the slave trade in consequence of which many thousand person be every year fraudulently and forcibly take from they country they relation and friend and from all that they esteem valuable in life the second be the evil of slavery itself in consequence of which the same person be force into a situation where they be deprive of the rights of man where they be oblige to linger out they day subject to excessive labor and cruel punishment and where they child be to inherit the same hard lot now the question be which of the two evil the committee should select as that to which they should direct they attention with a view of the removal of it or whether with the same view it should direct its attention to both of they it appear soon to be the sense of the committee that to aim at the removal of both would be to aim at too much and that by do this we might lose all the question then be which of the two they be to take as they object now in consider this question it appear that it do not matter where they begin or which of they they take as far as the end to be produce be the thing desire for first if the slave trade should be really abolish the bad usage of the slave in the colony that be the hard part of they slavery if not the slavery itself would fall for the planter and other be unable to procure more slave from the coast of africa it would follow directly whenever this great event should take place that they must treat those better whom they might then have they must render marriage honorable among they they must establish the union of one man with one wife they must give the pregnant woman more indulgence they must pay more attention to the rearing of they offspring they must work and punish the adult with less rigor now it be to be apprehend that they could not do these thing without see the political advantage which would arise to themselves from so do and that reasoning upon this they might be induce to go on to give they greater indulgence rights and privilege in time but how would every such successive improvement of they condition operate but to bring they nearer to the state of freeman in the same manner it be contend that the better treatment of the slave in the colony or that the emancipation of they there when fit for it would of itself lay the foundation for the abolition of the slave trade for if the slave be kindly treat that be if marriage be encourage among they if the infant who should be bear be bring up with care if the sick be properly attend to if the young and the adult be well feed and properly clothe and not over-worked and not wear down by the weight of severe punishment they would necessarily increase and this on a extensive scale but if the planter be thus to get they labourer from the birth on they own estate then the slave trade would in time be no longer necessary to they and it would die away as a useless and a noxious plant thus it be of no consequence which of the two evil the committee be to select as the object for they labor for as far as the end in view only be concern that the same end would be produce in either case but in look further into this question it seem to make a material difference which of the two they select as far as they have in view the due execution of any law which might be make respect they and they own prospect of success in the undertaking for by aim at the abolition of the slave trade they be lay the axe at the very root by do this and this only they would not incur the objection that they be meddle with the property of the planter and let loose a irritated race of being who in consequence of all the vice and infirmity which a state of slavery entail upon those who undergo it be unfit for they freedom by ask the government of the country to do this and this only they be ask for that which it have a indisputable right to do namely to regulate or abolish any of its branch of commerce : whereas it be doubtful whether it could interfere with the management of the internal affair of the colony or whether this be not wholly the province of the legislature establish there by ask the government again to do this and this only they be ask what it could really enforce it could station its ship of war and command its custom-house so as to carry any act of this kind into effect but it could not insure that a act to be observe in the heart of the island should be enforce -lrb- a -rrb- to this it be add that if the committee be to fix upon the annihilation of slavery as the object for they labor the slave trade would not fall so speedily as it would by a positive law for the abolition because though the increase from the birth might soon supply all the estate now in cultivation with labourer yet new plantation might be open from time to time in different island so that no period could be fix upon when it could be say that it would cease -lrb- footnote a : the late correspondence of the governor of we colony with lord camden in he official situation but particularly the statement make by lord seaforth and general prevost have show the wisdom of this remark and that no dependence be to be have for the better usage of the slave but upon the total abolition of the trade -rrb- impressed by these argument the committee be clearly of opinion that they should define they object to be the abolition of the slave trade and not of the slavery which spring from it hence from this time and in allusion to the month when this discussion take place they style themselves in they different advertisement and report though they be first associate in the month of may the committee institute in June 1787 for effect the abolition of the slave trade thus at the very outset they take a ground which be for ever tenable thus they be enable also to answer the objection which be afterwards so constantly and so industriously circulate against they that they be go to emancipate the slave and i have no doubt that this wise decision contribute greatly to they success for i be persuade that if they have adopt the other object they could not for year to come if ever have succeed in they attempt before the committee break up i represent to they the necessity there be of obtain further knowledge on all those individual point which might be say to belong to the great subject of the abolition of the slave trade in the first place this knowledge be necessary for I if i be to complete my work on _ the impolicy of this trade _ which work the _ summary view _ just print have announce to the world it would be necessary also in case the slave trade should become a subject of parliamentary inquiry for this inquiry could not proceed without evidence and if any time be peculiarly fit for the procuring of such information or evidence it be the present at this time the passion of man have not be heat by any public agitation of the question nor have interest feel itself biass to conceal the truth but as soon as ever it should be publicly understand that a parliamentary inquiry be certain -lrb- which we ourselves believe would be the case but which interested man do not then know -rrb- we should find many of the avenue to information close against we i propose therefore that some one of the committee should undertake a journey to bristol liverpool and lancaster where he should reside for a time to collect further light upon this subject and that if other should feel they occupation or engagement to be such as would make such a journey unsuitable i would undertake it myself i begged therefore the favor of the different member of the committee to turn the matter over in they mind by the next meeting that we might then talk over and decide upon the propriety of the measure the committee hold its fourth meeting on the 12th of June among the subject which be then bring forward be that of the journey before mention the propriety and indeed even the necessity of it be so apparent that i be request by all present to undertake it and a minute for that purpose be enter upon we record of this journey as gradually unfold light on the subject and as peculiarly connect with the promotion of we object i shall now give a account after which i shall return to the proceedings of the committee chapter xiv author arrive at bristol introduction to quaker family there -- object of he inquiry -- ill usage of seaman on board the ship brother -- obtain a knowledge of several article of african produce -- dr caniplin dean tucker mr henry sulgar -- procure a authenticate account of the treacherous massacre at calabar -- ill usage of the seaman of the ship alfr -- painful feeling of the author on this occasion have make preparation for my journey i take my leave of the different individual of the committee i call upon mr wilberforce also with the same design he be then very ill and in bed sir richard hill and other be sit by he bedside after converse as much as he well could in he weak state he hold out he hand to I and wish I success when i leave he i feel much dejected it appear to I as if it would be in this case as it be often in that of other earthly thing that we scarcely possess what we repute a treasure when it be take from we i determine to take this journey on horseback not only on account of the relax state in which i find myself after such close and constant application but because i wish to have all my time to myself upon the road in order the better to reflect upon the proper means of promote this great cause the first place i resolve to visit be bristol accordingly i direct my course thither on turn a corner within about a mile of that city at about eight in the evening i come within sight of it the weather be rather hazy which occasion it to look of unusual dimension the bell of some of the church be then ring the sound of they do not strike I till i have turn the corner before mention when it come upon I at once it fill I almost directly with a melancholy for which i could not account i begin now to tremble for the first time at the arduous task i have undertake of attempt to subvert one of the branch of the commerce of the great place which be then before I i begin to think of the host of people i should have to encounter in it i anticipate much persecution in it also and i question whether i should even get out of it alive but in journey on i become more calm and compose my spirit begin to return in these latter moment i consider my first feeling as useful inasmuch as they impress upon I the necessity of extraordinary courage and activity and perseverance and of watchfulness also over my own conduct that i might not throw any stain upon the cause i have undertake when therefore i enter the city i enter it with a undaunted spirit determine that no labor should make I shrink nor danger nor even persecution deter I from my pursuit my first introduction be by means of a letter to harry gandy who have then become one of the religious society of the quaker this introduction to he be particularly useful to I for he have be a seafaring man in he early youth he have be of a roving disposition and in order to see the world have be two voyage in the slave trade so that he have know the nature and practice of it this enable he to give I much useful information on the subject and as he have frequently feel as he grow up deep affliction of mind for have be concern in it he be impel to forward my view as much as possible under a idea that he should be thus make some reparation for the indiscreet and profane occupation of he youth i be also introduce to the family of jame harford john lury matthew wright philip debell tucket thoma bonville and john waring all of whom be of the same religious society i gain a introduction also soon afterwards to george fisher these be my first and only acquaintance at bristol for some time i derive assistance in the promotion of my object from all of they and it be a matter of please reflection that the friendship then form have be keep alive to the present time the object i have mark down as those to be attend to be -- to ascertain what be the natural production of africa and if possible to obtain specimen of they with the view of form a cabinet or collection -- to procure as much information as i could relative to the manner of obtain slave on continent of africa of transport they to the west indy and of treat they there -- to prevail upon person have a knowledge of any or all of these circumstance to come forward to be examine as evidence before parliament if such a examination should take place -- to make myself still better acquaint with the loss of seaman in the slave trade -- also with the loss of those who be employ in the other trade from the same port -- to know the nature and quantity and value of the import and export of goods in the former case : -- there be some other object which i class under the head of miscellaneous in my first movement about this city i find that people talk very openly on the subject of the slave trade they seem to be well acquaint with the various circumstance belong to it there be fact in short in every body 's mouth concern it and every body seem to execrate it though no one thought of its abolition in this state of thing i perceive that my course be obvious for i have little else to do in pursue two or three of my object than to trace the foundation of those report which be in circulation on the third of July i hear that the ship brother -lrb- a -rrb- then lie in king 's road for africa could not get she seaman and that a party which have be put on board become terrify by the prospect of they situation have leave she on Sunday morning on inquire further i find that those who have navigate she on she last voyage thirty-two of whom have die have be so dreadfully use by the captain that he could not get hand in the present it be add that the treatment of seaman be a cry evil in this trade and that consequently few would enter into it so that there be at all time a great difficulty in procure they though they be ready enough to enter into other trade -lrb- footnote a : i abstain from mention the name of the captain of this or of other vessel lest the recording of they should give pain to relative who can have have no share in they guilt -rrb- the relation of these circumstance make I acquaint with two thing of which i have not before hear namely the aversion of seaman to engage and the bad usage of they when engage in this cruel trade into both which i determine immediately to inquire i conceive that it become I to be very cautious about give ear too readily to report and therefore as i could easily learn the truth of one of the assertion which have be make to I i think it prudent to ascertain this and to judge by the discovery i should make concern it what degree of credit might be due to the rest accordingly by means of my late friend truman harford the eldest son of the respectable family of that name to which i have already mention myself to have be introduce i gain access to the muster-roll of the ship brother on look over the name of she last crew i find the melancholy truth confirm that thirty-two of they have be place among the dead have ascertain this circumstance i become eager to inquire into the truth of the other but more particularly of the treatment of one of the seaman which as it be report to I exceed all belief he name be john dean he be a black man but free the report be that for a trifling circumstance for which he be in no-wise to blame the captain have fasten he with he belly to the deck and that in this situation he have pour hot pitch upon he back and make incision in it with hot tong before however i attempt to learn the truth of this barbarous proceeding i think i would look into the ship 's muster-roll to see if i could find the name of such a man on examination i find it to be the last on the list john dean it appear have be one of the original crew have go on board from bristol on the twenty-second day of July 1785 on inquire where dean be to be find my informant tell I that he have lately leave bristol for london i be show however to the house where he have lodge the name of he landlord be donovan on talk with he on the subject he assure I that the report i have hear be true for that while he reside with he he have hear a account of he usage from some of he ship-mate and that he have often look at he scar and mutilate back on inquire of donovan if any other person in bristol could corroborate this account he refer I to a reputable tradesman living in the market-place have be introduce to he he tell I that he have long know john dean to be a sober and industrious man that he have see the terrible indenture on he back and that they be say to have be make by the captain in the manner relate during he last voyage while i be investigate this matter further i be introduce to mr sydenham teast a respectable ship-builder in bristol and the owner of vessel trade to africa in the natural production of that country i mention to he by accident what i have hear relative to the treatment of john dean he say it be true a attorney -lrb- a -rrb- in london have then take up he cause in consequence of which the captain have be prevent from sailing till he could find person who would be answerable for the damages which might be award against he in a court of law mr teast further say that not know at that time the cruelty of the transaction to its full extent he himself have be one of the security for the captain at the request of the purser -lrb- b -rrb- of the ship finding however afterwards that it be as the public have state he be sorry that he have ever interfere in such a barbarous case -lrb- footnote a : i afterwards find out this attorney he describe the transaction to I as by report it have take place and inform I that he have make the captain of the brother pay for he barbarity -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : the purser of a ship at bristol be the person who manage the outfit as well as the trade and who be often in part owner of she -rrb- this transaction which i now believe to be true have the effect of prepare I for credit whatever i might hear concern the barbarity say to be practice in this trade it kindle also a fire of indignation within I and produce in I both anxiety and spirit to proceed but that which excited these feeling the most be the consideration that the purser of this ship know as he do of this act of cruelty should have send out this monster again this i own make I think that there be a system of bad usage to be deliberately practice upon the seaman in this employment for some purpose or other which i could then neither comprehend nor ascertain but while i be in pursuit of this one object i be not unmindful of the other which i have mark out for myself i have already procure a interview as i have mention with mr sydenham teast i have do this with a view of learn from he what be the different production of the continent of africa as far as he have be able to ascertain from the import by he own vessel he be very open and communicative he have import ivory red-wood cam-wood and gum-copal he purpose to import palm-oil he observe that bee ' - wax might be collect also upon the coast of he gum-copal he give I a specimen he furnish I also with two different specimen of unknown wood which have the appearance of be useful one of he captain he inform I have be tell by the native that cotton pink in the pod grow in they country he be of opinion that many valuable production might be find upon this continent mr bigg to whom i gain a introduction also be in a similar trade with mr teast that be he have one or two vessel which skim as it be the coast and river for what they could get of the produce of africa without have any concern in the trade for slave mr bigg give I a specimen of gum senegal of yellow-wood and of malaguetta and cayenne pepper he give I also small piece of cloth make and dye by the native the color of which they could only have obtain from material in they own country mr bigg seem to be assure that if proper person be send to africa on discovery they would fine a rich mine of wealth in the natural production of it and in none more advantageous to this as a manufacturing nation than in the many beautiful dye which it might furnish from thomas bonville i collect two specimen of cloth make by the native and from other a beautiful piece of tulipwood a small piece of wood similar to mahogany and a sample of fine rice all of which have be bring from the same continent among the person whom i find out at bristol and from whom i derive assistance be dr camplin and the celebrated dean tucker the former be my warm defender for the west indian and african merchant as soon as they discover my errand begin to calumniate I the dean though in a very advanced age feel himself much interested in my pursuit he have long move in the political world himself and be desirous of hearing of what be go forward that be new in it but particularly about so desirable a measure as that of the abolition of the slave trade -lrb- a -rrb- he introduce I to the custom house at bristol he use to call upon I at the merchant ' hall while i be transcribe the muster-roll of the seaman there in short he seem to be interested in all my movement he become also a warm supporter both of I and of my cause -lrb- footnote a : dean tucker in he _ reflection on the dispute between great britain and ireland _ publish in 1785 have pass a severe censure on the british planter for the inhuman treatment of they slave -rrb- among other who be useful to I in my pursuit be mr henry sulgar a amiable minister of the gospel belong to the religious society of the moravian in the same city from he i first procured authentic document relative to the treacherous massacre at calabar this cruel transaction have be frequently mention to I but as it have take place twenty year before i could not find one person who have be engage in it nor could i come in a satisfactory manner at the various particulars belong to it my friend however put I in possession of copy of the real deposition which have be take in the case of the king against lippincott and other relative to this event namely of captain floyd of the city of bristol who have be a witness to the scene and of ephraim robin john and of ancona robin robin john two african chief who have be sufferer by it these deposition have be take before jacob kirby and thoma symon esquire commissioner at bristol for take affidavit in the court of king 's bench the tragedy of which they give a circumstantial account i shall present to the reader in as concise a manner as i can in the year 1767 the ship indian queen duke of york nancy and concord of bristol the edgar of liverpool and the canterbury of london lay in old calabar river it happen at this time that a quarrel subsist between the principal inhabitant of old town and those of new town old calabar which have originate in a jealousy respect slave the captain of the vessel now mention join in send several letter to the inhabitant of old town but particularly to ephraim robin john who be at that time a grandee or principal inhabitant of the place the tenor of these letter be that they be sorry that any jealousy or quarrel should subsist between the two party that if the inhabitant of old town would come on board they would afford they security and protection add at the same time that they intention in invite they be that they might become mediator and thus heal they dispute the inhabitant of old town happy to find that they difference be likely to be accommodate joyfully accept the invitation the three brother of the grandee just mention the eldest of whom be amboe robin john first enter they canoe attend by twenty-seven other and be follow by nine canoe direct they course to the indian queen they be despatch from thence the next morning to the edgar and afterwards to the duke of york on board of which they go leave they canoe and attendant by the side of the same vessel in the mean time the people on board the other canoe be either distribute on board or lie close to the other ship this be the situation of the three brother and of the principal inhabitant of the place the treachery now begin to appear the crew of the duke of york aid by the captain and mate and arm with pistol and cutlass rush into the cabin with a intent to seize the person of they three innocent and unsuspicious guest the unhappy man alarm at this violation of the rights of hospitality and strike with astonishment at the behavior of they suppose friend attempt to escape through the cabin window but be wound be oblige to desist and to submit to be put in iron in the same moment in which this atrocious attempt have be make a order have be give to fire upon the canoe which be then lie by the side of the duke of york the canoe soon fill and sink and the wretched attendant be either seize kill or drown most of the other ship follow the example great number be additionally kill and drown on the occasion and other be swim to the shore at this juncture the inhabitant of new town who have conceal themselves in the bush by the water-side and between whom and the commander of the vessel the plan have be previously concerted come out from they hiding-place and embark in they canoe make for such as be swim from the fire of the ship the ship ' boat also be man and join in the pursuit they butcher the greatest part of those whom they catch many dead body be soon see upon the sand and other be float upon the water and include those who be seize and carry off and those who be drown and kill either by the firing of the ship or by the people of new town three hundred be lose to the inhabitant of old town on that day the carnage which i have be now describe be scarcely over when a canoe full of the principal people of new town who have be the promoter of the scheme drop along-side of the duke of york they demand the person of amboe robin john the brother of the grandee of old town and the eldest of the three on board the unfortunate man put the palm of he hand together and beseech the commander of the vessel that he would not violate the rights of hospitality by give up a unoffending stranger to he enemy but no entreaty could avail the commander receive from the new town people a slave of the name of econg in he stead and then force he into the canoe where he head be immediately strike off in the sight of the crew and of he afflict and disconsolate brother as for they they escape he fate but they be carry off with they attendant to the west indy and sell for slave the knowledge of this tragical event now fully confirm I in the sentiment that the heart of those who be concern in this traffic become unusually hardened and that i might readily believe any atrocity however great which might be relate of they it make also my blood boil as it be within I : it give anew spring to my exertion and i rejoice sorrowful as i otherwise be that i have visit bristol if it have be only to gain a accurate statement of this one fact in pursue my object i find that report be current that the crew of the alfred slave-vessel which have just return have be barbarously use but particularly a young man of the name of thoma who have serve as the surgeon 's mate on board she the report be that he have be repeatedly knock down by the captain that he have become in consequence of he ill usage so weary of he life that he have three time jump over board to destroy it that on be take up the last time he have be chained to the deck of the ship in which situation he have remain night and day for some time that in consequence of this he health have be greatly impaired and that it be suppose he could not long survive this treatment it be with great difficulty notwithstanding all my inquiry that i could trace this person i discover he however at last he be confine to he bed when i see he and appear to I to be delirious i could collect nothing from himself relative to the particulars of he treatment in he interval of sense he exclaim against the cruelty both of the captain and of the chief mate and point to he leg thigh and body which be all wrap up in flannel he endeavor to convince I how much he have suffer there at one time he say he forgive they at another he ask if i come to befriend he at another he look wildly and ask if i mean to take the captain 's part and to kill he i be greatly affect by the situation of this poor man whose image haunt I both night and day and i be meditate how most effectually to assist he when i hear that he be dead i be very desirous of trace something further on this subject when walter chandler of the society of the quaker who have be daily look out for intelligence for I bring a young man to I of the name of dixon he have be one of the crew of the same ship he tell I the particulars of the treatment of thoma with very little variation from those contain in the public report after cross-examine he in the best manner i be able i could find no inconsistency in he account i ask dixon how the captain come to treat the surgeon 's mate in particular so ill he say he have treat they all much alike a person of the name of bulpin he believe be the only one who have escape bad usage in the ship with respect to himself he have be cruelly use so early as in the outward bind passage which have occasion he to jump overboard when take up he be put into iron and keep in these for a considerable time he be afterwards ill use at different time and even so late as within three or four day of he return to port for just before the alfr make the island of lundy he be strike by the captain who cut he under lip into two he say that it have bleed so much that the captain express himself as if much alarmed and have the expectation of arrive soon at bristol he have promise to make he amends if he would hold he peace this he say he have hitherto do but he have receive no recompense in confirmation of he own usage he desire I to examine he lip which i have no occasion to do have already perceive it for the wound be apparently almost fresh i ask dixon if there be any person in bristol beside himself who could confirm to I this he own treatment as well as that of the other unfortunate man who be now dead he refer I to a seaman of the name of matthew pyke this person when bring to I not only related readily the particulars of the usage in both case as i have now state they but that which he receive himself he say that he own arm have be break by the chief mate in black river jamaica and that he have also by the captain 's order though contrary to the practice in merchant-vessel be severely flog he arm appear to be then in pain and i have a proof of the punishment by a inspection of he back i ask matthew pyke if the crew in general have be treat in a cruel manner he reply they have except jame bulpin i then ask where jame bulpin be to be find he tell I where he have lodge but fear he have go home to he friend in somersetshire i think somewhere in the neighborhood of bridgewater i think it prudent to institute a inquiry into the character of thoma dixon and matthew pyke before i go further the two former i find be stranger in bristol and i could collect nothing about they the latter be a native of the place have serve he time as a seaman from the port and be repute of fair character my next business be to see jame bulpin i find he just set off for the country he stop however to converse with I he be a young man of very respectable appearance and of mild manners he appearance indeed give I reason to hope that i might depend upon he statement but i be most of all influence by the consideration that never have be ill-used himself he could have no inducement to go beyond the bound of truth on this occasion he give I a melancholy confirmation of all the three case he tell I also that one joseph cunningham have be a severe sufferer and that there be reason to fear that charle horseler another of the crew have be so severely beat over the breast with a knotted end of a rope -lrb- which end be of the size of a large ball and have be make on purpose -rrb- that he die of it to this he add that it be now a notorious fact that the captain of the alfr when mate of a slave-ship have be try at barbado for the murder of one of the crew with whom he have sail but that he escape by bribe the principal witness to disappear -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : mr sampson who be surgeon 's mate of the ship in which the captain have thus serve as a mate confirm to I afterwards this assertion have often hear he boast in the cabin how he have trick the law on that occasion -rrb- the reader will see the further i go into the history of this voyage the more dismal it become one miserable account when examine only bring up another i see no end to inquiry the great question be what be i to do i think the best thing would be to get the captain apprehend and make he stand he trial either for the murder of thoma or of charle horseler i communicate with the late mr burge a eminent attorney and the deputy town-clerk on this occasion he have show a attachment to I on account of the cause i have undertake and have give I privately assistance in it i say privately because know the sentiment of many of the corporate body at bristol under whom he act he be fearful of come forward in a open manner he advice to I be to take note of the case for my own private conviction but to take no public cognizance of it he say that seaman as soon as they wages be expend must be off to sea again they could not generally as landsman do maintain themselves on shore hence i should be oblige to keep the whole crew at my own expense till the day of trial which might not be for month to come he doubt not that in the interim the merchant and other would inveigle many of they away by make they boatswain and other inferior officer in some of they ship so that when the day of trial should come i should find my witness disperse and go he observe moreover that if any of the officer of the ship have any notion of go out again under the same owner -lrb- a -rrb- i should have all these against I to which he add that if i be to make a point of take up the cause of those whom i find complain of hard usage in this trade i must take up that of nearly all who sail in it for that he only know of one captain from the port in the slave trade who do not deserve long ago to be hang hence i should get into a labyrinth of expense and difficulty and uneasiness of mind from whence i should not easily find a clew to guide I -lrb- footnote a : the seaman of the alfred inform the purser of they ill usage matthew pyke not only show he he arm and he back but acquaint he with the murder of charle horseler state that he have the instrument of he death in he possession the purser seem more alive to this than to any other circumstance and wish to get it from he pyke however have give it to I now what will the reader think when he be inform that the purser after all this knowledge of the captain 's cruelty send he out again and that he be the same person who be purser of the brother and who have also send out the captain of that ship a second time as have be related notwithstanding he barbarity in former voyage -rrb- this advice though it be judicious and found on a knowledge of law proceedings i find it very difficult to adopt my own disposition be naturally such that whatever i engage in i follow with more than ordinary warmth i could not be suppose therefore affect and interested as i then be to be cool and tranquil on this occasion and yet what would my worthy friend have say if in this first instance i have oppose he i have a very severe struggle in my own feeling on this account at length though reluctantly i obeyed but as the passion which agitate the human mind when it be greatly inflamed must have a vent somewhere or must work off as it be or in work together must produce some new passion or effect so i find the rage which have be kindle within I subside into the most determine resolution of future increase activity and perseverance i begin now to think that the day be not long enough for I to labor in i regret often the approach of night which suspend my work and i often welcome that of the morning which restore I to it when i feel myself weary i become refresh by the thought of what i be do when disconsolate i be comfort by it i live in hope that every day 's labor would furnish I with that knowledge which would bring this evil nearer to its end and i work on under these feeling regard neither trouble nor danger in the pursuit chapter xv author confer with the inhabitant of

gardiner of the pilgrim of arnold of the ruby some particulars of the latter in he former voyage have hear by accident that the inhabitant of the town of bridgewater have send a petition to the house of common in the year 1785 for the abolition of the slave trade as have be relate in a former part of the work i determine while my feeling be warm to go there and to try to find out those who have be concern in it and to confer with they as the try friend of the cause the time seem to I to be approach when the public voice should be raise against this enormous evil i be sure that it be only necessary for the inhabitant of this favored island to know it to feel a just indignation against it accordingly i set off my friend george fisher who be before mention to have be of the religious society of the quaker give I a introduction to the respectable family of ball which be of the same religious persuasion i call upon mr sealey anstice crandon chubb and other i lay open to those whom i see the discovery i have make relative to the loss and ill treatment of seaman at which they seem to be much move and it be agree that if it should be think a proper measure -lrb- of which i would inform they when i have consult the committee -rrb- a second petition should be send to parliament from the inhabitant pray for the abolition of the slave trade with this view i leave they several of my _ summary view _ before mention to distribute that the inhabitant might know more particularly the nature of the evil against which they be go to complain on my return to bristol i determine to inquire into the truth of the report that seaman have a aversion to enter and that they be inveigle if not often force into this hateful employment for this purpose i be introduce to a landlord of the name of thompson who keep a public-house call the seven star he be a very intelligent man be accustom to receive sailor when discharge at the end of they voyage and to board they till they vessel go out again or to find they birth in other he avoid however all connexion with the slave trade declare that the credit of he house would be ruin if he be know to send those who put themselves under he care into it from he i collect the truth of all that have be state to I on this subject but i tell he i should not be satisfy until i have behold those scene myself which he have describe to I and i entreated he to take I into they say that i would reward he for all he time and trouble and that i would never forget he while i live to this he consent and as three or four slave-vessel at this time be prepare for they voyage it be time that we should begin we round at about twelve at night we generally set out and be employ till two and sometimes three in the morning he lead I from one of these public-house to another which the mate of the slave-vessel use to frequent to pick up they hand these house be in marsh-street and most of they be then keep by irishman the scene witness in these house be truly distressing to I and yet if i wish to know practically what i have purpose i could not avoid they music dancing rioting drunkenness and profane swearing be keep up from night to night the young mariner if a stranger to the port and unacquainted with the nature of the slave trade be sure to be pick up the novelty of the voyage the superiority of the wages in this over any other trade and the privilege of various kind be set before he gull in this manner he be frequently entice to the boat which be wait to carry he away if these prospects do not attract he he be ply with liquor till he become intoxicate when a bargain be make over he between the landlord and the mate after this he sens be keep in such a constant state of stupefaction by the liquor that in time the former might do with he what he please seaman also be board in these house who when the slave-ship be go out but at no other time be encourage to spend more than they have money to pay for and to these when they have thus exceed but one alternative be give namely a slave-vessel or a gaol these distressing scene i find myself obliged frequently to witness for i be no less than nineteen time occupy in make these hateful round and i can say from my own experience and all the information i could collect from thompson and other that no such practice be in use to obtain seaman for other trade the treatment of the seaman employ in the slave trade have so deeply interested I and now the manner of procure they that i be determine to make myself acquaint with they whole history for i find by report that they be not only personally ill-treated as i have already painfully describe but that they be rob by artifice of those wages which have be hold up to they as so superior in this service all person be oblige to sign article that in case they should die or be discharge during the voyage the wages then due to they should be pay in the currency where the vessel carry she slave and that half of the wages due to they on they arrival there should be pay in the same manner and that they be never permit to read over the article they have sign by means of this iniquitous practice the wages in the slave trade though nominally higher in order to induce seaman to engage in it be actually lower than in other trade all these usage i ascertain in such a manner that no person could doubt the truth of they i actually obtain possession of article of agreement belong to these vessel which have be sign and execute in former voyage i make the merchant themselves by send those seaman who have claim upon they to ask for they account current with they respective ship furnish I with such document as would have be evidence against they in any court of law on whatever branch of the system i turn my eye i find it equally barbarous the trade be in short one mass of iniquity from the begin to the end i employ myself occasionally in the merchant 's - hall in make copy of the muster-roll of ship sail to different part of the world that i might make a comparative view of the loss of seaman in the slave trade with that of those in the other trade from the same port the result of this employment show I the importance of it : for when i consider how partial the inhabitant of this country be to they fellow-citizen the seaman belong to it and in what estimation the member of the legislature hold they by enforce the navigation act which they consider to be the bulwark of the nation and by give bounty to certain trade that these might become so many nursery for the marine i think it of great importance to be able to prove as i be then capable of do that more person would be find dead in three slave-vessel from bristol in a give time than in all the other vessel put together numerous as they be belong to the same port i procured also a account of the export and import for the year 1786 by means of which i be enable to judge of the comparative value of this and the other trade in pursue another object which be that of go on board the slave-ship and learn they construction and dimension i be greatly strike and indeed affect by the appearance of two little sloop which be fitting out for africa the one of only twenty-five ton which be say to be destine to carry seventy and the other of only eleven which be say to be destine to carry thirty slave i be tell also that which be more affect namely that these be not to act as tender on the coast by go up and down the river and receive three or four slave at a time and then carry they to a large ship which be to take they to the west indy but that it be actually intend that they should transport they own slave themselves that one if not both of they be on they arrival in the west indy to be sell as pleasure-vessel and that the seaman belong to they be to be permit to come home by what be usually call the run this account of the destination of these little vessel though it be distressing at first appear to I afterwards on cool reasoning to be incredible i think that my informant wish to impose upon I in order that i might make statement which would carry they own refutation with they and that thus i might injure the great cause which i have undertake and i be much inclined to be of this opinion when i look again at the least of the two for any person who be tall standing upon dry ground by the side of she might have overlook every thing upon she deck i know also that she have be build as a pleasure-boat for the accommodation of only six person upon the severn i determine therefore to suspend my belief till i could take the admeasurement of each vessel this i do but lest in the agitation of my mind on this occasion i should have make any mistake i desire my friend george fisher to apply to the builder for he admeasurement also with this he kindly comply when he obtain it he bring it I this account which nearly correspond with my own be as follow : -- in the vessel of twenty-five ton the length of the upper part of the hold or roof of the room where the seventy slave be to be stow be but little better than ten yard or thirty-one foot the greatest breadth of the bottom or floor be ten foot four inch and the least five hence a grow person must sit down all the voyage and contract he limb within the narrow limit of three square foot in the vessel of eleven ton the length of the room for the thirty slave be twenty-two foot the greatest breadth of the floor be eight and the least four the whole height from the keel to the beam be but five foot eight inch three foot of which be occupy by ballast cargo and provision so that two foot eight inch remain only as the height between the deck hence each slave would have only four square foot to sit in and when in this posture he head if he be a full-grown person would touch the ceiling or upper deck have now receive this admeasurement from the builder which be rather more favourable than my own i look upon the destination of these little vessel as yet more incredible than before still the different person whom i occasionally see on board they persist in it that they be go to africa for slave and also for the number mention which they be afterwards to carry to the west indy themselves i desire however my friend george fisher truman harford harry gandy walter chandler and other each to make a separate inquiry for I on this subject and they all agree that improbable as the account both of they destination and of the number they be to take might appear they have find it to be too true i have soon afterwards the sorrow to learn from official document from the custom-house that these little vessel actually clear out for africa and that now nothing could be relate so barbarous of this traffic which might not instantly be believe in pursue my different object there be one which to my great vexation i find it extremely difficult to attain this be the procuring of any assurance from those who have be personally acquaint with the horror of this trade that they would appear if call upon as evidence against it my friend harry gandy to whom i have be first introduce have be two voyage as i before mention and he be willing though at a advanced age to go to london to state publicly all he know concern they but with respect to the many other in bristol who have be to the coast of africa i have not yet find one who would come forward for this purpose there be several old slave captain live there who have a great knowledge of the subject i think it not unreasonable that i might gain one or two good evidence out of these as they have probably long ago leave the concern and be not now interested in the continuance of it but all my endeavor be fruitless i send message to they by different person i meet they in all way i state to they that if there be nothing objectionable in the trade see it labor under such a stigma they have a opportunity of come forward and of wipe away the stain if on the other hand it be as bad as represent then they have it in they power by detail the crime which attach to it of make some reparation or atonement for the part they have take in it but no representation would do all intercourse be positively forbid between we and whenever they meet I in the street they shun I as if i have be a mad dog i could not for some time account for the strange disposition which they thus manifest towards I but my friend help I to unravel it for i be assure that one or two of they though they go no longer to africa as captain be in part owner of vessel trade there and with respect to all of they it might be generally say that they have be guilty of such enormity that they would be afraid of come forward in the way i propose lest any thing should come out by which they might criminate themselves i be oblige then to give up all hope of get any evidence from this quarter and i saw but little prospect of get it from those who be then actually derive they livelihood from the trade : and yet i be determine to persevere for i think that some might be find in it who be not yet so harden as to be incapable of be awaken on this subject i think that other might be find in it who wish to leave it upon principle and that these would unbosom themselves to I : and i think it not improbable that i might fall in with other who have come unexpectedly into a state of independence and that these might be induce as they livelihood would be no longer affect by give I information to speak the truth i persevere for week together under this hope but could find no one of all those who have be apply to who would have any thing to say to I at length walter chandler have prevail upon a young gentleman of the name of gardiner who be go out as surgeon of the pilgrim to meet I the condition be that we be to meet at the house of the former but that we be to enter in and go out at different time that be we be not to be see together gardiner on be introduce to I say at once that he have often wish to see I on the subject of my errand but that the owner of the pilgrim have point I out to he as a person whom he would wish he to avoid he then lay open to I the different method of obtain slave in africa as he have learn from those on board he own vessel in he first or former voyage he unfold also the manner of they treatment in the middle passage with the various distressing scene which have occur in it he state the barbarous usuage of the seaman as he have witness it and conclude by say that there never be a subject which demand so loudly the interference of the legislature as that of the slave trade when he have finish he narrative and answer the different question which i have propose to he concern it i ask he in as delicate a manner as i could how it happen that see the trade in this horrible light he have consent to follow it again he tell I frankly that he have receive a regular medical education but that he relation be poor have not be able to set he up in he profession he have save a little money in he last voyage in that which he be now to perform he hope to save a little more with the profit of both voyage together he expect he should be able to furnish a shop in the line of he profession when he would wipe he hand of this detestable trade i then ask he whether upon the whole he think he have judge prudently or whether the prospect of thus enable himself to become independent would counterbalance the uneasiness which might arise in future he reply that he have not so much to fear upon this account the trade while it continue must have surgeon but it make a great difference both to the crew and to the slave whether these discharge they duty towards they in a feeling manner or not with respect to himself he be sure that he should pay every attention to the want of each this thought make he continuance in the trade for one voyage longer more reconcilable but he add as if not quite satisfied cruel necessity and he fetch a deep sigh we take we leave and depart the one a few minute after the other the conversation of this young man be very interesting i be much impressed both by the nature and the manner of it i wish to secure he if possible as a evidence for parliament and thus save he from he approach voyage : but i know not what to do at first i think it would be easy to raise a subscription to set he up but then i be aware that this might be consider as bribery and make he testimony worth nothing i then think that the committee might detain he as a evidence and pay he in a reasonable manner for he sustenance till he testimony should be call for but i do not know how long it would be before he examination might take place it might be a year or two i foresee other difficulty also and i be oblige to relinquish what otherwise i should have deem a prize on review the conversation which have pass between we after my return home i think consider the friendly disposition of gardiner towards we i have not do all i could for the cause and communicate my feeling to walter chandler he procure I another interview at this i ask he if he would become a evidence if he live to return he reply very heartily that he would i then ask he if he would keep a journal of fact during he voyage as it would enable he to speak more correctly in case he should be call upon for he testimony he assure I he would and that he would make up a little book for that purpose i ask he lastly when he mean to sail he say as soon as the ship could get all she hand it be they intention to sail to-morrow but that seven man whom the mate have bring drunk out of marsh-street the evening before be so terrify when they find they be go to africa that they have seize the boat that morning and have put themselves on shore i take my leave of he entreat he to follow he resolution of kindness both to the sailor and the slave and wish he a speedy and a safe return on go one day by the exchange after this interview with gardiner i overheard a young gentleman say to another that it happen on the coast last year and that he see it i wish to know who he be and to get at he if i could i watch he at a distance for more than half a hour when i see he leave he companion i follow he till he enter a house i then consider whether it would be proper and in what manner to address he when he should come out of it but i wait three hour and i never see he i then conclude that he either lodge where i see he enter or that he have go to dine with some friend i therefore take notice of the house and show it afterwards to several of my friend desire they to make he out for I in a day or two i have a interview with he he name be jame arnold he have be two voyage to the coast of africa for slave one as a surgeon 's mate in the alexander in the year 1785 and the other as surgeon in the little pearl in the year 1786 from which he have not then very long return i ask he if he be willing to give I any account of these voyage for that i be make a inquiry into the nature of the slave trade he reply he know that i be he have be caution about fall in with I he have however take no pain to avoid I it be a bad trade and ought to be expose i go over the same ground as i have go with gardiner relative to the first of these voyage or that in the alexander it be not necessary to detail the particulars it be impossible however not to mention that the treatment of the seaman on board this vessel be worse than i have ever before hear of no less than eleven of they unable to bear they life have desert at bonny on the coast of africa -- which be a most unusual thing -- choose all that could be endure though in a most inhospitable climate and in the power of the native rather than to continue in they own ship nine other also in addition to the loss of these have die in the same voyage as to the rest he believe without any exception that they have be badly use in examine he with respect to he second voyage or that in the little pearl two circumstance come out with respect to the slave which i shall relate in few word the chief mate use to beat the men-slave on very trifling occasion about eleven one evening the ship then lie off the coast he hear a noise in they room he jump down among they with the lanthorn in he hand two of those who have be ill-use by he force themselves out of they iron and seize he strike he with the bolt of they and it be with some difficulty that he be extricate from they by the crew the men-slaves unable now to punish he and find they have create a alarm begin to proceed to extremity they endeavor to force themselves up the grating and to pull down a partition which have be make for a sick-birth when they be fire upon and repress the next morning they be bring up one by one when it appear that a boy have be kill who be afterwards throw into the sea the two man however who have force themselves out of iron do not come up with the rest but find they way into the hold and armed themselves with knife from a cask which have be open for trade one of they be call to in the african tongue by a black trader who be then on board come up but with a knife in each hand when one of the crew suppose he yet hostile shot he in the right side and kill he on the spot the other remain in the hold for twelve hour scalding water mix with fat be pour down upon he to make he come up though he flesh be painfully blister by these means he keep below a promise be then make to he in the african tongue by the same trader that no injury should be do he if he would come among they to this at length he consent but on observe when he be about half way up that a sailor be arm between deck he fly to he and clasp he and throw he down the sailor fire he pistol in the scuffle but without effect he contrived however to fracture he skull with the butt end of it so that the slave die on the third day the second circumstance take place after the arrival of the same vessel at st vincent 's there be a boy-slave on board who be very ill and emaciate the mate who by he cruelty have be the author of the former mischief do not choose to expose he to sale with the rest lest the small sum he would fetch in that situation should lower the average price and thus bring down -lrb- a -rrb- the value of the privilege of the officer of the ship this boy be keep on board and no provision allow he -lrb- footnote a : officer be say to be allow the privilege of one or more slave accord to they rank when the cargo be sell the sum total fetch be put down and this be divide by the number of slave sell give the average price of each such officer then receive this average price for one or more slave accord to they privilege but never the slave themselves -rrb- the mate have suggest the propriety of throw he overboard but no one would do it on the ninth day he expire have never be allow any sustenance during that time i ask mr arnold if he be willing to give evidence of these fact in both case he say he have only one objection which be that in two or three day he be to go in the ruby on he third voyage : but on leave I he say that he would take a affidavit before the mayor of the truth of any of those thing which he have relate to I if that would do but from motive of safety he should not choose to do this till within a few hour before he sail in two or three day after this he send for I he say the ruby would leave king-road the next day and that he be ready to do as he have promise deposition be accordingly make out from he own word i go with he to the residence of george daubeny esq who be then chief magistrate of the city and they be swear to in he presence and witness as the law require on take my leave of he i ask he how he could go a third time in such a barbarous employ he say he have be distressed in he voyage in the alexander he have make nothing for he have be so ill-used that he have solicit he discharge in grenada where be pay in currency he have but little to receive when he arrive in bristol from that island he be quite penniless and find the little pearl go out he be glad to get on board she as she surgeon which he then do entirely for the sake of bread he say moreover that she be but a small vessel and that he savings have be but small in she this occasion he to apply for the ruby he present ship but if he survive this voyage he would never go another i then put the same question to he as to gardiner and he promise to keep a journal of fact and to give he evidence if call upon on he return the reader will see from this account the difficulty i have in procure evidence from this port the owner of vessel employ in the trade there forbid all intercourse with I the old captain who have make they fortune in it would not see I the young who be make they could not be suppose to espouse my cause to the detriment of they own interest of those whose necessity make they go into it for a livelihood i could not get one to come forward without do so much for he as would have amount to bribery thus when i get one of these into my possession i be oblige to let he go again i be however greatly console by the consideration that i have procure two sentinel to be station in the enemy 's camp who keep a journal of different fact would bring I some important intelligence at a future period chapter xvi author go to monmouth confer relative to a petition from that place return to bristol be introduce to alexander falconbridge take one of the mate of the africa out of that ship visit disabled seaman from the ship thoma put a chief mate into prison for the murder of william line -- ill-usage of seaman in various other slave-vessel secure crutwell 's bath paper in favor of the abolition lay the foundation of a committee at bristol and of a petition from thence also take he leave of that city by this time i begin to feel the effect of my labor upon my constitution it have be my practice to go home in the evening to my lodgings about twelve o'clock and then to put down the occurrence of the day this usually keep I up till one and sometimes till nearly two in the morning when i go my round in marsh-street i seldom get home till two and into bed till three my clothes also be frequently wet through with the rain the cruel account i be daily in the habit of hear both with respect to the slave and to the seaman employ in this wicked trade from which indeed my mind have no respite often break my sleep in the night and occasion I to awake in a agitate state all these circumstance concur in affect my health i look thin my countenance become yellow i have also rheumatic feeling my friend see this prevail upon I to give myself two or three day ' relaxation and as a gentleman of whom i have some knowledge be go into carmarthenshire i accompany he as far as monmouth after we parting at this place i become restless and uneasy and long to get back to my work i think however my journey ought not to be wholly useless to the cause and hearing that dr davi a clergyman at monmouth be a man of considerable weight among the inhabitant i take the liberty of write he a letter in which i state who i be and the way in which i have lately employ myself and the great wish i have to be favor with a interview with he and i do not conceal that it would be very desirable if the inhabitant of the place could have that information on the subject which would warrant they in so do that they should petition the legislature for the abolition of the slave trade dr davi return I a answer and receive I the question which he put to I be judicious he ask I first whether if the slave be emancipate there would not be much confusion in the island i tell he that the emancipation of they be no part of we plan we solicit nothing but the stop of all future importation of they into the island he then ask what the planter would do for labourer i reply they would find sufficient from a increase of the native population if they be oblige to pay attention to the latter means we discourse a long time upon this last topic i have not room to give the many other question he propose to I : no one be ever more judiciously question in my turn i put he into possession of all the discovery i have make he acknowledge the injustice of the trade he confess also that my conversation have enlighten he as to the impolicy of it and take some of my _ summary view _ to distribute he say he hope that the inhabitant would after the perusal of they accede to my request on my return to bristol my friend have procure for I a interview with mr alexander falconbridge who have be to the coast of africa as a surgeon for four voyage one in the tartar another in the alexander and two in the emilium slave-vessel on my introduction to he i ask he if he have any objection to give I a account of the cruelty which be say to be connect with the slave trade he answer without any reserve that he have not for that he have now do with it never be any word more welcome to my ear than these : yes -- i have do with the trade -- and he say also that he be free to give I information concern it be he not then one of the very person whom i have so long be seek but in vain to detail the account which he give I at this and at subsequent interview relative to the different branch of this trade would fill no ordinary volume suffice it to say in general term as far as relate to the slave that he confirm the various violent and treacherous method of procure they in they own country they wretched condition in consequence of be crowd together in the passage they attempt to rise in defense of they own freedom and when this be impracticable to destroy themselves by the refusal of sustenance by jump overboard into the sea and in other way the effect also of they situation upon they mind by produce insanity and various disease and the cruel manner of dispose of they in the west indy and of separate relative and friend with respect to the seaman employ in this trade he commend captain frazer for he kind usage to they under whom he have so long serve the handsome way in which he speak of the latter pleased I much because i be willing to deduce from it he own impartiality and because i think i might infer from it also he regard to truth as to other part of he narrative indeed i have be before acquaint with this circumstance thompson of the seven star have inform I that frazer be the only man sailing out of that port for slave who have not be guilty of cruelty to he seaman : and mr burge allude to it when he give I advice not to proceed against the captain of the alfr for he then say as i mention in a former chapter that he know but one captain in the trade who do not deserve long ago to be hang mr falconbridge however state that though he have be thus fortunate in the tartar and emilium he have be as unfortunate in the alexander for he believe there be no instance upon naval record take altogether of greater barbarity than of that which have be exercise towards the seaman in this voyage in run over these it strike I that i have hear of the same from some other quarter or at least that these be so like the other that i be surprise at they coincidence on take out my note i look for the name of those whom i recollect to have be use in this manner and on desire mr falconbridge to mention the name of those also to whom he allude they turn out to be the same the mystery however be soon clear up when i tell he from whom i have receive my intelligence : for mr arnold the last-mentioned person in the last chapter have be surgeon 's mate under mr falconbridge in the same vessel there be one circumstance of peculiar importance but quite new to I which i collect from the information which mr falconbridge have give I this be that many of the seaman who leave the slave-ship in the west indy be in such a weak ulcerated and otherwise diseased state that they perish there several also of those who come home with the vessel be in the same deplorable condition this be the case mr falconbridge say with some who return in the alexander it be the case also with many other for he have be a pupil for twelve month in the bristol infirmary and have have ample means of know the fact the greatest number of seaman at almost all time who be there be from the slave-vessel these too be usually there on account of disease whereas those from other ship be usually there on account of accident the health of some of the former be so far destroy that they be never wholly to be restore this information be of great importance for it show that they who be report dead upon the muster-roll be not all that be lose to the country by the prosecution of this wicked trade indeed it be of so much importance that in all my future interview with other which be for the purpose of collect evidence i never forget to make it a subject of inquiry i can hardly say how precious i consider the fact with which mr falconbridge have furnish I from he own experience relative to the different branch of this commerce they be so precious that i begin now to be trouble lest i should lose they for though he have thus privately unbosomed himself to I it do not follow that he would come forward as a public evidence i be not a little uneasy on this account i be fearful lest when i should put this question to he he future plan of life or some little narrow consideration of future interest would prevent he from give he testimony and i delay ask he for many day during this time however i frequently visit he and at length when i think i be better acquaint and probably in some little estimation with he i venture to open my wish on this subject he answer I boldly and at once that he have leave the trade upon principle and that he would state all he know concern it either publicly or privately and at any time when he should be call upon to do it this answer produce such a effect upon I after all my former disappointment that i feel it all over my frame it operate like a sudden shock which often disable the impressed person for a time so the joy i feel render I quite useless as to business for the remainder of the day i begin to perceive in a little time the advantage of have cultivate a acquaintance with thompson of the seven star for nothing could now pass in bristol relative to the seaman employ in this trade but it be soon bring to I if there be anything amiss i have so arrange matter that i be sure to hear of it he send for I one day to inform I that several of the seaman who have be send out of marsh street into the prince which be then at kingroad and on the point of sailing to africa for slave have through fear of ill usage on the voyage take the boat and put themselves on shore he inform I at the same time that the seaman of the africa which be lie there also and ready to sail on a like voyage be not satisfy for that they have be make to sign they article of agreement without be permit to see they to this he add that mr sheriff one of the mate of the latter vessel be unhappy also on this account sheriff have be a mate in the west indium trade and be a respectable man in he line he have be entice by the captain of the africa under the promise of peculiar advantage to change he voyage have a wife and family at bristol he be willing to make a sacrifice on they account : but when he himself be not permit to read the article he begin to suspect bad work and that there would be nothing but misery in the approach voyage thompson entreat I to extricate he if i could he be sure he say if he go to the coast with that man mean the captain that he would never return alive i be very unwilling to refuse anything to thompson i be deeply bind to he in gratitude for the many service he have render I but i scarcely see how i could serve he on this occasion i promise however to speak to he in a hour 's time i consult my friend truman harford in the interim and the result be that he and i should proceed to kingroad in a boat go on board the africa and charge the captain in person with what he have do and desire he to discharge sheriff as no agreement where fraud or force be use in the signature could be deem valid if we be not able to extricate sheriff by these means we think that at least we should know by inquire of those whom we should see on board whether the measure of hinder the man from see they article on sign they have be adopt it would be useful to ascertain this because such a measure have be long report to be usual in this but be say to be unknown in any other trade have pass the river 's mouth and row towards the sea we come near the prince first but pursue we destination to the africa mr sheriff be the person who receive we on board i do not know he till i ask he name i then tell he my errand with which he seem to be much pleased on ask he to tell the captain that i wish to speak with he he reply that he be on shore this put I to great difficulty as i do not know then what to do i consult with truman harford and it be we opinion that we should inquire of the seaman but in a very quiet manner by go individually to each if they have ever demand to see the article on sign they and if they have be refuse we propose this question to they they reply that the captain have refuse they in a savage manner make use of threat and oath there be not one contradictory voice on this occasion we then ask mr sheriff what we be to do he entreat we by all means to take he on shore he be sure that under such a man as the captain and particularly after the circumstance of we come on board should be make know to he he would never come from the coast of africa alive upon this truman harford call I aside and tell I the danger of take a officer from the ship for that if any accident should happen to she the damage might all fall upon I i then inquire of mr sheriff if there be any officer on board who could manage the ship he point one out to I and i speak to he in the cabin this person tell I i need be under no apprehension about the vessel but that every one would be sorry to lose mr sheriff upon this ground truman harford who have feel more for I than for himself become now easy we have before conclude that the obtain any signature by fraud or force would render the agreement illegal we therefore join in opinion that we might take away the man he chest be accordingly put into we boat we jump into it with we rower and he follow we surround by the seaman all of whom take a affectionate leave of he and express they regret at parting soon after this there be a general cry of will you take I too from the deck and such a sudden movement appear there that we be oblige to push off directly from the side fear that many would jump into we boat and go with we after have leave the ship sheriff corroborate the desertion of the seaman from the prince as before relate to I by thompson he speak also of the savage disposition of he late captain which he have even dare to manifest through lie in a english port i be impress by this account of he rough manners and the wind have rise before and the surf now roll heavily i begin to think what a escape i might have have how easy it would have be for the savage captain if he have be on board or for any one at he instigation to have push I over the ship 's side this be the first time i have ever consider the peril of the undertaking but we arrive safe and though on the same evening i leave my name at the captain 's house as that of the person who have take away he mate i never hear more about it in pursue my inquiry into the new topic suggest by mr falconbridge i learn that two or three of the seaman of the ship thoma which have arrive now nearly a year from the coast be in a very cripple and deplorable state i accordingly go to see they one of they have be attack by a fever arise from circumstance connect with these voyage the inflammation which have proceed from it have reach he eye it could not be disperse and the consequence be that he be then blind the second be lame he have badly ulcerated leg and appear to be very weak the third be a mere spectre i think he be the most pitiable object i ever see i consider he as irrecoverably go they all complain to I of they bad usage on board the thoma they say they have hear of my be in bristol and they hope i would not leave it without inquire into the murder of william line on inquire who william line be they inform I that he have be one of the crew of the same ship and that all on board believe that he have be kill by the chief mate but they themselves have not be present when the blow be give he they have not see he till afterwards but they shipmate have tell they of he cruel treatment and they know that soon afterwards he have die in the course of the next day the mother of line who live in bristol come to I and related the case i tell she there be no evidence as to the fact for that i have see three seaman who could not speak to it from they own knowledge she say there be four other then in bristol who could i desire she to fetch they when they arrive i examine each separately and cross-examine they in the best manner i be able i could find no variation in they account and i be quite convinced that the murder have take place the mother be then importunate that i should take up the case i be too much affect by the narration i have hear to refuse she wholly and yet i do not promise that i would i begged a little time to consider of it during this i thought of consult my friend burge but i fear he would throw cold water upon it as he have do in the case of the captain of the alfred i remember well what he have then say to I and yet i feel a strong disposition to proceed for the trade be still go on every day perhaps some new act of barbarity be take place and one example if make might counteract the evil for a time i seem therefore to incline to stir in this matter and think if i should get into any difficulty about it it would be better to do it without consult mr burge than after have do it to fly as it be in he face i then send for the woman and tell she that she might appear with the witness at the common hall where the magistrate usually sit on a certain day we all meet at the time appoint and i determine to sit as near to the mayor as i could get the hall be unusually crowd one or two slave-merchant and two or three other who be largely concern in the west indium trade be upon the bench for i have inform the mayor the day before of my intention and he it appear have inform they i shall never forget the savage look which these people give I which indeed be so remarkable as to occasion the eye of the whole court to be turn upon I they look as if they be go to speak to I and the people look as if they expect I to say something in return they then get round the mayor and begin to whisper to he as i suppose on the business before it should come on one of they however say aloud to the former but fix he eye upon I and wish I to overhear he scandalous report have lately be spread but sailor be not use worse in guineaman than in other vessel this bring the people 's eye upon I again i be very much irritated but i think it improper to say anything another look savagely at I say to the mayor that he have know captain vicar a long time that he be a honorable man -lrb- a -rrb- and would not allow such usage in he ship there be always vagabond to hatch up thing and he make a dead point at I by put himself into a posture which attract the notice of those present and by stare I in the face i could now no longer restrain myself and i say aloud in as modest manner as i could you sir may know many thing which i do not but this i know that if you do not do you duty you be amenable to a higher court the mayor upon this look at I and directly my friend mr burge who be sit as the clerk to the magistrate go to he and whisper something in he ear after which all private conversation between the mayor and other cease and the hearing be order to come on -lrb- footnote a : we may well imagine what this person 's notion of another man 's honor be for he be the purser of the brother and of the alfr who as before mention send the captain of those ship out a second voyage after know they barbarity in the former and he be also the purser of this very ship thoma where the murder have be commit i by no means however wish by these observation to detract from the character of captain vicar as he have no concern in the cruel deed -rrb- i shall not detain the reader by give a account of the evidence which then transpire the four witness be examine and the case be so far clear captain vicar however be send for on be question he do not deny that there have be bad usage but say that the young man have die of the flux but this assertion go for nothing when balance against the fact which have come out and this be so evident that a order be make out for the apprehension of the chief mate he be accordingly take up the next day however there be a rehearing of the case when he be return to the gaol where he be to lie till the lord of the admiralty should order a session to be hold for the trial of offence commit on the high sea this public examination of the case of william line and the way in which it end produce a extraordinary result for after this time the slave-captain and mate who use to meet I suddenly use as suddenly to start from I indeed to the other side of the pavement as if i have be a wolf or tiger or some dangerous beast of prey such of they as saw I beforehand use to run up the cross street or lane which be nearest to they to get away seamen too come from various quarter to apply to I for redress one come to I who have be treat ill in the alexander when mr falconbridge have be the surgeon of she three come to I who have be ill-used in the voyage which follow though she have then sail under a new captain two apply to I from the africa who have be of she crew in the last voyage two from the fly two from the wasp one from the little pearl and three from the pilgrim or princess when she be last upon the coast the different scene of barbarity which these represent to I greatly add to the affliction of my mind my feeling become now almost insupportable i be agonize to think that this trade should last another day i be in a state of agitation from morning till night i determine i would soon leave bristol i see nothing but misery in the place i have collect now i believe all the evidence it would afford and to stay in it a day longer than be necessary would be only a interruption for so much time both of my happiness and of my health i determine therefore to do only two or three thing which i think to be proper and to depart in a few day and first i go to bath where i endeavor to secure the respectable paper belong to that city in favor of the abolition of the slave trade this i do entirely to my satisfaction by relate to the worthy editor all the discovery i have make and by impress he mind in a forcible manner on the subject and it be highly to the honor of mr crutwell that from that day he never cease to defend we cause that he never make a charge for insertion of any kind but that he consider all he do upon this occasion in the light of a duty or as he mite give in charity to a poor and oppressed people the next attempt be to lay the foundation of a committee in bristol and of a petition to parliament from it for the abolition of the slave trade i have now make many friend a gentleman of the name of paynter have feel himself much interested in my labor mr joseph harford a man of fortune of great respectability of character and of considerable influence have attach himself to the cause dr fox have assist I in it mr hughe a clergyman of the baptist church be anxious and ready to serve it dr camplin of the establishment with several of he friend continue steady matthew wright jame harford truman harford and all the quaker to a man be strenuous and this on the best of principle in its support to all these i speak and i have the pleasure of see that my wish be likely in a short time to be gratify in both these case it be now necessary that i should write to the committee in london i have write to they only two letter during my absence for i have devote myself so much to the great object i have undertake that i could think of little else hence some of my friend among they be oblige to write to different person at bristol to inquire if i be alive i give up a day or two therefore to this purpose i inform the committee of all my discovery in the various branch to which my attention have be direct and desire they in return to procure I various official document for the port of london which i then specify have do this i confer with mr falconbridge relative to be with I at liverpool i think it right to make he no other offer than that he expense should be pay he accede to my request on these disinterested term and i take my departure from bristol leave he to follow I in a few day chapter xvii author secure the gloucester paper and lay the foundation of a petition from that city do the same at worcester and at chester -- arrive at liverpool -- collect specimen of african produce also import and export and muster-roll and account of dock duty and iron instrument use in the slave trade -- he introduction to mr norri and other -- author and he errand become know -- people visit he out of curiosity -- frequent controversy on the subject of the slave trade on my arrival at gloucester i wait upon my friend dean tucker he be please to hear of the great progress i have make since he leave I on communicate to he my intention of make interest with the editor of some provincial papers to enlighten the public mind and with the inhabitant of some respectable place for petition to parliament relative to the abolition of the slave trade he approve of it and introduce I to mr raike the proprietor of the respectable paper belong to that city mr raike acknowledge without any hesitation the pleasure he should have in serve such a noble cause and he promise to grant I from time to time a corner in he paper for such thing as i might point out to he for insertion this promise he perform afterwards without any pecuniary consideration and solely on the ground of benevolence he promise also he assistance as to the other object for the promotion of which i leave he several of my _ summary view _ to distribute at worcester i trod over the same ground and with the same success timothy bevington of the religious society of the quaker be the only person to whom i have a introduction there : he accompany I to the mayor to the editor of the worcester paper and to several other before each of whom i plead the cause of the oppressed african in the best manner i be able i dilated both on the inhumanity and on the impolicy of the trade which i support by the various fact recently obtain at bristol i desire however as far as petition be concern -lrb- and this desire i express on all other similar occasion -rrb- that no attempt should be make to obtain these till such information have be circulate on the subject that every one when call upon might judge from he knowledge of it how far he would feel it right to join in it for this purpose i leave also here several of my _ summary view _ for distribution after my arrival at chester i go to the bishop 's residence but i find he be not there know no other person in the place i write a note to mr cowdroy whom i understand to be the editor of the chester paper solicit a interview with he i explain my wish to he on both subject he seem to be greatly rejoice when we meet that such a measure as that of the abolition of the slave trade be in contemplation living at so short a distance from liverpool and in a country from which so many person be constantly go to africa he be by no means ignorant as some be of the nature of this cruel traffic but yet he have no notion that i have probe it so deeply or that i have bring to light such important circumstance concern it as he find by my conversation he make I a hearty offer of he service on this occasion and this expressly without fee or reward i accept they most joyfully and gratefully it be indeed a most important thing to have a station so near the enemy 's camp where we could watch they motion and meet any attack which might be make from it and this office of a sentinel mr cowdroy perform with great vigilance and when he afterwards leave chester for manchester to establish a paper there he carry with he the same friendly disposition towards we cause my first introduction at liverpool be to william rathbone a member of the religious society of the quaker he be the same person who before the formation of we committee have procure I copy of several of the muster-roll of the slave-vessel belong to that port so that though we be not personally know yet we be not stranger to each other isaac hadwen a respectable member of the same society be the person whom i see next i have be introduce to he previously to my journey when he be at london at the yearly meeting of the quaker so that no letter to he be necessary as mr roscoe have generally give the profit of _ the wrong of africa _ to we committee i make no scruple of call upon he he reception of I be very friendly and he introduce I afterwards to dr currie who have write the preface to that poem there be also a fourth upon whom i call though i do not know he he name be edward rushton : he have be a officer in a slave-ship but have lose he sight and have become a enemy to that trade on pass through chester i have hear for the first time that he have publish a poem call _ west indian eclogue _ with a view of make the public better acquaint with the evil of the slave trade and of exciting they indignation against it of the three last it may be observe that have come forward thus early as labourer they deserve to be put down as i have place they in the map among the forerunner and coadjutor in this great cause for each publish he work before any effort be make publicly or without know that any be intend rushton also have the boldness though then live in liverpool to affix he name to he work these be the only person whom i know for some time after my arrival in that place it may not perhaps be necessary to enter so largely into my proceedings at liverpool as at bristol the follow account therefore may suffice : -- in my attempt to add to my collection of specimen of african produce i be favor with a sample of gum ruber astringent of cotton from the gambium of indigo and musk of long pepper of black pepper from whidh of mahogany from calabar and of cloth of different color make by the native which while they give other proof of the quality of they own cotton give proof also of the variety of they dye i make interest at the custom-house for various export and import and for copy of the muster-roll of several slave-vessel besides those of vessel employ in other trade by look out constantly for information on this great subject i be lead to the examination of a print card or table of the dock duty of liverpool which be publish annually the town of liverpool have so rise in opulence and importance from only a fishing-village that the corporation seem to have a pride in give a public view of this increase hence they publish and circulate this card now the card contain one among other fact which be almost as precious in a political point of view as any i have yet obtain it state that in the year 1772 when i know that a hundred vessel sail out of liverpool for the coast of africa the dock-duty amount to 4552_l _ and that in 1779 when i know that in consequence of the war only eleven go from thence to the same coast they amount to 4957_l _ from these fact put together two conclusion be obvious the first be that the opulence of liverpool as far as the entry of vessel into its port and the dock-duty arise from thence be concern be not indebted to the slave trade for these duty be highest when it have only eleven ship in that employ the second be that there have be almost a practical experiment with respect to the abolition of it for the vessel in it have be gradually reduce from one hundred to eleven and yet the west indian have not complain of they ruin nor have the merchant or manufacturer suffer nor have liverpool be affect by the change there be specimen of article in liverpool which i entirely overlook at bristol and which i believe i should have overlook here also have it not be for see they at a window in a shop i mean those of different iron instrument use in this cruel traffic i buy a pair of the iron hand-cuff with which the men-slave be confine the right-hand wrist of one and the left of another be almost bring into contact by these and fasten together as the figure a in the annexed plate represent by a little bolt with a small padlock at the end of it -lrb- illustration : handcuffs -rrb- i buy also a pair of shackle for the leg these be represent by the figure b the right ancle of one man be fasten to the left of another as the reader will observe by similar means i buy these not because it be difficult to conceive how the unhappy victim of this execrable trade be confine but to show the fact that they be so for what be the inference from it but that they do not leave they own country willingly that when they be in the hold of the slave-vessel they be not in the elysium which have be represent and that there be a fear either that they would make they escape or punish they oppressor -lrb- illustration : shackle for the leg -rrb- i buy also a thumb-screw at this shop the thumb be put into this instrument through the two circular hole at the top of it by turn a key a bar rise up by means of a screw from c to d and the pressure upon they become painful by turn it further you may make the blood start from the end of they by take the key away as at e you leave the tortured person in agony without any means of extricate himself or of be extricate by other this screw as i be then inform be apply by way of punishment in case of obstinacy in the slave or for any other reputed offence at the discretion of the captain at the same place i buy another instrument which i see it be call a speculum ori the dot line in the figure on the right hand of the screw represent it when shut the black line when open it be open as at g h by a screw below with a nob at the end of it this instrument be know among surgeon have be invent to assist they in wrenching open the mouth as in the case of a lock jaw but it have get into use in this trade -lrb- illustration : thumb screw -rrb- -lrb- illustration : speculum ori -rrb- on ask the seller of the instrument on what occasion it be use there he reply that the slave be frequently so sulky as to shut they mouth against all sustenance and this with a determination to die and that it be necessary they mouth should be force open to throw in nutriment that they who have purchase they might incur no loss by they death the town-talk of liverpool be much of the same nature as that at bristol on the subject of this trade horrible fact concern it be in everybody 's mouth but they be more numerous as be likely to be the case where eighty vessel be employ from one port and only eighteen from the other the people too at liverpool seem to be more hardened or they relate they with more coldness or less feeling this may be account for from the greater number of those fact as just relate the mention of which as it be of course more frequent occasion they to lose they power of exciting surprise all this i think in my favor as i should more easily or with less obnoxiousness come to the knowledge of what i want to obtain my friend william rathbone who have be look out to supply I with intelligence but who be desirous that i should not be impose upon and that i should get it from the fountainhead introduce I to mr norri for this purpose norri have be formerly a slave-captain but have quit the trade and settle as a merchant in a different line of business he be a man of quick penetration and of good talent which he have cultivate to advantage and he have a please address both as to speech and manners he receive I with great politeness and offer I all the information i desire i be with he five or six time at he own house for this purpose the substance of he communication on these occasion i shall now put down and i beg the reader 's particular attention to it as he will be refer to it in other part of this work with respect to the produce of africa mr norri enumerate many article in which a new and valuable trade might be open of which he give I one namely the black pepper from whidh before mention this he give I to use he own expression as one argument among many other of the impolicy of the slave trade which by turn the attention of the inhabitant to the person of one another for sale hinder foreigner from discover and themselves from cultivate many of the valuable production of they own soil on the subject of procure slave he give it as he decide opinion that many of the inhabitant of africa be kidnap by each other as they be travel on the road or fishing in the creek or cultivate they little spot have learn they language he have collect the fact from various quarter but more particularly from the account of slave whom he have transport in he own vessel with respect however to whidh many come from thence who be reduce to slavery in a different manner the king of dahomey whose life -lrb- with the war and custom of the dahoman -rrb- he say he be then write and who be a very despotic prince make no scruple of seize he own subject and of sell they if he be in want of any of the article which the slave-vessel would afford he the history of this prince 's life he lend I afterwards to read while it be yet in manuscript in which i observe that he have record all the fact now mention indeed he make no hesitation to state they either when we be by ourselves or when other be in company with we he repeat they at one time in the presence both of mr cruden and mr coupland the latter be then a slave-merchant at liverpool he seem to be fire at the relation of these circumstance unable to restrain himself longer he enter into a defense of the trade both as to the humanity and the policy of it but mr norris take up he argument in both these case and answer they in a solid manner with respect to the slave trade as it affect the health of we seaman mr norri admit it to be destructive but i do not stand in need of this information as i know this part of the subject in consequence of my familiarity with the muster-roll better than himself he admit it also to be true that they be too frequently ill-treated in this trade a day or two after we conversation on this latter subject he bring I the manuscript journal of a voyage to africa which have be keep by a mate with whom he be then acquaint he bring it to I to read as it might throw some light upon the subject on which we have talk last in this manuscript various instance of cruel usage towards seaman be put down from which it appear that the mate who write it have not escape himself at the last interview we have he seem to be so satisfied of the inhumanity injustice and impolicy of the trade that he make I a voluntary offer of certain clause which he have be think of and which he believe if put into a act of parliament would judiciously effect its abolition the offer of these clause i embrace eagerly he dictate they and i write i write they in a small book which i have then in my pocket they be these : -- no vessel under a heavy penalty to supply foreigner with slave every vessel to pay to government a tax for a register on clear out to supply we own island with slave every such vessel to be prohibit from purchase or bring home any of the production of africa every such vessel to be prohibit from bring home a passenger or any article of produce from the west indy a bounty to be give to every vessel trading in the natural production of africa this bounty to be pay in part out of the tax arise from the register of the slave-vessel certain establishment to be make by government in africa in the banana in the isle de lo on the bank of the camaranca and in other place for the encouragement and support of the new trade to be substitute there such then be the service which mr norri at the request of william rathbone render I at liverpool during my stay there and i have be very particular in detail they because i shall be oblige to allude to they as i have before observe on some important occasion in a future part of the work on go my round one day i meet accidentally with captain chaffer this gentleman either be or have be in the west indium employ he heart have beat in sympathy with mine and he have greatly favor we cause he have see I at mr norri 's and learn my errand there he tell I he could introduce I in a few minute as we be then near at hand to captain lace if i choose it captain lace he say have be long in the slave trade and could give I very accurate information about it i accept he offer on talk to captain lace relative to the production of africa he tell I that mahogany grow at calabar he begin to describe a tree of that kind which he have see there this tree be from about eighteen inch to two foot in diameter and about sixty foot high or as he express it of the height of a tall chimney as soon as he mention calabar a kind of horror come over I he name become directly associate in my mind with the place it almost instantly occur to I that he command the edgar out of liverpool when the dreadful massacre there as have be related take place indeed i seem to be so confident of it that attend more to my feeling than to my reason at this moment i accuse he with be concern in it this produce great confusion among we for he look incense at captain chaffer as if he have introduce I to he for this purpose captain chaffer again seem to be all astonishment that i should have know of this circumstance and to be vex that i should have mention it in such a manner i be also in a state of tremble myself captain lace could only say it be a bad business but he never defend himself nor those concern in it and we soon part to the great joy of we all soon after this interview i begin to perceive that i be know in liverpool as well as the object for which i come mr coupland the slave-merchant with whom i have dispute at mr norri 's house have give the alarm to those who be concern in the trade and captain lace as may be now easily imagine have spread it this knowledge of I and of my errand be almost immediately productive of two effect the first of which i shall now mention i have a private room at the king 's arm tavern besides my bed-room where i use to meditate and to write but i generally dine in public the company at dinner have hitherto varied but little as to number and consist of those both from the town and country who have be accustom to keep up a connexion with the house but now thing be alter and many people come to dine there daily with a view of see I as if i have be some curious creature import from foreign part they think also they could thus have a opportunity of converse with I slave-merchant and slave-captain come in among other for this purpose i have observe this difference in the number of we company for two or three day dale the master of the tavern have observe it also and tell I in a good-natured manner that many of these be my visitor and that i be likely to bring he a great deal of custom in a little time however thing become serious for they who come to see I always start the abolition of the slave trade as the subject for conversation many enter into the justification of this trade with great warmth as if to ruffle my temper or at any rate to provoke I to talk other throw out with the same view that man be go about to abolish it who would have do much better if they have stay at home other say they have hear of a person turn mad who have conceive the thought of destroy liverpool and all its glory some give as a toast success to the trade and then laugh immoderately and watch I when i take my glass to see if i would drink it i see the way in which thing be now go and i believe it would be proper that i should come to some fix resolution such as whether i should change my lodgings and whether i should dine in private and if not what line of conduct it would become I to pursue on such occasion with respect to change my lodgings and dining in private i conceive if i be to do either of these thing that i should be show a unmanly fear of my visiter which they would turn to they own advantage i conceive too that if i choose to go on as before and to enter into conversation with they on the subject of the abolition of the slave trade i might be able by have such a assemblage of person daily to gather all the argument which they could collect on the other side of we question a advantage which i should one day feel in the future management of the cause with respect to the line which i should pursue in the case of remain in the place of my abode and in my former habit i determine never to start the subject of the abolition myself -- never to abandon it when start -- never to defend it but in a serious and dignified manner -- and never to discover any sign of irritation whatever provocation might be give I by this determination i abide rigidly the king 's arm become now daily the place for discussion on this subject many try to insult I but to no purpose in all these discussion i find the great advantage of have bring mr falconbridge with I from bristol for he be always at the table and when my opponent with a disdainful look try to ridicule my knowledge among those present by ask I if i have ever be on the coast of africa myself he use generally to reply but i have i know all you proceedings there and that he statement be true these and other word put in by he who be a athletic and resolute-looking man be of great service to I all disinterested person of whom there be four or five daily in the room be uniformly convince by we argument and take we part and some of they very warmly day after day we beat we opponent out of the field as many of the company acknowledge to they no small notification in they presence thus while we serve the cause by discover all that could be say against it we serve it by give numerous individual proper idea concern it and of interesting they in we favor the second effect which i experience be that from this time i could never get any one to come forward as a evidence to serve the cause there be i believe hundred of person in liverpool and in the neighborhood of it who have be concern in this traffic and who have leave it all of whom could have give such testimony concern it as would have insure its abolition but none of they would now speak out of these indeed there be some who be alive to the horror of it and who lament that it should still continue but yet even these be backward in support I all that they do be just privately to see I to tell I that i be right and to exhort I to persevere : but as to come forward to be examine publicly my object be so unpopular and would become so much more so when bring into parliament that they would have they house pull down if they should then appear as public instrument in the annihilation of the trade with this account i be oblige to rest satisfied nor could i deny when i consider the spirit which have manifest itself and the extraordinary number of interested person in the place that they have some reason for they fear and that these fear be not groundless appear afterwards for dr binn a respectable physician belong to the religious society of the quaker and to whom isaac hadwen have introduce I be near fall into a mischievous plot which have be lay against he because he be one of the subscriber to the institution for the abolition of the slave trade and because he be suspect of have aid I in promote that object chapter xviii hostile disposition towards the author increase on account of he known patronage of the seaman employ in the slave trade manner of procure and pay they at liverpool they treatment and mortality -- account of the murder of peter green trouble take by the author to trace it he narrow escape -- go to lancaster but return to liverpool leave the latter place it have appear that a number of person use to come and see I out of curiosity at the king 's arm tavern and that these manifest a bad disposition towards I which be near break out into open insult now the cause of all this be as i have observe the knowledge which people have obtain relative to my errand at this place but this hostile disposition be increase by another circumstance which i be now to mention i have be so shocked at the treatment of the seaman belong to the slave-vessel at bristol that i determine on my arrival at liverpool to institute a inquiry concern it there also i have make considerable progress in it so that few seaman be land from such vessel but i have some communication with they and though no one else would come near I to give I any information about the trade these be always forward to speak to I and to tell I they grievance if it be only with the hope of be able to get redress the consequence of this be that they use to come to the king 's arm tavern to see I hence one two and three be almost daily to be find about the door and this happen quite as frequently after the hostility just mention have show itself as before they therefore who come to visit I out of curiosity could not help see my sailor visiter and on inquire into they errand they become more than ever incense against I the first result of this increase hostility towards I be a application from some of they to the master of the tavern that he would not harbor I this he communicate to I in a friendly manner but he be by no means desirous that i should leave he on the other hand he hope i would stay long enough to accomplish my object i think it right however to take the matter into consideration and have canvass it i resolve to remain with he for the reason mention in the former chapter but that i might avoid do anything that would be injurious to he interest as well as in some measure avoid give unnecessary offence to other i take lodgings in williamson square where i retire to write and occasionally to sleep and to which place all seaman desirous of see I be refer hence i continue to get the same information as before but in a less obnoxious and injurious manner the history of the seaman employ in the slave-vessel belong to the port of liverpool i find to be similar to that of those from bristol they who go into this trade be of two class the first consist of those who be ignorant of it and to whom generally improper representation of advantage have be make for the purpose of entice they into it the second consist of those who by means of a regular system keep up by the mate and captain have be purposely bring by they landlord into distress from which they could only be extricate by go into this hateful employ how many have i see with tear in they eye put into boat and convey to vessel which be then lie at the black rock and which be only wait to receive they to sail away the manner of pay they in the currency of the island be the same as at bristol but this practice be not conceal at liverpool as it be at the former place the article of agreement be print so that all who choose to buy might read they at the same time it must be observe that seaman be never pay in this manner in any other employ and that the african wages though nominally higher for the sake of procure hand be thus make to be actually lower than in other trade the loss by death be so similar that it do not signify whether the calculation on a give number be make either at this or the other port i have however a better opportunity at this than i have at the other of know the loss as it related to those whose constitution have be ruin or who have be render incapable by disease of continue they occupation at sea for the slave-vessel which return to liverpool sail immediately into the dock so that i see at once they sickly and ulcerated crew the number of vessel too be so much greater from this than from any other port that they sick make a more conspicuous figure in the infirmary and they be see also more frequently in the street with respect to they treatment nothing could be worse it seem to I to be but one barbarous system from the begin to the end i do not say barbarous as if premeditated but it become so in consequence of the savage habit gradually form by a familiarity with miserable sight and with a course of action inseparable from the trade man in they first voyage usually dislike the traffic and if they be happy enough then to abandon it they usually escape the disease of a hardened heart but if they go a second and a third time they disposition become gradually change it be impossible for they to be accustom to carry away man and woman by force to keep they in chain to see they tear to hear they mournful lamentation to behold the dead and the die to be oblige to keep up a system of severity amidst all this affliction -- in short it be impossible for they to be witness and this for successive voyage to the complicated mass of misery passing in a slave-ship without lose they finer feeling or without contract those habit of moroseness and cruelty which would brutalize they nature now if we consider that person could not easily become captain -lrb- and to these the barbarity be generally chargeable by actual perpetration or by consent -rrb- till they have be two or three voyage in this employ we shall see the reason why it would be almost a miracle if they who be thus employ in it be not rather to become monster than to continue to be man while i be at bristol i hear from a officer of the alfr who give I the intelligence privately that the steward of a liverpool ship whose name be green have be murder in that ship the alfr be in bonny river at the same time and he own captain -lrb- so infamous for he cruelty as have be before show -rrb- be on board when it happen the circumstance he say belong to this murder be if report be true of a most atrocious nature and deserve to be make the subject of inquiry as to the murder itself he observe it have pass as a notorious and uncontradicted fact this account be give I just as i have make a acquaintance with mr falconbridge and i inform he of it he say he have no doubt of its truth for in he last voyage he go to bonny himself where the ship be then lie in which the transaction happen : the king and several of the black trader tell he of it the report then current be simply this that the steward have be barbarously beat one evening that after this he be let down with chain upon he into a boat which be alongside of the ship and that the next morning he be find dead on my arrival at liverpool i resolve to inquire into the truth of this report on look into one of the wet dock i see the name of the vessel allude to i walk over the deck of several other and get on board she two people be walk up and down she and one be lean upon a rail by the side i ask the latter how many slave this ship have carry in she last voyage he reply he could not tell but one of the two person walk about could answer I as he have sail out and return in she this man come up to we and join in conversation he answer my question and many other and would have show I the ship but on ask he how many seaman have die on the voyage he change he manner and say with apparent hesitation that he could not tell i ask he next what have become of the steward green he say he believe he be dead i ask how the seaman have be use he say not worse than other i then ask whether green have be use worse than other he reply he do not then recollect i find that he be now quite upon he guard and as i could get no satisfactory answer from he i leave the ship on the next day i look over the muster-roll of this vessel on examine it i find that sixteen of the crew have die i find also the name of peter green i find again that the latter have be put down among the dead i observe also that the ship have leave liverpool on the 5th of June 1786 and have return on the 5th of June 1787 and that peter green be put down as have die on the 19th of September from all which circumstance it be evident that he must as my bristol informant assert have die upon the coast notwithstanding this extraordinary coincidence of name mortality time and place i could gain no further intelligence about the affair till within about ten day before i leave liverpool when among the seaman who come to apply to I in williamson square be george ormond he come to inform I of he own ill-usage from which circumstance i find that he have sail in the same ship with peter green this lead I to inquire into the transaction in question and i receive from he the follow account peter green have be ship as steward a black woman of the name of rodney go out in the same vessel she belong to the owner of it and be to be a interpretess to the slave who should be purchase about five in the evening some time in the month of September the vessel then lie in bonny river the captain as be he custom go on shore in he absence rodney the black woman ask green for the key of the pantry which he refuse she allege that the captain have already beat he for have give they to she on a former occasion when she drink the wine the woman be passionate strike he and a scuffle ensue out of which green extricate himself as well as he could when the scuffle be over the woman retire to the cabin and appear pensive between eight and nine in the evening the captain who be attend by the captain of the alfr come on board rodney immediately run to he and inform he that green have make a assault upon she the captain without any inquiry beat he severely and order he hand to be make fast to some bolt on the starboard side of the ship and under the half deck and then flog he himself use the lash of the cat-of-nine-tail upon he back at one time and the double walled knot at the end of it upon he head at another and stop to rest at interval and use each hand alternately that he might strike with the greater severity the pain have now become so very severe that green cry out and entreat the captain of the alfr who be stand by to pity he hard case and to intercede for he but the latter reply that he would have serve I in the same manner unable to find a friend here he call upon the chief mate but this only make matter worse for the captain then order the latter to flog he also which he do for some time use however only the lash of the instrument green then call in he distress upon the second mate to speak for he but the second mate be immediately order to perform the same cruel office and be make to persevere in it till the lash be all worn into thread but the barbarity do not close here for the captain on see the instrument now become useless order another with which he flog he as before beat he at time over the head with the double-walled knot and change he hand and cursing he own left hand for not be able to strike so severe a blow as he right the punishment as inflict by all party have now last two hour and a half when george ormond be order to cut down one of the arm and the boatswain the other from the place of they confinement this be do green lay motionless on the deck he attempt to utter something ormond understand it to be the word water but no water be allow he the captain on the other hand say he have not yet do with he and order he to be confine with he arm across he right hand to he left foot and he left hand to he right foot for this purpose the carpenter bring shackle and george ormond be compel to put they on the captain then order some tackle to be make fast to the limb of the say peter green in which situation he be then hoist up and afterwards let down into a boat which be lie alongside the ship michael cunningham be then send to loose the tackle and to leave he there in the middle watch or between one and two next morning george ormond look out of one of the port-hole and call to green but receive no answer between two and three paul berry a seaman be send down into the boat and find he dead he make he report to one of the officer of the ship about five in the morning the body be bring up and lay on the waist near the half-deck door the captain on see the body when he rise express no concern but order it to be knock out of iron and to be bury at the usual place of interment for seaman or bonny point i may now observe that the decease be in good health before the punishment take place and in high spirit for he play upon the flute only a short time before rodney ask he for the key while those seaman who be in health dance on hearing this cruel relation from george ormond who be throughout a material witness to the scene i have no doubt in my own mind of the truth of it but i think it right to tell he at once that i have see a person about four week ago who have be the same voyage with he and peter green but yet who have no recollection of these circumstance upon this he look quite astonished and begin to grow angry he maintain he have see the whole he have also hold the candle himself during the whole punishment he assert that one candle and half of another be burn out while it last he say also that while the body lay in the waist he have handle the abused part and have put three of he finger into a hole make by the double walled knot in the head from whence a quantity of blood and he believe brain issue he then challenge I to bring the man before he i desire he upon this to be cool and to come to I the next day and i would then talk with he again upon the subject in the interim i consult the muster-roll of the vessel again i find the name of george ormond he have sail in she out of liverpool and have be discharge at the latter end of January in the west indy as he have tell I i find also the name of michael cunningham and of paul berry whom he have mention it be obvious also that ormond 's account of the captain of the alfr be on board at the time of the punishment tally with that give I at bristol by a officer of that vessel and that he account of let down peter green into the boat tally with that which mr falconbridge as i mention before have hear from the king and the black trader in bonny river when he come to I next day he come in high spirit he say he have find out the man whom i have see the man however when he talk to he about the murder of peter green acknowledge every thing concern it ormond intimate that this man be to sail again in the same ship under the promise of be a officer and that he have be keep on board and have be entice to a second voyage for no other purpose than that he might be prevent from divulge the matter i then ask ormond whether he think the man would acknowledge the murder in my hearing he reply that if i be present he think he would not say much about it as he be soon to be under the same captain but that he would not deny it if however i be out of sight though i might be in hearing he believe he would acknowledge the fact by the assistance of mr falconbridge i find a public-house which have two room in it : nearly at the top of the partition between they be a small window which a person might look through by stand upon a chair i desire ormond one evening to invite the man into the larger room in which he be to have a candle and to talk with he on the subject i propose to station myself in the smallest in the dark so that by look through the window i could both see and hear he and yet be unperceived myself the room in which i be to be be one where the dead be frequently carry to be own we be all in we place at the time appoint i directly discover that it be the same man with whom i have converse on board the ship in the wet dock i hear he distinctly relate many of the particulars of the murder and acknowledge they all ormond after have talk with he some time say well then you believe peter green be actually murder he reply if peter green be not murder no man ever be what follow i do not know i have hear quite enough and the room be so disagreeable in smell that i do not choose to stay in it longer than be absolutely necessary i own i be now quite satisfied that the murder have take place and my first thought be to bring the matter before the mayor and to take up three of the officer of the ship but in mention my intention to my friend i be dissuade from it they have no doubt but that in liverpool as there be now a notion that the slave trade would become a subject of parliamentary inquiry every effort would be make to overthrow I they be of opinion also that such of the magistrate as be interested in the trade when apply to for warrant of apprehension would contrive to give notice to the officer to escape in addition to this they believe that so many in the town be already incense against I that i should be tear to piece and the house where i lodged burn down if i be to make the attempt i think it right therefore to do nothing for the present but i send ormond to london to keep he out of the way of corruption till i should make up my mind as to further proceedings on the subject it be impossible if i observe the bound i have prescribe myself and i believe the reader will be glad of it on account of he own feeling that i should lay open the numerous case which come before I at liverpool relative to the ill-treatment of the seaman in this wicked trade it may be sufficient to say that they harass my constitution and affect my spirit daily they be in my thought on my pillow after i retire to rest and i find they before my eye when i awake afflict however as they be they be of great use in the promotion of we cause : for they serve whatever else fail as a stimulus to perpetual energy : they make I think light of former labor and they urge I imperiously to new and here i may observe that among the many circumstance which ought to excite we joy on consider the great event of the abolition of the slave trade which have now happily take place there be few for which we ought to be more grateful than that from this time we commerce cease to breed such abandon wretch : while those who have thus be breed in it and who may yet find employment in other trade will in the common course of nature be take off in a give time so that we marine will at length be purify from a race of monster which have help to cripple its strength and to disgrace its character the temper of many of the interested people of liverpool have now become still more irritable and they hostility more apparent than before i receive anonymous letter entreat I to leave it or i should otherwise never leave it alive the only effect which this advice have upon I be to make I more vigilant when i go out at night i never stir out at this time without mr falconbridge and he never accompany I without be well arm of this however i know nothing until we have leave the place there be certainly a time when i have reason to believe that i have a narrow escape i be one day on the pier-head with many other look at some little boat below at the time of a heavy gale several person probably out of curiosity be hasten thither i have see all i intend to see and be depart when i notice eight or nine person make towards I i be then only about eight or nine yard from the precipice of the pier but go from it i expect that they would have divide to let I through they instead of which they close upon I and bear I back i be bear within a yard of the precipice when i discover my danger and perceive among they the murderer of peter green and two other who have insult I at the king 's arm it instantly strike I that they have a design to throw I over the pier-head which they might have do at this time and yet have plead that i have be kill by accident there be not a moment to lose vigorous on account of the danger i dart forward one of they against whom i push myself fall down : they rank be break and i escape not without blow amidst they imprecation and abuse i determine now to go to lancaster to make some inquiry about the slave trade there i have a letter of introduction to william jepson one of the religious society of the quaker for this purpose i find from he that though there be slave-merchant at lancaster they make they outfit at liverpool as a more convenient port i learn too from other that the captain of the last vessel which have sail out of lancaster to the coast of africa for slave have take off so many of the native treacherously that any other vessel know to come from it would be cut off there be only now one or two superannuated captain live in the place finding i could get no oral testimony i be introduce into the custom-house here i just look over the muster-roll of such slave-vessel as have formerly sail from this port and have find that the loss of seaman be precisely in the same proportion as elsewhere i give myself no further trouble but leave the place on my return to liverpool i be inform by mr falconbridge that a ship-mate of ormond of the name of patrick murray who have be discharge in the west indy have arrive there this man he say have be to call upon I in my absence to seek redress for he own bad usage but in the course of conversation he have confirm all the particulars as state by ormond relative to the murder of peter green on consult the muster-roll of the ship i find he name and that he have be discharge in the west indy on the 2nd of February i determine therefore to see he i cross-examine he in the best manner i could i could neither make he contradict himself nor say anything that militate against the testimony of ormond i be convinced therefore of the truth of the transaction and have obtain he consent i send he to london to stay with the latter till he should hear further from I i learn also from mr falconbridge that visitor have continue to come to the king 's arm during my absence that they have be very liberal of they abuse of I and that one of they do not hesitate to say -lrb- which be remarkable -rrb- that i deserve to be throw over the pierhead finding now that i could get no further evidence that the information which i have already obtain be considerable -lrb- a -rrb- and that the committee have express a earnest desire in a letter which i have receive that i would take into consideration the propriety of write my essay on the _ impolicy of the slave trade _ as soon as possible i determine upon leave liverpool -lrb- footnote a : in london bristol and liverpool i have already obtain the name of more than 20000 seaman in different voyage know what have become of each -rrb- i go round accordingly and take leave of my friend the last of these be william rathbone and i have to regret that it be also the last time i ever see he independently of the gratitude i owe he for assist I in this great cause i respect he highly as a man : he possess a fine understanding with a solid judgment : he be a person of extraordinary simplicity of manners though he live in a state of pecuniary independence he give a example of great temperance as well as of great humility of mind : but however humble he appear he have always the courage to dare to do that which be right however it might resist the custom or the prejudice of man in he own line of trade which be that of a timber-merchant on a extensive scale he would not allow any article to be sell for the use of a slave-ship and he always refuse those who apply to he for material for such purpose but it be evident that it be he intention if he have live to bear he testimony still more publicly upon this subject for a advertisement state the ground of he refusal to furnish anything for this traffic upon christian principle with a memorandum for two advertisement in the liverpool papers be find among he papers at he decease chapter xix author proceed to manchester find a spirit rise among the people there for the abolition of the slave trade be request to deliver a discourse on the subject of the slave trade head of it and extract -- proceeds to keddleston and birmingham find a similar spirit at the latter place -- revisit bristol new and difficult situation there -- author cross the severn at night unsuccessful termination of he journey return to london i now take my departure from liverpool and proceed to manchester where i arrive on the Friday evening on the Saturday morning mr thoma walker attend by mr cooper and mr bayley of hope call upon I they be then stranger to I they come they say have hear of my arrival to congratulate I on the spirit which be then begin to show itself among the people of manchester and of other place on the subject of the slave trade and which would unquestionably manifest itself further by break out into petition to parliament for its abolition i be much surprised at this information i have devote myself so entirely to my object that i have never have time to read a newspaper since i leave london i never know therefore till now that the attention of the public have be draw to the subject in such a manner and as to petition though i myself have suggest the idea at bridgewater bristol gloucester and two or three other place i have only do it provisionally and this without either the knowledge or the consent of the committee the news however as it astonish so it almost overpower I with joy i rejoice in it because it be a proof of the general good disposition of my countryman because it show I that the cause be such as need only to be know to be patronize and because the manifestation of this spirit seem to I to be a earnest that success would ultimately follow the gentleman now mention take I away with they and introduce I to mr thoma phillip we converse at first upon the discovery make in my journey but in a little time understand that i have be educate as a clergyman they come upon I with one voice as if it have be before agree upon to deliver a discourse the next day which be Sunday on the subject of the slave trade i be always aware that it be my duty to do all that i could with propriety to serve the cause i have undertake and yet i find myself embarrassed at they request foresee as i have before related that this cause might demand my attention to it for the greatest part of my life i have give up all thought of my profession i have hitherto but seldom exercise it and then only to oblige some friend i doubt too at the first view of the thing whether the pulpit ought to be make a engine for political purpose though i could not but consider the slave trade as a mass of crime and therefore the effort to get rid of it as a christian duty i have a idea too that sacred matter should not be enter upon without due consideration nor prosecute in a hasty but in a decorous and solemn manner i see besides that as it be then two o'clock in the afternoon and this sermon be to be forthcoming the next day there be not sufficient time to compose it properly all these difficulty i suggest to my new friend without any reserve but nothing that i could urge would satisfy they they would not hear of a refusal and i be oblige to give my consent though i be not reconcile to the measure when i go into the church it be so full that i could scarcely get to my place for notice have be publicly give though i know nothing of it that such a discourse would be deliver i be surprise also to find a great crowd of black people stand round the pulpit there might be forty or fifty of they the text that i take as the best to be find in such a hurry be the following : -- thou shalt not oppress a stranger for ye know the heart of a stranger see ye be stranger in the land of egypt i take a opportunity of show from these word that mose in endeavor to promote among the child of israel a tender disposition towards those unfortunate stranger who have come under they dominion remind they of they own state when stranger in egypt as one of the most forcible argument which could be use on such a occasion for they could not have forget that the egyptian have make they serve with rigor that they have make they life bitter with hard bondage in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field and that all the service wherein they make they serve be with rigor the argument therefore of mose be simply this : -- ye know well when ye be stranger in egypt the nature of you own feeling be you not make miserable by you debased situation there but if so you must be sensible that the stranger who have the same heart or the same feeling with yourselve must experience similar suffering if treat in a similar manner i charge you then know this to stand clear of the crime of he oppression the law then by which mose command the child of israel to regulate they conduct with respect to the usage of the stranger i show to be a law of universal and eternal obligation and for this among other reason that it be neither more nor less than the christian law which appear afterwards that we should not do that to other which we should be unwilling to have do unto ourselves have go into these statement at some length i make a application of they in the follow word : -- this be the case and this law of mose be afterwards establish into a fundamental precept of christianity i must apply it to fact of the present day and i be sorry that i must apply it to -- ourselves and first -- be there no stranger whom we oppress i fear the wretched african will say that he drink the cup of sorrow and that he drink it at we hand tear from he native soil and from he family and friend he be immediately force into a situation of all other the most degrading where he and he progeny be consider as cattle as possession and as the possession of a man to whom he never give offence it be a melancholy fact but it can be abundantly prove that great number of the unfortunate stranger who be carry from africa to we colony be fraudulently and forcibly take from they native soil to descant but upon a single instance of the kind must be productive of pain to the ear of sensibility and freedom consider the sensation of the person who be thus carry off by the ruffian who have be lurk to intercept he separate from everything which he esteem in life without the possibility even of bid he friend adieu beheld he overwhelm in tear -- wring he hand in despair -- look backwards upon the spot where all he hope and wish lay -- while he family at home be wait for he with anxiety and suspense -- be wait perhaps for sustenance -- be agitate between hope and fear -- till length of absence confirm the latter and they be immediately plunge into inconceivable misery and distress if this instance then be sufficiently melancholy of itself and be at all a act of oppression how complicate will we guilt appear who be the means of snatch away thousand annually in the same manner and who force they and they family into the same unhappy situation without either remorse or shame have proceed to show in a more particular manner than i can detail here how by means of the slave trade we oppress the stranger i make a inquiry into the other branch of the subject or how far we have a knowledge of he heart to elucidate this point i mention several specific instance out of those which i have collect in my journey and which i could depend upon as authentic of honor -- gratitude -- fidelity -- filial fraternal and conjugal affection -- and of the finest sensibility on the part of those who have be bring into we colony from africa in the character of slave and then i proceed for a while in the follow word : -- if then we oppress the stranger as i have show and if by a knowledge of he heart we find that he be a person of the same passion and feeling as ourselves we be certainly break by means of the prosecution of the slave trade that fundamental principle of christianity which say that we shall not do that unto another which we wish should not be do unto ourselves and i fear cut ourselves off from all expectation of the divine blessing for how inconsistent be we conduct we come into the temple of god we fall prostrate before he we pray to he that he will have mercy upon we but how shall he have mercy upon we who have have no mercy upon other we pray to he again that he will deliver we from evil but how shall he deliver we from evil who be daily invade the rights of the injured african and heaping misery on he head i attempt lastly to show that though the sin of the slave trade have be hitherto a sin of ignorance and might therefore have so far be wink at yet as the crime and misery belong to it become know it would attach even to those who have no concern in it if they suffer it to continue either without notice or reproach or if they do not exert themselves in a reasonable manner for its suppression i notice particularly the case of tyre and sidon which be the bristol and the liverpool of those time a direct judgment have be pronounce by the prophet joel against these city and what be remarkable for the prosecution of this same barbarous traffic thus and what have ye to do with I o tyre and sidon and all the coast of palestine ye have cast lot for my people ye have sell a girl for wine the child of judah and the child of jerusalem have ye sell unto the grecian that ye might remove they far from they own border behold i will raise they out of the place whither ye have sell they and will recompense you wickedness on you own head such be the language of the prophet and tyre and sidon fall as he have point out when the inhabitant be either cut off or carry into slavery have throw out these idea to the notice of the audience i conclude in the follow word : -- if then we wish to avert the heavy national judgment which be hang over we head -lrb- for must we not believe that we crime towards the innocent african lie record against we in heaven -rrb- let we endeavor to assert they cause let we nobly withstand the torrent of the evil however inveterately it may be fix among the custom of the time not however use we liberty as a cloak of maliciousness against those who perhaps without due consideration have the misfortune to be concern in it but upon proper motive and in a proper spirit as the servant of god so that if the sun should be turn into darkness and the moon into blood and the very heaven should fall upon we we may fall in the general convulsion without dismay conscious that we have do we duty in endeavor to succor the distressed and that the stain of the blood of africa be not upon we from manchester i proceed to keddleston in derbyshire to spend a day with lord scarsdale and to show he my little collection of african production and to inform he of my progress since i last see he here a letter be forward to I from the reverend john toogood of keington magna in dorsetshire though i be then unknown to he he inform I that he have address several letter to the inhabitant of he own county through they provincial paper on the subject of the slave trade which letter have produce a considerable effect it appear however that when he begin they he do not know of the formation of we committee or that he have a single coadjutor in the cause from keddleston i turn off to birmingham be desirous of visit bristol in my way to london to see if anything new have occur since i be there i be introduce by letter at birmingham to sampson and charle lloyd the brother of john lloyd belong to we committee and member of the religious society of the quaker i be highly gratify in find that these in conjunction with mr russell have be attempt to awaken the attention of the inhabitant to this great subject and that in consequence of they laudable effort a spirit be begin to show itself there as at manchester in favor of the abolition of the slave trade the kind manner in which these receive I and the deep interest which they appear to take in we cause lead I to a esteem for they which by means of subsequent visit grow into a solid friendship at length i arrive at bristol about ten o'clock on Friday morning but what be my surprise when almost the first thing i hear from my friend harry gandy be that a letter have be despatch to I to liverpool nearly a week ago request I immediately to repair to this place for that in consequence of notice from the lord of the admiralty advertise in the public papers the trial of the chief mate whom i have occasion to be take up at bristol for the murder of william line be come on at the old bailey and that not a evidence be to be find this intelligence almost paralyze I i can not describe my feeling on receive it i reproach myself with my own obstinacy for have resist the advice of mr burge as have be before explain all he word now come fresh into my mind i be terrify too with the apprehension that my own reputation be now at stake i foresaw all the calumny which would be spread if the evidence be not forthcoming on this occasion i anticipate also the injury which the cause itself might sustain if at we outset as it be i should not be able to substantiate what i have publicly advanced and yet the mayor of bristol have hear and determine the case -- he have not only examine but re-examine the evidence -- he have not only committed but re-commit the accuse : this be the only consolation i have i be sensible however amidst all these workings of my mind that not a moment be to be lose and i begin therefore to set on foot a inquiry as to the absent person on wait upon the mother of william line i learn from she that two out of four of the witness have be bribe by the slave-merchant and send to sea that they might not be forthcoming at the time of the trial that the two other have be tempt also but that they have be enable to resist the temptation that desirous of give they testimony in this cause they have go into some coal-mine between neath and swansea where they might support themselves till they should be call for and that she have address a letter to they at the request of mr gandy above a week ago in which she have desire they to come to bristol immediately but that she have receive no answer from they she then conclude either that she letter have miscarry or that they have leave the place i determine to lose no time after the receipt of this intelligence and i prevail upon a young man whom my friend harry gandy have recommend to I to set off directly and to go in search of they he be to travel all night and to bring they or if weary himself with he journey to send they up without ever sleep on the road it be now between twelve and one in the afternoon i see he depart in the interim i go to thompson 's and other place to inquire if any other of the seaman belong to the thoma be to be find but though i hunt diligently till four o'clock i could learn nothing satisfactory i then go to dinner but i grow uneasy i be fearful that my messenger might be at a loss or that he might want assistance on some occasion or other i now judge that it would have be more prudent if two person have be send who might have confer with each other and who might have divide when they have reach neath and go to different mine to inquire for the witness these thought disturb I those also which have occur when i first hear of the vexatious way in which thing be situate renew themselves painfully to my mind my own obstinacy in resist the advice of mr burge and the fear of injury to my own reputation and to that of the cause i have undertake be again before my eye i become still more uneasy : and i have no way of relieve my feeling but by resolve to follow the young man and to give he all the aid in my power it be now near six o'clock the night be cold and rainy and almost dark i get down however safe to the passage-house and desire to be convey across the severn the people in the house try to dissuade I from my design they say no one would accompany I for it be quite a tempest i reply that i would pay those handsomely who would go with I a person present ask I if i would give he three guinea for a boat i reply i would he could not for shame retract he go out and in about half a hour bring a person with he we be oblige to have a lanthorn as far as the boat we get on board and go off but such a passage i have never before witness the wind be furious the wave run high i could see nothing but white foam the boat also be

than a hour in this situation when the boatman begin to complain of cold and weariness i saw also that they begin to be uneasy for they do not know where they be they have no way of form any judgment about they course but by know the point from whence the wind blow and by keep the boat in a relative position towards it i encourage they as well as i could though i be begin to be uneasy myself and also sick in about a quarter of a hour they begin to complain again they say they could pull no longer they acknowledge however that they be get nearer to the shore though on what part of it they could not tell i could do nothing but bid they hope they then begin to reproach themselves for have come out with I i tell they i have not force they but that it be a matter of they own choice in the midst of this conversation i inform they that i think i see either a star or a light straight forward they both look at it and pronounce it to be a light and add with great joy that it must be a light in the passage-house and so we find it for in about ten minute afterwards we land and on reach the house learn that a servant maid have be accidentally talk to some other person on the stair-case near a window with a candle in she hand and that the light have appear to we from that circumstance it be now near eleven o'clock my messenger it appear have arrive safe about five in the evening and have proceed on he route i be very cold on my arrival and sick also there seem to be a chilliness all over I both within and without indeed i have not a dry thread about I i take some hot brandy and water and go to bed but desire as soon as my clothes be thoroughly dry to be call up that i might go forward this happen at about two in the morning when i get up i take my breakfast by the fire-side i then desire the post-boy if he should meet any person on the road to stop and inform I as i do not know whether the witness might not be come up by themselves and whether they might not have pass my messenger without know he errand have take these precaution i depart i travel on but we meet no one i trace however my messenger through newport cardiff and cowbridge i be assure also that he have not pass I on he return nor have any of those pass I whom he be seek at length when i be within about two mile of neath i meet he he have both the witness under he care this be a matter of great joy to I i determine to return with they it be now nearly two in the afternoon i accordingly go back but we do not reach the passage-house again till nearly two the next morning during we journey neither the wind nor the rain have much abate it be quite dark on we arrival we find only one person and he have be sit up in expectation of we it be in vain that i ask he for a boat to put we across the water he say all the boatman be in bed and if they be up he be sure that none of they would venture out it be think a mercy by all of they that we be not lose last night difficulty be also start about horse to take we another way unable therefore to proceed we take refreshment and go to bed we arrive at bristol between nine and ten the next morning but i be so ill that i could go no further i have be cold and shiver ever since my first passage across the severn and i have now a violent sore throat and a fever with it all i could do be to see the witness off for london and to assign they to the care of a attorney who should conduct they to the trial for this purpose i give they a letter to a friend of the name of langdale i see they depart the mother of william line accompany they by a letter receive on Tuesday i learn that they have not arrive in town till Monday morning at three o'clock that at about nine or ten they find out the office of mr langdale that on inquire for he they hear he be in the country but that he would be home at noon that finding he have not then arrive they acquaint he clerk with the nature of they business and open my letter to show he the contents of it that the clerk go with they to consult some other person on the subject when he convey they to the old bailey but that on inquire at the proper place about the introduction of the witness he learn that the chief mate have be bring to the bar in the morning and no person then appear against he that he have be discharge by proclamation such be the end of all my anxiety and labor in this affair i be very ill when i receive the letter but i see the necessity of bear up against the disappointment and i endeavor to discharge the subject from my mind with the follow wish that the narrow escape which the chief mate have experience and which be entirely owe to the accidental circumstance now explain might have the effect under providence of produce in he a deep contrition for he offence and of awaken he to a serious attention to he future life -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : he have undoubtedly a narrow escape for mr langdale 's clerk have learn that he have no evidence to produce in he favor the slave-merchant it seem have count most upon bribe those who be to come against he to disappear -rrb- i be oblige to remain in bristol a few day longer in consequence of my illness but as soon as i be able i reach london when i attend a sit of the committee after a absence of more than five month at this committee it be strongly recommend to I to publish a second edition of my _ essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species _ and to insert such of the fact in it in they proper place out of those collect in my late travels as i might judge to be productive of a interesting effect there appear also a earnest desire in the committee that directly after this i should begin my _ essay on the impolicy of the slave trade _ in compliance with they wish i determine upon both these work but i resolve to retire into the country that by be subject to less interruption there i might the sooner finish they it be proper however that i should settle many thing in london before i take my departure from it and among these that i should find out george ormond and patrick murray whom i have send from liverpool on account of the information they have give I relative to the murder of peter green i see no better way than to take they before sir sampson wright who be then at the head of the police of the metropolis he examine and cross-examine they several time and apart from each other he then desire they evidence to be draw up in the form of deposition copy of which he give to I he have no doubt that the murder would be prove the circumstance of the decease be in good health at nine o'clock in the evening and of he severe suffering till eleven and of the nature of the wound discover to have be make on he person and of he death by one in the morning could never he say be do away by any evidence who should state that he have be subject to other disorder which might have occasion he decease he find himself therefore compel to apply to the magistrate of liverpool for the apprehension of three of the principal officer of the ship but the answer be that the ship have sail and that they whose name have be specify be then none of they to be find in liverpool it be now for I to consider whether i would keep the two witness ormond and murray for a year or perhaps longer at my own expense and run the hazard of the death of the officer in the interim and of other calculable event i have feel so deeply for the usage of the seaman in this cruel traffic which indeed have embittered all my journey that i have no less than nine prosecution at law upon my hand on they account and nineteen witness detain at my own cost the committee in london could give I no assistance in these case they be the manager of the public purse for the abolition of the slave trade and any expense of this kind be neither within the limit of they object nor within the pale of they duty from the individual belong to it i pick up a few guinea by way of private subscription and this be all but a vast load still remain upon I and such as have occasion uneasiness to my mind i think it therefore imprudent to detain the evidence for this purpose for so long a time and i send they back to liverpool i commence however a prosecution against the captain at common law for he barbarous usage of they and desire that it might be push on as vigorously as possible and the result be that he attorney be so alarmed particularly after know what have be do by sir sampson wright that he enter into a compromise to pay all the expense of the suit hitherto incur and to give ormond and murray a sum of money as damages for the injury which they themselves have sustain this compromise be accede to the man receive the money and sign the release -lrb- of which i insist upon a copy -rrb- and go to sea again in another trade thank I for my interference in they behalf but by this copy which i have now in my possession it appear that care be take by the captain 's attorney to render they future evidence in the case of peter green almost impracticable for it be there wickedly state that george ormond and patrick murray do then and there bind themselves in certain penalty that they would neither encourage nor support any action at law against the say captain by or at the suit or prosecution of any other of the seaman now or late on board the say ship and that they release the say captain also from all manner of action suit and cause and cause of action information prosecution and other proceedings which they then have or ever have or could or might have by reason of the say assault upon they own person or _ other wrong or injury do by the say captain heretofore and to the date of this release _ -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : none of the nine action before mention ever come to a trial but they be all compromise by pay sum to the injured party -rrb- chapter xx labor of the committee during the author 's journey quaker the first to notice its institution general

of they labor and of the fruit of they : and if in do this i should be more minute for a few page than some would wish i must apologize for myself by say that there be other who would be sorry to lose the knowledge of the particular manner in which the foundation be lay and the superstructure advance of a work which will make so brilliant a appearance in we history as that of the abolition of the slave trade the committee have disperse five hundred circular letter give a account of they institution in london and its neighborhood the quaker be the first to notice it this they do in they yearly epistle of which the follow be a extract : -- we have also thankfully to believe there be a grow attention in many not of we religious society to the subject of negro slavery and that the mind of the people be more and more enlarged to consider it as a aggregate of every species of evil and to see the utter inconsistency of uphold it by the authority of any nation whatever especially of such as punish with loss of life crime whose magnitude bear scarce any proportion to this complicated iniquity the general baptist be the next for on the 22nd of June stephen lowdell and dan taylor attend as

institution the first individual who address the committee be mr william smith the late member for norwich in he letter he express the pleasure he have receive in find person associate in the support of a cause in which he himself have take a deep interest he give they advice as to they future plan he promise they all the co-operation in he power : and he exhort they not to despair even if they first attempt should be unsuccessful for consolation say he will not be want you may rest satisfied that the attempt will be productive of some good that the fervent wish of the righteous will be on you side and that the blessing of those who be ready to perish will fall upon you and as mr smith be the first person to address the committee as a individual after its formation so next to mr wilberforce and the member of it he give the most time and attention to the promotion of the cause on the 5th of July the committee open a correspondence by means of william dillwyn with the society of philadelphium and new york of whose institution a account have be give at this sit a due sense be signify of the service of mr ramsay and a desire of he friendly communication when convenient the

bring in a account of those whom he know personally and whom he believe not only to be willing but qualify on account of they judgment and the weight of they character to take a useful part in the work which be to be assign to they it be a remarkable circumstance that when the list be arrange the committee few as they be find they have friend in no less than thirty-nine county -lrb- a -rrb- in each of which there be several so that a knowledge of they institution could now be soon diffusively spread -lrb- footnote a : the quaker by means of they discipline have a greater personal knowledge of each other than the member of any other religious society but two-third of the committee be quaker and hence the circumstance be explain hence also nine-tenth of we first coadjutor be quaker -rrb- the committee have now fix upon they correspondent order five hundred of the circular letter which have be before mention and five thousand of the _ summary view _ a account of which have be give also to be print on account of the increase of business which be expect in consequence of the circulation of the precede publication robert barclay john vickris taylor and josiah wedgewood esq be add to the committee and it be then resolve that any three member might call a meeting when necessary on the 27th of August the new correspondent begin to make they appearance this sit be distinguish by the receipt of letter from two celebrated person the first be from brissot date paris August the 18th who it may be recollect be a active member of the national convention of france and who suffer in the persecution of robespierre the second be from mr john wesley whose useful labor as a minister of the gospel be so well know to we countryman brissot in he letter congratulate the member of the committee on have come together for so laudable a object he offer he own assistance towards the promotion of it he desire also that he valuable friend claviere -lrb- who suffer also under robespierre -rrb- might be join to he and that both might be acknowledge by the committee as associate in what he call this heavenly work he purpose to translate and circulate through france such publication as they might send he from time to time and to appoint banker in pari who might receive subscription and remit they to london for the good of they common cause in the mean time if he own countryman should be find to take a interest in this great cause it be not improbable that a committee might be form in pari to endeavor to secure the attainment of the same object from the government in france the thanks of the committee be vote to brissot for this disinterested offer of he service and he be elect a honorary and corresponding member in reply however to he letter it be state that as the committee have no doubt of procure from the generosity of they own nation sufficient fund for effect the object of they institution they decline the acceptance of any pecuniary aid from the people of france but recommend he to attempt the formation of a committee in he own country and to inform they of he progress and to make to they such other communication as he might deem necessary upon the subject from time to time mr wesley whose letter be read next inform the committee of the great satisfaction which he also have experience when he hear of they formation he conceive that they design while it would destroy the slave trade would also strike at the root of the shocking abomination of slavery also he desire to forewarn they that they must expect difficulty and great opposition from those who be interested in the system that these be a powerful body and that they would raise all they force when they perceive they craft to be in danger they would employ hirele writer who would have neither justice nor mercy but the committee be not to be dismay by such treatment nor even if some of those who profess goodwill towards they should turn against they as for himself he would do all he could to promote the object of they institution he would reprint a new and large edition of he _ think on slavery _ and circulate it among he friend in england and ireland to whom he would add a few word in favor of they design and then he conclude in these word : i commend you to he who be able to carry you through all opposition and support you under all discouragement on the 4th 11th and 18th of September the committee be employ variously among other thing they vote they thanks to mr leigh a clergyman of the established church for the offer of he service for the county of norfolk they order also one thousand of the circular letter to be additionally print at one of these meeting a resolution be make that granville sharp esq be appoint chairman this appointment though now first formally make in the minute book be always understand to have take place but the modesty of mr sharp be such that though repeatedly press he would never consent to take the chair and he generally refrain from come into the room till after he know it to be take nor could he be prevail upon even after this resolution to alter he conduct : for though he continue to sign the papers which be hand to he by virtue of hold this office he never be once seat as the chairman during the twenty year in which he attend at these meeting i think it not improper to mention this trait in he character conscious that he engage in the cause of he fellow-creature solely upon the sense of he duty as a christian he seem to have suppose either that he have do nothing extraordinary to merit such a distinction or to have be fearful lest the acceptance of it should bring a stain upon the motive on which alone he undertake it on the 2nd and 16th of October two sitting take place at the latter of which a sub-committee which have be appoint for the purpose bring in a design for a seal a african be see -lrb- as in the figure -lrb- a -rrb- -rrb- in chain in a supplicating posture kneel with one knee upon the ground and with both he hand lift up to heaven and round the seal be observe the follow motto as if he be utter the word himself -- be i not a man and a brother the design have be approve of a seal be order to be engrave from it i may mention here that this seal simple as the design be be make to contribute largely as will be show in its proper place towards turn the attention of we countryman to the case of the injured african and of procure a warm interest in they favor -lrb- footnote a : the figure be rather larger than that in the seal -rrb- -lrb- illustration : seal -rrb- on the 30th of October several letter be read : one of these be from brissot and claviere conjointly in this they acknowledge the satisfaction they have receive on be consider as associate in the humane work of the abolition of the slave trade and correspondent in france for the promotion of it they declare it to be they intention to attempt the establishment of a committee there on the same principle as that in england but in consequence of the different constitution of the two government they give the committee reason to suppose that they proceedings must be different as well as slower than those in england for the same object a second letter be read from mr john wesley he say that he have now read the publication which the committee have send he and that he take if possible a still deeper interest in they cause he exhort they to more than ordinary diligence and perseverance to be prepare for opposition to be cautious about the manner of procure information and evidence that no stain might fall upon they character and to take care that the question should be argue as well upon the consideration of interest as of humanity and justice the former of which he fear would have more weight than the latter and he recommend they and they glorious concern as before to the protection of he who be able to support they letter be read from dr price approve the institution of the committee from charle lloyd of birmingham state the interest which the inhabitant of that town be take in it and from william russell esq of the same place state the same circumstance and that he

which be contrary to all the feeling of humanity and the law of we religion a letter be read also at this sit from major cartwright of marnham in which he offer he own service in conjunction with those of the rev john charlesworth of ossington for the county of nottingham i congratulate you say he in this letter on the happy prospect of some considerable step at least be take towards the abolition of a traffic which be not only impious in itself but of all other tend most to vitiate the human mind although procrastination be generally pernicious in case depend upon the feeling of the heart i should almost fear that without very uncommon exertion you will scarcely be prepare early in the next session for bring the business into parliament with the greatest advantage but be that as it may let the best use be make of the intermediate time and then if there be a superintend providence which govern everything in the moral world there be every reason to hope for a blessing on this particular work the last letter be from robert boucher nickoll dean of middleham in yorkshire in this he state that he be a native of the west indy and have travel on the continent of america he then offer some important information to the committee as he mite towards the abolition of the slave trade and as a encouragement to they to persevere he attempt to prove that the natural increase of the negro already in the west indian island would be fully adequate to the cultivation of they without any fresh supplies from africa and that such natural increase would be secure by humane treatment with this view he instance the two estate of mr macmahon and of dr mapp in the island of barbado the first require continual supplies of new slave in consequence of the severe and cruel usage adopt upon it the latter overflow with labourer in consequence of a system of kindness so that it almost people another estate have relate these instance he cite other in north america where though the climate be less favourable to the constitution of the african but they treatment better they increase also he combate from he own personal knowledge the argument that self-interest be always sufficient to insure good usage and maintain that there be only one way of secure it which be the entire abolition of the slave trade he show in what manner the latter measure would operate to the desire end : he then dilate on the injustice and inconsistency of this trade and support the policy of the abolition of it both to the planter the merchant and the nation this letter of the dean of

for not only have the traffic become the general subject of conversation but public meeting have take place in which it have be discuss and of which the result be that a application to parliament have be resolve upon in many place concern it by the middle of February not fewer than thirty-five petition have be deliver to the common and it be know that other be on they way to the same house this ferment in the public mind which have show itself in the public print even before the petition have be resolve upon have excite the attention of government to coincide with the wish of the people on this subject appear to those in authority to be a desirable thing to abolish the trade replete as it be with misery be desirable also but it be so connect with the interest of individual and so interwoven with the commerce and revenue of the country that a hasty abolition of it without a previous inquiry appear to they to be likely to be productive of as much misery as good the king therefore by a order of council date February the eleventh 1788 direct that a committee of privy council should sit as a board of trade to take into they consideration the present state of the african trade particularly as far as related to the practice and manner of purchase or obtain slave on the coast of africa and the importation and sale thereof either in the british colony and settlement or in the foreign colony and settlement in america or the west-indy and also as far as related to the effect and consequence of the trade both in africa and in the say colony and settlement and to the general commerce of this kingdom and that they should report to he in council the result of they inquiry with such observation as they might have to offer thereupon of this order of council mr wilberforce who have attend to this great subject as far as he health would permit since i leave he have receive notice but he be then too ill himself to take any measure concern it he therefore write to I and beg of I to repair to london immediately in order to get such evidence ready as we might think it eligible to introduce when the council sit at that time as appear from the former chapter i have finish the addition to my _ essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species _ and i have now proceed about half way in that of the impolicy of it this summons however i obeyed and return to town on the fourteenth of February from which day to the twenty-fourth of may i shall now give the history of we proceedings my first business in london be to hold a conversation with mr pitt previously to the meeting of the council and to try to interest he as the first minister of state in we favor for this purpose mr wilberforce have open the way for I and a interview take place we be in free conversation together for a considerable time during which we go through most of the branch of the subject mr pitt appear to I to have but little knowledge of it he have also he doubt which he express openly on many point he be at a loss to conceive how private interest should not always restrain the master of the slave from abuse he this matter i explain to he as well as i could and if he be not entirely satisfy with my interpretation of it he be at least induce to believe that cruel practice be more probable than he have imagine a second circumstance of the truth of which he doubt be the mortality and usage of seaman in this trade and a third be the statement by which so much have be make of the riches of africa and of the genius and ability of she people for he seem at a loss to comprehend if these thing be so how it happen that they should not have be more generally notice before i promise to satisfy he upon these point and a interview be fix for this purpose the next day at the time appoint i go with my book papers and african production mr pitt examine the former himself he turn over leaf after leaf in which the copy of the muster-roll be contain with great patience and when he have look over above a hundred page accurately and find the name of every seaman insert he former abode or service the time of he entry and what have become of he either by death discharge or desertion he express he surprise at the great pain which have be take in this branch of the inquiry and confess with some emotion that he doubt be wholly remove with respect to the destructive nature of this employ and he say moreover that the fact contain in these document if they have be but fairly copy could never be disprove he be equally astonished at the various wood and other production of africa but most of all at the manufacture of the native in cotton leather gold and iron which be lay before he these he handle and examine over and over again many sublime thought seem to rush in upon he at once at the sight of these some of which he express with observation become a great and a dignified mind he thank I for the light i have give he on many of the branch of this great question and i go away under a certain conviction that i have leave he much impress in we favor my next visit be to mr -lrb- afterwards lord -rrb- grenville i call upon he at the request of mr wilberforce who have previously write to he from bath as he have promise to attend the meeting of the privy council during the examination which be to take place i find in the course of we conversation that mr grenville have not then more knowledge of the subject than mr pitt but i find he differently circumstance in other respects for i perceive in he a warm feeling in behalf of the injured african and that he have no doubt of the possibility of all the barbarity which have be allege against this traffic i show he all my papers and some of my natural production which he examine i be with he the next day and once again afterwards so that the subject be consider in all its part the effect of this interview with he be of course different from that upon the minister in the former case i have remove doubt and give birth to a interest in favor of we cause but i have here only increase a interest which have already be excite i have only enlarged the mass of feeling or add zeal to zeal or confirm resolution and reasoning dispose in this manner originally himself and strengthen by the document with which i have furnish he mr grenville contract a enmity to the slave trade which be never afterwards diminish -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : i have not mention the difference between these two eminent person with a view of draw any invidious comparison but because as these statement be true such person as have a high opinion of the late mr pitt 's judgment may see that this great man do not espouse the cause hastily or merely as a matter of feeling but upon the conviction of he own mind -rrb- a report have go abroad that the committee of privy council would only examine those who be interested in the continuance of the trade i find it necessary to call upon mr pitt again and to inform he of it when i receive a assurance that every person whom i choose to send to the council in behalf of the committee should be hear this give rise to a conversation relative to those witness whom we have to produce on the side of the abolition and here i be oblige to disclose we weakness in this respect i own with sorrow that though i have obtain specimen and official document in abundance to prove many important point yet i have find it difficult to prevail upon person to be publicly examine on this subject the only person we could then count upon be mr ramsay mr h gandy mr falconbridge mr newton and the dean of middleham there be one however who would be a host of himself if we could but gain he i then mention mr norri i tell mr pitt the nature -lrb- a -rrb- and value of the testimony which he have give I at liverpool and the great zeal he have discover to serve the cause i doubt however if he would come to london for this purpose even if i write to he for he be intimate with almost all the owner of slave-vessel in liverpool and living among these he would not like to incur they resentment by take a prominent part against they i therefore entreated mr pitt to send he a summons of council to attend hope that mr norri would then be please to come up as he would be enable to reply to he friend that he appearance have not be voluntary mr pitt however inform I that a summons from a committee of privy council sit as a board be not bind upon the subject and therefore that i have no other means leave but of write to he and he desire I to do this by the first post -lrb- footnote a : see he evidence chap xvii -rrb- this letter i accordingly write and send it to my friend william rathbone who be to deliver it in person and to use he own influence at the same time but i receive for answer that mr norri be then in london upon this i try to find he out to entreat he to consent to a examination before the council at length i find he address but before i could see he i be tell by the bishop of london that he have come up as a liverpool delegate in support of the slave trade astonish at this information i make the bishop acquaint with the case and ask he how it become I to act for i be fearful lest by expose mr norri i should violate the rights of hospitality on the one hand and by not expose he that i should not do my duty to the cause i have undertake on the other he advice be that i should see he and ask he to explain the reason of he conduct i call upon he for this purpose but he be out he send I however a letter soon afterwards which be full of flattery and in which after have pay high compliment to the general force of my argument and the general justice and humanity of my sentiment on this great question which have make a deep impression upon he mind he have find occasion to differ from I since we have last part on particular point and that he have therefore less reluctantly yield to the call of become a delegate -- though notwithstanding he would gladly have decline the office if he could have do it with propriety at length the council begin they examination mr norri lieutenant matthew of the navy who have just leave a slave employ in africa and mr jame penny formerly a slave captain and then interested as a merchant in the trade -lrb- which three be the delegate from liverpool -rrb- take possession of the ground first mr mile mr weuve and other follow they on the same side the evidence which they give as previously concerted between themselves may be shortly represent thus : -- they deny that kidnapping either do or could take place in africa or that war be make there for the purpose of procure slave have do away these wicked practice from they system they maintain position which be less exceptionable as that the native of africa generally become slave in consequence of have be make prisoner in just war or in consequence of they various crime they then give a melancholy picture of the despotism and barbarity of some of the african prince among whom the custom of sacrifice they own subject prevail but of all other that which be afford by mr norri on this ground be the most frightful the king of dahomey he say sport with the life of he people in the most wanton manner he have see at the gate of he palace two pile of head like those of shot in a arsenal within the palace the head of person newly put to death be strew at the distance of a few yard in the passage which lead to he apartment this custom of human sacrifice by the king of dahomey be not on one occasion only but on many such as on the reception of messenger from neighbouring state or of white merchant or on day of ceremonial but the great carnage be once a year when the poll-tax be pay by he subject a thousand person at least be sacrifice annually on these different occasion the great man too of the country cut off a few head on festival-day from all these particulars the humanity of the slave trade be infer because it take away the inhabitant of africa into land where no such barbarity be know but the humanity of it be insist upon by positive circumstance also namely that a great number of the slave be prisoner of war and that in former time all such be put to death whereas now they be save : so that there be a great accession of happiness to africa since the introduction of the trade these statement and those of other on the same side of the question have a great effect as may easily be conceive upon the feeling of those of the council who be present some of they begin immediately to be prejudice against we there be other who even think that it be almost unnecessary to proceed in the inquiry for that the trade be actually a blessing they have little doubt that all we assertion concern it would be find false the bishop of london himself be so impressed by these unexpected account that he ask I if falconbridge whose pamphlet have be previously send by the committee to every member of the council be worthy of belief and if he would substantiate publicly what he have thus write : but these impression unfortunately be not confine to those who have be present at the examination these could not help communicate they to other hence in all the higher circle -lrb- some of which i sometimes use to frequent -rrb- i have the mortification to hear of nothing but the liverpool evidence and of we own credulity and of the imposition which have be practice upon we : of these report the planter and merchant do not fail to avail themselves they boast that they would soon do away all the idle tale which have be invent against they they desire the public only to suspend they judgment till the privy council report should be out when they would see the folly and wickedness of all we allegation a little more evidence and all would be over on the 22nd of march though the committee council have not then hold its sitting more than a month and these only twice or thrice a week the follow paragraph be see in a morning paper : -- the report of the committee of privy council will be ready in a few day after due examination it appear that the major part of the complaint against this trade be ill-founded some regulation however be expect to take place which may serve in a certain degree to appease the cause of humanity but while they who be interested have produce this outcry against we in consequence of what have fall from they own witness in the course of they examination they have increase it considerably by the industrious circulation of a most artful pamphlet among person of rank and fortune at the west end of the metropolis which be call _ scriptural research on the licitness of the slave trade _ this they have procure to be write by r harri who be then clerk in a slave-house in liverpool but have be formerly a clergyman and a jesuit as they have maintain in the first instance as have be already show the humanity of the traffic so by means of this pamphlet they assert its consistency with reveal religion that such a book should have make convert in such a age be surprising and yet many who ought to have know better be carry away by it and we have now absolutely to contend and almost degrade ourselves by do so against the double argument of the humanity and the holiness of the trade by these means but particularly by the former the current of opinion in particular circle run against we for the first month and so strong that it be impossible for we to stem it at once but as some of the council recover from they panic and they good sense become less biass by they feeling and they be in a state to hear reason they prejudice begin to subside it begin now to be understand among they that almost all the witness be concern in the continuance of the trade it begin to be know also -lrb- for mr pitt and the bishop of london take care that it should be circulate -rrb- that mr norri have but a short time before furnished I at liverpool with information all of which he have conceal -lrb- a -rrb- from the council but all of which make for the abolition of it mr devayne also a respectable member of parliament who have be in africa and who have be appeal to by mr norri when examine before the privy council in behalf of he extraordinary fact be unable when summon to confirm they to the desire extent from this evidence the council collect that human sacrifice be not make on the arrival of white trader as have be assert that there be no poll-tax in dahomey at all and that mr norri must have be mistake on these point for he must have be there at the time of the ceremony of water the grave when about sixty person suffer this latter custom moreover appear to have be a religious superstition of the country such as at otaheite or in britain in the time of the druid and to have have nothing to do with the slave trade -lrb- b -rrb- with respect to prisoner of war mr devayne allow that the old the lame and the wound be often put to death on the spot but this be to save the trouble of bring they away the young and the healthy be drive off for sale but if they be not sell when offer they be not kill but reserve for another market or become house-slave to the conqueror mr devayne also maintain contrary to the allegation of the other that a great number of person be kidnap in order to be sell to the ship and that the government where this happen be not strong enough to prevent it but besides these drawback from the weight of the testimony which have be give it begin to be perceive by some of the lord of the council that the cruel superstition which have be describe obtain only in one or two country in africa and these of insignificant extent whereas at the time when they mind be carry away as it be by they feeling they have suppose they to attach to the whole of that vast continent they perceive also that there be circumstance relate in the evidence by the delegate themselves by means of which if they be true the inhumanity of the trade might be establish and this to they own disgrace they have all confess that such slave as the white trader refuse to buy be put to death and yet that these trader know that this would be the case have the barbarity uniformly to reject those whom it do not suit they to purchase mr matthew have reject one of this description himself whom he see afterwards destroy mr penny have know the refuse throw down melimba rock mr norri himself when certain prisoner of war be offer to he for sale decline buy they because they appear unhealthy and though the king then tell he that he would put they to death he could not be prevail upon to take they but leave they to they hard fate and he have the boldness to state afterwards that it be he belief that many of they actually suffer -lrb- footnote a : this be also the case with another witness mr weuve he have give I account before any stir be make about the slave trade relative to it all of which he keep back when he be examine there -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : be a religion custom it would still have go on though the slave trade have be abolish : nor could the merchant at any time have buy off a single victim -rrb- these consideration have the effect of diminish the prejudice of some of the council on this great question : and when this be perceive to be the case it be the opinion of mr pitt mr grenville and the bishop of london that we should send three or four of we own evidence for examination who might help to restore matter to a equilibrium accordingly mr falconbridge and some other all of whom be to speak to the african part of the subject be introduce these produce a certain weight in the opposite scale but soon after these have be examine dr andrew spaarman professor of physic and inspector of the museum of the royal academy at stockholm and he companion cb wadstrom chief director of the assay-office there arrive in england these gentleman have be lately send to africa by the late king of sweden to make discovery in botany mineralogy and other department of science for this purpose the swedish ambassador at paris have procure they permission from the french government to visit the country border on the senegal and have insure they protection there they have be convey to the place of they destination where they have remain from August 1787 to the end of January 1788 but meet with obstacle which they have not foresee they have leave it and have return to havre de grace from whence they have just arrive in london on they way home it so happen that by means of george harrison one of we committee i fall in unexpectedly with these gentleman i have not long be with they before i perceive the great treasure i have find they give I many beautiful specimen of african produce they show I they journal which they have regularly keep from day to day in these i have the pleasure of see a number of circumstance minute down all relate to the slave trade and even drawing on the same subject i obtain a more accurate and satisfactory knowledge of the manners and custom of the african from these than from all the person put together whom i have yet see i be anxious therefore to take they before the committee of council to which they be please to consent and as dr spaarman be to leave london in a few day i procure he a introduction first he evidence go to show that the native of africa live in a fruitful and luxuriant country which supply all they want and that they would be a happy people if it be not for the existence of the slave trade he instance war which he know to have be make by the moor upon the negro -lrb- for they be enter upon wholly at the instigation of the white trader -rrb- for the purpose of get slave and he have the pain of see the unhappy captive bring in on such occasion and some of they in a wounded state among they be many woman and child and the woman be in great affliction he see also the king of barbesin send out he party on expedition of a similar kind and he see they return with slave the king have be make intoxicate on purpose by the french agent or he would never have consent to the measure he state also that in consequence of the temptation hold out by slave-vessel come upon the coast the native seize one another in the night when they find opportunity and even invite other to they house whom they treacherously detain and sell at these time so that every enormity be practice in africa in consequence of the existence of the trade these specific instance make a proper impression upon the lord of the council in they turn for dr spaarman be a man of high character he possess the confidence of he sovereign he have no interest whatever in give he evidence on this subject either on one or the other side he means of information too have be large he have also record the fact which have come before he and he have he journal write in the french language to produce the tide therefore which have run so strongly against we begin now to turn a little in we favor while these examination be go on petition continue to be send to the house of common from various part of the kingdom no less than one hundred and three be present in this session the city of london though she be draw the other way by the cry of commercial interest make a sacrifice to humanity and justice : the two university applaud she conduct by they own example large manufacturing town and whole county express they sentiment and wish in a similar manner the established church in separate diocese and the quaker and other dissenter as separate religious body join in one voice upon this occasion the committee in the interim be not unmindful of the great work they have undertake and they continue to forward it in its different department they keep up a communication by letter with most of the worthy person who have be mention to have write to they but particularly with brissot and claviere from whom they have the satisfaction of learn that a society have at length be establish at paris for the abolition of the slave trade in france the learn marquis de condorcet have become the president of it the virtuous duc

treatment have increase by natural population only another effect of this humane treatment have be that these slave be among the most orderly and tractable in that island from these and other instance he argue that if the planter would all of they take proper care of they slave they humanity would be repay in a few year by a valuable increase in they property and they would never want supplies from

mariner contain observation upon a voyage which he have lately make to the coast of africa for slave they order three thousand of these to be print also by this time the subject have be much talk of and many doubt and difficulty have be throw in the way of the abolition by person interested in the continuance of the trade mr ramsay who have be often so honourably mention put down upon paper all the objection which be then hand about and also those answer to each which he be qualify from he superior knowledge of the subject to suggest this he do that the member of the legislature might see the more intricate part of the question unravel and that they might not be impose upon by the spurious argument which be then in circulation concern it observe also the poisonous effect which _ the scriptural research on the licitness of the slave trade _ have produce upon the mind of many he write a answer on scriptural grounds to that pamphlet these work be send to the press and three thousand copy of each of they be order to be strike off the committee in they arrangement of the distribution of they book order newton 's _ thought _ and ramsay 's _ objection and answer _ to be send to each member of both house of parliament they appoint also three sub-committee for different purpose : one to draw up such fact and argument respect the slave trade with a view of be translate into other language as should give foreigner a suitable knowledge of the subject another to prepare a answer to certain false report which have be spread relative to the object of they institution and to procure a insertion of it in the daily papers and a third to draw up rule for the government of the society by the latter end of the month of march there be a anxious expectation in the public notwithstanding the privy council have take up the subject that some notice should be take in the lower house of parliament of the numerous petition which have be present there there be the same expectation in many of the member of it themselves lord penrhyn one of the representative for liverpool and a planter also have anticipate this notice by move for such papers relative to ship employ goods export produce import and duty upon the same as would show the vast value of the trade which it be in contemplation to abolish but at this time mr wilberforce be ill and unable to gratify the expectation which have be thus apparent the committee therefore who partake of the anxiety of the public know not what to do they see that two-third of the session have already pass they see no hope of mr wilberforce 's recovery for some time rumor too be afloat that other member of whose plan they know nothing and who might even make emancipation they object would introduce the business into the house thus situate they wait as patiently as they could till the 8th of April -lrb- a -rrb- when they resolve to write to mr wilberforce to explain to he they fear and wish and to submit it to he consideration whether if he be unable himself he would appoint some one in whom he could confide to make some motion in parliament on the subject -lrb- footnote a : brissot attend in person at this committee in he way to america which it be then a object with he to visit -rrb- but the public expectation become now daily more visible the inhabitant of manchester many of whom have sign the petition for that place become impatient and they appoint thoma walker and thoma cooper esquire as they delegate to proceed to london to communicate with the committee on this subject to assist they in they deliberation upon it and to give they attendance while it be under discussion by the legislature at the time of the arrival of the delegate who be receive as such by the committee a letter come from bath in which it be state that mr wilberforce 's health be in such a precarious state that he physician dare not allow he to read any letter which related to the subject of the slave trade the committee be now again at a loss how to act when they be relieve from this doubtful situation by a message from mr pitt who desire a conference with they chairman mr sharp accordingly go and on he return make the follow report : he have a full opportunity he say of explain to mr pitt that the desire of the committee go to the entire abolition of the slave trade mr pitt assure he that he heart be with the committee as to this object and that he consider himself pledge to mr wilberforce that the cause should not sustain any injury from he indisposition but at the same time observe that the subject be of great political importance and it be requisite to proceed in it with temper and prudence he do not apprehend as the examination before the privy council would yet take up some time that the subject could be fully investigate in the present session of parliament but say he would consider whether the form of the house would admit of any measure that would be obligatory on they to take it up early in the ensue session in about a week after this conference mr morton pitt be depute by the minister to write to the committee to say that he have find precedent for such a motion as he conceive to be proper and that he would submit it to the house of common in a few day at the next meeting which be on the 6th of may and at which major cartwright and the manchester delegate assist mr morton pitt attend as a member of the committee and say that the minister have fix he motion for the 9th it be then resolve that deputation should be send to some of the lead member of parliament to request they support of the approach motion i be include in one of these and in that which be to wait upon mr fox we be receive by he in a friendly manner on put the question to he which related to the object of we mission mr fox pause for a little while as if in the act of deliberation when he assure we unequivocally and in language which could not be misunderstand that he would support the object of the committee to its fullest extent be convince that there be no remedy for the evil but in the total abolition of the trade at length the 9th or the day fix upon arrive when this important subject be to be mention in the house of common for the first time -lrb- a -rrb- with a view to the public discussion of it it be impossible for I to give within the narrow limit of this work all that be then say upon it and yet as the debate which ensue be the first which take place upon it i should feel inexcusable if i be not to take some notice of it -lrb- footnote a : david hartley make a motion some year before in the same house as have be show in a former part of this work but this be only to establish a proposition that the slave trade be contrary to the law of god and the rights of man -rrb- mr pitt rise he say he intend to move a resolution relative to a subject which be of more importance than any which have ever be agitate in that house this honor he should not have have but for a circumstance which he could not but deeply regret the severe indisposition of he friend mr wilberforce in whose hand every measure which belong to justice humanity and the national interest be peculiarly well place the subject in question be no less than that of the slave trade it be obvious from the great number of petition which have be present concern it how much it have engage the public attention and consequently how much it deserve the serious notice of that house and how much it become they duty to take some measure concern it but whatever be do on such a subject every one would agree ought to be do with the maturest deliberation two opinion have prevail without door as appear from the language of the different petition it have be pretty generally think that the african slave trade ought to be abolish there be other however who think that it only stand in need of regulation but all have agree that it ought not to remain as it stand at present but that measure which it might be the most proper to take could only be discover by a cool patient and diligent examination of the subject in all its circumstance relation and consequence this have induce he to form a opinion that the present be not the proper time for discuss it for the session be now far advance and there be also a want of proper material for the full information of the house it would he think be better discuss when it might produce some useful debate and when that inquiry which have be institute by he majesty 's minister -lrb- he mean the examination by a committee of privy council -rrb- should be bring to such a state of maturity as to make it fit that the result of it should be lay before the house that inquiry he trust would facilitate they investigation and enable they the better to proceed to a decision which should be equally found on principle of humanity justice and sound policy as there be not a probability of reach so desirable a end in the present state of the business he mean to move a resolution to pledge the house to the discussion of the question early in the next session if by that time he honorable friend should be recover which he hope would be the case then he -lrb- mr wilberforce -rrb- would take the lead in it but should it unfortunately happen otherwise then he -lrb- the chancellor of the exchequer -rrb- pledge himself to bring forward some proposition concern it the house however would observe that he have studiously avoid give any opinion of he own on this great subject he think it wiser to defer this till the time of the discussion should arrive he conclude with move after have read the name of the place from whence the different petition have come that this house will early in the next session of parliament proceed to take into consideration the circumstance of the slave trade complain of in the say petition and what may be fit to be do thereupon mr fox begin by observe that he have long take a interest in this great subject which he have also minutely examine and that it be he intention to have bring something forward himself in parliament respect it but when he hear that mr wilberforce have resolve to take it up he be unaffectedly rejoice not only know the purity of he principle and character but because from a variety of consideration as to the situation in which different man stand in the house there be something that make he honestly think it be better that the business should be in the hand of that gentleman than in he own have premise this he say that as so many petition and these sign by such number of person of the most respectable character have be present he be sorry that it have be find impossible that the subject of they could be take up this year and more particularly as he be not able to see as the chancellor of the exchequer have do that there be circumstance which might happen by the next year which would make it more advisable and advantageous to take it up then than it would have be to enter upon it in the present session for certainly there could be no information lay before the house through the medium of the lord of the council which could not more advantageously have be obtain by themselves have they institute a similar inquiry it be they duty to advise the king and not to ask he advice this the constitution have lay down as one of its most essential principle and though in the present instance he see no cause for blame because he be persuade he majesty 's minister have not act with any ill intention it be still a principle never to be depart from because it never could be depart from without establish a precedent which might lead to very serious abuse he lament that the privy council who have receive no petition from the people on the subject should have institute a inquiry and that the house of common the table of which have be load with petition from various part of the kingdom should not have institute any inquiry at all he hope these petition would have a fair discussion in that house independently of any information that could be give to it by he majesty 's minister he urge again the superior advantage of a inquiry into such a subject carry on within those wall over any inquiry carry on by the lord of the council in inquiry carry on in that house they have the benefit of every circumstance of publicity which be a most material benefit indeed and that which of all other make the manner of conduct the parliamentary proceedings of great britain the envy and the admiration of the world a inquiry there be better than a inquiry in any other place however respectable the person before and by whom it be carry on there all that could be say for the abolition or against it might be say in that house every relative fact would have be produce no information would have be withhold no circumstance would have be omit which be necessary for elucidation nothing would have be keep back he be sorry therefore that the consideration of the question but more particularly where so much human suffering be concern should be put off to another session when it be obvious that no advantage could be gain by the delay he then advert to the secrecy which the chancellor of the exchequer have observe relative to he own opinion on this important subject why do he refuse to give it have mr wilberforce be present the house would have have a great advantage in this respect because doubtless he would have state in what view he see the subject and in a general way describe the nature of the project he mean to propose but now they be keep in the dark as to the nature of any plan till the next session the chancellor of the exchequer have indeed say that it have be a very general opinion that the african slave trade should be abolish he have say again that other have not go so far but have give it as they opinion that it require to be revise and regulate but why do he not give he own sentiment boldly to the world on this great question as for himself he -lrb- mr fox -rrb- have no scruple to declare at the outset that the slave trade ought not to be regulate but destroy to this opinion he mind be make up and he be persuade that the more the subject be consider the more he opinion would gain ground and it would be admit that to consider it in any other manner or on any other principle than those of humanity and justice would be idle and absurd if there be any such man and he do not know but that there be those who lead away by local and interested consideration think the slave trade might still continue under certain modification these be the dupe of error and mistake what they think they interest for what he would undertake to convince they be they loss let such man only hear the case further and they would find the result to be that a cold-hearted policy be folly when it oppose the great principle of humanity and justice he conclude by say that he would not oppose the resolution if other member think it best to postpone the consideration of the subject but he should have be better pleased if it have be discuss sooner and he certainly reserve to himself the right of vote for any question upon it that should be bring forward by any other member in the course of the present session the chancellor of the exchequer say that nothing he have hear have satisfy he of the propriety of depart from the rule he have lay down for himself of not offer but of studiously avoid to offer any opinion upon the subject till the time should arrive when it could be fully argue he think that no discussion which could take place that session could lead to any useful measure and therefore he have wish not to argue it till the whole of it could be argue a day would come when every member would have a opportunity of state he opinion and he wish it might be discuss with a proper spirit on all side on fair and liberal principle and without any shackle from local and interested consideration with regard to the inquiry institute before the committee of privy council he be sure as soon as it become obvious that the subject must undergo a discussion it be the duty of he majesty 's minister to set those inquiry on foot which should best enable they to judge in what manner they could meet or offer any proposition respect the slave trade and although such previous examination by no means go to deprive that house of its undoubted right to institute those inquiry or to preclude they they would be find greatly to facilitate they but exclusive of this consideration it would have be utterly impossible to have come to any discussion of the subject that could have be bring to a conclusion in the course of the present session do the inquiry then before the privy council prove a loss of time so far from it that upon the whole time have be gain by it he have move the resolution therefore to pledge the house to bring on the discussion early in the next session when they would have a full opportunity of consider every part of the subject : first whether the whole of the trade ought to be abolish and if so how and when if it should be think that the trade should only be put under certain regulation what those regulation ought to be and when they should take place these be question which must be consider and therefore he have make he resolution as wide as possible that there might be room for all necessary consideration to be take in he repeat he declaration that he would reserve he sentiment till the day of discussion should arrive and again declare that he earnestly wish to avoid a anticipation of the debate upon the subject but if such debate be likely to take place he would withdraw he motion and offer it another day a few word then pass between mr pitt and mr fox in reply to each other after which lord penrhyn rise he say there be two class of man the african merchant and the planter both of whose character have be grossly calumniate these wish that a inquiry might be institute and this immediately conscious that the more they conduct be examine the less they would be find to merit the opprobrium with which they have be load the charge against the slave trade be either true or false if they be true it ought to be abolish but if upon inquiry they be find to be without foundation justice ought to be do to the reputation of those who be concern in it he then say a few word by which he signify that after all it might not be a improper measure to make regulation in the trade mr burke say the noble lord who be a man of honor himself have reason from he own conduct and be conscious of he own integrity be naturally lead to imagine that other man be equally just and honorable undoubtedly the merchant and planter have a right to call for a investigation of they conduct and they do so do they great credit the slave trade also ought equally to be inquire into neither do he deny that it be right he majesty 's minister should inquire into its merit for themselves they have do they duty but that house who have the petition of the people on they table neglect it by have so long defer a inquiry of they own if that house wish to preserve they function they understanding they honor and they dignity he advise they to beware of committee of privy council if they suffer they business to be do by such means they be abdicate they trust and character and make way for a entire abolition of they function which they be parting with one after another thus : -- star after star go out and all be night if they neglect the petition of they constituent they must fall and the privy-counsel be institute in they stead what would be the consequence he majesty 's minister instead of consult they and give they the opportunity of exercise they function of deliberation and legislation would modify the measure of government elsewhere and bring down the edict of the privy council to they to register mr burke say he be one of those who wish for the abolition of the slave trade he think it ought to be abolish on principle of humanity and justice if however opposition of interest should render its total abolition impossible it ought to be regulate and that immediately they need not send to the west indy to know the opinion of the planter on the subject they be to consider first of all and abstractedly from all political personal and local consideration that the slave trade be directly contrary to the principle of humanity and justice and to the spirit of the british constitution and that the state of slavery which follow it however mitigate be a state so improper so degrading and so ruinous to the feeling and capacity of human nature that it ought not to be suffer to exist he deprecate delay in this business as well for the sake of planter as of the slave mr gascoyne the other member for liverpool say he have no objection that the discussion should stand over to the next session of parliament provide it could not come on in the present because he be persuade it would ultimately be find that he constituent who be more immediately concern in the trade and who have be so shamefully calumniate be man of respectable character he hope the privy council would print they report when they have bring they inquiry to a conclusion and that they would lay it before the house and the public in order to enable all concern to form a judgment of what be proper to be do relative to the subject next session with respect however to the total abolition of the slave trade he must confess that such a measure be both unnecessary visionary and impracticable but he wish some alteration or modification to be adopt he hope that when the house come to go into the general question they would not forget the trade commerce and navigation of the country mr rolle say he have receive instruction from he constituent to inquire if the grievance which have be allege to result from the slave trade be well found and if it appear that they be to assist in apply a remedy he be glad the discussion have be put off till next session as it would give all of they a opportunity of consider the subject with more mature deliberation mr martin desire to say a few word only he put the case that suppose the slave be treat ever so humanely when they be carry to the west indy what compensation could be make they for be tear from they nearest relation and from everything that be dear to they in life he hope no political advantage no national expediency would be allow to weigh in the scale against the eternal rule of moral rectitude as for himself he have no hesitation to declare in this early stage of the business that he should think himself a wicked wretch if he do not do everything in he power to put a stop to the slave trade sir william dolben say that he do not then wish to enter into the discussion of the general question of the abolition of the slave trade which the chancellor of the exchequer be so desirous of postpone but he wish to say a few word on what he conceive to be a most cry evil and which might be immediately remedy without infringe upon the limit of that question he do not allude to the suffering of the poor african in they own country nor afterwards in the west indium island but to that intermediate state of tenfold misery which they undergo in they transportation when put on board the ship the poor unhappy wretch be chained to each other hand and foot and stow so close that they be not allow above a foot and a half for each individual in breadth thus cram together like herring in a barrel they contract putrid and fatal disorder so that they who come to inspect they in a morning have occasionally to pick dead slave out of they row and to unchain they carcass from the body of they wretched fellow-sufferer to whom they have be fasten nor be it merely to the slave that the baneful effect of the contagion thus create be confine this contagion affect the ship ' crew and number of the seaman employ in the horrid traffic perish this evil he say call aloud for a remedy and that remedy ought to be apply soon otherwise no less than ten thousand life might be lose between this and next session he wish therefore this grievance to be take into consideration independently of the general question and that some regulation such as restrain the captain from take above a certain number of slave on board accord to the size of they vessel and oblige they to let in fresh air and provide better accommodation for the slave during they passage should be adopt mr young wish the consideration of the whole subject to stand over to the next session sir jame johnstone though a planter profess himself a friend to the abolition of the slave trade he say it be highly necessary that the house should do something respect it but whatever be to be do should be do soon as delay might be productive of bad consequence in the island mr l smith stand up a zealous advocate for the abolition of the slave trade he say that even lord penrhyn and mr gascoyne the member for liverpool have admit the evil of it to a certain extent for regulation or modification in which they seem to acquiesce be unnecessary where abuse do not really exist mr grigby think it he duty to declare that no privy council report or other mode of examination could influence he a traffic in the person of man be so odious that it ought everywhere as soon as ever it be discover to be abolish mr bastard be anxious that the house should proceed to the discussion of the subject in the present session the whole country he say have petition and be it any satisfaction to the country to be tell that the committee of privy council be inquire who know anything of what be do by the committee of privy council or what progress they be make the inquiry ought to have be institute in that house and in the face of the public that everybody concerned might know what be go on the numerous petition of the people ought immediately to be attend to he reprobate delay on this occasion and as the honorable baronet sir william dolben have state fact which be shocking to humanity he hope he would move that a committee might be appoint to inquire into they existence that a remedy might be apply if possible before the sailing of the next ship for africa mr whitbread profess himself a strenuous advocate for the total and immediate abolition of the slave trade it be contrary to nature and to every principle of justice humanity and religion mr pelham state that he have very maturely consider the subject of the slave trade and have he not know that the business be in the hand of a honorable member -lrb- whose absence from the house and the cause of it no man lament more sincerely than he do -rrb- he should have venture to propose something concern it himself if it should be think that the trade ought not to be entirely do away the sooner it be regulate the better he have a plan for this purpose which appear to he to be likely to produce some salutary effect he wish to know if any such thing would be permit to be propose in the course of the present session the chancellor of the exchequer say he should be happy if he think the circumstance of the house be such as to enable they to proceed to a immediate discussion of the question but as that do not appear from the reason he have before state to be the case he could only assure the honorable gentleman that the same motive which have induce he to propose a inquiry into the subject early in the next session of parliament would make he desirous of receive any other light which could be throw upon it the question have be then put the resolution be agree to unanimously thus end the first debate that ever take place in the common on this important subject this debate though many of the person concern in it abstain cautiously from enter into the merit of the general question become interesting in consequence of circumstance attend it several rise up at once to give relief as it be to they feeling by utterance but by so do they be prevent many of they from be hear they who be hear speak with peculiar energy as if warm in a extraordinary manner by the subject there be a apparent enthusiasm in behalf of the injured african it be suppose by some that there be a moment in which if the chancellor of the exchequer have move for a immediate abolition of the trade he would have carry it that night and both he and other who profess a attachment to the cause be censure for not have take a due advantage of the disposition which be so apparent but independently of the inconsistency of do this on the part of the ministry while the privy council be in the midst of they inquiry and of the improbability that the other branch of the legislature would have concur in so hasty a measure what good would have accrue to the cause if the abolition have be then carry those concern in the cruel system would never have rest quietly under the stigma under which they then labor they would have urge that they have be condemn unheard the merchant would have say that they have have no notice of such a event that they might prepare a way for they vessel in other trade the planter would have say that they have have no time allow they to provide such supplies from africa as might enable they to keep up they respective stock they would both of they have call aloud for immediate indemnification they would have decry the policy of the measure of the abolition and where have it be prove they would have demand a reverse of it and might they not in cooler moment have succeed whereas by enter into a patient discussion of the merit of the question by bring evidence upon it by reasoning upon that evidence night after night and year after year and thus by dispute the ground inch as it be by inch the abolition of the slave trade stand upon a rock upon which it never can be shake many of those who be concern in the cruel system have now give up they prejudice because they become convinced in the contest a stigma too have be fix upon it which can never be erase : and in a large record in which the cruelty and injustice of it have be recognize in indelible character its impolicy also have be eternally enrol chapter xxiii continuation to the middle of July -- anxiety of sir william dolben to lessen the horror of the middle passage till the great question should be discuss bring in a bill for that purpose debate upon it -- evidence examine against it its inconsistency and falsehood -- further debate upon it -- bill pass and carry to the lord vexatious delay and opposition there carry backwards and forwards to both house -- at length finally pass -- proceedings of the committee in the interim effect of they it be suppose after the debate of which the substance have be just give that there would have be no further discussion of the subject till the next year but sir william dolben become more and more affect by those consideration which he have offer to the house on the ninth of may the trade he find be still to go on the horror of the transportation or middle passage as it be call which he conceive to be the worst in the long catalogue of evil belong to the system would of course accompany it the partial discussion of these he believe would be no infringement of the late resolution of the house he be desirous therefore of do something in the course of the present session by which the misery of the trade might be diminish as much as possible while it last or till the legislature could take up the whole of the question this desire he mention to several of he friend and as these approve of he design he make it know on the twenty-first of may in the house of common he begin by observe that he would take up but little of they time he rise to move for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of those unhappy person the native of africa from the hardship to which they be usually expose in they passage from the coast of africa to the colony he do not mean by any regulation he might introduce for this purpose to countenance or sanction the slave trade which however modify would be always wicked and unjustifiable nor do he mean by introduce these to go into the general question which the house have prohibit the bill which he have in contemplation go only to limit the number of person to be put on board to the tonnage of the vessel which be to carry they in order to prevent they from be crowd too closely together to secure to they good and sufficient provision and to take cognizance of other matter which related to they health and accommodation and this only till parliament could enter into the general merit of the question this humane interference he think no member would object to indeed those for liverpool have both of they admit on the ninth of may that regulation be desirable and he have since converse with they and be happy to learn that they would not oppose he on this occasion mr whitbread highly approve of the object of the worthy baronet which be to diminish the suffering of a unoffending people whatever could be do to relieve they in they hard situation till parliament could take up the whole of they case ought to be do by man live in a civilized country and profess the christian religion : he therefore beg leave to second the motion which have be make general norton be sorry that he have not rise up sooner he wish to have second this humane motion himself it have he most cordial approbation mr burgess compliment the worthy baronet on the honor he have do himself on this occasion and congratulate the house on the good which they be likely to do by accede as he be sure they would to he proposition mr joliffe rise and say that the motion in question should have he strenuous support mr gascoyne state that have understand from the honorable baronet that he mean only to remedy the evil which be state to exist in transport the inhabitant of africa to the west indy he have tell they that he would not object to the introduction of such a bill should it however interfere with the general question the discussion of which have be prohibit he would then oppose it he must also reserve another case for he opposition and this would be if the evil of which it take cognizance should appear not to have be well found he have write to he constituent to be make acquaint with this circumstance and he must be guide by they on the subject mr martin be surprised how any person could give a opposition to such a bill whatever be the merit of the great question all would allow that if human being be to be transport across the ocean they should be carry over with as little suffering as possible to themselves mr hamilton deprecate the subdivision of this great and important question which the house have reserve for another session every endeavor to meddle with one part of it before the whole of it could be take into consideration look rather as if it come from a enemy than from a friend he be fearful that such a bill as this would sanction a traffic which should never be view but in a hostile light or as repugnant to the feeling of we nature and to the voice of we religion lord frederic campbell be convince that the postpone of all consideration of the subject till the next session be a wise measure he be sure that neither the house nor the public be in a temper sufficiently cool to discuss it properly there be a general warmth of feeling or a enthusiasm about it which run away with the understanding of man and disqualify they from judge soberly concern it he wish therefore that the present motion might be defer mr william smith say that if the motion of the honorable baronet have trespass upon the great question reserve for consideration he would have oppose it himself but he conceive the subject which it comprehend might with propriety be separately consider and if it be likely that a hundred but much more a thousand life would be save by this bill it be the duty of that house to adopt it without delay the chancellor of the exchequer though he mean still to conceal he opinion as to the general merit of the question could not be silent here he be of opinion that he could very consistently give this motion he support there be a possibility -lrb- and a bare possibility be a sufficient ground with he -rrb- that in consequence of the resolution lately come to by the house and the temper then manifest in it those person who be concern in the slave trade might put the native of africa in a worse situation during they transportation to the colony even than they be in before by cram additional number on board they vessel in order to convey as many as possible to the west indy before parliament ultimately decide on the subject the possibility therefore that such a consequence might grow out of they late resolution during the intervene month between the end of the present and the commencement of the next session be a good and sufficient parliamentary ground for they to provide immediate means to prevent the existence of such a evil he consider this as a act of indispensable duty and on that ground the bill should have he support soon after this the question be put and leave be give for the introduction of the bill a account of these proceedings of the house have be send to the merchant of liverpool they hold a meeting and come to resolution on the subject they determine to oppose the bill in every stage in which it should be bring forward and what be extraordinary even the principle of it accordingly between the 21st of may and the 2nd of June on which latter day the bill have be previously read a second time be to be commit petition from interested person have be bring against it and consent have be obtain that both council and evidence should be hear the order of the day have be read on the 2nd of June for the house to resolve itself into a committee of the whole house a discussion take place relative to the manner in which the business be to be conduct this be over the counsel begin they observation and as soon as they have finish evidence be call to the bar in behalf of the petition which have be deliver from the 2nd of June to the 17th the house continue to hear the evidence at interval but the member for liverpool take every opportunity of occasion delay they have recourse twice to count out the house and at another time though complaint have be make of they attempt to procrastinate they oppose the resume of they own evidence with the same view and this merely for the frivolous reason that though there be then a suitable opportunity notice have not be previously give but in this proceed other member feel indignant at they conduct they be overrule the witness bring by the liverpool merchant against this humane bill be the same as they have before send for examination to the privy council namely mr norris lieutenant matthew and other on the other side of the question it be not deem expedient to bring any it be soon perceive that it would be possible to refute the former out of they own mouth and to do this seem more eligible than to proceed in the other way mr pitt however take care to send captain parrey of the royal navy to liverpool that he might take the tonnage and internal dimension of several slave-vessel which be then there suppose that these when know would enable the house to detect any misrepresentation which the delegate from that town might be dispose to make upon this subject it be the object of the witness when examine to prove two thing : first that regulation be unnecessary because the present mode of the transportation be sufficiently convenient for the object of it and be well adapt to preserve they comfort and they health they have sufficient room sufficient air and sufficient provision when upon deck they make merry and amuse themselves with dancing as to the mortality or the loss of they by death in the course of they passage it be trifle in short the voyage from africa to the west indy be one of the happiest period of a negro 's life secondly that if the merchant be hinder from take less that two full size or three smaller african to a ton then the restriction would operate not as the regulation but as the utter ruin of the trade hence the present bill under the specious mask of a temporary interference seek nothing less than its abolition these assertion have be severally make by the former of which it be insinuate that the african unhappy in he own country find in the middle passage under the care of the merchant little less than a elysian retreat it be now proper to institute a severe inquiry into the truth of they mr pitt sir charle middleton mr william smith and mr beaufoy take a conspicuous part on this occasion but particularly the two latter to whom much praise be due for the constant attention they bestow upon this subject question after question be put by these to the witness and from they own mouth they drag out by means of a cross-examination as severe as could be well institute the follow melancholy account : -- every slave whatever he size might be be find to have only five foot and six inch in length and sixteen inch in breadth to lie in the floor be cover with body stow or pack accord to this allowance : but between the floor and the deck or ceiling be often platform or broad shelf in the mid-way which be cover with body also the height from the floor to the ceiling within which space the body on the floor and those on the platform lay seldom exceed five foot eight inch and in some case it do not exceed four foot the man be chained two and two together by they hand and foot and be chained also by means of ring-bolt which be fasten to the deck they be confine in this manner at least all the time they remain upon the coast which be from six week to six month as it might happen they allowance consist of one pint of water a day to each person and they be feed twice a day with yam and horsebean after meal they jump up in they iron for exercise this be so necessary for they health that they be whip if they refuse to do it and this jump have be term dance they be usually fifteen and sixteen hour below deck out of the twenty-four in rainy weather they could not be bring up for two or three day together if the ship be full they situation be then distressing they sometimes draw they breath with anxious and laborious effort and some die of suffocation with respect to they health in these voyage the mortality where the african constitution be the strongest or on the windward coast be only about five in a hundred in thirty-five voyage a account of which be produce about six in a hundred be the average number lose but this loss be still greater at calabar and bonny which be the greatest market for slave this loss too do not include those who die either while the vessel be lie upon the coast or after they arrival in the west indy of the disorder which they have contract upon the voyage three and four in a hundred have be know to die in this latter case but besides these fact which be force out of the witness by means of the cross-examination which take place they be detect in various falsehood they have assert that the ship in this trade be peculiarly construct or differently from other in order that they might carry a great number of person with convenience whereas captain parrey assert that out of the twenty-six which he have see ten only have be build expressly for this employ they have state the average height between deck at about five foot and four inch but captain parrey show that out of the nine he measure the height in four of the smallest be only four foot eight inch and the average height in all of they be but five foot two they have assert that vessel under two hundred ton have no platform but by he account the four just mention be of this tonnage and yet all of they have platform either wholly or in part on other point they be find both to contradict themselves and one another they have assert as before mention that if they be restricted to less than two full-grown slave to a ton the trade would be ruin but in examine into the particulars of nineteen vessel which they produce themselves five of they only have cargo equal to the proportion which they state to be necessary to the existence of the trade the other fourteen carry a less number of slave -lrb- and they might have take more on board if they have please -rrb- so that the average number in the nineteen be but one man and four-fifth to a ton or ten in a hundred below they lowest standard -lrb- a -rrb- one again say that no inconvenience arise in consequence of the narrow space allow to each individual in these voyage another say that smaller vessel be more healthy than larger because among other reason they have a less proportion of slave as to number on board -lrb- footnote a : the falsehood of they statement in this respect be prove again afterwards by fact for after the regulation have take place they lose fewer slave and make greater profit -rrb- they be find also guilty of a wilful concealment of such fact as they know if communicate would have invalidate they own testimony i be instrumental in detect they on one of these occasion myself when mr dalzell be examine he be not wholly unknown to I my liverpool muster-roll tell I that he have lose fifteen seaman out of forty in he last voyage this be a sufficient ground to go upon for generally where the mortality of the seaman have be great it may be lay down that the mortality of the slave have be considerable also i wait patiently till he evidence be nearly close but he have then make no unfavourable statement to the house i desire therefore that a question might be put to he and in such a manner that he might know that they who put it have get a clue to he secret he become immediately embarrassed he voice falter he confess with tremble that he have lose a third of he sailor in he last voyage press hard immediately by other question he then acknowledge that he have lose one hundred and twenty or a third of he slave also but would he say that these be all he have lose in that voyage no twelve other have perish by a accident for they be drown but be no other lose beside the one hundred and twenty and the twelve none he say upon the voyage but between twenty and thirty before he leave the coast thus this champion of the merchant this advocate for the health and happiness of slave in the middle passage lose nearly a hundred and sixty of the unhappy person commit to he superior care in a single voyage the evidence on which i have now comment have be deliver the counsel sum up on the 17th of June when the committee proceed to fill up the blank in the bill mr pitt move that the operation of it be retrospective and that it commence from the 10th instant this be violently oppose by lord penrhyn mr gascoyne and mr brickdale but be at length accede to sir william dolben then propose to apportion five man to every three ton in every ship under one hundred and fifty ton burden which have the space of five foot between the deck and three man to two ton in every vessel beyond one hundred and fifty ton burden which have equal accommodation in point of height between the deck this occasion a very warm dispute which be not settle for some time and which give rise to some beautiful and interesting speech on the subject mr william smith point out in the clearest manner many of the contradiction which i have just state in comment upon the evidence indeed he have be a principal means of detect they he prove how little worthy of belief the witness have show themselves and how necessary they have make the present bill by they own confession the worthy baronet indeed have be too indulgent to the merchant in the proportion he have fix of the number of person to be carry to the tonnage of they vessel he then take a feeling view of what would be the wretched state of the poor african on board even if the bill pass as it now stand and conjure the house if they would not allow they more room at least not to infringe upon that which have be propose lord belgrave -lrb- afterwards grosvenor -rrb- animadvert with great ability upon the cruelty of the trade which he say have be fully prove at the bar he take notice of the extraordinary opposition which have be make to the bill then before they and which he believe every gentleman who have a proper feeling of humanity would condemn if the present mode of carry on the trade receive the countenance of that house the poor unfortunate african would have occasion doubly to curse he fate he would not only curse the womb that bring he forth but the british nation also whose diabolical avarice have make he cup of misery still more bitter he hope that the member for liverpool would urge no further opposition to the bill but that they would join with the house in a effort to enlarge the empire of humanity and that while they be stretch out the strong arm of justice to punish the degrader of british honor and humanity in the east they would with equal spirit exert they power to dispense the blessing of they protection to those unhappy african who be to serve they in the west mr beaufoy enter minutely into a examination of the information which have be give by the witness and which afford unanswerable argument for the passing of the bill he show the narrow space which they themselves have be make to allow for the package of a human body and the ingenious measure they be oblige to resort to for stow this live cargo within the limit of the ship he advert next to the case of mr dalzell and show how one dismal fact after another each make against they own testimony be extort from he he then go to the trifling mortality say to be experience in these voyage upon which subject he speak in the follow word : though the witness be some of they interested in the trade and all of they party against the bill they confession be that of the negro of the windward coast who be man of the strongest constitution which africa afford no less on a average than five in each hundred perish in the voyage -- a voyage it must be remembered but of six week in a twelvemonth then what must be the proportion of the dead no less than forty-three in a hundred which be seventeen time the usual rate of mortality for all the estimate of life suppose no more than a fortieth of the people or two and a half in the hundred to die within the space of a year such then be the comparison in the ordinary course of nature the number of person -lrb- include those in age and infancy the weakest period of existence -rrb- who perish in the space of a twelvemonth be at the rate of but two and a half in a hundred but in a african voyage notwithstanding the old be exclude and few infant admit so that those who be ship be in the firmest period of life the list of death present a annual mortality of forty-three in a hundred it present this mortality even in vessel from the windward coast of africa but in those which sail to bonny benin and the calabar from whence the greatest proportion of the slave be bring this mortality be increase by a variety of cause -lrb- of which the greater length of the voyage be one -rrb- and be say to be twice as large which suppose that in every hundred the death annually amount to no less than eighty-six yet even the former comparatively low mortality of which the counsel speak with so much satisfaction as a proof of the kind and compassionate treatment of the slave even this indolent and lethargic destruction give to the march of death seventeen time its usual speed it be a destruction which if general but for ten year would depopulate the world blast the purpose of its creation and extinguish the human race after have go with great ability through the other branch of the subject he conclude in the follow manner : -- thus i have consider the various objection which have be state to the bill and be ashamed to reflect that it could be necessary to speak so long in defense of such a cause for what after all be ask by the propose regulation on the part of the african the whole of they purport be that they whom you allow to be rob of all thing but life may not unnecessarily and wantonly be deprive of life also to the honor to the wisdom to the feeling of the house i now make my appeal perfectly confident that you will not tolerate as senator a traffic which as man you shudder to contemplate and that you will not take upon yourselve the responsibility of this waste of existence to the memory of former parliament the horror of this traffic will be a eternal reproach yet former parliament have not know as you on the clearest evidence now know the dreadful nature of this trade should you reject this bill no exertion of yours to rescue from oppression the suffering inhabitant of you eastern empire no record of the prosperous state to which after a long and unsuccessful war you have restore you native land no proof however splendid that under you guidance great britain have recover she rank and be again the arbitress of nation will save you name from the stigma of everlasting dishonor the broad mantle of this one infamy will cover with substantial blackness the radiance of you glory and change to feeling of abhorrence the present admiration of the world but pardon the supposition of so impossible a event i believe that justice and mercy may be consider as the attribute of you character and that you will not tarnish they lustre on this occasion the chancellor of the exchequer rise next and after have make some important observation on the evidence -lrb- which take up much time -rrb- he declare himself most unequivocally in favor of the motion make by the honorable baronet he be convince that the regulation propose would not tend to the abolition of the trade but if it even go so far he have no hesitation openly and boldly to declare that if it could not be carry on in a manner different from that state by the member for liverpool he would retract what he have say on a former day against go into the general question and wave every other discussion than what have that day take place he would give he vote for the utter annihilation of it at once it be a trade which it be shocking to humanity to hear detailed if it be to be carry on as propose by the petitioner it would besides its own intrinsic baseness be contrary to every humane and christian principle and to every sentiment that ought to inspire the breast of man and would reflect the greatest dishonor on the british senate and the british nation he therefore hope that the house be now in possession of such information as never hitherto have be bring before they would in some measure endeavor to extricate themselves from that guilt and from that remorse which every one of they ought to feel for have suffer such monstrous cruelty to be practice upon a helpless and unoffending part of the human race mr martin compliment mr pitt in term of the warmest panegyric on he noble sentiment declare that they reflect the greatest honor upon he both as a englishman and as a man soon after this the house divide upon the motion of sir william dolben fifty-six appear to be in favor of it and only five against it the latter consist of the two member for liverpool and three other interested person this be the first division which ever take place on this important subject the other blank be then fill up and the bill be pass without further delay the next day or on the 18th of June it be carry up to the house of lord the slave-merchant of london liverpool and bristol immediately present petition against it as they have do in the lower house they pray that counsel might open they case and though they have be drive from the common on account of they evidence with disgrace they have the effrontery to ask that they might call witness here also counsel and evidence have be respectively hear the bill be order to be commit the next day the lord attend accord to summons but on a motion by dr warren the bishop of bangor who state that the lord chancellor thurlow be much indispose and that he wish to be present when the question be discuss the committee be postpone it be generally think that the reason for this postponement and particularly as it be recommend by a prelate be that the chancellor might have a opportunity of forwarding this humane bill but it be find to be quite otherwise it appear that the motive be that he might give to it by he official appearance as the chief servant of the crown in that house all the opposition in he power for when the day arrive which have be appoint for the discussion and when the lord bathurst and hawkesbury -lrb- afterwards liverpool -rrb- have express they opinion which be different relative to the time when the bill should take place he rise up and pronounce a bitter and vehement oration against it he say among other thing that it be full of inconsistency and nonsense from the begin to the end the french have lately offer large premium for the encouragement of this trade they be a politic people and the presumption be that we be do politically wrong by abandon it the bill ought not to have be bring forward in this session the introduction of it be a direct violation of the faith of the other house it be unjust when a assurance have be give that the question should not be agitate till next year that this sudden fit of philanthropy which be but a few day old should be allow to disturb the public mind and to become the occasion of bring man to the metropolis with tear in they eye and horror in they countenance to deprecate the ruin of they property which they have embark on the faith of parliament the extraordinary part which the lord chancellor thurlow take upon this occasion be ascribe at the time by many who move in the higher circle to a shyness or misunderstanding which have take place between he and mr pitt on other matter when believe this bill to have be a favorite measure with the latter he determine to oppose it but whatever be he motive -lrb- and let we hope that he could never have be actuate by so malignant a spirit as that of sacrifice the happiness of forty thousand person for the next year to spite the gratification of a individual -rrb- he opposition have a mischievous effect on account of the high situation in which he stand for he not only influence some of the lord themselves but by take the cause of the slave-merchant so conspicuously under he wing he give they boldness to look up again under the stigma of they iniquitous calling and courage even to resume vigorous operation after they disgraceful defeat hence arise those obstacle which will be find to have be throw in the way of the passing of the bill from this period among the lord who be to be particularly notice as have take the same side as the lord chancellor in this debate be the duke of chando and the earl of sandwich the former foresaw nothing but insurrection of the slave in we island and the massacre of they master there in consequence of the agitation of this question the latter expect nothing less than the ruin of we marine he beg the house to consider how by do that which might bring about the abolition of this traffic they might lessen the number of british sailor how by throw it into the hand of france they might increase those of a rival nation and how in consequence the flag of the latter might ride triumphant on the ocean the slave trade be undoubtedly a nursery for we seaman all objection against it in this respect be ill-founded it be as healthy as the newfoundland and many other trade the debate have close during which nothing more be do than fill up the blank with the time when the bill be to begin to operate the committee be adjourn but the bill after this drag on so heavily that it would be tedious to detail the proceedings upon it from day to day i shall therefore satisfy myself with the follow observation concern they : -- the committee sit not less than five different time which consume the space of eight day before a final decision take place during this time so much be it a object to throw in obstacle which might occupy the little remaining time of the session that other petition be present against the bill and leave be ask on new pretence contain in these that counsel might be hear again letter also be read from jamaica about the mutinous disposition of the slave there in consequence of the stir which have be make about the abolition and also from merchant in france by which large offer be make to the british merchant to furnish they with slave several regulation also be propose in this interval some of which be negative by majority of only one or two voice of the regulation which be carry the most remarkable be those propose by lord hawkesbury -lrb- afterwards liverpool -rrb- namely that no insurance should be make on the slave except against accident by fire and water that person should not be appoint as officer of vessel transport they who have not be a certain number of such voyage before that a regular surgeon only should be capable of be employ in they and that both the captain and surgeon should have bounty if in the course of the transportation they have lose only two in a hundred slave the duke of chando again and lord sydney be the more conspicuous among the opposer of the humane bill and the duke of richmond the marquis townshend the earl of carlisle the bishop of london and earl stanhope among the most strenuous supporter of it at length it pass by a majority of nineteen to eleven vote on the 4th of July when the bill have be return to the common it be move that the amendment make in it by the lord should be read but as it have become a money-bill in consequence of the bounty to be grant and as new regulation be to be incorporate in it it be think proper that it should be wholly do away accordingly sir william dolben move that the further consideration of it should be put off till that day three month this have be agree upon he then move for leave to bring in a new bill this be accordingly introduce and a additional clause be insert in it relative to bounty by mr pitt but on the second reading that no obstacle might be omit which could legally be throw in the way of its progress petition be present against it both by the liverpool merchant and the agent for the island of jamaica under the pretence that it be a new bill they petition however be reject and it be commit and pass through its regular stage and send up to the lord on its arrival there on the 5th of July petition from london and liverpool still follow it the prayer of these be against the general tendency of it but it be solicit also that counsel might be hear in a particular case the solicitation be comply with after which the bill be read a second time and order to be commit on the 7th when it be take next into consideration two other petition be present against it but here so many objection be make to the clause of it as they then stand and such new matter suggest that the duke of richmond who be a strenuous supporter of it think it best to move that the committee then sit should be defer till that day seven-night in order to give time for another more perfect to originate in the lower house this motion have be accede to sir william dolben introduce a new one for the third time into the common this include the suggestion which have be make in the lord it include also a regulation on the motion of mr sheridan that no surgeon should be employ as such in the slave-vessel except he have a testimonial that he have pass a proper examination at surgeon 's hall the amendment be all then agree to and the bill be pass through its several stage on the 10th of July be now fully amend it come for a third time before the lord but it be no sooner bring forward than it meet with the same opposition as it have experience before two new petition appear against it one from a certain class of person in liverpool and another from mile peter andrew esq state that if it pass into a law it would injure the sale of he gunpowder and that he have render great service to the government during the last war by he provision of that article but here the lord chancellor thurlow reserve himself for a effort which by occasion only a day 's delay would in that particular period of the session have totally prevent the passing of the bill he suggest certain amendment for consideration and discussion which if they have agree upon must have be carry again to the lower house and sanction there before the bill could have be complete but it appear afterwards that there would have be no time for the latter proceeding earl stanhope therefore press this circumstance peculiarly upon the lord who be present he observe that the king be to dismiss the parliament next day and therefore they must adopt the bill as it stand or reject it altogether there be no alternative and no time be to be lose : accordingly he move for a immediate division on the first of the amendment propose by lord thurlow this have take place it be negative the other amendment share the same fate and thus at length pass through the upper house as through a ordeal as it be of fire the first bill that ever put fetter upon that barbarous and destructive monster the slave trade the next day or on Friday July the 11th the king give he assent to it and as lord stanhope have previously assert in the house of lord conclude the session while the legislature be occupy in the consideration of this bill the lord of the council continue they examination that they might collect as much light as possible previously to the general agitation of the question in the next session of parliament among other i undergo a examination : i give my testimony first relative to many of the natural production of africa of which i produce the specimen these be such as i have collect in the course of my journey to bristol and liverpool and elsewhere i explain secondly the loss and usage of seaman in the slave trade to substantiate certain point which belong to this branch of the subject i leave several deposition and article of agreement for the examination of the council with respect to other as it would take a long time to give all the datum upon which calculation have be make and the manner of make they i be desire to draw up a statement of particulars and to send it to the council at a future time i leave also deposition with they relative to certain instance of the mode of procure and treat slave the committee also for effect the abolition of the slave trade continue they attention during this period towards the promotion of the different object which come within the range of the institution they add the rev dr coombe in consequence of the great increase of they business to the list of they member they vote thanks to mr hughe vicar of ware in hertfordshire for he excellent answer to harri 's _ scriptural research on the licitness of the slave trade _ and they enrol he among they honorary and corresponding member also thanks to william roscoe esq for he answer to the same mr roscoe have not affix he name to this pamphlet any more than to he poem of _ the wrong of africa _ but he make himself know to the committee as the author of both also thanks to william smith and henry beaufoy esqr for have so successfully expose the evidence offer by the slave merchant against the bill of sir william dolben and for have draw out of it so many fact all make for they great object the abolition of the slave trade as the great question be to be discuss in the approach session it be move in the committee to consider of the propriety of send person to africa and the west indy who should obtain information relative to the different branch of the system as they exist in each of these country in order that they might be able to give they testimony from they own experience before one or both of the house of parliament as it might be judge proper this proposition be discuss at two or three several meeting it be however finally reject and principally on the follow grounds -- first it be obvious that person send out upon such a errand would be expose to such danger from vary cause that it be not improbably that both they and they testimony might be lose secondly such person would be oblige to have recourse to falsehood that be to conceal or misrepresent the object of they destination that they might get they intelligence with safety which falsehood the committee could not countenance to which it be add that few person would go to these place except they be handsomely reward for they trouble but this reward would lessen the value of they evidence as it would afford a handle to the planter and slave-merchant to say that they have be bribe another circumstance which come before the committee be the following : -- many argument be afloat at this time relative to the great impolicy of abolish the slave trade the principal of which be that if the english abandon it other foreign nation would take it up and thus while they give up certain national profit themselves the great cause of humanity would not be benefit nor would any moral good be do by the measure now there be a presumption that by means of the society institute in paris the french nation might be awaken to this great subject and that the french government might in consequence as well as upon other consideration be induce to favor the general feeling upon this occasion but there be no reason to conclude either than any other maritime people who have be engage in the slave trade would relinquish it or that any other who have not yet be engage in it would not begin it when we countryman should give it up the consideration of these circumstance occupy the attention of the committee and as dr spaarman who be say to have be examine by the privy council be return home it be think advisable to consider whether it would not be proper for the committee to select certain of they own book on the subject of the slave trade and send they by he accompany by a letter to the king of sweden in which they should entreat he consideration of this powerful argument which now stand in the way of the cause of humanity with a view that as one of the prince of europe he might contribute to obviate it by prevent he own subject in case of the dereliction of this commerce by ourselves from embark in it the matter have be fully consider it be resolve that the propose measure would be proper and it be accordingly adapt by a letter receive afterwards from dr spaarman it appear that both the letter and the book have be deliver and receive graciously and that he be authorize to say that unfortunately in consequence of those hereditary possession which have devolve upon he majesty he be oblige to confess that he be the sovereign of a island which have be principally people by african slave but that he have be frequently mindful of they hard case with respect to the slave trade he never hear of a instance in which the merchant of he own native realm have embark in it and as they have preserve they character pure in this respect he would do all he could that it should not be sully in the eye of the generous english nation by take up in the case which have be point out to he such a odious concern by this time i have finish my _ essay on the impolicy of the slave trade _ which i compose from material collect chiefly during my journey to bristol liverpool and lancaster these material i have admit with great caution and circumspection indeed i admit none for which i could not bring official and other authentic document or live evidence if necessary whose testimony could not reasonably be deny and when i give they to the world i do it under the impression that i ought to give they as scrupulously as if i be to be call upon to substantiate they upon oath it be of peculiar moment that this book should make its appearance at this time first because it would give the lord of the council who be then sit a opportunity of see many important fact and of inquire into they authenticity and it might suggest to they also some new point or such as have not fall within the limit of the arrangement they have agree upon for they examination on this subject : and secondly because as the member of the house of common be to take the question into consideration early in the next session it would give they also new light and information upon it before this period accordingly the committee order two thousand copy of it to be strike off for these and other object and though the contents of it be most diligently sift by the different opponent of the cause they never even make a attempt to answer it it continue on the other hand during the inquiry of the legislature to afford the basis or grounds upon which to examine evidence on the political part of the subject and evidence thus examine continue in they turn to establish it among the other book order to be print by the committee within the period now under we consideration be a new edition of two thousand of the dean of middleham 's _ letter _ and another of three thousand of falconbbidge 's _ account of the slave trade _ the committee continue to keep up during the same period a communication with many of they old correspondent whose name have be already mention but they receive also letter from other who have not hitherto address they : namely from ellington wright of erith dr franklin of philadelphium eustace kentish esq high sheriff for the county of huntingdon governor bouchier the reverend charle symmon of haverfordwest and from john york and william downe esquire high sheriff for the county of york and hereford a letter also be read in this interval from mr evan a dissent clergyman of bristol state that the elder of several baptist church form the western baptist association who have meet at portsmouth common have resolve to recommend it to the minister and member of the same to unite with the committee in the promotion of the great object of they institution another from mr andrew irvin of the island of grenada in which he confirm the wretched situation of many of the slave there and in which he give the outline of a plan for better they condition as well as that of those in the other island another from il wynne esq of jamaica in this he give a afflict account of the suffering and unprotected state of the slave there which it be high time to rectify he congratulate the committee on they institution which he think would tend to promote so desirable a end but desire they not to stop short of the total abolition of the slave trade as no other measure would prove effectual against the evil of which he complain this trade he say be utterly unnecessary as he own plantation on which he slave have increase rapidly by population and other which he know to be similarly circumstance would abundantly testify he conclude by promise to give the committee such information from time to time as might be useful on this important subject the session of parliament have close the committee think it right to make a report to the public : in which they give a account of the great progress of they cause since the last of the state in which they then be and of the unjustifiable conduct of they opponent who industriously misrepresent they view but particularly by attribute to they the design of abolish slavery : and they conclude by exhort they friend not to relax they endeavor on account of favourable appearance but to persevere as if nothing have be do under the please hope of a honorable triumph and now have give the substance of the labor of the committee from its formation to the present time i can not conclude this chapter without give to the worthy member of it that tribute of affectionate and grateful praise which be due to they for they exertion in have forward the great cause which be intrust to they care and this i can do with more propriety because have be so frequently absent from they when they be engage in the pursuit of this they duty i can not be liable to the suspicion that in bestow commendation upon they i be bestow it upon myself from about the end of may 1787 to the middle of July 1788 they have no less than fifty-one committee these generally occupy they from about six in the evening till about eleven at night in the interval between the committee they be often occupied have each of they some object commit to he charge it be remarkable too that though they be all except one engage in business or trade and though they have the same call as other man for innocent recreation and the same interruption of they health there be individual who be not absent more than five or six time within this period in the course of the thirteen month during which they have exercise this public trust they have print and afterwards distribute not at random but judiciously and through respectable channel -lrb- besides 26526 report account of debate in parliament and other small papers -rrb- no less than 51432 pamphlet or book nor be the effect produce within this short period otherwise than commensurate with the effort use in may 1787 the only public notice take of this great cause be by this committee of twelve individual of whom all be little known to the world except mr granville sharp but in July 1788 it have attract the notice of several distinguished individual in france and germany and in we own country it have come within the notice of the government and a branch of it have undergo a parliamentary discussion and restraint it have arrest also the attention of the nation and it have produce a kind of holy flame or enthusiasm and this to a degree and to a extent never before witness of the purity of this flame no better proof can be offer than that even bishop deign to address a obscure committee consist principally of quaker and that churchman and dissenter forget they difference of religious opinion and join they hand all over the kingdom in its support chapter xxiv continuation from June 1788 to July 1789 -- author travel to collect further evidence great difficulty in obtain it form committee on he tour -- privy council resume the examination inspect cabinet of african production oblige to leave many of the witness in behalf of the abolition unexamined prepare they report -- labor of the committee in the interim -- proceedings of the planter and other -- report lay on the table of the house of common -- introduction of the question and debate there twelve proposition deduce from the report and reserve for future discussion day of discussion arrive opponent refuse to argue from the report require new evidence this grant and introduce further consideration of the subject defer to the next session -- renewal of sir william dolben 's bill -- death and character of ramsay matter have now become serious the gauntlet have be throw down and accept the combatant have take they station and the contest be to be renew which be to be decide soon on the great theater of the nation the committee by the very act of they institution have pronounce the slave trade to be criminal they on the other hand who be concern in it have deny the charge it become the one to prove and the other to refute it or to fall in the ensue session the committee in this perilous situation be anxious to find out such other person as might become proper evidence before the privy council they have hitherto send there only nine or ten and they have then only another whom they could count upon for this purpose in they view the proposal of send person to africa and the west indy who might come back and report what they have witness have already be negative the question then be what they be to do upon this they deliberate and the result be a application to I to undertake a journey to different part of the kingdom for this purpose when this determination be make i be at teston write a long letter to the privy council on the ill usage and mortality of the seaman employ in the slave trade which it have be previously agree should be receive as evidence there i think it proper however before i take my departure to form a system of question upon the general subject these i divide into six table the first related to the production of africa and the disposition and manners of the native the second to the method of reduce they to slavery the third to the manner of bring they to the ship they value the medium of exchange and other circumstance the fourth to they transportation the fifth to they treatment in the colony the sixth to the seaman employ in the trade these table contain together one hundred and forty-five question my idea be that they should be print on a small sheet of paper which should be fold up in seven or eight leaf of the length and breadth of a small almanac and then be send in frank to we different correspondent these when they have they might examine person capable of give evidence who might live in they neighborhood or fall in they way and return we they examination by letter the committee have approve and print the table of question i begin my tour i have select the southern county from kent to cornwall for it i have do this because these include the great station of the ship of war in ordinary and as these be all under the superintendence of sir charle middleton as comptroller of the navy i could get a introduction to those on board they secondly because sea-faring people when they retire from a marine life usually settle in some town or village upon the coast of this tour i shall not give the reader any very particular account i shall mention only those thing which be most worthy of he notice in it at poole in dorsetshire i lay the foundation of a committee to act in harmony with that of london for the promotion of the cause mose neave of the respectable society of the quaker be the chairman thoma bell the secretary and elli b metford and the reverend mr davi and other the committee this be the third committee which have be institute in the country for this purpose that at bristol under mr joseph harford as chairman and mr lunell as secretary have be the first : and that at manchester under mr thoma walker as chairman and mr samuel jackson as secretary have be the second as poole be a great place for carry on the trade to newfoundland i determine to examine the assertion of the earl of sandwich in the house of lord when he say in the debate on sir william dolben 's bill that the slave trade be not more fatal to seaman than the newfoundland and some other this assertion i know at the time to be erroneous as far as my own research have be concern : for out of twenty-four vessel which have sail out of the port of bristol in that employ only two sailor be upon the dead list in sixty vessel from poole i find but four lose at dartmouth where i go afterwards on purpose i find almost a similar result on converse however with governor holdsworth i learn that the year 1786 have be more fatal than any other in this trade i learn that in consequence of extraordinary storm and hurricane no less than five sailor have die and twenty-one have be drown in eighty-three vessel from that port upon this statement i determine to look into the muster-roll of the trade there for two or three year together i begin by accident with the year 1769 and i go on to the end of 1772 about eighty vessel on a average have sail thence in each of these year take the loss in these year and compound it with that in the fatal year three sailor have be lose but take it in these four year by themselves only two have be lose in twenty-four vessel so employ on comparison with the slave trade the result would be that two vessel to africa would destroy more seaman than eighty-three sailing to newfoundland there be this difference also to be note that the loss in the one trade be generally by the weather or by accident but in the other by cruel treatment or disease and that they who go out in a decline state of health in the one come home generally recover whereas they who go out robust in the other come home in a shattered condition at plymouth i lay the foundation of another committee the late william cookworthy the late john prideaux and jame fox all of the society of the quaker and mr george leach samuel northcote and john saunder have a principal share in form it sir william ellford be choose chairman from plymouth i journey on to falmouth and from thence to exeter where have meeting with the late mr samuel milford the late mr george man the reverend jame manning thoma sparke and other a desire become manifest among they of establish a committee there this be afterwards effect and mr milford who at a general meeting of the inhabitant of exeter on the 10th of June on this great subject have be call by those present to the chair be appoint the chairman of it with respect to evidence which be the great object of this tour i find myself often very unpleasantly situate in collect it i hear of many person capable of give it to we advantage to whom i could get no introduction i have to go after these many mile out of my established route not know I they receive I coldly and even suspiciously while i fall in with other who consider themselves on account of they concern and connexion as we opponent treat I in a uncivil manner but the difficulty and disappointment in other respects which i experience in this tour -- even where i have a introduction and where the party be not interested in the continuance of the slave trade -- be greater than people in general would have imagine one would have think consider the great enthusiasm of the nation on this important subject that they who could have give satisfactory information upon it would have rejoice to do it but i find it otherwise and this frequently to my sorrow there be a aversion in person to appear before such a tribunal as they conceive the privy council to be with man of shy or timid character this operate as a insuperable barrier in they way but it operate more or less upon all it be surprising to see what little circumstance affect many when i take out my pen and ink to put down the information which a person be give I he become evidently embarrassed and frightened he begin to excuse himself from stay by allege that he have nothing more to communicate and he take himself away as quickly as he could with decency the sight of the pen and ink have lose I so many good evidence that i be oblige wholly to abandon the use of they and to betake myself to other means i be oblige for the future to commit my table of question to memory and endeavor by practice to put down after the examination of a person such answer as he have give I to each of they other go off because it happen that immediately on my interview i acquaint they with the nature of my errand and solicit they attendance in london conceive that i have no right to ask they such a favor or terrify at the abruptness and apparent awfulness of my request some of they give I a immediate denial which they would never afterwards retract i begin to perceive in time that it be only by the most delicate management that i could get forward on these occasion i resolve therefore for the future except in particular case that when i should be introduce to person who have a competent knowledge of this trade i would talk with they upon it as upon any ordinary subject and then leave they without say anything about they become evidence i would take care however to commit all they conversation to write when it be over and i would then try to find out that person among they relation or friend who could apply to they for this purpose with the least hazard of a refusal there be other also who though they be not so much impress by the consideration mention yet object to give they public testimony those whose livelihood or promotion or expectation be dependent upon the government of the country be generally backward on these occasion though they think they discover in the parliamentary conduct of mr pitt a bias in favor of the cause they know to a certainty that the lord chancellor thurlow be against it they conceive therefore that the administration be at least divide upon the question and they be fearful of be call upon lest they should give offence and thus injure they prospects in life this objection be very prevalent in that part of the kingdom which i have select for my tour the reader can hardly conceive how my mind be agitate and distressed on these different account to have travel more than two month -- to have see many who could have materially serve we cause -- and to have lose most of they -- be very try and though it be true that i apply a remedy i be not drive to the adoption of it till i have perform more than half my tour suffice it to say that after have travel upward of sixteen hundred mile backwards and forwards and have converse with forty-seven person who be capable of promote the cause by they evidence i could only prevail upon nine by all the interest i could make to be examine on my return to london whither i have be call up by the committee to take upon I the superintendence of the evidence which the privy council be now ready again to hear i find my brother : he be then a young officer in the navy and as i know he feel as warmly as i do in this great cause i prevail upon he to go to havre de grace the great slave-port in france where he might make he observation for two or three month and then report what he have see and hear so that we might have some one to counteract any false statement of thing which might be make relative to the subject in that quarter at length the examination be resume and with they the contest in which we own reputation and the fate of we cause be involve the committee for the abolition have discover one or two willing evidence during my absence and mr wilberforce who be now recover from he severe indisposition have find one or two other these add to my own make a respectable body but we have send no more than four or five of these to the council when the king 's illness unfortunately stop we career for nearly five week between the middle of November and January the examination be interrupted or put off so that at the latter period we begin to fear that there would be scarcely time to hear the rest for not only the privy council report be to be print but the contest itself be to be decide by the evidence contain in it in the exist session the examination however go on but they go on only slowly be still subject to interruption from the same unfortunate cause among other i offer my mite of information again i

answer have come into my table of question from several place and person have be point out to we by we correspondent who have increase we list of evidence to this number i write therefore to they at the desire of the committee for the abolition and give they the name of the eighteen and request also that they would order for they own inspection certain muster-roll of vessel from poole and dartmouth that they might be convince that the objection which the earl of sandwich have make in the house of lord against the abolition of the slave trade have no solid foundation in reply to my first request they inform I that it be impossible in the advanced state of the session -lrb- it be then the middle of march -rrb- that the examination of so many could be take but i be at liberty in conjunction with the bishop of london to select eight for this purpose this occasion I to address they again and i then find to my surprise and sorrow that even this last number be to be diminish for i be inform in write that the bishop of london have lay my last letter before they lordship they have agree to meet on the Saturday next and on the Tuesday follow for the purpose of receive the evidence of some of the gentleman name in it and it be they lordship ' desire that i would give notice to any three of they -lrb- whose information i might consider the most material -rrb- of the above determination that they might attend the committee accordingly this answer consider the difficulty we have find in collect a body of evidence and the critical situation in which we be be peculiarly distressing but we have no remedy leave we nor could we reasonably complain three therefore be select and they be send to deliver they testimony on they arrival in town but before the last of these have leave the council room who should come up to I but dr arnold he have but lately arrive at bristol from africa and have hear from we friend there that we have be daily look for he he have come to we in london he and mr gardiner be the two surgeon as mention in the former chapter who have promise I when i be in bristol in the year 1787 that they would keep a journal of fact during the voyage they be then go to perform they have both keep this promise gardiner i find have die upon the coast and he journal have be discover at he death have be bury with he in great triumph but arnold have survive and he come now to offer we he service in the cause as it be a pity that such correct information as that take down in write upon the spot should be lose -lrb- for all the other evidence except dr spaarman and mr wadstrom have speak from they memory only -rrb- i make all the interest i could to procure a hearing for mr arnold plead now for the examination of he only and under these particular circumstance i be attend to it be consent in consequence of the little time which be now leave for prepare and print the report that i should make out he evidence from he journal under certain head this i do mr arnold swear to the truth of it when so draw up before edward montague esquire a master in chancery he then deliver the paper in which it be contain to the lord of the council who on receive it read it throughout and then question he upon it at this time also my brother return with account and papers relative to the slave trade from havre de grace but as i have pledge myself to offer no other person to be examine he evidence be lose thus after all the pain we have take and in a contest too on the success of which we own reputation and the fate of africa depend we be oblige to fight the battle with sixteen less than we could have bring into the field while we opponent on the other hand on account of they superior advantage have muster all they force not have omit a single man i do not know of any period of my life in which i suffer so much both in body and mind as from the time of resume these public inquiry by the privy council to the time when they be close for i have my weekly duty to attend at the committee for the abolition during this interval i have to take down the examination of all the evidence who come to london and to make certain copy of these i have to summon these to town and to make provision against all accident and here i be often trouble by means of circumstance which unexpectedly occur lest when committee of the council have be purposely appoint to hear they they should not be forthcoming at the time i have also a new and extensive correspondence to keep up for the table of question which have be send down to we correspondent bring letter almost innumerable on this subject and they be always address to I these not only require answer of themselves but as they usually related to person capable of give they testimony and contain the particulars of what they could state they occasion fresh letter to be write to other hence the write often of ten or twelve daily become necessary but the contents of these letter afford the circumstance which give birth to so much suffering they contain usually some affect tale of woe at bristol my feeling have be harass by the cruel treatment of the seaman which have come to my knowledge there : but now i be doom to see this treatment over again in many other melancholy instance and additionally to take in the various suffering of the unhappy slave these account i could seldom get time to read till late in the evening and sometimes not till midnight when the letter contain they be to be answer the effect of these account be in some instance to overwhelm I for a time in tear and in other to produce a vivid indignation which affect my whole frame recover from these i walk up and down the room : i feel fresh vigor and make new determination of perpetual warfare against this impious trade i implored strength that i might succeed i then sit down and continue my work as long as my wearied eye would permit I to see have be agitate in this manner i go to bed but my rest be frequently break by the vision which float before I when i awake these renew themselves to I and they flit about with I for the remainder of the day thus i be keep continually harass : my mind be confine to one gloomy and heart-breaking subject for month it have no respite and my health begin now materially to suffer but the contents of these letter be particularly grievous on account of the severe labor which they necessarily entail upon I in other way than those which have be mention it be my duty while the privy council examination go on not only to attend to all the evidence which be present to we by we correspondent but to find out and select the best the happiness of million depend upon it hence i be often oblige to travel during these examination in order to converse with those who have be point out to we as capable of give they testimony and that no time might be lose to do this in the night more than two hundred mile in a week be sometimes pass over on these occasion the disappointment too which i frequently experience in journey increase the poignancy of the suffering which arise from a contemplation of the melancholy case which i have thus travel to bring forward to the public view the reader at present can have no idea of these i have be sixty mile to visit a person of whom i have hear not only as possess important knowledge but as espouse we opinion on this subject i have at length see he he have applaud my pursuit at we first interview he have tell I in the course of we conversation that neither my own pen nor that of any other man could describe adequately the horror of the slave trade horror which he himself have witness he have exhort I to perseverance in this noble cause could i have wish for a more favourable reception -- but mark the issue he be the nearest relation of a rich person concern in the traffic and if he be to come forward with he evidence publicly he should ruin all he expectation from that quarter in the same week i have visit another at a still greater distance i have meet with similar applause i have hear he describe scene of misery which he have witness and on the relation of which he himself almost weep but mark the issue again -- i be a surgeon say he through that window you see a spacious house it be occupy by a west indian the medical attendance upon he family be of considerable importance to the temporal interest of mine if i give you my evidence i lose he patronage at the house above he live a east indian the two family be connect : i fear if i lose the support of one i shall lose that of the other also : but i will give you privately all the intelligence in my power the reader may now conceive the many miserable hour i must have spend after such visit in return home and how grievously my heart must have be afflict by these cruel disappointment but more particularly where they arise from cause inferior to those which have be now mention or from little frivolous excuse or idle and unfounded conjecture unworthy of being expect to fill a moral station in life yes o man often in these solitary journeying have i exclaimed against the baseness of thy nature when reflect on the little paltry consideration which have smother thy benevolence and hinder thee from succour a oppressed brother and yet on a further view of thing i have reason myself into a kinder feeling towards thee for i have be oblige to consider ultimately that there be both light and shades in the human character and that if the bad part of we nature be visible on these occasion the nobler part of it ought not to be forget while i pass a censure upon those who be backward in serve this great cause of humanity and justice how many do i know who be toiling in the support of it i draw also this consolation from my reflection that i have do my duty that i have leave nothing untried or undo that amidst all these disappointment i have collect information which might be useful at a future time and that such disappointment be almost inseparable from the prosecution of a cause of such magnitude and where the interest of so many be concern : -- have now give a general account of my own proceedings i shall state those of the committee or show how they contribute by fulfil the duty of they several department to promote the cause in the interim in the first place they complete the rule or code of law for they own government they continue to adopt and circulate book that they might still enlighten the public mind on the subject and preserve it interested in favor of they institution they keep the press indeed almost constantly go for this purpose they print within the period mention ramsay 's _ address on the propose bill for the abolition the speech of henry beaufoy esq on sir william dolben 's bill _ of which a extract be give in chap xxiii _ note by a planter on the two report from the committee of the honorable house of assembly of jamaica _ _ observation on the slave

afterwards bishop of salisbury -rrb- as honorary and corresponding member the latter have write _ consideration on the abolition of slavery and the slave trade upon grounds of natural religious and political duty _ which have be of great service to the cause of the new correspondent of the committee within this period i may first mention henry taylor of north shield william proud of hull the rev t gisborne of yoxall lodge and william ellford esq of plymouth the latter as chairman of the plymouth committee send up for inspection a engraving of a plan and section of a slave-ship in which the body of the slave be see stow in the proportion of rather less than one to a ton this happy invention give all those who see it a much better idea than they could otherwise have have of the horror of they transportation and contribute greatly as will appear afterwards to impress the public in favor of we cause the next whom i shall mention be cl evan esq of west bromwich the rev t clarke of hull sp wolferstan of stratford near tamworth edmund lodge esq of halifax the rev caleb rotheram of kendal and mr campbell haliburton of edinburgh the news which mr haliburton send be very agreeable he

dr pretyman precentor of lincoln and a prebend of norwich succeed he -rrb- but the committee in london while they be endeavor to promote the object of they institution at home continue they exertion for the same purpose abroad within this period they keep up a communication with the different society establish in america they direct they attention also to the continent of europe they have already apply as i mention before to the king of sweden in favor of they cause and have receive a gracious answer they now attempt to interest other potentate in it for this purpose they bind up in a elegant manner two set of the _ essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species and on the impolicy of the slave trade _ and send they to the chevalier de pinto in portugal they bind up in a similar manner three set of the same and send they to mr eden -lrb- afterwards lord aukland -rrb- at madrid to be give to the king of spain the count d'aranda and the marquis del campomanes they keep up they correspondence with the committee at pari which have greatly advance itself in the eye of the french nation so that when the different bailliage send deputy to the states-general they instruct they to take the slave trade into they consideration as a national object and with a view to its abolition they keep up they correspondence with dr frossard of lyon he have already publish in france on the subject of the slave trade and now he offer the committee to undertake the task so long project by they of collect such argument and fact concern it and translate they into different language as might be useful in forwarding they view in foreign part they address letter also to various individual to monsieur snetlage doctor of law at halle in saxony to monsieur ladebat of bordeaux to the marquis de feuillade d'aubusson at paris and to monsieur necker the latter in he answer reply in part as follow : as this great question say he be not in my department but in that of the minister for the colony i can not interfere in it directly but i will give indirectly all the assistance in my power i have for a long time take a interest in the general alarm on this occasion and in the noble alliance of the friend of humanity in favor of the injured african such a attempt throw a new lustre over you nation it be not yet however a national object in france but the moment may perhaps come and i shall think myself happy in prepare the way for it you must be aware however of the difficulty which we shall have to encounter on we side of the water for we colony be much more considerable than yours so that in the view of political interest we be not on a equal footing it will therefore be necessary to find some middle line at first as it can not be expect that humanity alone will be the govern principle of mankind but the day be now draw near when it be expect that this great contest would be decide mr wilberforce on the 19th of march rise up in the house of common and desire the resolution to be read by which the house stand pledge to take the slave trade into they consideration in the then session he then move that the house should resolve itself into a committee of the whole house on Thursday the 23rd of April for this purpose this motion be agree to after which he move for certain official document necessary to throw light upon the subject in the course of its discussion this motion by means of which the great day of trial be now fix seem to be the signal for the planter merchant and other interested person to begin a furious opposition meeting be accordingly call by advertisement at these meeting much warmth and virulence be manifest in debate and proposition breathe a spirit of anger be adopt it be suggest there in the vehemence of passion that the island could exist independently of the mother country nor be even threat withhold to intimidate government from effect the abolition from this time also the public papers begin to be fill with such statement as be think most likely to influence the member of the house of common previously to the discussion of the question the first impression attempt to be make upon they be with respect to the slave themselves it be contend and attempt to be show by the revival of the old argument of human sacrifice in africa that these be better off in the island than in they own country it be contend also that they be people of very inferior capacity and but little remove from the brute creation whence a inference be draw that they treatment against which so much clamor have arise be adapt to they intellect and feeling the next attempt be to degrade the abolitionist in the opinion of the house by show the wildness and absurdity of they scheme it be again insist upon that emancipation be the real object of the former so that thousand of slave would be let loose in the island to rob or perish and who could never be bring back again into habit of useful industry a attempt be then make to excite they pity in behalf of the planter the abolition it be say would produce insurrection among the slave but insurrection would produce the massacre of they master and if any of these should happily escape from butchery they would be reserve only for ruin a appeal be then make to they on the ground of they own interest and of that of the people whom they represent it be state that the ruin of the island would be the ruin of themselves and of the country its revenue would be half annihilate its naval strength would decay merchant manufacturer and other would come to beggary but in this deplorable situation they would expect to be indemnify for they loss compensation indeed must follow : it could not be withhold but what would be the amount of it the country would have no less than from eighty to a hundred million to pay the sufferer and it would be drive to such distress in pay this sum as it have never before experience the last attempt be to show they that a regulation of the trade be all that be now want while this would remedy the evil complain of it would prevent the mischief which would assuredly follow the abolition the planter have already do they part the assembly of the different island have most of they make wholesome law upon the subject the very bill pass for this purpose in jamaica and grenada have arrive in england and might be see by the public the great grievance have be redress no slave could now be mutilate or wantonly kill by he owner one man could not now maltreat or bruise or wind the slave of another the age could not now be turn off to perish by hunger there be law also relative to the better feeding and clothing of the slave it remain only that the trade to africa should be put under as wise and humane regulation as the slavery in the island have undergo these different statement appear now in the public papers from day to day begin in this early stage of the question when the subject in all its bearing be know but to few to make a considerable impression upon those who be soon to be call to the decision of it but that which have the greatest effect upon they be the enormous amount of the compensation which it be say must be make this statement against the abolition be make its way so powerfully that archdeacon paley think it he duty to write and to send to the committee a little treatise call _ argument against the unjust pretension of slave dealer and holder to be indemnify by pecuniary allowance at the public expense in case the slave trade should be abolish _ this treatise when the substance of it be detail in the public papers have its influence upon several member of the house of common but there be other who have be as it be panic-struck by the statement these in they fright seem to have lose the right use of they eye or to have look through a magnifying glass with these the argument of emancipation which they would have reject at another time as ridiculous obtain now easy credit the massacre too and the ruin though only conjectural they admit also hence some of they desert we cause wholly while other wish to do justice as far as they could to the slave on the one hand and to they own countryman on the other adopt a middle line of conduct and would go no further than the regulation of the trade while these preparation be make by we opponent to prejudice the mind of those who be to be the judge in this contest mr pitt present the privy council report at the bar of the house of common and as it be a large folio volume and contain the evidence upon which the question be to be decide it be necessary that time should be give to the member to peruse it accordingly the 12th of may be appoint instead of the 23rd of April for the discussion of the question this postponement of the discussion of the question give time to all party to prepare themselves further the merchant and planter avail themselves of it to collect petition to parliament from interested person against the abolition of the trade to wait upon member of parliament by deputation in order to solicit they attendance in they favor and to renew they injurious paragraph in the public papers the committee for the abolition avail themselves of it to reply to these and here dr dickson who have be secretary to governor hey in barbado and who have offer the committee he _ letter on slavery _ before mention and he service also be of singular use many member of parliament avail themselves of it to retire into the country to read the report among the latter be mr wilberforce and mr pitt in this retirement they discover notwithstanding the great disadvantage under which we have labor with respect to evidence that we cause be safe and that as far as it be to be decide by reason and sound policy it would triumph it be in this retirement that mr pitt make those able calculation which satisfy he for ever after as the minister of the country as to the safety of the great measure of the abolition of the slave trade for he have clearly prove that not only the island could go on in a flourishing state without supplies from the coast of africa but that they be then in a condition to do it at length the 12th of may arrive mr wilberforce rise up in the common and move the order of the day for the house to resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to take into consideration the petition which have be present against the slave trade this order have be read he move that the report of the committee of privy council that the act pass in the island relative to slave that the evidence adduce last year on the slave trade that the petition offer in the last session against the slave trade and that the account present to the house in the last and present session relative to the export and import of africa be refer to the same committee these motion have be severally agree to the house immediately resolve itself into a committee of the whole house and sir william dolben be put into the chair mr wilberforce begin by declare that when he consider how much discussion the subject which he be about to explain to the committee have occasion not only in that house but throughout the kingdom and throughout europe and when he consider the extent and importance of it the variety of interest involve in it and the consequence which might arise he own he have be fill with apprehension lest a subject of such magnitude and a cause of such weight should suffer from the weakness of its advocate but when he recollect that in the progress of he inquiry he have everywhere be receive with candor that most people give he credit for the purity of he motive and that however many of these might then differ from he they be all likely to agree in the end he have dismiss he fear and march forward with a firmer step in this cause of humanity justice and religion he could not however but lament that the subject have excite so much warmth he fear that too many on this account be but ill prepare to consider it with impartiality he entreat all such to endeavor to be calm and compose a fair and cool discussion be essentially necessary the motion he mean to offer be as reconcilable to political expediency as to national humanity it belong to no party question it would in the end be find serviceable to all party and to the best interest of the country he do not come forward to accuse the west indium planter or the liverpool merchant or indeed any one concern in this traffic but if blame attach anywhere to take shame to himself in common indeed with the whole parliament of great britain who have suffer it to be carry on under they own authority be all of they participator in the guilt in endeavor to explain the great business of the day he say he should call the attention of the house only to the lead feature of the slave trade nor should he dwell long upon these every one might imagine for himself what must be the natural consequence of such a commerce with africa be it not plain that she must suffer from it that she savage manners must be render still more ferocious and that a trade of this nature carry on round she coast must extend violence and desolation to she very center it be well know that the native of africa be sell as goods and that number of they be continually convey away from they country by the owner of british vessel the question then be which way the latter come by they in answer to this question the privy council report which be then on the table afford evidence the most satisfactory and conclusive he have find thing in it which have confirm every proposition he have maintain before whether this proposition have be gather from live information of the best authority or from the history he have read but it be unnecessary either to quote the report or to appeal to history on this occasion plain reason and common sense would point out how the poor african be obtain africa be a country divide into many kingdom which have different government and law in many part the prince be despotic in other they have a limited rule but in all of they whatever the nature of the government be man be consider as goods and property and as such subject to plunder in the same manner as property in other country the person in power there be naturally fond of we commodity and to obtain they -lrb- which could only be do by the sale of they countryman -rrb- they wage war on one another or even ravage they own country when they could find no pretence for quarrel with they neighbor : in they court of law many poor wretch who be innocent be condemn and to obtain these commodity in greater abundance thousand be kidnap and tear from they family and send into slavery such transaction he say be record in every history of africa and the report on the table confirm they with respect however to these he should make but one or two observation if we look into the reign of henry the eighth we should find a parallel for one of they we should find that similar conviction take place and that penalty follow conviction with respect to war the king of africa be never induce to engage in they by public principle by national glory and least of all by the love of they people this have be state by those most conversant in the subject by dr spaarman and mr wadstrom they have converse with these prince and have learn from they own mouth that to procure slave be the object of they hostility indeed there be scarcely a single person examine before the privy council who do not prove that the slave trade be the source of the tragedy act upon that extensive continent some have endeavor to palliate this circumstance but there be not one who do not more or less admit it to be true by one the slave trade be call the concurrent cause by the majority it be acknowledge to be the principal motive of the african war the same might be say with respect to those instance of treachery and injustice in which individual be concerned and here he be sorry to observe that we own countryman be often guilty he would only at present advert to the tragedy at calabar where two-large african village have be for some time at war make peace this peace be to have be ratify by intermarriage but some of we captain who be there see they trade would be stop for a while sow dissension again between they they actually set one village against the other take a share in the contest massacre many of the inhabitant and carry other of they away as slave but shocking as this transaction might appear there be not a single history of africa to be read in which scene of as atrocious a nature be not related they he say who defend this trade be warped and blind by they own interest and would not be convince of the misery they be daily heaping on they fellow creature by the countenance they give it they have reduce the inhabitant of africa to a worse state than that of the most barbarous nation they have destroy what ought to have be the bond of union and safety among they they have introduce discord and anarchy among they they have set king against they subject and subject against each other they have render every private family wretched they have in short give birth to scene of injustice and misery not to be find in any other quarter of the globe have say thus much on the subject of procure slave in africa he would now go to that of the transportation of they and here he have fondly hope that when man with affection and feeling like we own have be tear from they country and everything dear to they he should have find some mitigation of they suffering but the sad reverse be the case this be the most wretched part of the whole subject he be incapable of impress the house with what he feel upon it a description of they conveyance be impossible so much misery condensed in so little room be more than the human imagination have ever before conceive think only of six hundred person link together try to get rid of each other cram in a close vessel with every object that be nauseous and disgusting diseased and struggle with all the variety of wretchedness it seem impossible to add anything more to human misery yet shocking as this description must be feel to be by every man the transportation have be describe by several witness from liverpool to be a comfortable conveyance mr norri have paint the accommodation on board a slave-ship in the most glowing color he have represent they in a manner which would have exceed he attempt at praise of the most luxurious scene they apartment he say be fit up as advantageously for they as circumstance could possibly admit : they have several meal a day some of they own country provision with the best sauce of african cookery and by way of variety another meal of pulse accord to the european taste after breakfast they have water to wash themselves while they apartment be perfumed with frankincense and lime-juice before dinner they be amuse after the manner of they country instrument of music be introduce the song and the dance be promote game of chance be furnish they the man play and sing while the woman and girl make fanciful ornament from bead with which they be plentifully supply they be indulge in all they little fancy and keep in sprightly humor another of they have say when the sailor be flog it be out of the hearing of the african lest it should depress they spirit he by no means wish to say that such description be wilful misrepresentation if they be not it prove that interest or prejudice be capable of spread a film over the eye thick enough to occasion total blindness other however and these man of the greatest veracity have give a different account what would the house think when by the concur testimony of these the true history be lay open the slave who have be describe as rejoicing in they captivity be so wring with misery at leave they country that it be the constant practice to set sail in the night lest they should know the moment of they departure with respect to they accommodation the right ancle of one be fasten to the left ancle of another by a iron fetter and if they be turbulent by another on the wrist instead of the apartment describe they be place in niche and along the deck in such a manner that it be impossible for any one to pass among they however careful he might be without tread upon they sir george yonge have testify that in a slave-ship on board of which he go and which have not complete she cargo by two hundred and fifty instead of the scent of frankincense be perceptible to the nostril the stench be intolerable the allowance of water be so deficient that the slave be frequently find gasp for life and almost suffocate the pulse with which they have be say to be favor be absolutely english horse-bean the legislature of jamaica have state the scantiness both of water and provision as a subject which call for the interference of parliament as mr norri have say the song and the dance be promote he could not pass over these expression without tell the house what they mean it would have be much more fair if he himself have explain the word _ promote _ the truth be that for the sake of exercise these miserable wretch load with chain and oppress with disease be force to dance by the terror of the lash and sometimes by the actual use of it i say one of the evidence be employ to dance the man while another person dance the woman such then be the meaning of the word _ promote _ and it might also be observe with respect to food that instrument be sometimes carry out in order to force they to eat which be the same sort of proof how much they enjoy themselves in this instance also with respect to they singing it consist of song of lamentation for the loss of they country while they sing they be in tear : so that one of the captain more humane probably than the rest threaten a woman with a flogging because the mournfulness of she song be too painful for he feeling perhaps he could not give a better proof of the suffering of these injured people during they passage than by state the mortality which accompany it this be a species of evidence which be infallible on this occasion death be a witness which could not deceive they and the proportion of death would not only confirm but if possible even aggravate we suspicion of the misery of the transit it would be find upon a average of all the ship upon which evidence have be give that exclusively of such as perish before they sail from africa not less than twelve and-a-half per cent die on they passage : besides these the jamaica report state that four and-a-half per cent die while in the harbor or on shore before the day of sale which be only about the space of twelve or fourteen day after they arrival there and one-third more die in the seasoning : and this in a climate exactly similar to they own and where as some of the witness pretend they be healthy and happy thus out of every lot of one hundred ship from africa seventeen die in about nine week and not more than fifty live to become effective labourer in we island have advance thus far in he investigation he feel he say the wickedness of the slave trade to be so enormous so dreadful and irremediable that he could stop at no alternative short of its abolition a trade found on iniquity and carry on with such circumstance of horror must be abolish let the policy of it be what it might and he have from this time determine whatever be the consequence that he would never rest till he have effect that abolition he mind have indeed be harass by the objection of the west indium planter who have assert that the ruin of they property must be the consequence of such a measure he could not help however distrust they argument he could not believe that the almighty be who have forbid the practice of rapine and bloodshed have make rapine and bloodshed necessary to any part of he universe he feel a confidence in this persuasion and take the resolution to act upon it light indeed soon break in upon he the suspicion of he mind be every day confirm by increase information and the evidence he have now to offer upon this point be decisive and complete the principle upon which he found the necessity of the abolition be not policy but justice : but though justice be the principle of the measure yet he trust he should distinctly prove it to be reconcilable with we truest political interest in the first place he assert that the number of the slave in we west indium island might be keep up without the introduction of recruit from africa and to prove this he would enumerate the different source of they mortality the first be the disproportion of the sex there be upon a average about five male import to three female : but this evil when the slave trade be abolish would cure itself the second consist in the bad condition in which they be bring to the island and the method of prepare they for sale they arrive frequently in a sickly and disorder state and then they be make up for the market by the application of astringent wash mercurial ointment and repel drug so that they wound and disease might be hide these artifice be not only fraudulent but fatal but these it be obvious would of themselves fall with the trade a third be excessive labor join with improper food and a fourth be the extreme dissoluteness of they manners these also would both of they be counteract by the impossibility of get further supplies : for owner now unable to replace those slave whom they might lose by speedy purchase in the market would be more careful how they treat they in future and a better treatment would be productive of better moral and here he would just advert to a argument use against those who complain of cruelty in we island which be that it be the interest of master to treat they slave with humanity : but surely it be immediate and present not future and distant interest which be the great spring of action in the affair of mankind why do we make law to punish man it be they interest to be upright and virtuous : but there be a present impulse continually break in upon they better judgment and a impulse which be know to be contrary to they permanent advantage it be ridiculous to say that man would be bind by they interest when gain or ardent passion urge they it might as well be assert that a stone could not be throw into the air or a body move from place to place because the principle of gravitation bind they to the surface of the earth if a planter in the west indy find himself reduce in he profit he do not usually dispose of any part of he slave and he own gratification be never give up so long as there be a possibility of make any retrenchment in the allowance of he slave -- but to return to the subject which he have leave : he be happy to state that as all the cause of the decrease which he have state might be remedy so by the progress of light and reformation these remedy have be gradually come into practice and that as these have increase the decrease of slave have in a equal proportion be lessen by the gradual adoption of these remedy he could prove from the report on the table that the decrease of slave in jamaica have lessen to such a degree that from the year 1774 to the present it be not quite one in a hundred and that in fact they be at present in a state of increase for that the birth in that island at this moment exceed the death by one thousand or eleven hundred per annum barbado nevi antigua and the bermuda be like jamaica lessen they decrease and hold forth a evident and reasonable expectation of a speedy state of increase by natural population but allow the number of negro even to decrease for a time there be method which would insure the welfare of the west indium island the land there might be cultivate by fewer hand and this to greater advantage to the proprietor and to this country by the produce of cinnamon coffee and cotton than by that of sugar the produce of the plantation might also be considerably increase even in the case of sugar with less hand than be at present employ if the owner of they would but introduce machine of husbandry mr long himself long resident as a planter have prove upon he own estate that the plough though so little use in the west indy do the service of a hundred slave and cause the same ground to produce three hogshead of sugar which when cultivate by slave would only produce two the division of work which in free and civilized country be the grand source of wealth and the reduction of the number of domestic servant of whom not less than from twenty to forty be keep in ordinary family afford other resource for this purpose but grant that all these supposition should be unfounded and that everyone of these substitute should fail for a time the planter would be indemnify as be the case in all transaction of commerce by the increase price of they produce in the british market thus by contend against the abolition they be defeat in every part of the argument but he would never give up the point that the number of the slave could be keep up by natural population and without any dependence whatever on the slave trade he therefore call upon the house again to abolish it as a criminal waste of life -- it be utterly unnecessary -- he have prove it so by document contain in the report the merchant of liverpool indeed have think otherwise but he should be cautious how he assent to they opinion they declare last year that it be a lose trade at two slave to a ton and yet they pursue it when restricted to five slave to three ton he believe however that it be upon the whole a lose concern in the same manner as the lottery would be a lose adventure to any company who should buy all the ticket here and there a individual gain a large prize but the majority of adventurer gain nothing the same merchant too have assert that the town of liverpool would be mine by the abolition but liverpool do not depend for its consequence upon the slave trade the whole export-tonnage from that place amount to no less than 170000 ton whereas the export part of it to africa amount only to 13000 liverpool he be sure owe its greatness to other and very different cause the slave trade bearing but a small proportion to its other trade have go through that part of the subject which related to the slave he would now answer two objection which he have frequently hear state the first of these be that the abolition of the slave trade would operate to the total ruin of we navy and to the increase of that of we rival for a answer to these assertion he refer to what he consider to be the most valuable part of the report and for which the house and the country be indebted to the indefatigable exertion of mr clarkson by the report it appear that instead of the slave trade be a nursery for british seaman it be they grave it appear that more seaman die in that trade in one year than in the whole remain trade of the country in two out of 910 sailor in it 216 die in the year while upon a fair average of the same number of man employ in the trade to the east and west indy petersburgh newfoundland and greenland no more than eighty-seven die it appear also that out of 3170 who have leave liverpool in the slave-ship in the year 1787 only 1428 have return and here while he lament the loss which the country thus annually sustain in she seaman he have additionally to lament the barbarous usage which they experience and which this trade by its natural tendency to harden the heart exclusively produce he would just read a extract of a letter from governor parrey of barbado to lord sydney one of the secretary of state the governor declare he could no longer contain himself on account of the ill treatment which the british sailor endure at the hand of they savage captain these be oblige to have they vessel strongly man not only on account of the unhealthiness of the climate of africa but of the necessity of guard the slave and prevent and suppress insurrection and when they arrive in the west indy and be out of all danger from the latter they quarrel with they man on the most frivolous pretence on purpose to discharge they and thus save the payment of supernumerary wages home thus many be leave in a diseased and deplorable state either to perish by sickness or to enter into foreign service great number of whom be for ever lose to they country the governor conclude by declare that the enormity attendant on this trade be so great as to demand the immediate interference of the legislature the next objection to the abolition be that if we be to relinquish the slave trade we rival the french would take it up so that while we should suffer by the measure the evil would still go on and this even to its former extent this be indeed a very weak argument and if it would defend the continuance of the slave trade might equally be urge in favor of robbery murder and every species of wickedness which if we do not practice other would commit but suppose for the sake of argument that they be to take it up what good would it do they what advantage for instance would they derive from this pestilential commerce to they marine should not we on the other hand be benefit by this change would they not be oblige to come to we in consequence of the cheapness of we manufacture for what they want for the african market but he would not calumniate the french nation so much as to suppose that they would carry on the trade if we be to relinquish it he believe on the other hand that they would abolish it also mr necker the minister of france be a man of religious principle and in he work upon the administration of the finances have record he abhorrence of this trade he be happy also to relate a anecdote of the king of france which prove that he be a friend to the abolition for be petition to dissolve a society form at paris for the annihilation of the slave trade he majesty answer that he would not and be happy to hear that so humane a association be form in he dominion and here have mention the society in paris he could not help pay a due compliment to that establish in london for the same purpose which have labor with the greatest assiduity to make this important subject understand and which have conduct itself with so much judgment and moderation as to have interested man of all religion and to have unite they in they cause there be another topic which he would submit to the notice of the house before he conclude they be perhaps not aware that a fair and honorable trade might be substitute in the natural production of africa so that we connexion with that continent in the way of commercial advantage need not be lose the native have already make some advance in it and if they have not appear so forward in raise and collect they own produce for sale as in some other country it be to be imputed to the slave trade : but remove the cause and africa would soon emerge from she present ignorant and indolent state civilization would go on with she as well as with other nation europe three or four century ago be in many part as barbarous as africa at present and chargeable with as bad practice for what would be say if so late as the middle of the thirteenth century he could find a parallel there for the slave trade -- yes this parallel be to be find even in england the people of bristol in the reign of henry the seventh have a regular market for child which be buy by the irish : but the latter have experience a general calamity which they imputed as a judgment from heaven on account of this wicked traffic abolish it the only thing therefore which he have to solicit of the house be to show that they be now as enlighten as the irish be four century back by refuse to buy the child of other nation he hope they would do it he hope too they would do it in a unqualified manner nothing less than a total abolition of the trade would do away the evil complain of the legislature of jamaica indeed have think that regulation might answer the purpose they report have recommend that no person should be kidnap or permit to be make a slave contrary to the custom of africa but might he not be reduce to this state very unjustly and yet by no means contrary to the african law besides how could we distinguish between those who be justly or unjustly reduce to it could we discover they by they physiognomy -- but if we could who would believe that the british captain would be influence by any regulation make in this country to refuse to purchase those who have not be fairly honestly and uprightly enslave they who be offer to we for sale be bring some of they three or four thousand mile and exchange like cattle from one hand to another till they reach the coast but who could return these to they home or make they compensation for they suffering during they long journeying he would now conclude by beg pardon of the house for have detain they so long he could indeed have express he own conviction in fewer word he need only to have make one or two short statement and to have quote the commandment thou shalt do no murder but he think it he duty to lay the whole of the case and the whole of its guilt before they they would see now that no mitigation no palliative would either be efficient or admissible nothing short of a absolute abolition could be adopt this they owe to africa : they owe it too to they own moral character and he hope they would follow up the principle of one of the repentant african captain who have go before the committee of privy council as a voluntary witness and that they would make africa all the atonement in they power for the multifarious injury she have receive at the hand of british subject with respect to these injury they enormity and extent it might be allege in they excuse that they be not fully acquaint with they till that moment and therefore not answerable for they former existence : but now they could no longer plead ignorance concern they they have see they bring directly before they eye and they must decide for themselves and must justify to the world and they own conscience the fact and principle upon which they decision be form mr wilberforce have conclude he speech which last three hour and a half read and lay on the table of the house as subject for they future discussion twelve proposition which he have deduce from the evidence contain in the privy council report and of which the follow be the abridged substance : -- 1 that the number of slave annually carry from the coast of africa in british vessel be about 38000 of which on a average 22500 be carry to the british island and that of the latter only 17500 be retain there 2 that these slave accord to the evidence on the table consist first of prisoner of war secondly of free person sell for debt or on account of real or imputed crime particularly adultery and witchcraft in which case they be frequently sell with they whole family and sometimes for the profit of those by whom they be condemn thirdly of domestic slave sell for the profit of they master in some place at the will of the master and in other on be condemn by they for real or imputed crime fourthly of person make slave by various act of oppression violence or fraud commit either by the prince and chief of those country on they subject or by private individual on each other or lastly by european engage in this traffic 3 that the trade so carry on have necessarily a tendency to occasion frequent and cruel war among the native to produce unjust conviction and punishment for pretended or aggravate crime to encourage act of oppression violence and fraud and to obstruct the natural course of civilization and improvement in those country 4 that africa in its present state furnish several valuable article of commerce which be partly peculiar to itself but that it be adapt to the production of other with which we be now either wholly or in great part supply by foreign nation that a extensive commerce with africa might be substitute in these commodity so as to afford a return for as many article as have annually be carry thither in british vessel : and lastly that such a commerce might reasonably be expect to increase by the progress of civilization there 5 that the slave trade be peculiarly destructive to the seaman employ in it and that the mortality there have be much greater than in any british vessel employ upon the same coast in any other service or trade 6 that the mode of transport the slave from africa to the west indy necessarily expose they to many and grievous suffering for which no regulation could provide a adequate remedy and that in consequence thereof a large proportion have annually perish during the voyage 7 that a large proportion have also perish in the harbor in the west indy from the disease contract in the voyage and the treatment of the same previously to they be sell and that this loss amount to four and a half percent of the import slave 8 that the loss of the newly-imported slave within the three first year after they importation bear a large proportion to the whole number import 9 that the natural increase of population among the slave in the island appear to have be impede principally by the follow cause : -- first by the inequality of the sex in the importation from africa secondly by the general dissoluteness of manners among the slave and the want of proper regulation for the encouragement of marriage and of rear child among they thirdly by the particular disease which be prevalent among they and which be in some instance to be attribute to too severe labor or rigorous treatment and in other to insufficient or improper food fourthly by those disease which affect a large proportion of negro-child in they infancy and by those to which the negro newly import from africa have be find to be particularly liable 10 that the whole number of the slave in the island of jamaica in 1768 be about 167000 in 1774 about 193000 and in 1787 about 256000 : that by compare these number with the number import and retain in the say island during all these year and make proper allowance the annual excess of death above birth be in the proportion of about seven-eighths per cent that in the first six year of this period it be in the proportion of rather more than one on every hundred that in the last thirteen year of the same it be in the proportion of about three-fifths on every hundred and that a number of slave amount to fifteen thousand perish during the latter period in consequence of repeat hurricane and of the want of foreign supplies of provision 11 that the whole number of slave in the island of barbado be in the year 1764 about 70706 in 1774 about 74874 in 1780 about 68270 in 1781 after the hurricane about 63248 and in 1786 about 62115 that by compare these number with the number import into this island -lrb- not allow for any re-exportation -rrb- the annual excess of death above birth in the ten year from 1764 to 1774 be in the proportion of about five on every hundred that in the seven year from 1774 to 1780 it be in the proportion of about one and one-third on every hundred that between the year 1780 and 1781 there have be a decrease in the number of slave of about 5000 that in the six year from 1781 to 1786 the excess of death be in the proportion of rather less than seven-eighths on every hundred that in the four year from 1783 to 1786 it be in the proportion of rather less than one-third on every hundred and that during the whole period there be no doubt that some have be export from the island but considerably more in the first part of this period than in the last 12 that the account from the leeward island and from dominica grenada and st vincent 's do not furnish sufficient grounds for compare the state of population in the say island at different period with the number of slave which have be from time to time import there and export therefrom but that from the evidence which have be receive respect the present state of these island as well as that of jamaica and barbado and from a consideration of the means of obviate the cause which have hitherto operate to impede the natural increase of the slave and of lessen the demand for manual labor without diminish the profit of the planter no considerable or permanent inconvenience would result from discontinue the further importation of african slave these proposition have be lay upon the table of the house lord penrhyn rise in behalf of the planter and next after he mr gascoyne -lrb- both member for liverpool -rrb- in behalf of the merchant concern in the latter place they both predict the ruin and misery which would inevitably follow the abolition of the trade the former say that no less than seventy million be mortgage upon land in the west indy all of which would be lose mr wilberforce therefore should have make a motion to pledge the house to the repayment of this sum before he have bring forward he proposition compensation ought to have be agree upon as a previous necessary measure the latter say that in consequence of the bill of last year many ship be lay up and many seaman out of employ he constituent have large capital engage in the trade and if it be to be wholly do away they would suffer from not know where to employ they : they both join in assert that mr wilberforce have make so many misrepresentation in all the branch of this subject that no reliance whatever be to be place on the picture which he have choose to exhibit they should speak however more fully to this point when the proposition be discuss the latter declaration call up mr wilberforce again who observe that he have no intention of misrepresent any fact : he do not know that he have do it in any one instance but if he have it would be easy to convict he out of the report upon the table mr burke then rise he would not he say detain the committee long : indeed he be not able weary and indispose as he then feel himself even if he have a inclination to do it but as on account of he other parliamentary duty he might not have it in he power to attend the business now before they in its course he would take that opportunity of state he opinion upon it and first the house the nation and all europe be under great obligation to mr wilberforce for have bring this important subject forward he have do it in a manner the most masterly impressive and eloquent he have lay down he principle so admirably and with so much order and force that he speech have equal anything he have ever hear in modern oratory and perhaps it have not be excel by anything to be find in ancient time as to the slave trade itself there could not be two opinion about it where man be not interested a trade begin in savage war prosecute with unheard-of barbarity continue during the transportation with the most loathsome imprisonment and end in perpetual exile and slavery be a trade so horrid in all in circumstance that it be impossible to produce a single argument in its favor on the ground of prudence nothing could be say in defense of it nor could it be justify by necessity it be necessity alone that could be bring to justify inhumanity but no case of necessity could be make out strong enough to justify this monstrous traffic it be therefore the duty of the house to put a end to it and this without further delay this conviction that it become they to do it immediately make he regret -lrb- and it be the only thing he regret in the admirable speech he have hear -rrb- that he honorable friend should have introduce proposition on this subject he could have wish that the business have be bring to a conclusion at once without vote the proposition which have be read to they he be not over fond of abstract proposition they be seldom necessary and often occasion great difficulty embarrassment and delay there be besides no occasion whatever to assign detailed reason for a vote which nature herself dictate and which religion enforce if it should happen that the proposition be not carry in that house or the other such a complication of mischief might follow as might occasion they heartily to lament that they be ever introduce if the ultimate resolution should happen to be lose he be afraid the proposition would pass as waste paper if not be injurious to the cause at a future time and now as the house must bring this matter to a issue he would beg they attention to a particular point he entreat they to look further than the present moment and to ask themselves if they have fortify they mind sufficiently to bear the consequence which might arise from the abolition of the slave trade suppose they should decide upon it when they abandon it other foreign power might take it up and clandestinely supply we island with slave have they virtue enough to see another country reap profit which they themselves have give up and to abstain from that envy natural to rival and firmly to adhere to they determination if so let they thankfully proceed to vote the immediate abolition of the slave trade but if they should repent of they virtue -lrb- and he have know miserable instance of such repentance -rrb- all hope of future reformation of this enormous evil would be lose they would go back to a trade they have abandon with redoubled attachment and would adhere to it with a degree of avidity and shameless ardor to they own humiliation and to the degradation and disgrace of the nation in the eye of all europe these be consideration worth regard before they take a decisive step in a business in which they ought not to move with any other determination than to abide by the consequence at all hazard the honorable gentleman -lrb- who to he eternal honor have introduce this great subject to they notice -rrb- have in he eloquent oration knock at every door and appeal to every passion well know that mankind be govern by they sympathy but there be other passion to be regard man be always ready to obey they sympathy when it cost they nothing but be they prepare to pay the price of they virtue on this great occasion this be the question if they be they would do themselves immortal honor and would have the satisfaction of have do away a commerce which while it be productive of misery not to be describe most of all harden the heart and vitiate the human character with respect to the consequence mention by the two member for liverpool he have a word or two to offer upon they lord penrhyn have talk of million to be lose and pay for but see no probability of any loss ultimately he could see no necessity for compensation he believe on the other hand that the planter would be great gainer by those wholesome regulation which they would be oblige to make if the slave trade be abolish he do not however flatter they with the idea that this gain would be immediate perhaps they might experience inconvenience at first and even some loss but what then with they loss they virtue would be the greater and in this light he hope the house would consider the matter for if they be call upon to do a act of virtuous energy and heroism they ought to think it right to submit to temporary disadvantage for the sake of truth justice humanity and the prospect of greater happiness the other member mr gascoyne have say that he constituent if the trade be abolish could not employ they capital elsewhere but whether they could or not it be the duty of that house if they put they into a traffic which be shocking to humanity and disgraceful to the nation to change they application and not to allow they to be use to a barbarous purpose he believe however that the merchant of liverpool would find no difficulty on this head all capital require active motion it be in they nature not to remain passive and unemployed they would soon turn they into other channel this they have do themselves during the american war for the slave trade be almost wholly lose and yet they have they ship employ either as transport in the service of government or in other way and as he now call upon the house not to allow any conjectural loss to become impediment in the way of the abolition of the slave trade so he call upon they to beware how they suffer any representation of the happiness of the state of slavery in we island to influence they against so glorious a measure admiral barrington have say in he testimony that he have often envy the condition of the slave there but surely the honorable admiral must have mean that as he have often toil like a slave in the defense of he country -lrb- as he many gallant action have prove -rrb- so he envy the day when he be to toil in a similar manner in the same cause if however he word be to be take literally he sensation could only be account for by he have see the negro in the hour of they sport when a sense of the misery of they condition be neither feel by themselves not visible to other but they appearance on such occasion do by no means disprove they low and abject state nothing make a happy slave but a degraded man in proportion as the mind grow callous to its degradation and all sense of manly pride be lose the slave feel comfort in fact he be no longer a man if he be to define a man he would say with shakespeare man be a be hold large discourse look before and after but a slave be incapable of look before and after he have no motive to do it he be a mere passive instrument in the hand of other to be use at they discretion though live he be dead as to all voluntary agency though move amidst the creation with a erect form and with the shape and semblance of a human be he be a nullity as a man mr pitt thank he honorable friend mr wilberforce for have at length introduce this great and important subject to the consideration of the house he thank he also for the perspicuous forcible and masterly manner in which he have treat it he be sure that no argument compatible with any idea of justice could be assign for the continuation of the slave trade and at the same time that he be willing to listen with candor and attention to everything that could be urge on the other side of the question he be sure that the principle from which he opinion be deduce be unalterable he have examine the subject with the anxiety which become he where the happiness and interest of so many thousand be concerned and with the minuteness which would be expect of he on account of the responsible situation which he hold and he aver that it be sophistry obscurity of idea and vagueness of reasoning which alone could have hitherto prevent all mankind -lrb- those immediately interested in the question except -rrb- from agree in one and the same opinion upon the subject with respect to the propriety of introduce the individual proposition which have be offer he differ with mr burke and he thank he honorable friend mr wilberforce for have choose the only way in which it could be make obvious to the world that they be warrant on every ground of reason and of fact in come to that vote which he trust would be the end of they proceed the grounds for the attainment of this end be distinctly state in the proposition let the proposition be bring before the house one by one and argue from the evidence and it would then be see that they be such as no one who be not deaf to the language of reason could deny let they be once enter upon the journal of that house and it be almost impossible they should fail the abolition must be vote as to the mode of it or how it should be effect they be not at present to discuss it but he trust it would be such as would not invite foreign power to supply we island with slave by a clandestine trade after a debt found on the immutable principle of justice be find to be due it be impossible but the country have means to cause it to be pay should such a illicit proceeding be attempt the only language which it become we to adopt be that great britain have resource to enable she to protect she island and to prevent that traffic from be clandestinely carry on by they which she have think fit from a regard to she character to abandon it be highly become great britain to take the lead of other nation in such a virtuous and magnificent measure and he could not but have confidence that they would he incline to share the honor with we or be please to follow we as they example if we be dispose to set about this glorious work in earnest they might he invite to concur with we by a negotiation to be immediately open for that purpose he would only now observe before he sit down in answer to certain idea throw out that he could by no means acquiesce in any compensation for loss which might be sustain by the people of liverpool or by other in any other part of the kingdom in the execution of this just and necessary undertaking sir william yonge say he want no inducement to concur with the honorable mover of the proposition provide the latter could be fairly establish and no serious mischief be to arise from the abolition but he be apprehensive that many evil might follow in the case of any sudden or unlooked-for decrease in the slave they might be destroy by hurricane they might be sweep off by many fatal disorder in these case the owner of they would not be able to fill up they place and they who have lend money upon the land where the loss have happen would foreclose they mortgage he be fearful also that a clandestine trade would be carry on and then the suffering of the african cram up in small vessel which would be oblige to be hover about from day to day to watch a opportunity of landing would be ten time greater than any which they now experience in the legal trade he be glad however as the matter be to be discuss that it have be bring forward in the shape of distinct proposition to be ground upon the evidence in the privy council report mr fox observe that he do not like where he agree as to the substance of a measure to differ with respect to the form of it if however he differ in any thing in the present case it be with a view rather to forward the business than to injure it or to throw anything like a obstacle in its way nothing like either should come from he what he think be that all the proposition be not necessary to be vote previously to the ultimate decision though some of they undoubtedly be he consider they as of two class : the one allege the grounds upon which it be proper to proceed to the abolition such as that the trade be productive of inexpressible misery in various way to the innocent native of africa that it be the grave of we seaman and so on the other merely answer objection which might be start and where there might be a difference of opinion he be however glad that the proposition be likely to be enter upon the journal since if from any misfortune the business should be defer it might succeed another year sure he be that it could not fail to succeed sooner or later he highly approve of what mr pitt have say relative to the language it become we to hold out to foreign power in case of a clandestine trade with respect however to the assertion of sir william yonge that a clandestine trade in slave would be worse than a legal one he could not admit it such a trade if it exist at all ought only to be clandestine a trade in human flesh and sinew be so scandalous that it ought not openly to be carry on by any government whatever and much less by that of a christian country with regard to the regulation of the slave trade he know of no such thing as a regulation of robbery and murder there be no medium the legislature must either abolish it or plead guilty of all the wickedness which have be show to attend it he would now say a word or two with respect to the conduct of foreign nation on this subject it be possible that these when they hear that the matter have be discuss in that house might follow the example or they might go before we and set one themselves if this be to happen though we might be the loser humanity would be the gainer he himself have be think sometimes to use expression relative to france which be too harsh and as if he could only treat she as the enemy of this country politically speak france be we rival but he well know the distinction between political enmity and illiberal prejudice if there be any great and enlighten nation in europe it be france which be as likely as any country upon the face of the globe to catch a spark from the light of we fire and to act upon the present subject with warmth and enthusiasm france have often be improperly stimulate by she ambition and he have no doubt but that in the present instance she would readily follow its honorable dictate mr -lrb- afterwards lord -rrb- grenville would not detain the house by go into a question which have be so ably argue but he should not do justice to he feeling if he do not express publicly to he honorable friend mr wilberforce the pleasure he have receive from one of the most masterly and eloquent speech he have ever hear a speech which while it do honor to he entitle he to the thanks of the house of the people of england of all europe and of the latest posterity he approve of the proposition as the best mode of bring this great question to a happy issue he be pleased also with the language which have be hold out with respect to foreign nation and with we determination to assert we right of prevent we colony from carry on any trade which we have think it we duty to abandon alderman newnham sawbridge and watson though they wish well to the cause of humanity could not as representative of the city of london give they concurrence to a measure which would injure it so essentially as the abolition of the slave trade this trade might undoubtedly be put under wholesome regulation and make productive of great commercial advantage but if it be abolish it would render the city of london one scene of bankruptcy and ruin it become the house to take care while they be give way to the goodness of they heart that they do not contribute to the ruin of the mercantile interest of they country mr martin state that he be so well satisfy with the speech of the honorable gentleman who have introduce the proposition and with the language hold out by other distinguished member on this subject that he feel himself more proud than ever of be a englishman he hope and believe that the melancholy prediction of the worthy alderman would not prove true and that the citizen of london would have too much public spirit to wish that a great national object -lrb- which comprehend the great duty of humanity and justice -rrb- should be set aside merely out of consideration to they own private interest mr dempster expect notwithstanding all he have hear that the first proposition submit to they would have be to make good out of the public purse all the loss individual be liable to sustain from a abolition of the slave trade this ought to have be as lord penrhyn have observe a preliminary measure he do not like to be generous out of the pocket of other they be to abolish the trade it be say out of a principle of humanity undoubtedly they owe humanity to all mankind but they also owe justice to those who be interested in the event of the question and have embark they fortune on the faith of parliament in fact he do not like to see man introduce even they scheme of benevolence to the detriment of other people and much less do he like to see they go to the colony as it be upon they estate and prescribe rule to they for they management with respect to he own speculative opinion as it regard cultivation he have no objection to give it he be sure that sugar could be raise cheaper by free-men than by slave this the practice in china abundantly prove but yet neither he nor any other person have a right to force a system upon other as to the trade itself by which the present labourer be supply it have be consider by that house as so valuable that they have prefer it to all other and have annually vote a considerable sum towards carry it on they have hitherto deem it a essential nursery for we seaman have it really be such as have be represent we ancestor would scarcely have encourage it and therefore upon these and other consideration he could not help think that they would be want in they duty if they abolish it altogether mr william smith would not detain the house long at that late hour upon this important subject but he could not help testify the great satisfaction he feel at the manner in which the honorable gentleman who open the debate -lrb- if it could be so call -rrb- have treat it he approve of the proposition as the best mode of bring the decision to a happy issue he give mr fox great credit for the open and manly way in which he have manifest he abhorrence of this trade and for the support he mean to give to the total and unqualified abolition of it for he be satisfy that the more it be inquire into the more it would be find that nothing short of abolition would cure the evil with respect to certain assertion of the member for liverpool and certain melancholy prediction about the consequence of such a event which other have hold out he desire to lay in he claim for observation upon they when the great question should come before the house soon after this the house break up and the discussion of the proposition which be the next parliamentary measure intend be postpone to a future day which be sufficiently distant to give all the party concerned time to make the necessary preparation for it of this interval the committee for the abolition avail themselves to thank mr wilberforce for the very able and satisfactory manner in which he have state to the house he proposition for the abolition of the slave trade and for the unparalleled assiduity and perseverance with which he have all along endeavor to accomplish this object as well as to take measure themselves for the further promotion of it they opponent avail themselves of this interval also but that which now embarrass they be the evidence contain in the privy council report they have no idea consider the number of witness they have send to be examine that this evidence when duly weigh could by right reasoning have give birth to the sentiment which have be display in the speech of the most distinguished member of the house of common or to the contents of the proposition which have be lay upon they table they be thunderstruck as it be by they own weakness and from this time they be determine if possible to get rid of it as a standard for decision or to interpose every parliamentary delay in they power on the 21st of may the subject come again before the attention of the house it be usher in as be expect by petition collect in the interim and which be expressive of the frightful consequence which would attend the abolition of the slave trade alderman newnham present one from certain merchant in london alderman watson another from certain merchant mortgagee and creditor of the sugar-islands lord maitland another from the planter of antigua mr blackburne another from certain manufacturer of manchester mr gascoyne another from the corporation of liverpool and lord penrhyn other from different interested body in the same town mr wilberforce then move the order of the day for the house to go into a committee of the whole house on the report of the privy council and the several matter of evidence already upon the table relative to the slave trade mr alderman sawbridge immediately arise and ask mr wilberforce if he mean to adduce any other evidence besides that in the privy council report in behalf of he proposition or to admit other witness if such could be find to invalidate they mr wilberforce reply that he be quite satisfied with the report on the table it would establish all he proposition he should call no witness himself as to permission to other to call they that must be determine by the house this question and this answer give birth immediately to great dispute upon the subject alderman sawbridge newnham and watson lord penrhyn and maitland messr gascoyne marsham and other speak against the admission of the evidence which have be lay upon the table they contend that it be insufficient defective and contradictory that it be _ ex parte _ evidence that it have be manufacture by minister that it be found chiefly on hearsay and that the greatest part of it be false that it have undergo no cross-examination that it be unconstitutional and that if they admit it they would establish a dangerous precedent and abandon they rights it be urge on the other hand by mr courtenay that it could not be _ ex parte _ evidence because it contain testimony on both side of the question the circumstance also of its be contradictory which have be allege against it prove that it be the result of a impartial examination mr fox observe that it be perfectly admissible he call upon those who take the other side of the question to say why if it be really inadmissible they have not oppose it at first it have now be a long time on the table and no fault have be find with it the truth be it do not suit they and they be determine by a side-wind as it be to put a end to the inquiry mr pitt observe that if parliament have previously resolve to receive no evidence on a give subject but from the privy council such a resolution indeed would strike at the root of the privilege of the house of common but it be absurd to suppose that the house could upon no occasion receive evidence take where it be most convenient to take it and subject throughout to new investigation if any one doubt its validity the report of the privy council consist first of calculation and account from the public office and next of write document on the subject : both of which be just as authentic as if they have be lay upon the table of that house the remain part of it consist of the testimony of live witness all of whose name be publish so that if any one doubt they veracity it be open to he to re-examine all or each of they it have be say by adversary that the report on the table be a weak and imperfect report but would not these have the advantage of its weakness and imperfection it be strange when he honorable friend mr wilberforce have say weak and imperfect as the report may be think to be i think it strong enough to bear I out in all my proposition that they who object to it should have no better reason to give than this we object because the ground of evidence on which you rest be too weak to support you cause unless it be mean to say -lrb- and the meaning seem to be but thinly disguise -rrb- that the house ought to abandon the inquiry he see no reason whatever for not go immediately into a committee and he wish gentleman to consider whether it become the dignity of they proceedings to obstruct the progress of a inquiry which the house have pledge itself to undertake they conduct indeed seem extraordinary on this occasion it be certainly singular that while the report have be five week upon the table no argument have be bring against its sufficiency but that on the moment when the house be expect to come to a ultimate vote upon the subject it should be think defective contradictory unconstitutional and otherwise objectionable these objection he be satisfied neither do nor could originate with the country gentleman but they be bring forward for purpose not now to be conceal by the avowed enemy of this noble cause in the course of the discussion which arise upon this subject every opportunity be take to impress the house with the dreadful consequence of the abolition mr heriniker read a long letter from the king of dahomey to george the first which have be find among the papers of jame first duke of chando and which have remain in the family till that time in this the king of dahomey boast of he victory over the king of ardrah and how he have ornament the pavement and wall of he palace with the head of the vanquish these cruelty mr henniker say be not imputable to the slave trade they show the african to be naturally a savage people and that we do they a great kindness by take they from they country alderman sawbridge maintain that if the abolition pass the african who could not be sell as slave would be butcher at home while those who have be carry to we island would be no longer under control hence insurrection and the manifold evil which belong to they alderman newnham be certain that the abolition would be the ruin of the trade of the country it would affect even the land interest and the fund it would be impossible to collect money to diminish the national debt every man in the kingdom would feel the abolition come home to hit alderman watson maintain the same argument and pronounce the trade under discussion to be a merciful and humane trade compensation be also insist upon by mr drake alderman newnham mr senniker mr cruger and other this be resist by mr burke who say that compensation in such a case would be contrary to every principle of legislation government give encouragement to any branch of commerce while it be regard as conducive to the welfare of the community or compatible with humanity and justice but they be competent to withdraw they countenance from it when it be find to be immoral and injurious and disgraceful to the state : they who engage in it know the term under which they be place and adopt it with all the risk with which it be accompany and of consequence it be but just that they should be prepare to abide by the loss which might accrue when the public should think it right no longer to support it but such a trade as this it be impossible any longer to support indeed it be not a trade it be a system of robbery it be a system too injurious to the welfare of other nation how could africa ever be civilized under it while we continue to purchase the native they must remain in a state of barbarism it be impossible to civilize slave it be contrary to the system of human nature there be no country place under such disadvantageous circumstance into which the shadow of improvement have ever be introduce great pain be take to impress the house with the propriety of regulation sir gray cooper alderman sawbridge watson and newnham mr marsham and mr cruger contend strenuously for it instead of abolition it be also state that the merchant would consent to any regulation of the trade which might be offer to they in the course of the debate much warmth of temper be manifest on both side the expression of mr fox in a former debate that the slave trade could not be regulate because there could be no regulation of robbery and murder be bring up and construe by planter in the house as a charge of these crime upon themselves mr fox however would not retract the expression he repeat it he have no notion however that any individual would have take it to himself if it contain any reflection at all it be on the whole parliament who have sanction such a trade mr molyneux rise up and animadverted severely on the character of mr ramsay one of the evidence in the privy council report during he residence in the west indy this call up sir william dolben and sir charle middleton in he defense the latter of whom bear honorable testimony to he virtue from a intimate acquaintance with he and a residence in the same village with he for twenty year mr molyneux speak also in angry term of the measure of abolition to annihilate the trade he say and to make no compensation on account of it be a act of swindle mr macnamara call the measure hypocritical fanatic and methodistical mr pitt be so irritated at the insidious attempt to set aside the privy council report when no complaint have be allege against it before that he be quite off he guard and he think it right afterwards to apologize for the warmth into which he have be betray the speaker too be oblige frequently to interfere on this occasion no less than thirty member speak and there have probably be few season when so much disorder have be discoverable in that house the result of the debate be a permission to those interested in the continuance of the slave trade to bring counsel to the bar on the 26th of may and then to introduce such witness as might throw further light on the proposition in the shortest time : for mr pitt only acquiesce in this new measure on a supposition that there would be no unnecessary delay as he could by no means submit to the ultimate procrastination of so important a business he even hope -lrb- and in this hope he be join by mr fox -rrb- that those concern would endeavor to bring the whole of the evidence they mean to offer at the first examination on the day appoint the house meet for the purpose now specify when alderman newnham think that such a important question should not be decide but in a full assembly of the representative of the nation move for a call of the house on that day fortnight mr wilberforce state that he have no objection to such a measure believe the greater the number present the more favourable it would be to he cause this motion however produce a debate and a division in which it appear that there be one hundred and fifty-eight in favor of it and twenty-eight against it the business of the day now commence the house go into a committee and sir william dolben be put into the chair mr serjeant le blanc be then call in he make a able speech in behalf of he client and introduce john barne esquire as he first witness whose examination take up the remainder of the day by this step they who be interested in the continuance of the trade attain they wish for they have now get possession of the ground with they evidence and they know they could keep it almost as long as they please for the purpose of delay thus they who boast when the privy council examination begin that they would soon do away all the idle tale which have be invent against they and who desire the public only to suspend they judgment till the report should come out when they would see the folly and wickedness of all we allegation dare not abide by the evidence which they themselves have teach other to look up to as the standard by which they be desirous of be judge : thus they who have advantage beyond measure in form a body of evidence in they own favor abandon that which they have collect and here it be impossible for I not to make a short comparative statement on this subject if it be only to show how little can be make out with the very best opportunity against the cause of humanity and religion with respect to ourselves we have almost all we witness to seek we have to travel after they for week together when we find they we have scarcely the power of choice we where oblige to take they as they come when we find they too we have generally to implore they to come forward in we behalf of those so implored three out of four refuse and the plea for this refusal be a fear lest they should injure they own interest the merchant on the other hand have they witness ready on the spot they have always ship in harbor contain person who have a knowledge of the subject they have several also from whom to choose if one man be favourable to they cause in three of the point belong to it but be unfavourable in the fourth he could be put aside and replace when they have thus select they they have not to entreat but to command they attendance they have no fear again when they thus command of a refusal on the ground of interest because these be promote they interest by oblige these who employ they view these and other circumstance which might be throw into this comparative statement it be some consolation to we to know amidst the disappointment which this new measure occasion and we apparent defeat in the eye of the public that we have really beat we opponent at they own weapon and that as this be a victory in we own private feeling so it be the presage to we of a future triumph on the 29th of may mr tierney make a motion to divide the consideration of the slave trade into two head by separate the african from the west indian part of the question this he do for the more clear discussion of the proposition as well as to save time this motion however be overrule by mr pitt at length on the 9th of June by which time it be suppose that new light and this in sufficient quantity would have be throw upon the proposition it appear that only two witness have be fully hear the examination therefore be continue and they go on till the 23rd on this day the order for the call of the house which have be prolong stand unrepealed there be a large attendance of member a motion be then make to get rid of the business altogether but it fail it be now see however that it be impossible to bring the question to a final decision in this session for they who be interested in it affirm that they have yet many important witness to introduce alderman newnham therefore by the consent of mr wilberforce move that the further consideration of the subject be defer to the next session on this occasion mr william smith remark that though the decision on the great question be thus to be adjourn he hope the examination at least would be permit to go on he have not hear any good reason why they might not be carry on for some week longer it be know that the hearing of evidence be at all time thinly attend if therefore the few member who do attend be willing to give up they time a little longer why should other member complain of a inconvenience in the suffering of which they take no share he think that by this the examination of witness on the part of the merchant might be finish and of consequence the business bring into a very desirable state of forwardness against the ensue session these observation have not the desire effect and the motion of mr alderman newnham be carry without a division thus the great question for the elucidation of which all the new evidence be to be hear at the very first examination in order that it might be decide by the 9th of June be by the intrigue of we opponent defer to another year the order of the day for go into the further consideration of the slave trade have be discharge sir william dolben rise to state that it be he intention to renew he bill of the former year relative to the conveyance of the unhappy african from they own country to the west indy and to propose certain alteration in it he make a motion accordingly which be adopt and he and mr wilberforce be desire to prepare the same this bill he introduce soon afterwards and it pass but not without opposition it be a matter however of great pleasure to find that the worthy baronet be enable by the assistance of captain -lrb- afterwards admiral -rrb- macbride and other naval officer in the house to carry such clause as provide in some degree for the comfort of the poor seaman who be seduce into this wicked trade they could not indeed provide against the barbarity of they captain but they secure they a space under the half deck in which to sleep they prescribe a form of muster-roll which they be to see and sign in the presence of the clear officer they regulate they food both as to kind and quantity and they preserve they from many of the imposition to which they have be before expose from the time when mr wilberforce give he first notice this session to the present i have be variously employ but more particularly in the composition of a new work it be soon perceive to be the object of we opponent to impress upon the public the preference of regulation to abolition i attempt therefore to show the fallacy and wickedness of this notion i divide the evil belong to the slave trade into two kind these i enumerated in they order with respect to those of the first kind i prove that they be never to be remedy by any act of the british parliament thus for instance what bill could alter the nature of the human passion what bill could prevent fraud and violence in africa while the slave trade exist there what bill could prevent the miserable victim of the trade from rise when on board the ship if they see a opportunity and feel a keen sense of they oppression those of the second i state to admit of a remedy and after make accurate calculation on the subject of each i show that those merchant who be to do they away effectually would be ruin by they voyage the work be call _ a essay on the comparative efficiency of regulation or abolition as apply to the slave trade _ the committee also in this interval bring out they famous print of the plan and section of a slave-ship which be design to give the spectator a idea of the suffering of the african in the middle passage and this so familiarly that he might instantly pronounce upon the misery experience there the committee at plymouth have be the first to suggest the idea but that in london have now improve it as this print seem to make a instantaneous impression of horror upon all who see it and as it be therefore very instrumental in consequence of the wide circulation give it in serve the cause of the injured african i have give the reader a copy of it in the annexed plate and i will now state the ground or basis upon which it be form it must be obvious that it become the committee to select some one ship which have be engage in the slave trade with she real dimension if they mean to make a fair representation of the manner of the transportation when captain parrey of the royal navy return from liverpool to which place government have send he he bring with he the admeasurement of several vessel which have be so employ and lay they on the table of the house of common at the top of he list stand the ship brooke the committee therefore in choose a vessel on this occasion make use of the ship brooke and this they do because they think it less objectionable to take the first that come than any other the vessel then in the plate be the vessel now mention and the follow be she admeasurement as give in by captain parrey ft in length of the lower deck grating and bulk head include at a a 100 0 breadth of beam on the lower deck inside b b 25 4 depth of hold ooo from ceiling to ceiling 10 0 height between deck from deck to deck 5 8 length of the man 's room c c on the lower deck 46 0 breadth of the man 's

committee have proceed thus far think that they should now allow certain dimension for every man woman and child and then see how many person upon such dimension and upon the admeasurement just give could be stow in this vessel they allow accordingly to every man slave 6 ft by 1 ft 4in for room to every woman 5 ft by 1 ft 4 in to every boy 5 ft by 1 ft 2 in and to every girl 4 ft 6 in by 1 ft they then stow they and find they as in the annexed plate that be they find -lrb- deduct the woman stow in z of figure 6 and 7 which space be half of the half-deck be allow by sir william dolben 's last bill to the seaman -rrb- that only 450 could be stow in she and the reader will find if he should think it worthwhile to count the figure in the plate that on make the deduction mention they will amount to this number the committee then think it right to inquire how many slave the act of sir william dolben allow this vessel to carry and they find the number to be 454 that be they find it allow she to carry four more than could be put in without trespassing upon the room allot to the rest for we see that the body of the slave except just at the head of the vessel already touch each other and that no deduction have be make for tub or stanchion to support the platform and deck -lrb- illustration : slave ship -rrb- -lrb- illustration : slave ship -rrb- -lrb- illustration : slave ship -rrb- -lrb- illustration : slave ship -rrb- such be the picture which the committee be oblige to draw if they regard mathematical accuracy of the room allot to the slave in this vessel by this picture be exhibit the nature of the elysium which mr norri and other have invent for they during they transportation from they own country by this picture be see also the advantage of sir william dolben 's bill for many on look at the plate consider the regulation itself as perfect barbarism the advantage however obtain by it be considerable for the brooke be now restricted to 450 slave whereas it be prove that she carry 609 in a former voyage the committee at the conclusion of the session of parliament make a suitable report it will be unnecessary to detail this for obvious reason there be however one thing contain in it which ought not to be omit it state with appropriate concern the death of the first controversial writer and of one of the most able and indefatigable labourer in they cause mr ramsay have be for some time indispose the climate of the west indy during a residence of twenty year and the agitation in which he mind have be keep for the last four year of he life in consequence of the virulent attack on he word and character by those interested in the continuance of the trade have contribute to undermine he constitution during he whole illness he be cheerful and compose nor do he allow it to hinder he severe as it be from take any opportunity which offer of serve those unhappy person for whose injury he have so deeply feel a few day only before he die i receive from he probably the last letter he ever write of which the follow be a extract : my health have certainly take a most alarming turn and if some considerable alteration do not take place for the better in a very little time it will be all over with I : i mean as to the present life i have lose all appetite and suffer grievously from a almost continual pain in my stomach which leave I no enjoyment of myself but such as i can collect from my own reflection and the comfort of religion i be glad the bill for the abolition be in such forwardness whether it go through the house or not the discussion attend it will have a most beneficial effect the whole of this business i think now to be in such a train as to enable I to bid farewell to the present scene with the satisfaction of not have live in vain and of have do something towards the improvement of we common nature and this at no little expense of time and reputation the little i have now write be my utmost effort yet yesterday i think it necessary to write a answer to a scurrilous libel in _ the diary _ by one scipio on my own account he should have remain unnoticed but we great cause must be keep unsullied mr ramsay be a man of active habit of diligence and perseverance in he undertaking and of extraordinary application he be of mild and humble manners he possess a strong understanding with great coolness and courage patriotism and public spirit be striking trait in he character in domestic life he be amiable : in the ministry exemplary and useful and he die to the great regret of he parishioner but most of all to that of those who move with he in he attempt to bring about the important event of the abolition of the slave trade chapter xxv continuation from July 1789 to July 1790 -- author travel to pari to promote the abolition in france attend the committee of the friend of the negro -- counter-attempt of the committee of white colonist -- a account of the deputy of color -- meeting at the duke de la rochefoucauld 's -- mirabeau espouse the cause canvass the national assembly -- distribution of the section of the slave-ship there -- character of brissot -- author leave pari and return to england -- examination of merchant ' and planter ' evidence resume in the house of common -- author travel in search of evidence in favor of the abolition opposition to the hearing of it -- this evidence be at length introduce -- renewal of sir william dolben 's bill -- distribution of the section of the slave-ship in england and of cowper 's negro 's complaint and of wedgewood 's cameo we usually find as we give ourselves up to reflection some little mitigation of the affliction we experience and yet of the evil which come upon we some be often so heavy as to overpower the source of consolation for a time and to leave we wretched this be nearly we situation at the close of the last session of parliament it would be idle not to confess that circumstance have occur which wound we deeply though we have foiled we opponent at they own weapon and have experience the uninterrupted good wish and support of the public we have the great mortification to see the enthusiasm of member of parliament begin to cool to see a question of humanity and justice -lrb- for such it be when it be deliver into they hand -rrb- verge towards that of commercial calculation and finally to see regulation as it related to it in the way of be substitute for abolition but most of all be we affect know as we do the nature and the extent of the suffering belong to the slave trade that these should be continue to another year this last consideration almost overpower I it have fall to my lot more than to that of any other person to know these evil and i seem almost inconsolable at the postponement of the question i wonder how member of parliament and these englishman could talk as they do on this subject how they could bear for a moment to consider they fellow-man as a article of trade and how they should not count even the delay of a hour which occasion so much misery to continue as one of the most criminal action of they life it be in vain however to sink under we burden grief could do no good and if we affair have take a unfavourable turn the question be how to restore they it be sufficiently obvious that if we opponent be leave to themselves or without any counteract evidence they would considerably soften down the proposition if not invalidate they in the mind of many they have such a power of selection of witness that they could bring man forward who might say with truth that they have see but very few of the evil complain of and these in a inferior degree we know also from the example of the liverpool delegate how interest and prejudice could blind the eye and how other might be call upon to give they testimony who would dwell upon the comfort of the african when they come into we power on the sprinkling of they apartment with frankincense on the promotion of music and the dance among they and on the health and festivity of they voyage it seem therefore necessary that we should again be look out for evidence on the part of the abolition nor do it seem to I to be unreasonable if we opponent be allow to come forward in a new way because it be more constitutional that we should be allow the same privilege by these mean the evidence of which we have now lose the use might be restore indifference might be fan into warmth commercial calculation might be overpower by justice and abolition rise above the reach of the cry of regulation might eventually triumph i communicate my idea to the committee and offer to go round the kingdom to accomplish this object the committee have themselves be consider what measure to take and as each in he own mind have come to conclusion similar with my own my proposal be no sooner make than adopt i have not be long upon this journey when i be call back mr wilberforce always solicitous for the good of this great cause be of opinion that as commotion have take place in france which then aim at political reform it be possible that the lead person concern in they might if a application be make to they judiciously be induce to take the slave trade into they consideration and incorporate it among the abuse to be do away such a measure if realize would not only lessen the quantity of human suffering but annihilate a powerful political argument against we he have a conference therefore with the committee on this subject and as they accord with he opinion they unite with he in write a letter to I to know if i would change my journey and proceed to france as i have no object in view but the good of the cause it be immaterial to I where i go if i could but serve it and therefore without any further delay i return to london as account have arrive in england of the excess which have take place in the city of pari and of the agitate state of the province through which i be to pass i be desire by several of my friend to change my name to this i could not consent and on consult the committee they be decidedly against it i be introduce as quickly as possible on my arrival at pari to the friend of the cause there to the duke de la rochefoucauld the marquis de condorcet messieurs ption de villeneuve clavire and brissot and to the marquis de la fayette the latter receive I with peculiar mark of attention he have long feel for the wrong of africa and have do much to prevent they he have a plantation in cayenne and have devise a plan by which the labourer upon it should pass by degree from slavery to freedom with this view he have there lay it down as a principle that all crime be equal whether they be commit by black or whites and ought equally to be punish as the human mind be of such a nature as to be act upon by reward as well as punishment he think it unreasonable that the slave should have no advantage from a stimulus from the former he lay it down therefore as another principle that temporal profit should follow virtuous action to this he subjoin a reasonable education to be gradually give by introduce such principle and by make various regulation for the protection and comfort of the slave he think he could prove to the planter that there be no necessity for the slave trade that the slave upon all they estate would increase sufficiently by population that they might be introduce gradually and without detriment to a state of freedom and that then the real interest of all would be most promote this system he have begin to act upon two year before i see he he have also when the society be establish in pari which take the name of the friend of the negro enrol himself a member of it the first public step take after my arrival in pari be at a committee of the friend of the negro which be but thinly attend none of those mention except brissot be present it be resolve there that the committee should solicit a audience of mr necker and that i should wait upon he accompany by a deputation consist of the marquis de condorcet monsieur de bourge and brissot de warville : secondly that the committee should write to the president of the national assembly and request the favor of he to appoint a day for hear the cause of the negro and thirdly that it should be recommend to the committee in london to draw up a petition to the national assembly of france pray for the abolition of the slave trade by that country this petition it be observe be to be sign by as great a number of the friend to the cause in england as could be procure it be then to be send to the committee at paris who would take it in a body to the place of its destination i find great delicacy as a stranger in make my observation upon these resolution and yet i think i ought not to pass they over wholly in silence but particularly the last i therefore rise up and state that there be one resolution of which i do not quite see the propriety but this might arise from my ignorance of the custom as well as of the genius and spirit of the french people it strike I that a application from a little committee in england to the national assembly of france be not a dignified measure nor be it likely to have weight with such a body it be besides contrary to all the habit of propriety in which i have be educate the british parliament do not usually receive petition from the subject of other nation it be this feeling which have induce I thus to speak to these observation it be reply that the national assembly of france would glory in go contrary to the example of other nation in a case of generosity and justice and that the petition in question if it could be obtain would have a influence there which the people of england unacquainted with the sentiment of the french nation would hardly credit to this i have only to reply that i would communicate the measure to the committee in london but that i could not be answerable for the part they would take in it by a answer receive from mr necker relative to the first of these resolution it appear that the desire interview have be obtain but he grant it only for a few minute and this principally to show he good-will to the cause : for he be then so oppressed with business in he own department that he have but little time for any other he write to I however the next day and desire my company to dinner he then express a wish to I that any business relative to the slave trade might be manage by ourselves as individual and that i would take the opportunity of dine with he occasionally for this purpose by this plan he say both of we would save time madame necker also promise to represent she husband if i should call in he absence and to receive I and converse with I on all occasion in which this great cause of humanity and religion might be concern with respect to the other resolution nothing ever come of they for we wait daily for a answer from the president during the whole of he presidency but we never receive any and the committee in london when they have read my letter desire I unequivocally to say that they do not see the propriety of the petition which it have be recommend to they to obtain at the next meeting it be resolve that a letter should be write to the new president for the same purpose as the former this it be say be now render essentially necessary for the merchant planter and other interested in the continuance of the slave trade be so alarmed at the enthusiasm of the french people in favor of the new order of thing and of any change recommend to they which have the appearance of prompt the cause of liberty that they hold daily committee to watch and to thwart the motion of the friend of the negro it be therefore think proper that the appeal to the assembly should be immediate on this subject before the feeling of the people should cool or before they who be thus interested should poison the mind by calculation of loss and gain the silence of the former president be already attribute to the intrigue of the planter ' committee no time therefore be to be lose the letter be accordingly write but as no answer be ever return to it they attribute this second omission to the same cause i do not really know whether interested person ever do as be suspect intercept the letter of the committee to the two president as now surmise or whether they ever dissuade they from introduce so important a question for discussion when the nation be in such a heated state but certain it be that we have many and i believe barbarous enemy to encounter at the very next meeting of the committee clavire produce anonymous letter which he have receive and in which it be state that if the society of the friend of the negro do not dissolve itself he and the rest of they would be stab it be say that no less than three hundred person have associate themselves for this purpose i have receive similar letter myself and on produce mine and compare the handwriting in both it appear that the same person have write in a few day after this the public print be fill with the most malicious representation of the view of the committee one of they be that they be go to send twelve thousand musket to the negro in st domingo in order to promote a insurrection there this declaration be so industriously circulate that a guard of soldier be send to search the committee-room but these be soon satisfy when they find only two or three book and some waste paper report equally unfounded and wicked be spread also in the same papers relative to myself my name be mention at full length and the place of my abode hint at it be state at one time that i have propose such wild and mischievous plan to the committee in london relative to the abolition of the slave trade that they have cast I out of they own body and that i have take refuge in paris where i now try to impose equally on the french nation it be state at another that i be employ by the british government as a spy and that it be my object to try to undermine the noble constitution which be then form for france this latter report at this particular time when the passion of man be so inflamed and when the stone of pari have not be long purify from the blood of foulon and berthier might have cost I my life and i mention it to general la fayette and solicit he advice he desire I to make a public reply to it : which i do he desire I also to change my lodging to the hotel de yorck that i might be nearer to he and to send to he if there should be any appearance of a collection of people about the hotel and i should have aid from the military in he quarter he say also that he would immediately give in my name to the municipality and that he would pledge himself to they that my view be strictly honorable on dine one day at the house of the marquis de la fayette i meet the deputy of color they have arrive only the precede day from st domingo i be desire to take my seat at dinner in the midst of they they be six in number of a sallow or swarthy complexion but yet it be not darker than that of some of the native of the south of france they be already in the uniform of the parisian national guard and one of they wear the cross of st loui they be man of genteel appearance and modest behavior they seem to be well inform and of a more solid cast than those whom i be in the habit of see daily in this city the account which they give of themselves be this the white people of st domingo consist of less than ten thousand person have deputy then sit in the national assembly the people of color in the same island greatly exceed the whites in number they amount to thirty thousand and be generally proprietor of land they be equally free by law with the former and pay they tax to the mother-country in a equal proportion but in consequence of have spring from slave they have no legislative power and moreover be treat with great contempt believe that the mother-country be go to make a change in its political constitution they have call a meeting on the island and this meeting have depute they to repair to france and to desire the full rights of citizen or that the free people of color might be put upon a equality with the whites they -lrb- the deputy -rrb- have come in consequence they have bring with they a present of six million of livre to the national assembly and a appointment to general la fayette to be commander-in-chief over they constituent as a distinct body this command they say the general have accept though he have decline similar honor from every town in france except pari in order to show that he patronize they cause i be now very anxious to know the sentiment which these gentleman entertain on the subject of the slave trade if they be with we they might be very useful to we not only by they vote in the assembly but by the knowledge of fact which they would be able to adduce there in we favor if they be against we it become I to be upon my guard against they and to take measure accordingly i therefore state to they at once the nature of my errand to france and desire they opinion upon it this they give I without reserve they break out into lavish commendation of my conduct and call I they friend the slave trade they say be the parent of all the misery in st domingo not only on account of the cruel treatment it occasion to the slave but on account of the discord which it constantly keep up between the whites and people of color in consequence of the hateful distinction it introduce these distinction could never be obliterate while it last indeed both the trade and the slavery must fall before the infamy now fix upon a skin of color could be so do away that whites and black could meet cordially and look with respect upon one another they have it in they instruction in case they should obtain a seat in the assembly to propose a immediate abolition of the slave trade and a immediate amelioration of the state of slavery also with a view to its final abolition in fifteen year but time be fly apace i have now be nearly seven week in pari and have do nothing the thought of this make I uneasy and i see no consoling prospect before I i find it even difficult to obtain a meeting of the friend of the negro the marquis de la fayette have no time to attend those of the committee who be member of the national assembly be almost constantly engage at versaille such of they as belong to the municipality have enough to do at the hotel deville other be employ either in learn the use of arm or in keep they daily and nightly guard these circumstance make I almost despair of do anything for the cause at pari at least in any reasonable time but a new circumstance occur which distressed I greatly for i discover in the most satisfactory manner that two out of the six at the last committee be spy they have come into the society for no other reason than to watch and report its motion and they be in direct correspondence with the slave-merchant at havre de grace this matter i bring home to they afterwards and i have the pleasure of see they exclude from all we future meeting from this time i think it expedient to depend less upon the committee and more upon my own exertion and i form the resolution of go among the member of the national assembly myself and of learn from they own mouth the hope i ought to entertain relative to the decision of we question in the course of my endeavor i obtain a promise from the duke de la rochefoucauld the comte de mirabeau the abb siyes monsieur bergasse and monsieur ption de villeneuv five of the most approved member of the national assembly that they would meet I if i would fix a day i obtain a similar promise from the marquis de condorcet and clavire and brissot as member select from the committee of the friend of the negro and messieurs de roveray and du monde two genevese gentleman at versaille man of considerable knowledge and interest and who have hear of we intended meeting be to join we at they own request the place choose be the house of the bishop of chartre at versaille i be now in hope that i should soon bring the question to some issue and on the 4th of October i go to dine with the bishop of chartre to fix the day we appoint the 7th but how soon frequently do we prospects fade from the conversation which take place at dinner i begin to fear that we meeting would not be realize about three day before the officer of the garde du corps have give the memorable banquet record in the annals of the revolution to the officer of the regiment of flander which then lay at versaille this be a topic on which the company present dwelt they condemn it as a most fatal measure in these heated time and be apprehensive that something would grow immediately out of it which might endanger the king 's safety in pass afterwards through the street of versaille my fear increase i meet several of that regiment in group some be brandish they sword other be walk arm in arm and singing tumultuously other be stand and converse earnestly together among the latter i hear one declare with great vehemence that it should not be that the revolution must go on on my arrival at paris in the evening the palais royal be full of people and there be movement and buzzing among they as if something be expect to happen the next day when i go into the street it be obvious what be go to take place suffice it to say that the next evening the king and queen be bring prisoner into pari after this thing be in such a unsettled state for a few day and the member of the national assembly be so occupy in the consideration of the event itself and of the consequence which might attend it that my little meeting of which it have cost I so much time and trouble to procure the appointment be entirely prevent i have now to wait patiently till a new opportunity should occur the comte de mirabeau before the departure of the king have move and carry the resolution that the assembly be inseparable from he majesty 's person it be expect therefore that the national assembly would immediately transfer its sitting to pari this take place on the 19th it be now more easy for I to bring person together than when i have to travel backward and forward to versaille accordingly by watch my opportunity i obtain the promise of another meeting this be hold afterwards at the duke de la rochefoucauld 's the person before mention be present except the comte de mirabeau whose occupation at that moment make it utterly impossible for he to attend the duke open the business in a appropriate manner and conclude by desire each person to give he opinion frankly and unequivocally as to what might be expect of the national assembly relative to the great measure of the abolition of the slave trade the abb siyes rise up and say it would probably bring the business within a shorter compass if instead of discuss this proposition at large i be to put to the meeting my own question i accordingly accept this offer and begin by ask those present how long it be likely that the present national assembly would sit after some conversation it be reply that it would sit till it have complete the constitution and interwoven such fix principle into it that the legislature which should succeed it might have nothing more to do than to proceed on the ordinary business of the state its dissolution would probably not take place till the month of march i then ask they whether it be they opinion that the national assembly would feel itself authorize to take up such a foreign question -lrb- if i might be allow the expression -rrb- as that of the abolition of the slave trade the answer to this be that the object of the national assembly be undoubtedly the formation of a constitution for the french people with respect to foreign possession it be very doubtful whether it be the real interest of france to have any colony at all but while it keep such colony under its dominion the assembly would feel that it have the right to take up this question and that the question itself would naturally spring out of the bill of rights which have already be adopt as the basis of the constitution the next question i propose be whether they be of opinion that the national assembly would do more wisely in the present situation of thing to determine upon the abolition of the slave trade now or to transfer it to the legislature which be to succeed it in the month of march this question give birth to a long discussion during which much eloquence be display but the unanimous answer with the reason for it may be convey in substance as follow : -- it would be most wise it be say in the present assembly to introduce the question to the notice of the nation and this as essentially connect with the bill of rights but to transfer the determination of it in a way the best calculate to ensure success to the succeed legislature the revolution be of more importance to frenchman than the abolition of the slave trade to secure this be they first object and more particularly because the other would naturally flow from it but the revolution might be injure by the immediate determination of the question many person in the large town of bourdeaux marseille rouen nante and havre who be now friend to it might be convert into enemy it would also be hold up by those who wish to produce a counter-revolution -lrb- and the ignorant and prejudiced might believe it -rrb- that the assembly have make a great sacrifice to england by thus give she a opportunity of enlarge she trade the english house of common have take up the subject but have do nothing and though they who be then present be convince of the sincerity of the english minister who have introduce it and that the trade must ultimately fall in england yet it would not be easy to persuade many bigoted person in france of these truth it would therefore be most wise in the assembly only to introduce the subject as mention but if extraordinary circumstance should arise such as a decree that the deputy of color should take they seat in the assembly or that england should have begin this great work advantage might be take of they and the abolition of the slave trade might be resolve upon in the present session the last question i propose be this : -- if the determination of this great question should be propose to the next legislature would it be more difficult to carry it then than now this question also produce much conversation but the answer be unanimous that there would be no greater difficulty in the one than in the other case for that the people would daily more and more admire they constitution that this constitution would go down to the next legislature from whence would issue solid and fixed principle which would be resort to as a standard for decision on all occasion hence the slave trade which would be adjudge by it also could not possibly stand add to which that the most virtuous member in the present would be choose into the new legislature which if the constitution be but once fairly establish would not regard the murmur of any town or province after this a desultory conversation take place in which some be of opinion that it would be proper on the introduction of the subject into the assembly to move for a committee of inquiry which should collect fact and document against the time when it should be take up with a view to its final discussion as it now appear to I that nothing material would be do with respect to we cause till after the election of the new legislature i have thought of return to england to resume my journey in quest of evidence but i judge it right to communicate first with the comte de mirabeau and the marquis de la fayette both of whom would have attend the meeting just mention if unforeseen circumstance have not prevent they on converse with the first i find that he differ from those whom i have consult he think that the question on account of the nature and urgency of it ought to be decide in the present legislature this be so much he opinion that he have make a determination to introduce it there himself and have be prepare for he motion he have already draw up the outline of a speech for the purpose but be in want of circumstantial knowledge to complete it with this knowledge he desire I to furnish he he then put he speech into my hand and wish I to take it home and peruse it he write down also some question and he give they to I directly afterwards and beg i would answer they at my leisure on converse with the latter he say that he believe with those of the meeting that there would be no greater difficulty in carry the question in the succeed than in the present legislature but this consideration afford a argument for the immediate discussion of it for it would make a considerable difference to suffer humanity whether it be to be decide now or then this be the moment to be take to introduce it nor do he think that they ought to be deter from do it by any suppose clamor from some of the town in france the great body of the people admire the constitution and would support any decision which be make in strict conformity to its principle with respect to any committee of inquiry he deprecate it the slave trade he say be not a trade it dishonour the name of commerce it be piracy but if so the question which it involve be a question of justice only and it could not be decide with propriety by any other standard i then inform he that the comte de mirabeau have undertake to introduce it into the assembly at this he express he uneasiness mirabeau say he be a host in himself and i should not be surprise if by he own eloquence and popularity only he be to carry it and yet i regret that he have take the lead in it the cause be so lovely that even ambition abstractedly consider be too impure to take it under its protection and not to sully it it should have be place in the hand of the most virtuous man in france this man be the duc de la rochefoucauld but you can not alter thing now you can not take it out of he hand i be sure he will be second to no one on this occasion on my return to my hotel i peruse the outline of the speech which the comte de mirabeau have lend I it afford a masterly knowledge of the evil of the trade as draw from reason only it be put together in the most striking and affect manner it contain a almost irresistible appeal to he auditor by frequent reference to the ancient system of thing in france and to they situation and prospects under the new it flow at first gently like a river in a level country but it grow afterwards into a mountain-torrent and carry everything before it on look at the question which he have write down for I i find they consist of three 1 what be the different way of reduce to slavery the inhabitant of that part of africa which be under the dominion of france 2 what be the state of society there with respect to government industry and the art 3 what be the various evil belong to the transportation of the african from they own country it be peculiarly agreeable to I to find on read the first two question that i have form a acquaintance with monsieur geoffroy de villeneuve who have be aide-du-camp to the chevalier de bouffler at goree but who be then at he father 's house in pari this gentleman have entertain dr spaarman and mr wadstrom and have accompany they up the senegal when under the protection of the french government in africa he have confirm to I the testimony which they have give before the privy council : but he have a fund of information on this subject which go far beyond what these possess or i have ever yet collect from book or man he have travel all over the kingdom of cayor on foot and have make a map of it he information be so important that i have be with he for almost day together to take it down i determine therefore to arrange the fact which i have obtain from he of which i have now a volume that i might answer the two first question which have be propose to I for it be of great importance to the comte de mirabeau that he should be able to appeal in behalf of the statement in he speech to the assembly to a evidence on the spot in the course of my correspondence with the comte which continue with but little intermission for six week many circumstance take place which be connect with the cause and which i shall now detail in they order on wait upon mr necker at he own request he give I the please intelligence that the committee of finances which be then compose of member of the national assembly have resolve though they have not yet promulgate they resolution upon a total abolition of all the bounty then in existence in favor of the slave trade the deputy of color now begin to visit I at my own hotel they inform I that they have be admit since they have see I into the national assembly on state they claim the president assure they that they might take courage for that the assembly know no distinction between black and whites but consider all man as have equal rights this speech of the president they say have rouse all the white colonist in paris some of these have openly insult they they have hold also a meeting on the subject of this speech at which they have work themselves up so as to become quite furious nothing but intrigue be now go forward among they to put off the consideration of the claim of the free people of color they the deputy have be flatter by the prospect of a hearing no less than six time and when the day arrive something have constantly occur to prevent it at a subsequent interview they appear to be quite disheartened and to be grievously disappoint as to the object of they mission they be now sure that they should never be able to make head against the intrigue and plot of the white colonist day after day have be fix as before for the hearing of they cause day after day it have be defer in like manner they be now weary with wait one of they og could not contain himself but break out with great warmth -- i begin say he not to care whether the national assembly will admit we or not but let it beware of the consequence we will no longer continue to be behold in a degraded light dispatch shall go directly to st domingo and we will soon follow they we can produce as good soldier on we estate as those in france we own arm shall make we independent and respectable if we be once force to desperate measure it will be in vain that thousand will be send across the atlantic to bring we back to we former state on hearing this i entreated the deputy to wait with patience i observe to they that in a great revolution like that of france thing but more particularly such as might be think external could not be discuss either so soon or so rapidly as man full of enthusiasm would wish france would first take care of herself she would then i have no doubt extend she care to she colony be not this a reasonable conclusion when they the deputy have almost all the first man in the assembly in they favor i entreated they therefore to wait patiently as well as upon another consideration which be that by a imprudent conduct they might not only ruin they own cause in france but bring indescribable misery upon they native land by this time a large packet for which i have send from england arrive it consist of above a thousand of the plan and section of a slave-ship with a explanation in french it contain also about five hundred color engraving make from two view which mr wadstrom have take in africa the first of these represent the town of joal and the king 's military on horseback return to it after have execute the great pillage with they slave the other represent the village of bain from whence ruffian be force a poor woman and she child to sell they to a ship which be then lie in the road both these scene mr wadstrom have witness i have collect also by this time one thousand of my essay on the _ impolicy of the slave trade _ which have be translate into the french language these i now wish to distribute as preparatory to the motion of mirabeau among the national assembly this distribution be afterwards undertake and effect by the archbishop of aix the bishop of chartre the marquis de la fayette the duc de la rochefoucauld the comte de mirabeau monsieur necker the marquis de condorcet messieurs ption de villeneuve bergasse clavire and brissot and by the marchioness de la fayette madame necker and madame de poivre the latter of whom be the widow of the late intendant of the isle of france this distribution have not be long begin before i witness its effect the virtuous abb gregoire and several member of the national assembly call upon I the section of the slave-ship it appear have be the means of draw they towards I they wish for more accurate information concern it indeed it make its impression upon all who see it the bishop of chartre once tell I that when he first espouse we cause he do it at once for it seem obvious to he that no one could under the christian dispensation hold another as he slave and it be no less obvious where such a unnatural state exist that there would be great abuse but that nevertheless he have not give credit to all the tale which have be relate of the slave trade till he have see this plate after which there be nothing so barbarous which might not readily be believe the archbishop of aix when i first show he the same plate be so strike with horror that he could scarcely speak : and when mirabeau first see it he be so impressed by it that he order a mechanic to make a model of it in wood at a considerable expense this model he keep afterwards in he dining-room it be a ship in miniature about a yard long and little wooden man and woman which be paint black to represent the slave be see stow in they proper place but while the distribution of these different article thus contribute to make we many friend it call forth the extraordinary exertion of we enemy the merchant and other interested in the continuance of the slave trade write letter to the archbishop of aix beseech he not to ruin france which he would inevitably do if as then president he be to grant a day for hear the question of the abolition offer of money be make to mirabeau from the same quarter if he would totally abandon he motion a attempt be make to establish a colonial committee consist of such planter as be member of the national assembly upon whom it should devolve to consider and report upon all matter relate to the colony before they could be determine there book be circulate in abundance in opposition to mine resort be again have to the public papers as the means of raise a hue and cry against the principle of the friend of the negro i be again denounce as a spy and as one send by the english minister to bribe member in the assembly to do that in a time of public agitation which in the settled state of france they could never have be prevail upon to accomplish and as a proof that this be my errand it be request of every frenchman to put to himself the follow question how it happen that england which have consider the subject coolly and deliberately for eighteen month and this in a state of internal peace and quietness have not abolish the slave trade the clamor which be now make against the abolition pervade all pari and reach the ear of the king mr necker have a long conversation with he upon it the latter send for I immediately he inform I that he majesty be desirous of make himself master of the question and have express a wish to see my _ essay on the impolicy of the slave trade _ he desire to have two copy of it one in french and the other in english and he would then take he choice as to which of they he would read he -lrb- mr necker -rrb- be to present they he would take with he also at the same time the beautiful specimen of the manufacture of the african which i have lend to madame necker out of the cabinet of monsieur geoffroy de villeneuve and other as to the section of the slave-ship he think it would affect he majesty too much as he be then indispose all these article except the latter be at length present the king bestow a good deal of time upon the specimen he admire they but particularly those in gold he express he surprise at the state of some of the art in africa he send they back on the same day on which he have examine they and commission mr necker to return I he thanks and to say that he have be highly gratify with what he have see and with respect to the _ essay on the impolicy of the slave trade _ that he would read it with all the seriousness which such a subject deserve my correspondence with the comte de mirabeau be now draw near to its close i have send he a letter every other day for a whole month which contain from sixteen to twenty page he usually acknowledge the receipt of each hence many of he letter come into my possession : these be always interesting on account of the richness of the expression they contain mirabeau even in he ordinary discourse be eloquent it be he peculiar talent to use such word that they who hear they be almost lead to believe that he have take great pain to cull they for the occasion but this he ordinary language be the language also of he letter and as they show a power of expression by which the reader may judge of the character of the eloquence of one who be then undoubtedly the greatest orator in france i have think it not improper to submit one of they to he perusal in the annexed note -lrb- a -rrb- i could have wish as far as it relate to myself that it have be less complimentary it must be observe however that i have already write to he more than two hundred page with my own hand and as this be do at no small expense time and trouble and solely to qualify he for the office of do good he could not but set some value upon my labor -lrb- footnote a : je fai toujor mille remercimen plus empresss et plus affectueux  monsieur clarkson pour la vertueuse profusion de se lumires de se recherch et

du matin jusqu '  midi non seulement avec un vif plaisir mais avec une sensible reconnaissance 25_th __ dcembre _ 1789 -rrb- when we correspondence be over i have some conversation with he relative to fix a day for the motion but he judge it prudent previously to this to sound some of the member of the assembly on the subject of it this he do but he be greatly disappoint at the result there be not one member out of all those with whom he converse who have not be canvass by the planter ' committee and though most of they have be proof against all its intrigue and artifice yet many of they hesitate respect the abolition at that moment there be a fear in some that they should injure the revolution by adopt it other who have no such fear wish for the concurrence of england in the measure and suggest the propriety of a deputation there for that purpose previously to the discussion of the question in france while other maintain that as england have do nothing after have have it so long under consideration it be fair to presume that she judge it impolitic to abandon the slave trade but if france be to give it up and england to continue it how would humanity be the gainer while the comte de mirabeau be continue he canvass among the member of the national assembly relative to he motion attempt be again make in the public papers to mislead they emancipation be now state to be the object of the friend of the negro this charge i repel by address myself to monsieur beauvet i explain to he the view of the different society which have take up the cause of the african and i desire he to show my letter to the planter i be oblige also to answer publicly a letter by monsieur mosneron de laung this writer profess to detail the substance of the privy council report he have the injustice to assert that three thing have be distinctly prove there : first that slavery have always exist in africa secondly that the native be a bloody people addict to human sacrifice and other barbarous custom and thirdly that they soil be incapable of produce any proper article for commerce from these premise he argue as if they have be establish by the unanimous and uncontradicted testimony of the witness and he draw the conclusion that not only have england do nothing in consequence but that she never would do anything which should affect the existence of this trade but these letter have only just make they appearance in the public papers when i be summon to england parliament it appear have meet and i be immediately to leave paris among those of whom i have but just time to take leave be the deputy of color at this my last conference with they i recommend moderation and forbearance as the best gift i could leave they and i entreated they rather to give up they seat in the assembly than on that account to bring misery on they country for that with patience they cause would ultimately triumph they reply that i have prescribe to they a most difficult task they be afraid that neither the conduct of the white colonist nor of the national assembly could be much longer bear they thank I however for my advice one of they give I a trinket by which i might remember he and as for himself he say he should never forget one who have take such a deep interest in the welfare of he mother -lrb- a -rrb- i find however notwithstanding all i say that there be a spirit of dissatisfaction in they which nothing but a redress of they grievance could subdue and that if the planter should persevere in they intrigue and the national assembly in delay a fire would be light up in st domingo which could not easily be extinguish this be afterwards realize : for og in about three month from this time leave he companion to report to he constituent in st domingo the state of they mission when hear on he arrival in that island of the outrageous conduct of the whites of the committee of aquin who have begin a persecution of the people of color for no other reason than that they have dare to seek the common privilege of citizen and of the murder of ferrand and labadie he imprudently arm he slave with a small but faithful band he rush upon superior number and be defeat take refuge at length in the spanish part of st domingo he be give up and he enemy to strike terror into the people of color break he upon the wheel from this time reconciliation between the party become impossible a bloody war commence and with it all those horror which it have be we lot so frequently to deplore it must be remembered however that the slave trade by means of the cruel distinction it occasion be the original cause and though the revolution of france afford the occasion it be a occasion which would have be prevent if it have not be for the intrigue and injustice of the whites -lrb- footnote a : africa -rrb- another upon whom i have time to call be the amiable bishop of chartre when i leave he the abb siyes who be with he desire to walk with I to my hotel he there present I with a set of he work which he send for while he staid with I and on parting he make use of this complimentary expression in allusion i suppose to the cause i have undertake -- i be pleased to have be acquaint with the friend of man it be necessary that i should see the comte de mirabeau and the marquis de la fayette before i leave paris i have write to each of they to communicate the intelligence of my departure as soon as i receive it the comte it appear have nearly canvass the assembly he could count upon three hundred member who for the sake of justice and without any consideration of policy or of consequence would support he motion but alas what proportion do this number bear to twelve hundred about five hundred more would support he but only on one condition which be if england would give a unequivocal proof of she intention to abolish the trade the knowledge of these circumstance he say have induce he to write a letter to mr pitt in this he have explain how far he could proceed without he assistance and how far with it he have frankly develop to he the mind and temper of the assembly on this subject but he answer must be immediate for the white colonist be daily gain such a influence there that he forsaw that it would be impossible to carry the measure if it be long delay on take leave of he he desire I to be the bearer of the letter and to present it to mr pitt on converse with the marquis de la fayette he lament deeply the unexpected turn which the cause of the negro have lately take in the assembly it be entirely owe to the daily intrigue of the white colonist he fear they would ruin everything if the deputy of color have be hear on they arrival they rights would have be acknowledge but now there be little probability that they would obtain they he foresee nothing but desolation in st domingo with respect to the abolition of the slave trade it might be yet carry but not unless england would concur in the measure on this topic he enlarged with much feeling he hope the day be near at hand when two great nation which have be hitherto distinguish only for they hostility one toward the other would unite in so sublime a measure and that they would follow up they union by another still more lovely for the preservation of eternal and universal peace thus they future rivalship might have the extraordinary merit of be rivalship in good thus the revolution of france through the mighty aid of england might become the source of civilization of freedom and of happiness to the whole world no other nation be sufficiently enlighten for such a union but all other nation might be benefit by it the last person whom i saw be brissot he accompany I to my carriage with he therefore i shall end my french account and i shall end it in no way so satisfactory to myself as in a very concise vindication of he character from actual knowledge against the attack of those who have endeavor to disparage it but who never know he justice and truth i be convinced demand some little declaration on this subject at my hand brissot then be a man of plain and modest appearance he habit contrary to those of he countryman in general be domestic in he own family he set a amiable example both as a husband and as a father on all occasion he be a faithful friend he be particularly watchful over he private conduct from the simplicity of he appearance and the severity of he moral he be call the quaker at least in all the circle which i frequented he be a man of deep feeling he be charitable to the poor as far as a slender income permit he but he benevolence go beyond the usual bound he be no patriot in the ordinary acceptation of the word for he take the habitable globe as he country and wish to consider every foreigner as he brother i leave france as it may be easily imagine much disappointed that my labor which have be of nearly six month continuance should have have no better success nor do i see in look forward any circumstance that be console with respect to the issue of they there for it be impossible that mr pitt even if he have be incline to write to mirabeau circumstance as matter then be with respect to the hearing of evidence could have give he a promise at least of a speedy abolition and unless he answer have be immediate it would have arrive see that the french planter be daily profit by they intrigue too late to be effectual i have but just arrive in england when mr wilberforce make a new motion in the house of common on the subject of the slave trade in refer to the transaction of the last session he find that twenty-eight day have be allot to the hearing of witness against the abolition and that eleven person only have be examine in that time if the examination be to go on in the same manner they might be make to last for year he resolve therefore to move that instead of hear evidence in future in the house at large member should hear it in a open committee above stair which committee should sit notwithstanding any adjournment of the house itself this motion he make and in do it he take a opportunity of correct a erroneous report which be that he have change he mind on this great subject this be he say so far from be the case that the more he contemplate the trade the more enormous he find it and the more he feel himself compel to persevere in endeavor for its abolition one would have think that a motion so reasonable and so constitutional would have meet with the approbation of all but it be vehemently oppose by mr gascoyne alderman newnham and other the plea set up be that there be no precedent for refer a question of such importance to a committee it be now obvious that the real object of we opponent in abandon decision by the privy council evidence be delay unable to meet we there they be glad to fly to any measure which should enable they to put off the evil day this charge be fix upon they in unequivocal language by mr fox who observe besides that if the member of the house should then resolve to hear evidence in a committee of the whole house as before it would amount to a resolution that the question of the abolition of the slave trade should be put by or at least that it should never be decide by they after a long debate the motion of mr wilberforce be vote without a division and the examination of witness proceed in behalf of those who be interested in the continuance of the trade this measure have be resolve upon by which despatch in the examination be promote i be alarm lest we should be call upon for we own evidence before we be fully prepare the time which i have originally allot for the discovery of new witness have be take up if not waste in france in look over the name of the sixteen who be to have be examine by the committee of privy council if there have be time one have die and eight who be sea-faring people be out of the kingdom it be time therefore to stir immediately in this business happily on look over my letter which i find on my arrival in england the name of several have be hand to I with the place of they abode who could give I information on the subject of we question all these i visit with the utmost despatch i be absent only three week i have travel a thousand mile in this time have converse with seventeen person and have prevail upon three to be examine i have scarcely return with the addition of these witness to my list when i find it necessary to go out again upon the same errand this second journey arise in part from the follow circumstance there be a matter in dispute relative to the mode of obtain slave in the river of calabar and bonny it be usual when the slave-ship lay there for a number of canoe to go into the inland country these go in a fleet there might be from thirty to forty armed native in each of they every canoe also have a four or a six-pounder -lrb- cannon -rrb- fasten to she bow equip in this manner they depart and they be usually absent from eight to fourteen day it be say that they go to fair which be hold on the bank of these river and at which there be a regular show of slave on they return they usually bring down from eight hundred to a thousand of these for the ship these lay at the bottom of the canoe they arm and leg have be first bind by the rope of the country now the question be how the people thus go up these river obtain they slave it be certainly a very suspicious circumstance that such a number of person should go out upon these occasion and that they should be arm in such a manner we presume therefore that though they might buy many of the slave whom they bring down at the fair which have be mention they obtain other by violence as opportunity offer this inference we press upon we opponent and call upon they to show what circumstance make such warlike preparation necessary on these excursion to this they reply readily the people in the canoe say they pass through the territory of different petty prince to each of whom on enter he territory they pay a tribute or toll this tribute have be long fix but attempt frequently have be make to raise it they who follow the trade can not afford to submit to these unreasonable demand and therefore they arm themselves in case of any determination on the part of these petty prince to enforce they this answer we never judge to be satisfactory we try therefore to throw light upon the subject by inquire if the native who go upon these expedition usually take with they as many goods as would amount to the number of the slave they be accustom to bring back with they but we could get no direct answer from any actual knowledge to this question all have see the canoe go out and return but no one have see they loaded or have be on board they it appear however from circumstantial evidence that though the native on these occasion might take some article of trade with they it be impossible from appearance that they could take they in the proportion mention we maintain then we inference as before but it be still uniformly deny how then be we to decide this important question for it be say that no white man be ever permit by the native to go up in these canoe on mention accidentally the circumstance of the case as i have now state they to a friend immediately on my return from my last journey he inform I that he himself have be in company about a year before with a sailor a very respectable-looking man who have be up these river he have spend half a hour with he at a inn he describe he person to I but he know nothing of he name or of the place of he abode all he know be that he be either go or that he belong to some ship of war in ordinary but he could not tell at what port i might depend upon all these circumstance if the man have not deceive he and he see no reason why he should i feel myself set on fire as it be by this intelligence deficient as it be and i seem to determine instantly that i would if it be possible find he out for if we suspicion be true that the native frequently be kidnap in these expedition it would be of great importance to the cause of the abolition to have they confirm for as many slave come annually from these two river as from all the coast of africa besides but how to proceed on so blind a errand be the question i first thought of try to trace the man by letter but this might be tedious the examination be now go on rapidly we should soon be call upon for evidence ourselves besides i know nothing of he name i then think it to be a more effectual way to apply to sir charle middleton as comptroller of the navy by whose permission i could board every ship of war in ordinary in england and judge for myself but here the undertaking seem very arduous and the time it would consume become a objection in this respect that i think i could not easily forgive myself if i be to fail in it my inclination however preponderate this way at length i determine to follow it for on deliberate consideration i find that i could not employ my time more advantageously to the cause for as other witness must be find out somewhere it be highly probable that if i should fail in the discovery of this man i should by move among such a number of sea-faring people find other who could give they testimony in we favor i must now inform the reader that ship of war in ordinary in one of which this man be report to be be those which be out of commission and which be lay up in the different river and water in the neighborhood of the king 's dock-yard every one of these have a boatswain gunner carpenter and assistant on board they lie usually in division of ten or twelve and a master in the navy have a command over every division at length i begin my journey i boarded all the ship of war lie in ordinary at deptford and examine the different person in each from deptford i proceed to woolwich where i do the same thence i hasten to chatham and then down the medway to sheerness i have now board above a hundred and sixty vessel of war i have find out two good and willing evidence among they but i could gain no intelligence of he who be the object of my search from chatham i make the best of my way to portsmouth harbor a very formidable task present itself here but the master ' boat be ready for I and i continue my pursuit on board the pegase on the second day i discover a very respectable person in the gunner of that ship he name be george millar he have be on board the canterbury slaveship at the dreadful massacre at calabar he be the only disinterested evidence living of whom i have yet hear he express he willingness to give he testimony if he presence should be think necessary in london i then continue my pursuit for the remainder of the day on the next day i resume and finish it for this quarter i have now examine the different person in more than a hundred vessel in this harbor but i have not discover the person i have go to seek matter now begin to look rather disheartening i mean as far as my grand object be concern there be but one other port leave and this be between two and three hundred mile distant i determine however to go to plymouth i have already be more successful in this tour with respect to obtain general evidence than in any other of the same length and the probability be that as i should continue to move among the same kind of people my success would be in a similar proportion accord to the number visit these be great encouragement to I to proceed at length i arrive at the place of my last hope on my first day 's expedition i boarded forty vessel but find no one in these who have be on the coast of africa in the slave trade one or two have be there in king 's ship but they have never be on shore thing be now draw near to a close and notwithstanding my success as to general evidence in this journey my heart begin to beat i be restless and uneasy during the night the next morning i feel agitate again between the alternate pressure of hope and fear and in this state i enter my boat the fifty-seventh vessel which i board in this harbor be the melampus frigate one person belong to it on examine he in the captain 's cabin say he have be two voyage to africa and i have not long discourse with he before i find to my inexpressible joy that he be the man i find too that he unravel the question in dispute precisely as we inference have determine it he have be two expedition up the river calabar in the canoe of the native in the first of these they come within a certain distance of a village they then conceal themselves under the bush which hang over the water from the bank in this position they remain during day-light but at night they go up to it armed and seize all the inhabitant who have not time to make they escape they obtain forty-five person in this manner in the second they be out eight or nine day when they make a similar attempt and with nearly similar success they seize man woman and child as they could find they in the hut they then bind they arm and drive they before they to the canoe the name of the person thus discover on board the melampus be isaac parker on inquire into he character from the master of the division i find it highly respectable i find also afterwards that he have sail with captain cook with great credit to himself round the world it be also remarkable that my brother on see he in london when he go to deliver he evidence recognize he as have serve on board the monarch man-of-war and as one of the most exemplary man in that ship i return now in triumph i have be out only three week and i have find out this extraordinary person and five respectable witness besides these add to the three discover in the last journey and to those provide before make we more formidable than at any former period so that the delay of we opponent which we have look upon as so great a evil prove in the end truly serviceable to we cause on go into the committee-room of the house of common on my return i find that the examination be still go on in the behalf of those who be interested in the continuance of the trade and they go on beyond the middle of April when it be consider that they have close mr wilberforce move accordingly on the 23rd of the same month that captain thoma wilson of the royal navy and that charle bern wadstrom and henry hew dalrymple esqr do attend as witness on the behalf of the abolition there be nothing now but clamor from those on the opposite side of the question they know well that there be but few member of the house of common who have read the privy council report they know therefore that if the question be to be decide by evidence it must be decide by that which they own witness have give before parliament but this be the evidence only on one side it be certain therefore if the decision be to be make upon this basis that it must be entirely in they favor will it then be believe that in a english house of common there could be find person who could move to prevent the hearing of any other witness on this subject and what be more remarkable that they should charge mr wilberforce because he propose the hearing of they with the intention solely of delay yes such person be find but happily only among the friend of the slave trade mr wilberforce in reply to they could not help observe that it be rather extraordinary that they who have occasion the delay of a whole year should charge he with that of which they themselves have be so conspicuously guilty he then comment for some time on the injustice of they motion he state too that he would undertake to remove from disinterested and unprejudiced person many of the impression which have be make by the witness against the abolition and he appeal to the justice and honor of the house in behalf of a injured people under the hope that they would not allow a decision to be make till they have hear the whole of the case these observation however do not satisfy all those who belong to the opposite party lord penrhyn contend for a decision without a moment 's delay mr gascoyne relent and say he would allow three week to the abolitionist during which they evidence might be hear at length the debate end in the course of which mr pitt and mr fox powerfully support mr wilberforce when the motion be negative without any attempt at a division the witness in behalf of the abolition of the slave trade now take possession of the ground which those in favor of it have leave but what be we surprise when only three of they have be hear to find that mr norri should come forward as a evidence this he do to confirm what he have state to the privy council as to the general question but he do it more particularly as it appear afterwards in the justification of he own conduct : for the part which he have take at liverpool as it related to I have become a subject of conversation with many it be now well know what assistance he have give I there in my pursuit how he have even furnished I with clause for a bill for the abolition of the trade how i have write to he in consequence of he friendly co-operation to come up as a evidence in we favor and how at that moment he have accept the office of a delegate on the contrary side the noise which the relation and repetition of these and other circumstance have make have give he i believe considerable pain he friend too have urge some explanation as necessary but how short-sighted be they who do wrong by come forward in this imprudent manner he fix the stain only the more indelibly on himself for he thus impose upon I the cruel necessity of be examine against he and this necessity be the more afflict to I because i be to be call upon not to state fact relative to the trade but to destroy he character as a evidence in its support i be to be call upon in fact to explain all those communication which have be state to have take place between we on this subject glad indeed should i have be to have decline this painful interference but no one would hear of a refusal the bishop of london mr pitt and mr wilberforce consider my appearance on this occasion as a imperious duty to the cause of the oppressed it may be perhaps sufficient to say that i be examine that mr norri be present all the time that i be cross-examine by counsel and that after this time mr norri seem to have no ordinary sense of he own degradation for he never afterwards hold up he head or look the abolitionist in the face or act with energy as a delegate as on former occasion the hearing of evidence continue to go on in behalf of the abolition of the trade no less than twenty-four witness altogether be hear in this session and here it may not be improper to remark that during the examination of we own witness as well as the cross-examination of those of we opponent no counsel be ever employ mr wilberforce and mr william smith undertake this laborious department and as they perform it with great ability so they do it with great liberality towards those who be oblige to come under they notice in the course of this fiery ordeal the bill of sir william dolben be now to be renew on this occasion the enemy of the abolition become again conspicuous for on the 26th of may they avail themselves of a thin house to propose a amendment by which they increase the number of the slave to the tonnage of the vessel they increase it too without take into the account as have hitherto be do the extent of the superficies of the vessel which be to carry they this be the third indecorous attempt against what be only reasonable and expected proceedings in the present session but they advantage be of no great duration for the very next day the amendment be reject on the report by a majority of ninety-five to sixty-nine in consequence principally of the private exertion of mr pitt of this bill though it be renew in other year besides the present i shall say no more in this _ history _ because it have nothing to do with the general question horrible as it yet leave the situation of the poor slave in they transportation -lrb- which the plate have most abundantly show -rrb- it be the best bill which could be then obtain and it answer to a certain degree the benevolent wish of the worthy baronet who introduce it : for if we could conclude that these voyage be make more comfortable to the injured african in proportion as there be less mortality in they he have undoubtedly the pleasure of see the end at least partially obtain though he must always have feel a great drawback from it by reflect that the survivor however they suffering might have be a little diminished be reserve for slavery the session be now near its close and we have the sorrow to find though we have defeat we opponent in the three instance which have be mention that the tide run decidedly against we upon the general question in the house of common the same statement which have strike so many member with panic in the former session such as that of emancipation of the ruin and massacre of the planter and of indemnification to the amount of seventy million have be industriously keep up and this by a personal canvass among they but this hostile disposition be still unfortunately increase by consideration of another sort for the witness of we opponent have take they ground first no less than eleven of they have be examine in the last session in the present two-third of the time have be occupy by other on the same side hence the impression upon this ground also be against we and we have yet have no adequate opportunity of do it away a clamor be also raise where we think it least likely to have originate they -lrb- the planter -rrb- it be say have produce person in elevated life and of the highest character as witness whereas we have be oblige to take up with those of the lowest condition this idea be circulate directly after the introduction of isaac parker before mention a simple mariner and who be now contrast with the admiral on the other side of the question this outcry be not only ungenerous but unconstitutional it be the glory of the english law that it have no scale of veracity which it adapt to person accord to the station which they may be find to occupy in life in we court of law the poor be hear as well as the rich and if they reputation be fair and they stand proof against the cross-examination they undergo both the judge and the jury must determine the matter in dispute by they evidence but the house of common be now call upon by we opponent to adopt the preposterous maxim of attach falsehood to poverty or of weigh truth by the standard of rank and riches but though we feel a considerable degree of pain in find this adverse disposition among so many member of the lower house it be some consolation to we to know that we cause have not suffer with they constituent -- the people these be still warmly with we indeed they hatred of the trade have greatly increase many circumstance have occur in this year to promote it the committee during my absence in france have circulate the plate of the slave-ship throughout all england no one see it but he be impressed it speak to he in a language which be at once intelligible and irresistible it bring forth the tear of sympathy in behalf of the sufferer and it fix they suffering in he heart the committee too have be particularly vigilant during the whole of the year with respect to the public papers they have suffer no statement in behalf of those interested in the continuance of the trade to go unanswered dr dickson the author of the _ letter on slavery _ before mention have come forward again with he service on this occasion and by he active co-operation with a sub-committee appoint for the purpose the coast be so well clear of we opponent that though they be see the next year again through the medium of the same papers they appear only in sudden incursion as it be during which they dart a few weapon at we but they never afterward venture upon the plain to dispute the matter inch by inch or point by point in a open and manly manner but other circumstance occur to keep up a hatred of the trade among the people in this interval which trivial as they be ought not to be forget the amiable poet cowper have frequently make the slave trade the subject of he contemplation he have already severely condemn it in he valuable poem _ the task _ but now he have write three little fugitive piece upon it of these the most impressive be that which he call _ the negro 's complaint _ and of which the follow be a copy : -- force from home and all its pleasure afric 's coast i leave forlorn to increase a stranger 's treasure o'er the rage billow bear man from england buy and sell I pay my price in paltry gold but though theirs they have enroll would I mind be never to be sell still in think as free as ever what be england 's rights i ask I from my delight to sever I to torture I to task fleecy lock and black complexion can not forfeit nature 's claim skin may differ but affection dwell in black and white the same why do all-creating nature make the plant for which we toil sigh must fan it tear must water sweat of ours must dress the soil think ye master iron-hearted lolling at you jovial board think how many back have smart for the sweet you cane afford be there as you sometimes tell we be there one who rule on high have he bid you buy and sell we speak from he throne the sky ask he if you knotted scourge fetter blood-extort screw be the means which duty urge agent of he will to use hark he answer wild tornado strew yonder sea with wreck waste town plantation meadow be the voice with which he speak he foresee what vexation afric 's son should undergo fix they tyrant ' habitation where he whirlwind answer -- no by we blood in afric waste ere we neck receive the chain by the misery which we taste cross in you bark the main by we suffering since you bring we to the man-degrading mart all-sustained by patience teach we only by a broken heart : deem we nation brute no longer till some reason you shall find worthier of regard and stronger than the color of we kind slave of gold whose sordid dealings tarnish all you boast power prove that you have human feeling ere you proudly question ours this little piece cowper present in manuscript to some of he friend in london and these conceive it to contain a powerful appeal in behalf of the injured african join in print it have order it on the finest hot-pressed paper and fold it up in a small and neat form they give it the print title of _ a subject for conversation at the tea-table _ after this they send many thousand copy of it in frank into the country from one it spread to another till it travel almost over the whole island fall at length into the hand of the musician it be set to music and it then find its way into the street both of the metropolis and of the country where it be sing as a ballad and where it give a plain account of the subject with a appropriate feeling to those who hear it nor be the philanthropy of the late mr wedgewood less instrumental in turn the popular feeling in we favor he make he own manufactory contribute to this end he take the seal of the committee as exhibit in chap xx for he model and he produce a beautiful cameo of a less size of which the ground be a most delicate white but the negro who be see implore compassion in the middle of it be in he own native color mr wedgewood make a liberal donation of these when finish among he friend i receive from he no less than five hundred of they myself they to whom they be send do not lay they up in they cabinet but give they away likewise they be soon like _ the negro 's complaint _ in different part of the kingdom some have they inlaid in gold on the lid of they snuff-box of the lady several wear they in bracelet and other have they fit up in a ornamental manner as pin for they hair at length the taste for wear they become general and thus fashion which usually confines itself to worthless thing be see for once in the honorable office of promote the cause of justice humanity and freedom i shall now only state that the committee take as member within its own body in the period of time which be include in this chapter the reverend mr ormerod chaplain to the bishop of london and captain jame bowen of the royal navy that they elect the honorable nathaniel curzon -lrb- afterwards lord scarsdale -rrb- dr frossard of lyon and benjamin garlike esq then secretary to the english embassy at the hague honorary and corresponding member and that they conclude they annual labor with a suitable report in which they notice the extraordinary effort of we opponent to injure we cause in the follow manner : -- in the progress of this business a powerful combination of interest have be excite against we the african trader the planter and the west indium merchant have unite they force to defend the fortress in which they suppose treasure lie vague calculation and false alarm have be throw out to the public in order to show that the constitution and even the existence of this free and opulent nation depend on its deprive the inhabitant of a foreign country of those rights and of that liberty which we ourselves so highly and so justly prize surely in the nature of thing and in the order of providence it can not be so england exist as a great nation long before the african commerce be know amongst we and it be not to act of injustice and violence that she owe she present rank in the scale of nation chapter xxvi -- continuation from July 1790 to July 1791 -- author travel again throughout the kingdom object of he journey -- motion in the house of common to resume the hearing of evidence in favor of the abolition list of all those examine on this side of the question machination of interested person and cruel circumstance of the time previously to the day of decision -- motion at length make for stop all further importation of slave from africa debate upon it motion lose -- resolution of the committee for the abolition of the slave trade -- establishment of the sierra leone company it be a matter of deep affliction to we to think that the crime and suffering inseparable from the slave trade be to be continue to another year and yet it be we duty in the present moment to acquiesce in the postponement of the question this postponement be not now for the purpose of delay but of secure victory the evidence on the side of the abolition be at the end of the last session but half finish it be impossible for the sake of africa that we could have then close it no other opportunity might offer in parliament for establish a indelible record in she favor if we be to neglect the present it be we duty therefore even to wait to complete it and to procure such a body of evidence as should not only bear we out in the approach contest but such as if we be to fail would bear out we successor also it be possible indeed if the inhabitant of we island be to improve in civilization that the poor slave might experience gradually a improved treatment with it and so far testimony now might not be testimony for ever but it be utterly impossible while the slave trade last and the human passion continue to be the same that there should be any change for the better in africa or that any mode less barbarous should come into use for procure slave evidence therefore if once collect on this subject would be evidence for posterity in the midst of these thought another journey occur to I as necessary for this purpose and i pray that i might have strength to perform it in the most effectual manner and that i might be daily impress as i travel along with the stimulate thought that the last hope for million might possibly rest upon my own endeavor the committee highly approve of this journey mr wilberforce see the absolute necessity of it also and have prepare a number of question with great ingenuity to be put to such person as might have information to communicate these i add to those in the table which have be already mention and they make together a valuable collection on the subject this tour be the most vexatious of any i have yet undertake many still refuse to come forward to be examine and some on the most frivolous pretence so that i be disgust as i journeyed on to find how little man be dispose to make sacrifice for so great a cause in one part of it i go over nearly two thousand mile receive repeat refusal i have not secure one witness within this distance this be truly disheartening i be subject to the whim and caprice of those whom i solicit on these occasion -lrb- a -rrb- to these i be oblige to accommodate myself when at edinburgh a person who could have give I material information decline see I though he really wish well to the cause when i have return southward as far as york he change he mind and he would then see I i go back that i might not lose he when i arrive he would give I only private information thus i travel backwards and forwards four hundred mile to no purpose at another place a circumstance almost similar happen though with a different issue i have be for two year write about a person whose testimony be important i have pass once through the town in which he live but he would not then see I i pass through it now but no entreaty of he friend could make he alter he resolution he be a man highly respectable as to situation in life but of considerable vanity i say therefore to my friend on leave the town you may tell he that i expect to be at nottingham in a few day and though it be a hundred and fifty mile distant i will even come back to see he if he will dine with I on my return a letter from my friend announce to I when at nottingham that he vanity have be so gratify by the thought of a person come expressly to visit he from such a distance that he would meet I accord to my appointment i go back we dine together he yield to my request i be now repay and i return towards nottingham in the night these circumstance i mention and i feel it right to mention they that the reader may be properly impress with the great difficulty we find in collect a body of evidence in comparison with we opponent they ought never to be forget for if with the testimony pick up as it be under all these disadvantage we carry we object against those who have almost numberless witness to command what must have be the merit of we cause no person can indeed judge of the severe labor and trial in these journey in the present i be out four month i be almost over the whole island i intersect it backwards and forwards both in the night and in the day i travel nearly seven thousand mile in this time and i be able to count upon twenty new and willing evidence have now accomplished my object mr wilberforce move on the 4th of February in the house of common that a committee be appoint to examine further witness in behalf of the abolition of the slave trade this motion be no sooner make than mr cawthorne rise to we great surprise to oppose it he take upon himself to decide that the house have hear evidence enough this indecent motion be not without its advocate mr wilberforce set forth the injustice of this attempt and prove that out of eighty-one day which have be give up to the hearing of evidence the witness against the abolition have occupy no less than fifty-seven he be strenuously support by mr burke mr martin and other respectable member at length the debate end in favor of the original motion and a committee be appoint accordingly the examination begin again on February 7th and continue till April 5th when they be finally close in this as in the former session mr wilberforce and mr william smith principally conduct they and indeed it be necessary that they should have be present at these time for it be perhaps difficult to conceive the illiberal manner in which we witness be treat by those on the other side of the question man who have leave the trade upon principle and who have come forward against they apparent interest to serve the cause of humanity and justice be look upon as mercenary and culprit or as man of doubtful and suspicious character they be brow-beaten unhandsome question be put to they some be keep for four day under examination it be however highly to they honor that they be find in no one instance to prevaricate nor to waver as to the certainty of they fact but this treatment hard as it be for they to bear be indeed good for the cause for come thus pure out of the fire they occasion they own testimony when read to bear stronger mark of truth than that of the generality of we opponent nor be it less superior when weigh by other consideration for the witness against the abolition be principally interested they who be not have be hospitably receive at the planter ' table the evidence too which they deliver be almost wholly negative they have not see such and such evil but this be no proof that the evil do not exist the witness on the other hand who come up in favor of the abolition have no advantage in make they several assertion in some instance they come up against they apparent interest and to my knowledge suffer persecution for so do the evidence also which they deliver be of a positive nature they give a account of specific evil which have come under they own eye these evil be never disprove they stand therefore on a firm basis as on a tablet of brass engrave there in affirmative character a few of they be of more value than all the negative and airy testimony which have be advance on the other side of the question that the public may judge in some measure of the respectability of the witness in favor of the abolition and that they may know also to whom africa be so much indebted for she deliverance i shall subjoin they name in the three follow list the first will contain those who be examine by the privy council only the second those who be examine by the privy council and the house of common also and the third those who be examined-by the house of common only list i list ii list iii the evidence have be deliver on both side and then print it be judge expedient by mr wilberforce see that it fill three folio volume to abridge it this abridgement be make by the different friend of the cause william burgh esq of york thoma babington esq of rothley temple the rev thoma gisborne of yoxall lodge mr campbell haliburton of edinburgh george harrison with one or two other of the committee and myself be employ upon it the greater share however of the labor fall upon dr dickson that no misrepresentation of any person 's testimony might be make matthew montagu esq and the honorable ej elliott member of parliament undertake to compare the abridged manuscript with the original text and to strike out or correct whatever they think to be erroneous and to insert whatever they think to have be omit the committee for the abolition when the work be finish print it at they own expense mr wilberforce then present it to the house of common as a faithful abridgement of the whole evidence have be receive as such under the guarantee of mr montague and mr elliott the committee send it to every individual member of that house the book have be thus present and a day fix for the final determination of the question we feeling become almost insupportable for we have the mortification to find that we cause be go down in estimation where it be then most important that it should have increase in favor we opponent have take advantage of the long delay which the examination of evidence have occasion to prejudice the mind of many of the member of the house of common against we the old argument of emancipation massacre ruin and indemnification have be keep up but as the day of final decision approach they have be increase such be we situation at this moment when the current be turn still more powerfully against we by the peculiar circumstance of the time it be indeed the misfortune of this great cause to be assail by every weapon which could be turn against it at this time thoma paine have publish he _ rights of man _ this have be widely circulate at this time also the french revolution have exist nearly two year the people of england have see during this interval a government as it be dissect they have see a old constitution take down and a new one put up piece by piece in its stead the revolution therefore in conjunction with the book in question have have the effect of produce dissatisfaction among thousand and this dissatisfaction be grow so as to alarm a great number of person of property in the kingdom as well as the government itself now will it be believe that we opponent have the injustice to lay hold of these circumstance at this critical moment to give a death-blow to the cause of the abolition they represent the committee though it have exist before the french revolution or the _ rights of man _ be hear of as a nest of jacobin and they hold up the cause sacred as it be and though it have the support of the minister as afford a opportunity of meeting for the purpose of overthrow the state they cry succeed the very book of the abridgment of the evidence be consider by many member as poisonous as that of the _ rights of man _ it be too profane for many of they to touch and they who discard it discard the cause also but these be not the only circumstance which be use as means at this critical moment to defeat we news of the revolution which have commence in st domingo in consequence of the dispute between the whites and the people of color have long before this arrive in england the horrible scene which accompany it have be frequently publish as so many argument against we cause in January new insurrection be announce as have happen in martinique the negro there be describe as armed and the planter as have abandon they estate for fear of massacre early in the month of march insurrection in the smaller french island be report every effort be then make to represent these as the effect of the new principle of liberty and of the cry for abolition but what should happen just at this moment to increase the clamor against we nothing less than a insurrection in dominica -- yes -- a insurrection in a british island this be the very event for we opponent all the prediction of the planter have now become verify the horrible massacre be now realize at home to give this news still greater effect a meeting of we opponent be hold at the london tavern by a letter read there it appear that the ruin of dominica be now at hand resolution be vote and a memorial present to government immediately to despatch such a military force to the different island as might preserve the whites from destruction and keep the negro in subjection during the present critical state of the slave bill this alarm be keep up till the 7th of April when another meeting take place to receive the answer of government to the memorial it be there resolve that as it be too late to send troops to the island the best way of preserve they would be to bring the question of the slave trade to a immediate issue and that it be the duty of the government if they regard the safety of the island to oppose the abolition of it account of all these proceedings be insert in the public papers it be needless to say that they be injurious to we cause many look upon the abolitionist as monster they become also terrify themselves the idea with these be that unless the discussion on this subject be terminate all would be lose thus under a combination of effect arise from the publication of the _ rights of man _ the rise and progress of the french revolution and the insurrection of the negro in the different island no one of which event have anything to do with the abolition of the slave trade the current be turn against we and in this unfavourable frame of mind many member of parliament go into the house on the day fix for the discussion to discharge they duty with respect to this great question on the 18th of April mr wilberforce make he motion he begin by express a hope that the present debate instead of exciting asperity and confirm prejudice would tend to produce a general conviction of the truth of what in fact be incontrovertible that the abolition of the slave trade be indispensably require of they not only by morality and religion but by sound policy he state that he should argue the matter from evidence he advert to the character situation and means of information of he own witness and have divide he subject into part the first of which related to the manner of reduce the native of africa to a state of slavery he handle it in the follow manner : -- he would begin he say with the first boundary of the trade captain wilson and captain hill of he majesty 's navy and mr dalrymple of the land service have concur in state that in the country contiguous to the river senegal when slave-ship arrive there arm party be regularly send out in the evening who scour the country and bring in they prey the wretched victim be to be see in the morning bind back to back in the hut on shore whence they be convey tie hand and foot to the slave-ship the design of these ravages be obvious because when the slave trade be stop they cease mr kiernan speak of the constant depredation by the moor to procure slave mr wadstrom confirm they the latter gentleman show also that they be excite by present of brandy gunpowder and such other incentive and that they be not only carry on by one community against another but that the king be stimulate to practice they in they territory and on they own subject : and in one instance a chieftain who when intoxicate could not resist the demand of the slave merchant have express in a moment of reason a due sense of he own crime and have reproach he christian seducer abundant also be the instance of private rapine individual be kidnap whilst in they field and garden there be a universal feeling of distrust and apprehension there the native never go any distance from home without arm and when captain wilson ask they the reason of it they point to a slave-ship then lie within sight on the windward coast it appear from lieutenant story and mr bowman that the evil just mention exist if possible in a still higher degree they have see the remains of village which have be burnt whilst the field of corn be still stand beside they and every other trace of recent desolation here a agent be send to establish a settlement in the country and to send to the ship such slave as he might obtain the order he receive from he captain be that he be to encourage the chieftain by brandy and gunpowder to go to war to make slave this he do the chieftain perform they part in return the neighbouring village be surround and set on fire in the night the inhabitant be seize when make they escape and be bring to the agent be by he forward to he principal on the coast mr how a botanist in the service of government state that on the arrival of a order for slave from cape coast castle while he be there a native chief immediately send forth armed party who bring in a supply of all description in the night but he would now mention one or two instance of another sort and these merely on account of the conclusion which be to be draw from they when captain hill be in the river gambium he mention accidentally to a black pilot who be in the boat with he that he want a cabin-boy it so happen that some youth be then on the shore with vegetable to sell the pilot beckon to they to come on board at the same time give captain hill to understand that he might take he choice of they and when captain hill reject the proposal with indignation the pilot seem perfectly at a loss to account for he warmth and drily observe that the slave-captain would not have be so scrupulous again when general rooke command at goree a number of the native man woman and child come to pay he a friendly visit all be gaiety and merriment it be a scene to gladden the saddest and to soften the hardest heart but a slave-captain be not so soon throw off he guard three english barbarian of this description have the audacity jointly to request the general to seize the whole unsuspicious multitude and sell they for this they allege the precedent of a former governor be not this request a proof of the frequency of such act of rapine for how familiar must such have be to slave-captain when three of they dare to carry a british officer of rank such a flagitious proposal this would stand in the place of a thousand instance it would give credibility to every other act of violence state in the evidence however enormous it might appear but he would now have recourse for a moment to circumstantial evidence a adverse witness who have live on the gold coast have say that the only way in which child could he enslave be by whole family be sell when the principal have be condemn for witchcraft but he say at the same time that few be convict of this crime and that the younger part of a family in these case be sometimes spare but if this account be true it would follow that the child in the slave-vessel would be few indeed but it have be prove that the usual proportion of these be never less than a fourth of the whole cargo on the coast and also that the kidnapping of child be very prevalent there all these atrocity he say be fully substantiate by the evidence and here he should do injustice to he cause if he be not to make a quotation from the speech of mr b edward in the assembly of jamaica who though he be hostile to he proposition have yet the candor to deliver himself in the follow manner there i be persuade say he that mr wilberforce have be rightly inform as to the manner in which slave be generally procure the intelligence i have collect from my own negro abundantly confirm he account and i have not the smallest doubt that in africa the effect of this trade be precisely such as he have represent they the whole or the greatest part of that immense continent be a field of warfare and desolation a wilderness in which the inhabitant be wolf towards each other that this scene of oppression fraud treachery and bloodshed if not originally occasion be in part -lrb- i will not say wholly -rrb- uphold by the slave trade i dare not dispute every man in the sugar island may be convince that it be so who will enquire of any african negro on they first arrival concern the circumstance of they captivity the assertion that it be otherwise be mockery and insult but it be not only by act of outrage that the african be bring into bondage the very administration of justice be turn into a engine for that end the smallest offence be punish by a fine equal to the value of a slave crime be also fabricate false accusation be resort to and person be sometimes employ to seduce the unwary into practice with a view to the conviction and the sale of they it be another effect of this trade that it corrupt the moral of those who carry it on every fraud be use to deceive the ignorance of the native by false weight and measure adulterated commodity and other imposition of a like sort these fraud be even acknowledge by many who have themselves practice they in obedience to the order of they superior for the honor of the mercantile character of the country such a traffic ought immediately to be suppress yet these thing however clearly prove by positive testimony by the concession of opponent by particular inference by general reasoning by the most authentic history of africa by the experience of all country and of all age -- these thing and -lrb- what be still more extraordinary -rrb- even the possibility of they be deny by those who have be bring forward on the other side of the question these however be chiefly person who have be trading-governor of fort in africa or who have long command ship in the slave trade as soon as he know the sort of witness which be to be call against he he have be prepare to expect much prejudice but he expectation have be greatly surpass by the testimony they have give he do not mean to impeach they private character but they certainly show themselves under the influence of such gross prejudice as to render they incompetent judge of the subject they come to elucidate they seem -lrb- if he might so say -rrb- to be envelop by a certain atmosphere of they own and to see as it be through a kind of african medium every object which meet they eye come distorted and turn from its true direction even the declaration which they make on other occasion seem wholly strange to they they sometimes not only forget what they have see but what they have say and when to one of they he own testimony to the privy council be read he mistake it for that of another whose evidence he declare to be the merest burlesque in the world but the house must be aware that there be not only a african medium but a african logic it seem to be a acknowledged axiom in this that every person who offer a slave for sale have a right to sell he however fraudulently he might have obtain he this have be prove by the witness who oppose he it would have stop my trade say one of they to have ask the broker how he come by the person he be offer I for sale -- we always suppose say another the broker have a right to sell the person he offer we -- i never hear of such a question be ask say a third a man would be think a fool who should put such a question -- he hope the house would see the practical utility of this logic it be the key-stone which hold the building together by means of it slave-captain might traverse the whole coast of africa and see nothing but equitable practice they could not however be wholly absolved even if they avail themselves of this principle to its fullest extent for they have often committed depredation themselves especially when they be pass by any part of the coast where they do not mean to continue or to go again hence it be -lrb- as several captain of the navy and other have declare on they examination -rrb- that the native when at sea in they canoe would never come near the men-of-war till they know they to be such but find this and that they be not slave-vessels they lay aside they fear and come and continue on board with unsuspecting cheerfulness with respect to the misery of the middle passage he have say so much on a former occasion that he would spare the feeling of the committee as much as he could he would therefore simply state that the evidence which be before they confirm all those scene of wretchedness which he have then describe : the same suffering from a state of suffocation by be crowd together the same dancing in fetter the same melancholy singing the same eating by compulsion the same despair the same insanity and all the other abomination which characterize the trade new instance however have occur where these wretched man have resolve on death to terminate they woe some have destroy themselves by refuse sustenance in spite of threat and punishment other have throw themselves into the sea and more than one when in the act of drowning be see to wave they hand in triumph exulting -lrb- to use the word of a eye-witness -rrb- that they have escape yet these and similar thing when view through the african medium he have mention take a different shape and color captain knox a adverse witness have maintain that slave lay during the night in tolerable comfort and yet he confess that in a vessel of one hundred and twenty ton in which he have carry two hundred and ninety slave the latter have not all of they room to lie on they back how comfortably then must they have lie in he subsequent voyage for he carry afterwards in a vessel of a hundred and eight ton four hundred and fifty and in a vessel of one hundred and fifty ton no less than six hundred slave another instance of african deception be to be find in the testimony of captain frazer one of the most humane captain in the trade it have be say of he that he have hold hot coal to the mouth of a slave to compel he to eat he be question on this point but not admit in the true spirit of african logic that he who make another commit a crime be guilty of it himself he deny the charge indignantly and defy a proof but it be say to he do you never order such a thing to be do he reply be be sick in my cabin i be inform that a man-slave would neither eat drink nor speak i desire the mate and surgeon to try to persuade he to speak i desire that the slave might try also when i find he be still obstinate not know whether it be from sulkiness or insanity i order a person to present he with a piece of fire in one hand and a piece of yam in the other and to tell I what effect this have upon he i learn that he take the yam and begin to eat it but he throw the fire overboard such be he own account of the matter this be eat by duresse if anything could be call so the captain however triumph in he expedient and conclude by tell the committee that he sell this very slave at grenada for forty pound mark here the moral of the tale and learn the nature and the cure of sulkiness but upon whom do the cruelty thus arise out of the prosecution of this barbarous traffic fall upon a people with feeling and intellect like ourselves one witness have speak of the acuteness of they understanding another of the extent of they memory a third of they genius for commerce : a fourth of they proficiency in manufacture at home many have admire they gentle and peaceable disposition they cheerfulness and they hospitality even they who be nominally slave in africa live a happy life a witness against the abolition have describe they as sit and eat with they master in the true style of patriarchal simplicity and comfort be these then a people incapable of civilization the argument that they be a inferior species have be prove to be false he would now go to a new part of the subject a opinion have go forth that the abolition of the trade would be the ruin of the west indium island he trust he should prove that the direct contrary be the truth though have he be unable to do this it would have make no difference as to he own vote in examine however this opinion he should exclude the subject of the cultivation of new land by fresh importation of slave the impolicy of this measure apart from its inhumanity be indisputably clear let the committee consider the dreadful mortality which attend it let they look to the evidence of mr woolrich and there see a contrast draw between the slow but sure progress of cultivation carry on in the natural way and the attempt to force improvement which however flattering the prospect at first soon produce a load of debt and inextricable embarrassment he might even appeal to the statement of the west indian themselves who allow that more than twenty million be owe to the people of this country to show that no system could involve they so deeply as that on which they have hitherto go but he would refer they to the account of mr irving as contain in the evidence wave then the consideration of this part of the subject the opinion in question must have arise from a notion that the stock of slave now in the island could not be keep up by propagation but that it be necessary from time to time to recruit they with import african in direct refutation of this position he should prove : first that in the condition and treatment of the negro there be cause sufficient to afford we reason to expect a considerable decrease but particularly that they increase have not be a serious object of attention : secondly that this decrease be in fact notwithstanding very trifling or rather he believe he might declare it have now actually cease : and thirdly he should urge many direct and collateral fact and argument constitute on the whole a irresistible proof that even a rapid increase might henceforth be expect he wish to treat the west indian with all possible candor : but he be oblige to confess in argue upon these point that whatever splendid instance there might be of kindness towards they slave there be some evil of almost universal operation which be necessarily connect with the system of slavery above all the state of degradation to which they be reduce deserve to be notice as it produce a utter inattention to they as moral agent they be keep at work under the whip like cattle they be leave totally ignorant of morality and religion there be no regular marriage among they hence promiscuous intercourse early prostitution and excessive drinking be material cause of they decrease with respect to the instruction of the slave in the principle of religion the happiest effect have result particularly in antigua where under the moravian and methodist they have so far profit that the planter themselves confess they value as property have be raise one-third by they increase habit of regularity and industry whatever might have be say to the contrary it be plainly to be infer from the evidence that the slave be not protect by law colonial statute have indeed be pass but they be a dead letter since however ill they be treat they be not consider as have a right to redress a instance of astonishing cruelty by a jew have be mention by mr ross it be but justice to say that the man be hold in detestation for it but yet no one have ever think of call he to a legal account mr ross conceive a master have a right to punish he slave in whatever manner he might think proper the same be declare by numberless other witness some instance indeed have lately occur of conviction a master have wantonly cut the mouth of a child of six month old almost from ear to ear but do not the verdict of the jury show that the doctrine of call master to a account be entirely novel as it only pronounce he guilty subject to the opinion of the court if immoderate correction of a slave by he master be a crime indictable the court determine in the affirmative and what be the punishment of this barbarous act -- a fine of forty shilling currency equivalent to about twenty-five shilling sterling the slave be but ill off in point of medical care sometimes four or five and even eight or nine thousand of they be under the care of one medical man which disperse on different and distant estate be a greater number than he could possibly attend to it be also in evidence that they be in general under-fed they be support partly by the produce of they own provision-ground and partly by a allowance of flour and grain from they master in one of the island where provision-ground do not answer one year in three the allowance to a work negro be but from five to nine pint of grain per week : in dominica where it never fail from six to seven quart : in nevi and st christopher 's where there be no provision-ground it be but eleven pint add to this that it might be still less as the circumstance of they master might become embarrassed and in this case both a abridgment of they food and a increase of they labor would follow but the great cause of the decrease of the slave be in the non-residence of the planter sir george yonge and many other have say they have see the slave treat in a manner which they owner would have resent if they have know it mr orde speak in the strongest term of the misconduct of manager the fact be that these in general seek to establish they character by produce large crop at a small immediate expense too little consider how far the slave might suffer from ill-treatment and excessive labor the pursuit of such a system be a criterion for judge of they character as both mr long and mr ottley have confess but he must contend in addition to this that the object of keep up the stock of slave by breed have never be seriously attend to for this he might appeal both to he own witness and to those of he opponent but he would only notice one fact it be remarkable that when owner and manager be ask about the produce of they estate they be quite at home as to the answer but when they be ask about the proportion of they male and female slave and they infant they know little about the matter even medical man be adept in the art of plant but when they be ask the latter question as connect with breed and rear they seem quite amaze and could give no information upon the subject of they person however of great respectability have be call as witness who have not see the treatment of the negro as he have now describe it he know what be due to they character but yet he must enter a general protest against they testimony i have often say mr ross attend both governor and admiral upon tour in the island of jamaica but it be not likely that these should see much distress upon these occasion the white people and driver would take care not to harrow up the feeling of stranger of distinction by the exercise of the whip or the infliction of punishment at that particular time and even if there be any disgusting object it be natural to suppose that they would then remove they but in truth these gentleman have give proof that they be under the influence of prejudice some of they have declare the abolition would ruin the west indy but this it be obvious must depend upon the practicability of keep up the stock without african supplies and yet when they be question upon this point they know nothing about it hence they have form a conclusion without premise they evidence too extend through a long series of year they have never see one instance of ill-treatment in the time and yet in the same breath they talk of the amend situation of the slave and that they be now far better off than formerly one of they to whom he country owe much state that a master have be sentence to death for the murder of he own slave but he recollection must have fail he for the murder of a slave be not then a capital crime a respectable governor also have deliver a opinion to the same effect but have he look into the statute-book of the island he would have find he error it have be say that the slave be in a better state than the peasantry of this country but when the question be put to mr ross do he not answer that he would not insult the latter by a comparison it have be say again that the negro be happier as slave than they would be if they be to be make free but how be this reconcilable with fact if a negro under extraordinary circumstance have save money enough do he not always purchase he release from this situation of superior happiness by the sacrifice of he last shilling be it not also notorious that the greatest reward which a master think he could bestow upon he slave for long and faithful service be he freedom it have be say again that negro when make free never return to they own country but be not the reason obvious if they could even reach they own home in safety they kindred and connexion might be dead but would they subject themselves to be kidnap again to be hurry once more on board a slave-ship and again to endure and survive the horror of the passage yet the love of they native country have be prove beyond a doubt many of the witness have hear they talk of it in term of the strongest affection act of suicide too be frequent in the island under the notion that these afford they the readiest means of get home conformably with this captain wilson have maintain that the funeral which in africa be accompany with lamentation and cry of sorrow be attend in the west indy with every mark of joy he have now he say make good he first proposition -- that in the condition of the slave there be cause which should lead we to expect that there would be a considerable decrease among they this decrease in the island of jamaica be but trifling or rather it have cease some year ago and if there be a decrease it be only on the import slave it appear from the privy council report that from 1698 to 1730 the decrease be three and a-half per cent from 1730 to 1755 it be two and a-half per cent from 1755 to 1768 it be lessen to one and three-quarter and from 1768 to 1788 it be not more than one per cent this last decrease be not greater than could be account for from hurricane and consequent famine and from the number of import african who perish in the season the latter be a cause of mortality which it be evident would cease with the importation this conclusion be confirm in part by dr anderson who in he testimony to the assembly of jamaica affirm that there be a considerable increase on the property of the island and particularly in the parish in which he reside he would now proceed to establish he second proposition that from henceforth a very considerable increase might be expect this he might support by a close reasoning upon the precede fact but the testimony of he opponent furnish he with sufficient evidence he could show that wherever the slave be treat better than ordinary there be uniformly a increase in they number look at the estate of mr willock mr ottley sir ralph payne and other in short he should weary the committee if he be to enumerate the instance of plantation which be state in the evidence to have keep up they number only from a little variation in they treatment a remedy also have be lately find for a disorder by which vast number of infant have be formerly sweep away mr long also have lay it down that whenever the slave should bear a certain proportion to the produce they might be expect to keep up they number but this proportion they now exceed the assembly of jamaica have give it also as they opinion that when once the sex should become nearly equal in point of number there be no reason to suppose that the increase of the negro by generation would fall short of the natural increase of the labor poor in great britain but the inequality here speak of could only exist in the case of the african negro of whom more male be import than female and this inequality would be do away soon after the trade should cease but the increase of the negro where they treatment be better than ordinary be confirm in the evidence by instance in various part of the world from one end of the continent of america to the other they increase have be undeniably establish and this to a prodigious extent though they have to contend with the severe cold of the winter and in some part with noxious exhalation in the summer this be the case also in the settlement of bencoolen in the east indy it appear from the evidence of mr botham that a number of negro who have be import there in the same disproportion of the sex as in west indian cargo and who live under the same disadvantage as in the island of promiscuous intercourse and general prostitution begin after they have be settle a short time annually to increase but to return to the west indy -- a slave-ship have be many year ago wreck near st vincent 's the slave on board who escape to the island be without necessaries and besides be oblige to maintain a war with the native caribb : yet they soon multiply to a astonishing number and accord to mr ottley they be now on the increase from sir john dalrymple 's evidence it appear that the domestic slave in jamaica who be less work than those in the field increase and from mr long that the free black and mulatto there increase also but there be a instance which militate against these fact -lrb- and the only one in the evidence -rrb- which he would now examine sir archibald campbell have hear that the maroon in jamaica in the year 1739 amount to three thousand man fit to carry arm this suppose they whole number to have be about twelve thousand but in the year 1782 after a real muster by himself he find to he great astonishment that the fight man do not then amount to three hundred now the fact be that sir archibald campbell 's first position be found upon rumor only and be not true for accord to mr long the maroon be actually number in 1749 when they amount to about six hundred and sixty in all have only a hundred and fifty man fit to carry arm hence if when muster by sir archibald campbell he find three hundred fight man they must from 1749 to 1782 have actually double they population be it possible after these instance to suppose that the negro could not keep up they number if they natural increase be make a subject of attention the reverse be prove by sound reasoning it have be confirm by unquestionable fact it have be show that they have increase in every situation where there be the slightest circumstance in they favor where there have be any decrease it be state to be trifling though no attention appear to have be pay to the subject this decrease have be gradually lessen and whenever a single cause of it have be remove -lrb- many still remain -rrb- it have altogether cease surely these circumstance form a body of proof which be irresistible he would now speak of the consequence of the abolition of the slave trade in other point of view and first as to its effect upon we marine a abstract of the bristol and liverpool muster-roll have be just lay before the house it appear from this that in three hundred and fifty slave-vessel have on board twelve thousand two hundred and sixty-three person two thousand six hundred and forty-three be lose in twelve month whereas in four hundred and sixty-two west indiaman have on board seven thousand six hundred and forty person one hundred and eighteen only be lose in seven month this rather exceed the loss state by mr clarkson for they barbarous usage on board these ship and for they sickly and abject state in the west indy he would appeal to governor parry 's letter to the evidence of mr ross to the assertion of mr b edward a opponent and to the testimony of captain sir george yonge and thompson of the royal navy he would appeal also to what captain hall of the navy have give in evidence this gentleman after the action of the 12th of April impressed thirty hand from a slave-vessel whom he select with the utmost care from a crew of seventy and he be reprimand by he admiral though they could scarcely get man to bring home the prize for introduce such wretch to communicate disorder to the fleet captain smith of the navy have also declare that when employ to board guineaman to impress sailor although he have examine near twenty vessel he never be able to get more than two man who be fit for service and these turn out such inhuman fellow although good seaman that he be oblige to dismiss they from the ship but he hope the committee would attend to the latter part of the assertion of captain smith yes : this trade while it injure the constitution of we sailor debase they moral of this indeed there be a barbarous illustration in the evidence a slave-ship have strike on some shoal call the morant key a few league from the east end of jamaica the crew land in they boat with arm and provision leave the slave on board in they iron this happen in the night when morning come it be discover that the negro have break they shackle and be busy in make raft upon which afterwards they place the woman and child the man attend upon the latter swimming by they side whilst they drift to the island where the crew be but what be the sequel from a apprehension that the negro would consume the water and provision which have be land the crew resolve to destroy they as they approach the shore they kill between three and four hundred out of the whole cargo only thirty-three be save who on be bring to kingston be sell it would however be to no purpose he say to relieve the slave trade from this act of barbarity the story of the morant key be parallel by that of captain collingwood and be you to get rid of these another and another would still present itself to prove the barbarous effect of this trade on the moral character but of the misery of the trade there be no end whilst he have be read out of the evidence the story of the morant key he eye have but glance on the opposite page and it meet another circumstance of horror this related to what be call the refuse-slave many people in kingston be accustom to speculate in the purchase of those who be leave after the first day 's sale they then carry they out into the country and retail they mr ross declare that he have see these land in a very wretched state sometimes in the agony of death and sell as low as for a dollar and that he have know several expire in the piazza of the vendue-master the bare description supersede the necessity of any remark yet these be the familiar incident of the slave trade but he would go back to the seaman he would mention another cause of mortality by which many of they lose they life in look over lloyd 's list no less than six vessel be cut off by the irritated native in one year and the crew massacre such instance be not unfrequent in short the history of this commerce be write throughout in character of blood he would next consider the effect of the abolition on those place where it be chiefly carry on but would the committee believe after all the noise which have be make on this subject that the slave trade compose but a thirtieth part of the export trade of liverpool and that of the trade of bristol it constitute a still less proportion for the effect of the abolition on the general commerce of the kingdom he would refer they to mr irve from whose evidence it would appear that the medium value of the british manufacture export to africa amount only to between four and five hundred thousand pound annually this be but a trifling sum surely the superior capital ingenuity application and integrity of the british manufacturer would command new market for the produce of he industry to a equal amount when this should be no more one branch however of we manufacture he confess would suffer from the abolition and that be the manufacture of gunpowder of which the nature of we connexion with africa draw from we as much as we export to all the rest of the world besides he hasten however to another part of the argument some have say we wish to put a end to the slave trade but we do not approve of you mode allow more time do not displease the legislature of the west indium island it be by they that those law must be pass and enforce which will secure you object now he be directly at issue with these gentleman he could show that the abolition be the only certain mode of amend the treatment of the slave so as to secure they increase : and that the mode which have be offer to he be at once inefficacious and unsafe in the first place how could any law make by these legislature be effectual whilst the evidence of negro be in no case admit against white man what be the answer from grenada do it not state that they who be capable of cruelty would in general be artful enough to prevent any but slave from be witness of the fact hence it have arise that when positive law have be make in some of the island for the protection of the slave they have be find almost a dead letter besides by what law would you enter into every man 's domestic concern and regulate the interior economy of he house and plantation this would be something more than a general excise who would endure such a law and yet on all these and innumerable other minutiae must depend the protection of the slave they comfort and the probability of they increase it be universally allow that the code noir have be utterly neglect in the french island though there be a officer appoint by the crown to see it enforce the provision of the directorio have be but of little more avail in the portuguese settlement or the institution of a protector of the indian in those of the spaniard but what degree or protection the slave would enjoy might be infer from the admission of a gentleman by whom this very plan of regulation have be recommend and who be himself no ordinary person but a man of discernment and legal resource he have propose a limitation of the number of lash to be give by the master or overseer for one offence but after all he candidly confess that he proposal be not likely to be useful while the evidence of slave continue inadmissible against they master but he could even bring testimony to the inefficacy of such regulation a wretch in barbado have chained a negro girl to the floor and flog she till she be nearly expire captain cook and major fitch hear she cry break open the door and find she the wretch retreat from they resentment but cry out exultingly that he have only give she thirty-nine lash -lrb- the number limit by law -rrb- at any one time and that he have only inflict this number three time since the beginning of the night add that he would prosecute they for break open he door and that he would flog she to death for all any one if he please and that he would give she the fourth thirty-nine before morning but this plan of regulation be not only inefficacious but unsafe he enter he protest against the fatal consequence which might result from it the negro be creature like ourselves but they be uninformed and they moral character be debased hence they be unfit for civil rights to use these properly they must be gradually restore to that level from which they have be so unjustly degrade to allow they a appeal to the law would be to awaken in they a sense of the dignity of they nature the first return of life after a swoon be commonly a convulsion dangerous at once to the party himself and to all around he you should first prepare they for the situation and not bring the situation to they to be under the protection of the law be in fact to be a freeman and to unite slavery and freedom in one condition be impracticable the abolition on the other hand be exactly such a agent as the case require all hope of supplies from the coast be cut off breed would henceforth become a serious object of attention and the care of this as include better clothing and feeding and milder discipline would extend to innumerable particulars which a act of assembly could neither specify nor enforce the horrible system too which many have go upon of work out they slave in a few year and recruit they gang with import african would receive its death-blow from the abolition of the trade the opposite would force itself on the most unfeeling heart ruin would stare a man in the face if he be not to conform to it the non-resident owner would then express themselves in the term of sir philip gibb that he should consider it as the fault of he manager if he be not to keep up the number of he slave this reasoning concern the different tendency of the two system be self-evident but fact be not want to confirm it mr long have remark that all the insurrection and suicide in jamaica have be find among the import slave who not have lose the consciousness of civil rights which they have enjoy in they own country could not brook the indignity to which they be subject in the west indy a instance in point be afford also by what have lately take place in the island of dominica the disturbance there have be chiefly occasion by some runaway slave from the french island but what a illustration be it of he own doctrine to say that the slave of several person who have be treat with kindness be not among the number of the insurgent on that occasion but when person coolly talk of put a end to the slave trade through the medium of the west indium legislature and of gradual abolition by means of regulation they surely forget the misery which this horrid traffic occasion in africa during every moment of its continuance this consideration be conclusive with he when call upon to decide whether the slave trade should be tolerate for a while or immediately abolish the divine law against murder be absolute and unqualified whilst we be ignorant of all these thing we sanction of they might in some measure be pardon but now when we eye be open could we tolerate they for a moment unless we be ready at once to determine that gain should be we god and like the heathen of old be prepare to offer up human victim at the shrine of we idolatry this consideration preclude also the give heed for a instant to another plea namely that if we be to abolish the trade it would be proportionably take up by other nation but whatever other nation do it become great britain in every point of view to take a forward part one half of this guilty commerce have be carry on by she subject as we have be great in crime we should be early in we repentance if providence have shower he blessing upon we in unparalleled abundance we should show ourselves grateful for they by render they subservient to the purpose for which they be intend there would be a day of retribution wherein we should have to give a account of all those talent faculty and opportunity with which we have be intrust let it not then appear that we superior power have be employ to oppress we fellow-creature and we superior light to darken the creation of god he could not but look forward with delight to the happy prospects which open themselves to he view in africa from the abolition of the slave trade when a commerce justly deserving that name should be establish with she not like that falsely so call which now subsist and which all who be interested for the honor of the commercial character -lrb- though there be no superior principle -rrb- should hasten to disavow have this trade indeed be ever so profitable he decision would have be in no degree affect by that consideration here be the smell of blood on the hand still and all the perfume of arabium can not sweeten it he doubt whether it be not almost a act of degrading condescension to stoop to discuss the question in the view of commercial interest on this ground however he be no less strong than on every other africa abound with production of value which she would gladly exchange for we manufacture when these be not otherwise to be obtain : and to what a extent she demand might then grow exceed almost the power of computation one instance already exist of a native king who be debar by he religion the use of spirituous liquor and therefore not feel the irresistible temptation to act of rapine which they afford to he countryman have abolish the slave trade throughout all he dominion and be encourage a honest industry for he own part he declare that interested as he might be suppose to be in the final event of the question he be comparatively indifferent as to the present decision of the house upon it whatever they might do the people of great britain he be confident would abolish the slave trade when as would then soon happen its injustice and cruelty should be fairly lay before they it be a nest of serpent which would never have exist so long but for the darkness in which they lay hide the light of day would now be let in on they and they would vanish from the sight for himself he declare he be engage in a work which he would never abandon the consciousness of the justice of he cause would carry he forward though he be alone but he could not but derive encouragement from consider with whom he be associate let we not he say despair it be a bless cause and success ere long will crown we exertion already we have gain one victory we have obtain for these poor creature the recognition of they human nature -lrb- a -rrb- which for a while be most shamefully deny they this be the first fruit of we effort let we persevere and we triumph will be complete never never will we desist till we have wipe away this scandal from the christian name till we have release ourselves from the load of guilt under which we at present labor and till we have extinguish every trace of this bloody traffic which we posterity look back to the history of these enlighten time will scarcely believe have be suffer to exist so long a disgrace and a dishonor to we country -lrb- footnote a : this point be actually obtain by the evidence before the house of common for after this we hear no more of they as a inferior race -rrb- he then move that the chairman be instruct to move for leave to bring in a bill to prevent the further importation of slave into the british colony in the west indy colonel tarleton immediately rise up and begin by give a historical account of the trade from the reign of elizabeth to the present time he then proceed to the sanction which parliament have always give it hence it could not then be withdraw without a breach of faith : hence also the private property embark in it be sacred nor could it be invade unless a adequate compensation be give in return they who have attempt the abolition of the trade be lead away by a mistaken humanity the african themselves have no objection to its continuance with respect to the middle passage he believe the mortality there to be on a average only five in the hundred whereas in regiment send out to the west indy the average loss in the year be about ten and a half per cent the slave trade be absolutely necessary if we mean to carry on we west indium commerce for many attempt have be make to cultivate the land in the different island by white labourer but they have always fail it have also the merit of keep up a number of seaman in readiness for the state lord rodney have state this as one of its advantage on the break out of a war liverpool alone could supply nine hundred and ninety-three seaman annually he would now advert to the connexion dependent upon the african trade it be the duty of the house to protect the planter whose life have be and be then expose to imminent danger and whose property have undergo a unmerited depreciation to what could this depreciation and to what could the late insurrection at dominica be imputed which have be save from horrid carnage and midnight-butchery only by the adventitious arrival of two british regiment they could only be attribute to the long delay question of the abolition of the slave trade and if this question be to go much longer unsettled jamaica would be endanger also to member of land property he would observe that the abolition would lessen the commerce of the country and increase the national debt and the number of they tax the minister he hope who patronize this wild scheme have some new pecuniary resource in store to supply the deficiency it would occasion to the mercantile member he would speak thus : a few ministerial man in the house have be gifted with religious inspiration and this have be communicate to other eminent personage in it : these enlighten philanthropist have discover that it be necessary for the sake of humanity and for the honor of the nation that the merchant concern in the african trade should be persecute notwithstanding the sanction of they trade by parliament and notwithstanding that such persecution must aggrandize the rival of great britain now how do this language sound it might have do in the twelfth century when all be bigotry and superstition but let not a mistaken humanity in these enlighten time furnish a colourable pretext for any injurious attack on property or character these thing be consider he should certainly oppose the measure in contemplation it would annihilate a trade whose export amount to eight hundred thousand pound annually and which employ a hundred and sixty vessel and more than five thousand seaman it would destroy also the west indium trade which be of the annual value of six million and which employ one hundred and sixty thousand ton of shipping and seaman in proportion these be object of too much importance to the country to be hazard on a unnecessary speculation mr grosvenor then rise he compliment the humanity of mr wilberforce though he differ from he on the subject of he motion he himself have read only the privy council report and he wish for no other evidence the question have then be delay two year have the abolition be so clear a point as it be say to be it could not have need either so much evidence or time he have hear a good deal about kidnapping and other barbarous practice he be sorry for they but these be the natural consequence of the law of africa and it become we as wise man to turn they to we own advantage the slave trade be certainly not a amiable trade neither be that of a butcher but yet it be a very necessary one there be great reason to doubt the propriety of the present motion he have twenty reason for disapprove it the first be that the thing be impossible he need not therefore to give the rest parliament indeed might relinquish the trade but to whom to foreigner who would continue it and without the humane regulation which be apply to it by he countryman he would give advice to the house on this subject in the word which the late alderman beckford use a different occasion : -- meddle not with troubled water they will be find to be bitter water and the water of affliction he again admit that the slave trade be not a amiable trade but he would not gratify he humanity at the expense of the interest of he country and he think we should not too curiously inquire into the unpleasant circumstance which attend it mr jame martin succeed mr grosvenor he say he have be long aware how much self-interest could pervert the judgment but he be not apprize of the full power of it till the slave trade become a subject of discussion he have always conceive that the custom of trafficing in human being have be incautiously begin and without any reflection upon it for he never could believe that any man under the influence of moral principle could suffer himself knowingly to carry on a trade replete with fraud cruelty and destruction with destruction indeed of the worst kind because it subject the sufferer to a linger death but he find now that even such a trade as this could be sanction it be well observe in the petition from the university of cambridge against the slave trade that a firm belief in the providence of a benevolent creator assure they that no system found on the oppression of one part of mankind could be beneficial to another he feel much concern that in a assembly of the representative of the country boast itself zealous not only for the preservation of its own liberty but for the general rights of mankind it should be necessary to say a single word upon such a subject but the deceitfulness of the human heart be such as to change the appearance of truth when it stand in opposition to self-interest and he have to lament that even among those whose public duty it be to cling to the universal and eternal principle of truth justice and humanity there be find some who could defend that which be unjust fraudulent and cruel the doctrine he have hear that evening ought to have be reserve for time the most flagrantly profligate and abandon he never expect then to learn that the everlasting law of righteousness be to give way to imaginary political and commercial expediency and that thousand of we fellow-creature be to be reduce to wretchedness that individual might enjoy opulence or government a revenue he hope that the house for the sake of its own character would explode these doctrine with all the mark of odium they deserve and that all party would join in give a death-blow to this execrable trade the royal family would he expect from they known benevolence patronize the measure both house of parliament be now engage in the prosecution of a gentleman accuse of cruelty and oppression in the east but what be these cruelty even if they could be bring home to he when compare in number and degree to those which be every day and every hour commit in the abominable traffic which be now under they discussion he consider therefore both house of parliament as pledge upon this occasion of the support of the bishop he could have no doubt because they be to render christianity amiable both by they doctrine and they example some of the inferior clergy have already manifest a laudable zeal in behalf of the injured african the university of cambridge have present a petition to that house worthy of itself the sister-university have by one of she representative give sanction to the measure dissenter of various denomination but particularly the quaker -lrb- who to they immortal honor have take the lead in it -rrb- have vie with those of the established church in this amiable contest the first county and some of the largest trading town in the kingdom have espouse the cause in short there have never be more unanimity in the country than in this righteous attempt with such support and with so good a cause it would be impossible to fail let but every man stand forth who have at any time boast of himself as a englishman and success would follow but if he be to be unhappily mistake as to the result we must give up the name of englishman indeed if we retain it we should be the greatest hypocrite in the world for we boast of nothing more than of we own liberty we manifest the warmest indignation at the smallest personal insult we profess liberal sentiment towards other nation : but to do these thing and to continue such a traffic would be to deserve the hateful character before mention while we could hardly bear the sight of anything resemble slavery even as a punishment among ourselves how could we consistently entail a eternal slavery upon other it have be frequently but most disgracefully say that we should not be too eager in set the example : let the french begin it such a sentiment be a direct libel upon the ancient noble and generous character of this nation we ought on the other hand under the blessing we enjoy and under the high sense we entertain of we own dignity as a people to be proudly fearful lest other nation should anticipate we design and obtain the palm before we it become we to lead and if other should not follow we it would belong to they to glory in the shame of trample under foot the law of reason humanity and religion this motion he say come strongly recommend to they the honorable member who introduce it be justly esteem for he character he be the representative too of a noble county which have be always ready to take the lead in every public measure for the good of the community or for the general benefit of mankind of a county too which have have the honor of produce a saville have he illustrious predecessor be alive he would have show the same zeal on the same occasion the preservation of the unalienable rights of all he fellow-creature be one of the chief characteristic of that excellent citizen let every member in that house imitate he in the purity of they conduct and in the universal rectitude of they measure and they would pay the same tender regard to the rights of other country as to those of they own and for he part he should never believe those person to be sincere who be loud in they profession of love of liberty if he see that love confine to the narrow circle of one community which ought to be extend to the natural rights of every inhabitant of the globe but we should be better able to bring ourselves up to this standard of rectitude if we be to put ourselves into the situation of those whom we oppress this be the rule of we religion what should we think of those who should say that it be they interest to injure we but he hope we should not deceive ourselves so grossly as to imagine that it be we real interest to oppress any one the advantage to be obtain by tyranny be imaginary and deceitful to the tyrant and the evil they cause to the oppress be grievous and often insupportable before he sit down he would apologize if he have express himself too warmly on this subject he do not mean to offend any one there be person connect with the trade some of whom he pity on account of the difficulty of they situation but he should think most contemptibly of himself as a man if he could talk on this traffic without emotion it would be a sign to he of he own moral degradation he regret he inability to do justice to such a cause but if in have attempt to forward it he have show the weakness of he power he must console himself with the consideration that he feel more solid comfort in have act up to sound public principle than he could have do from the exercise of the most splendid talent against the conviction of he conscience mr burdon rise and say he be embarrass to know how to act mr wilberforce have in a great measure meet he idea indeed he consider himself as much in he hand but he wish to go gradually to the abolition of the trade he wish to give time to the planter to recruit they stock he fear the immediate abolition might occasion a monopoly among such of they as be rich to the detriment of the less affluent we ought like a judicious physician to follow nature and to promote a gradual recovery mr franci rise next after compliment mr wilberforce he state that personal consideration might appear to incline he to go against the side which he be about to take namely that of strenuously support he motion have himself a interest in the west indy he think that what he should submit to the house would have the double effect of evidence and argument and he state most unequivocally he opinion that the abolition of the slave trade would tend materially to the benefit of the west indy the argument urge by the honorable mover be support by the fact which he have adduce from the evidence more strongly than any argument have be support in any speech he have ever hear he wish however that more of these fact have be introduce into the debate for they be apt to have a greater effect upon the mind than mere reasoning however just and powerful many have affirm that the slave trade be politic and expedient but it be worthy of remark that no man have venture to deny that it be criminal criminal however he declare it to be in the highest degree and he believe it be equally impolitic both its inexpediency and injustice have be establish by the honorable mover he dwell much on the unhappy situation of the negro in the west indy who be without the protection of government or of efficient law and subject to the mere caprice of man who be at once the party the judge and the executioner he instance a overseer who have throw a negro into a copper of boil cane-juice for a trifling offence be punish merely by the loss of he place and by be oblige to pay the value of the slave he state another instance of a girl of fourteen who be dreadfully whip for come too late to she work she fall down motionless after it and be then drag along the ground by the leg to a hospital where she die the murderer though try be acquit by a jury of he peer upon the idea that it be impossible a master could destroy he own property this be a notorious fact it be publish in the _ jamaica gazette _ and it have even happen since the question of the abolition have be start the only argument use against such cruelty be the master 's interest in the slave but he urge the common cruelty to horse in which they driver have a equal interest with the driver of man in the colony as a proof that this be no security he have never hear a instance of a master be punish for the murder of he slave the propagation of the slave be so far from be encourage that it be purposely check because it be think more profitable and less troublesome to buy a full grown negro than to rear a child he repeat that he interest might have incline he to the other side of the question but he do not choose to compromise between he interest and he duty for if he abandon he duty he should not be happy in this world nor should he deserve happiness in the next mr pitt rise but he say it be only to move see that justice could not be do to the subject this evening that the further consideration of the question might be adjourn to the next mr cawthorne and colonel tarleton both oppose this motion and colonel phipp and lord carhampton support it mr fox say the opposition to the adjournment be uncandid and unbecoming they who oppose it well know that the trade could not bear discussion let it be discuss and although there be symptom of predetermination in some the abolition of it must be carry he would not believe that there could be find in the house of common man of such hard heart and inaccessible understanding as to vote a assent to its continuance and then go home to they family satisfy with they vote after they have be once make acquaint with the subject mr pitt agree with mr fox that from a full discussion of the subject there be every reason to augur that the abolition would be adopt under the imputation with which this trade be load gentleman should remember they could not do justice to they own character unless they stand up and give they reason for oppose the abolition of it it be unusual also to force any question of such importance to so hasty a decision for he own part it be he duty from the situation in which he stand to state fully he own sentiment on the question and however exhaust both he and the house might be he be resolve it should not pass without discussion as long as he have strength to utter a word upon it every principle that could bind a man of honor and conscience would impel he to give the most powerful support he could to the motion for the abolition the motion of mr pitt be assent to and the house be adjourn accordingly on the next day the subject be resume sir william yonge rise and say that though he differ from the honorable mover he have much admire he speech of the last evening indeed the recollection of it make he only the more sensible of the weakness of he own power and yet have what he suppose to be irrefragable argument in he possession he feel embolden to proceed and first before he could vote for the abolition he wish to be convince that whilst britain be to lose africa would gain as for himself he hate a traffic in man and joyfully anticipate its termination at no distant period under a wise system of regulation : but he consider the present measure as crude and indolent and as preclude better and wiser measure which be already in train a british parliament should attain not only the best end but by the wisest means great britain might abandon she share of this trade but she could not abolish it parliament be not a assembly of delegate from the power of europe but of a single nation it could not therefore suppress the trade but would eventually aggravate those misery incident to it which every enlighten man must acknowledge and every good man must deplore he wish the traffic for ever close but other nation be only wait for we decision to seize the part we should leave they the new project of these would be intemperate and in the zeal of rivalship the present evil of comparatively sober deal would be aggravate beyond all estimate in this new and heated auction of bidder for life and limb we might indeed by regulation give a example of new principle of policy and of justice but if we be to withdraw suddenly from this commerce like pontius pilate we should wash we hand indeed but we should not be innocent as to the consequence on the first agitation of this business mr wilberforce have speak confidently of other nation follow we example but have not the national assembly of france refer the slave trade to a select committee and have not that committee reject the measure of its abolition by the evidence it appear that the french and spaniard be then give bounty to the slave trade that denmark be desirous of follow it that america be encourage it and that the dutch have recognize its necessity and recommend its recovery thing be bad enough indeed as they be but he be sure this rivalship would make they worse he do not admit the disorder imputed to the trade in all they extent pillage and kidnapping could not be general on account of the populousness of the country though too frequent instance of it have be prove crime might be falsely imputed this he admit but only partially witchcraft he believe be the secret of poisoning and therefore deserve the severest punishment that there should be a number of conviction for adultery where polygamy be a custom be not to be wonder at but he fear if a sale of these criminal be to be do away massacre would be the substitute a honorable member have ask on a former day be it a excuse for robbery to say that another would hare commit it but the slave trade do not necessarily imply robbery not long since great britain sell she convict indirectly at least to slavery but he be no advocate for the trade he wish it have begin and that it might soon terminate but the means be not adequate to the end propose mr burke have say on a former occasion that in adopt measure we must prepare to pay the price of we virtue he be ready to pay he share of that price but the effect of the purchase must be first ascertain if they do not estimate this it be not benevolence but dissipation effect be to be duly appreciate and though statesman might rest everything on a manifesto of cause the humbler moralist meditate peace and good will towards man would venture to call such statesman responsible for consequence in regard to the colony a sudden abolition would be oppression the legislature there should be lead and not force upon this occasion he be persuade they would act wisely to attain the end point out to they they would see that a natural increase of they negro might be effect by a improved system of legislation and that in the result the slave trade would be no longer necessary a sudden abolition also would occasion dissatisfaction there supplies be necessary for some time to come the negro do not yet generally increase by birth the gradation of age be not yet duly fill these and many defect might be remedy but not suddenly it would cause also distress there the planter not have they expect supplies could not discharge they debt hence they slave would be seize and sell nor be there any provision in this case against the separation of family except as to the mother and infant child these separation be one of the chief outrage complain of in africa why then should we promote they in the west indy the confinement on board a slave-ship have be also bitterly complain of but under distraint for the debt of a master the poor slave might linger in a gaol twice or thrice the time of the middle passage he again state he abhorrence of the slave trade but as a resource though he hope but a temporary one it be of such consequence to the existence of the country that it could not suddenly be withdraw the value of the import and export between great britain and the west indy include the excise and custom be between seven and eight million annually and the tonnage of the ship employ about a eighth of the whole tonnage of these kingdom he complain that in the evidence the west indian planter have be by no means spare cruel story have be hastily and lightly tell against they invidious comparison have be make to they detriment but it be well know that one of we best comic writer when he wish to show benevolence in its fairest color have personify it in the character of the west indian he wish the slave might become as secure as the apprentice in this country but it be necessary that the alarm concern the abolition of the slave trade should in the mean time be quiet and he trust that the good sense and true benevolence of the house would reject the present motion mr matthew montagu rise and say a few word in support of the motion and after condemn the trade in the strongest manner he declare that as long as he have life he would use every faculty of he body and mind in endeavor to promote its abolition lord john russell succeed mr montagu he say that although slavery be repugnant to he feeling he must vote against the abolition as visionary and delusive it be a feeble attempt without the power to serve the cause of humanity other nation would take up the trade whenever a bill of wise regulation should be bring forward no man would be more ready than himself to lend he support in this way the rights of humanity might be assert without injury to other he hope he should not incur censure by he vote for let he understanding be what it might he do not know that he have notwithstanding the assertion of mr fox a inaccessible heart mr stanley -lrb- agent for the island -rrb- rise next he feel himself call upon he say to refute the many calumny which have for year be propagate against the planter -lrb- even through the medium of the pulpit which should have be employ to better purpose -rrb- and which have at length produce the mischievous measure which be now under the discussion of the house a cry have be sound forth and from one end of the kingdom to the other as if there have never be a slave from adam to the present time but it appear to he to have be the intention of providence from the very begin that one set of man should be slave to another this truth be as old as it be universal it be recognize in every history under every government and in every religion nor do the christian religion itself if the comment of dr halifax bishop of gloucester on a passage of st paul 's epistle to the corinthian be true show more repugnance to slavery than any other he deny that the slave be procure in the manner which have be describe it be the custom of all savage to kill they prisoner and the african ought to be thankful that they have be carry safe into the british colony as to the tale of misery in the middle passage they be gross falsehood and as to they treatment in the west indy he know personally that it be in general indulgent and humane with regard to promote they increase by any better mode of treatment he wish gentleman would point it out to he as a planter he would thank they for it it be absurd to suppose that he and other be blind to they own interest it be well know that one creole slave be worth two african and they interest therefore must suggest to they that the propagation of slave be preferable to the purchase of import negro of whom one half very frequently die in the seasoning he then argue the impossibility of beast do the work of the plantation he endeavor to prove that the number of these adequate to this purpose could not be supply with food and after have make many other observation which on account of the lowness of he voice could not be hear he conclude by object to the motion mr william smith rise he wonder how the last speaker could have have the boldness to draw argument from scripture in support of the slave trade such argument could be intend only to impose on those who never take the trouble of think for themselves could it be think for a moment that the good sense of the house could be mislead by a few perverted or misapplied passage in direct opposition to the whole tenor and spirit of christianity to the theory he might say of almost every religion which have ever appear in the world whatever might have be advance every body must feel that the slave trade could not exist a hour if that excellent maxim to do to other as we would wish that other should do to we have its proper influence on the conduct of man nor be mr stanley more happy in he argument of the antiquity and universality of slavery because a practice have exist do it necessarily follow that it be just by this argument every crime might be defend from the time of cain the slave of antiquity however be in a situation far preferable to that of the negro in the west indy a passage in macrobius which exemplify this in the strongest manner be now bring to he recollection we ancestor say macrobius denominate the master father of the family and the slave domestic with the intention of remove all odium from the condition of the master and all contempt from that of the servant could this language be apply to the present state of west indium slavery it have be complain of by those who support the trade that they labor under great disadvantage by be oblige to contend against the most splendid ability which the house could boast but he believe they labor under one which be worse and for which no talent could compensate he mean the impossibility of maintain they ground fairly on any of those principle which every man within those wall have be accustom from he infancy to venerate as sacred he and he friend too labor under some disadvantage they have be charge with fanaticism but what have mr long say when he address himself to those planter who be desirous of attempt improvement on they estate he advise they not to be divert by partial view vulgar prejudice or the ridicule which might spring from weak mind from a benevolent attention to the public good but neither by these nor by other charge be he or he friend to be divert from the prosecution of they purpose they be convince of the rectitude and high importance of they object and be determine never to desist from pursue it till it should be attain but they have to struggle with difficulty far more serious the west indian interest which oppose they be a collect body of great power affluence connexion and respectability artifice have also be employ abolition and emancipation have be so often confound and by those who know better that it must have be purposely do to throw a odium on the measure which be now before they the abolitionist have be also accuse as the author of the late insurrection in dominica a revolt have certainly take place in that island but revolt there have occur frequently before mr stanley himself in attempt to fix this charge upon they have related circumstance which amount to they entire exculpation he have say that all be quiet there till the disturbance in the french island when some negro from the latter have find they way to dominica and have excite the insurrection in question he have also say that the negro in we own island hate the idea of the abolition for they think as no new labourer be to come in they should be subject to increase hardship but if they and they master hate this same measure how be this coincidence of sentiment to give birth to insurrection other fallacy also have be industriously propogate of the african trade it have be say that the export amount to a million annually whereas from the report on the table it have on a average amount to little more than half a million and this include the article for the purchase of african produce which be of the value of 140000_l _ the east indian trade also have be say to depend on the west indian and the african in the first place it have but very little connexion with the former at all its connexion with the latter be principally on account of the saltpetre which it furnish for make gunpowder out of nearly three million of pound in weight of the latter article which have be export in a year from this country one-half have be send to africa alone for the purpose doubtless of maintain peace and encouraging civilization among its various tribe four or five thousand person be say also to depend for they bread in manufacture gun for the african trade and these it be pretend could not make gun of another sort -- but where lay the difficulty -- one of the witness have unravel it he have see the negro maim by the bursting of these gun they kill more from the butt than from the muzzle another have state that on the sea-coast the native be afraid to fire a trade-gun in the west indian commerce two hundred and forty thousand ton of shipping be state to be employ but here deception intrude itself again this statement include every vessel great and small which go from the british west indy to america and to the foreign island and what be yet more unfair all the repeat voyage of each throughout the year the shipping which could only fairly be bring into this account do but just exceed half that which have be mention in a similar manner have the island themselves be overrate they value have be compute for the information of the privy council at thirty-six million but the planter have estimate they at seventy the truth however might possibly lie between these extreme he by no means wish to depreciate they importance but he do not like that such palpable misrepresentation should go unnoticed a honorable member -lrb- colonel tarleton -rrb- have disclaim every attempt to interest the feeling of those present but have desire to call they to reason and account he also desire -lrb- though it be a question of feeling if any one ever be -rrb- to draw the attention of the committee to reason and account -- to the voice of reason instead of that of prejudice and to account in the place of idle apprehension the result he doubt not would be a full persuasion that policy and justice be inseparable upon this as upon every other occasion the same gentleman have enlarged on the injustice of deprive the liverpool merchant of a business on which be found they honor and they fortune on what part of it they found they honor he could not conjecture except from those passage in the evidence where it appear that they agent in africa have systematically practice every fraud and villany which the meanest and most unprincipled cunning could suggest to impose on the ignorance of those with whom they trade the same gentleman have also lament that the evidence have not be take upon oath he himself lament it too numberless fact have be relate by eye-witness call in support of the abolition so dreadfully atrocious that they appear incredible and seem rather to use the expression of ossian like the history of the day of other time these procure for the trade a species of acquittal which it could not have obtain have the committee be authorise to administer a oath he apprehend also in this case that some other person would have be rather more guard in they testimony captain knox would not then perhaps have tell the committee that six hundred slave could have have comfortable room at night in he vessel of about one hundred and forty ton when there could have be no more than five foot six inch in length and fifteen inch in breadth to about two-third of he number the same gentleman have also dwell upon the slave trade as a nursery for seaman but it have appear by the muster-roll of the slave-vessel then actually on the table of the house that more than a fifth of they die in the service exclusive of those who perish when discharge in the west indy and yet he have be instruct by he constituent to maintain this false position he reasoning too be very curious for though number might die yet as one half who enter be landsmen seaman be continually form not to dwell on the expensive cruelty of form these seaman by the yearly destruction of so many hundred this very statement be flatly contradict by the evidence the muster-roll from bristol state the proportion of landsman in the trade there at one twelfth and the proper officer of liverpool itself at but a sixteenth of the whole employ in the face again of the most glaring fact other have maintain that the mortality in these vessel do not exceed that of other trade in the tropical climate but the same document which prove that twenty-three per cent be destroy in this waste traffic prove that in west indium ship only about one and a half per cent be lose include every casualty but the very man under whose management this dreadful mortality have be constantly occur have coolly say that much of it might be avoid by proper regulation how criminal then be they who know this have neither publicly propose nor in they practice adopt a remedy the average loss of the slave on board which have be calculate by mr wilberforce at twelve and a half per cent have be deny he believe this calculation take in all the circumstance connect with it to be true but that for year not less than one-tenth have so perished he would challenge those concern in the traffic to disprove much evidence have be produce on the subject but the voyage have be generally select there be only one who have disclose the whole account this be mr anderson of london whose engagement in this trade have be very inconsiderable he loss have only amount to three per cent but unfortunately for the slave-trader of liverpool he vessel have not take above three-fourth of that number in proportion to the tonnage which they have state to be necessary to the very existence of they trade a honorable member -lrb- mr grosvenor -rrb- have attribute the protraction of this business to those who have introduce it but from whom do the motion for further evidence -lrb- when that of the privy council be refuse -rrb- originate but from the enemy of the abolition the same gentleman have say it be impossible to abolish the trade but where be the impossibility of forbid the further importation of slave into we own colony and beyond this the motion do not extend the latter argument have also be advance by sir william yonge and other but allow it its full force would there be no honor in the dereliction of such a commerce would it be nothing publicly to recognize great and just principle would we example be nothing -- yes : every country would learn from we experiment that american colony could be cultivate without the necessity of continual supplies equally expensive and disgraceful but we might do more than merely lay down principle or propose example we might in fact diminish the evil itself immediately by no inconsiderable part -- by the whole of we own supply and here he could not at all agree with the honorable baronet in what seem to he a commercial paradox that the take away from a open trade by far the largest customer and the lessen of the consumption of the article would increase both the competition and the demand and of course all those mischief which it be they intention to avert that the civilization of the african be promote as have be assert by they intercourse with the european be void of foundation as have appear from the evidence in manners and dishonesty they have indeed assimilate with those who frequent they coast but the greatest industry and the least corruption of moral be in the interior where they be out of the way of this civilizing connexion to relieve africa from famine be another of the benign reason which have be assign for continue the trade that famine have occur there he do not doubt but that they should annually occur and with such arithmetical exactness as to suit the demand of the slave trade be a circumstance most extraordinary so wonderful indeed that could it once be prove he should consider it as a far better argument in favor of the divine approbation of that trade than any which have ever yet be produce as to the effect of the abolition on the west indy it would give weight to every humane regulation which have be make by substitute a certain and obvious interest in the place of one depend upon chance and calculation a honorable member -lrb- mr stanley -rrb- have speak of the impossibility of cultivate the estate there without further importation of negro and yet of all the authority he have bring to prove he case there be scarcely one which might not be press to serve more or less effectually against he almost every planter he have name have find he negro increase under the good treatment he have profess to give they and it be a axiom throughout the whole evidence that wherever they be well use importation be not necessary it have be say indeed by some adverse witness that in jamaica all possible means have be use to keep up the stock by breed but how preposterous be this when it be allow that the moral of the slave have be totally neglect and that the planter prefer buy a larger proportion of male than female the misfortune be that prejudice and not reason be the enemy to be subdue the prejudice of the west indian on these point be numerous and inveterate mr long himself have characterise they on this account in term which he should have feel diffident in use but mr long have show he own prejudice also : for he justify the chaining of the negro on board the slave-vessel on account of they bloody cruel and malicious disposition but hear he commendation of some of the aborigine of jamaica who have miserably perish in cave whither they have retire to escape the tyranny of the spaniard these say he leave a glorious monument of they have disdain to survive the loss of they liberty and they country and yet this same historian could not perceive that this natural love of liberty might operate as strongly and as laudably in the african negro as in the indian of jamaica he be concern to acknowledge that these prejudice be yet further strengthen by resentment against those who have take a active part in the abolition of the slave trade but it be never the object of these to throw a stigma on the whole body of the west indian but to prove the miserable effect of the trade this it be they duty to do and if in do this disgraceful circumstance have come out it be not they fault and it must never be forget that they be true that the slave be expose to great misery in the island be true as well from inference as from fact : for what might not be expect from the use of arbitrary power where the three character of party judge and executioner be unite the slave too be more capable on account of they passion than the beast in the field of exciting the passion of they tyrant to what a length the ill-treatment of they might be carry might be learn from the instance which general tottenham mention to have see in the year 1780 in the street of bridge town barbado : a youth about nineteen -lrb- to use he own word in the evidence -rrb- entirely naked with a iron collar about he neck have five long project spike he body both before and behind be cover with wound he belly and thigh be almost cut to piece with run ulcer all over they and a finger might have be lay in some of the weal he could not sit down because he hinder part be mortified and it be impossible for he to lie down on account of the prong of he collar he supplicate the general for relief the latter ask who have punish he so dreadfully the youth answer he master have do it and because he could not work this same master in the same spirit of perversion which extort from scripture a justification of the slave trade have fulfil the apostolic maxim that he should have nothing to eat the use he mean to make of this instance be to show the unprotected state of the slave what must it be where such a instance could pass not only unpunished but almost unregarded if in the street of london but a dog be to be see lacerate like this miserable man how would the cruelty of the wretch be execrate who have thus even abuse a brute the judicial punishment also inflict upon the negro show the low estimation in which in consequence of the strength of old custom and deep-rooted prejudice they be hold mr edward in he speech to the assembly at jamaica state the follow case as one which have happen in one of the rebellion there some slave surround the dwelling-house of they mistress she be in bed with a lovely infant they deliberate upon the means of put she to death in torment but in the end one of they reserve she for he mistress and they kill she infant with a axe before she face now say mr edward -lrb- address himself to he audience -rrb- you will think that no torment be too great for such horrible excess nevertheless i be of a different opinion i think that death unaccompanied with cruelty should be the utmost exertion of human authority over we unhappy fellow-creature torment however be always inflict in these case the punishment be gibbet alive and expose the delinquent to perish by the gradual effect of hunger thirst and parching sun in which situation they be know to suffer for nine day with a fortitude scarcely credible never utter a single groan but horrible as the excess might have be which occasion these punishment it must be remember that they be commit by ignorant savage who have be drag from all they hold most dear whose patience have be exhaust by a cruel and loathsome confinement during they transportation and whose resentment have be wind up to the highest pitch of fury by the lash of the driver but he would now mention another instance by way of contrast out of the evidence a child on board a slave-ship of about ten month old take sulk and would not eat the captain flog it with a cat swearing that he would make it eat or kill it from this and other ill-treatment the child 's leg swell he then order some water to be make hot to abate the swell but even he tender mercy be cruel for the cook on put he hand into the water say it be too hot upon this the captain swear at he and order the foot to be put in this be do the nail and skin come off oiled cloth be then put round they the child be at length tie to a heavy log two or three day afterwards the captain catch it up again and repeat that he would make it eat or kill it he immediately flog it again and in a quarter of a hour it die but after the child be dead whom should the barbarian select to throw it overboard but the wretched mother in vain she start from the office he beat she till he make she take up the child and carry it to the side of the vessel she then drop it into the sea turn she head the other way that she might not see it now it would naturally be ask be not this captain also gibbet alive alas although the execrable barbarity of the european exceed that of the african before mention almost as much as he opportunity of instruction have be greater than theirs no notice whatsoever be take of this horrible action and a thousand similar cruelty have be commit in this abominable trade with equal impunity : but he would say no more he would vote for the abolition not only as it would do away all the evil complain of in africa and the middle passage but as it would be the most effectual means of ameliorate the condition of those unhappy person who be still to continue slave in the british colony mr courtenay rise he say he could not but consider the assertion of sir william yonge as a mistake that the slave trade if abandon by we would fall into the hand of france it ought to be recollect with what approbation the motion for abolish it make by the late mirabeau have be receive although the situation of the french colony might then have present obstacle to carry the measure into immediate execution he have no doubt if parliament be to begin so wise and enlighten a body as the national assembly would follow the example but even if france be not to relinquish the trade how could we if justice require its abolition hesitate as to we part of it the trade it have be say be conduct upon the principle of humanity yes : we rescue the african from what we be please to call they wretched situation in they own country and then we take credit for we humanity because after have kill one half of they in the seasoning we substitute what we be again pleased to call a better treatment than that which they would have experience at home it have be state that the principle of war among savage be a general massacre this be not true they frequently adopt the captive into they own family and so far from massacre the woman and child they often give they the protection which the weakness of they age and sex demand there could be no doubt that the practice of kidnapping prevail in africa as to witchcraft it have be make a crime in the reign of jame the first in this country for the purpose of information and how much more likely be information to take place in africa under the encouragement afford by the slave trade this trade it have be say be sanction by twenty-six act of parliament he do not doubt but fifty-six might be find by which parliament have sanction witchcraft of the existence of which we have now no belief whatever it have be say by mr stanley that the pulpit have be use as a instrument of attack on the slave trade he be happy to learn it have be so well employ and he hope the bishop would rise up in the house of lord with the virtuous indignation which become they to abolish a traffic so contrary to humanity justice and religion he entreat every member to recollect that on he vote that night depend the happiness of million and that it be then in he power to promote a measure of which the benefit would be feel over one whole quarter of the globe that the seed of civilization might by the present bill be sow all over africa : and the first principle of humanity be establish in region where they have hitherto be exclude by the existence of this execrable trade lord carysfort rise and say that the great cause of the abolition have flourish by the manner in which it have be oppose no one argument of solid weight have be adduce against it it have be show but never disprove that the colonial law be inadequate to the protection of the slave that the punishment of the latter be most unmerciful that they be deprive of the right of self-defence against any white man and in short that the system be totally repugnant to the principle of the british constitution colonel phipp follow lord carysfort he deny that this be a question in which the rights of humanity and the law of nature be concern the african become slave in consequence of the constitution of they own government these be found in absolute despotism every subject be a actual slave the inhabitant be slave to the great man and the great man be slave to the prince prisoner of war too be by law subject to slavery such be the case he see no more cruelty in dispose of they to we merchant than to those of any other nation criminal also in case of adultery and witchcraft become slave by the same law it have be say that there be no regulation in the west indy for the protection of slave there be several though he be ready to admit that more be necessary and he would go in this respect as far as humanity might require he have pass ten month in jamaica where he have never see any such act of cruelty as have be talk of those which he have see be not exercise by the whites but by the black the dreadful story which have be tell ought no more to fix a general stigma upon the planter than the story of mr brownrigg to stamp this polished metropolis with the general brand of murder there be once a haberdasher 's wife -lrb- mr nairne -rrb- who lock up she apprentice girl and starve she to death but do ever any body think of abolish haberdashery on this account he be persuade the negro in the west indy be cheerful and happy they be fond of ornament but it be not the characteristic of miserable person to show a taste for finery such a taste on the contrary imply a cheerful and contented mind he be sorry to differ from he friend mr wilberforce but he must oppose he motion mr pitt rise and say that from the first hour of he have have the honor to sit in parliament down to the present among all the question whether political or personal in which it have be he fortune to take a share there have never be one in which he heart be so deeply interested as in the present both on account of the serious principle it involve and the consequence connect with it the present be not a mere question of feel the argument which ought in he opinion to determine the committee be that the slave trade be unjust it be therefore such a trade as it be impossible for he to support unless it could be first prove to he that there be no law of morality binding upon nation and that it be not the duty of a legislature to restrain its subject from invade the happiness of other country and from violate the fundamental principle of justice several have state the impracticability of the measure before they they wish to see the trade abolish but there be some necessity for continue it which they conceive to exist nay almost every one he believe appear to wish that the further importation of slave might cease provide it could be make out that the population of the west indy could be maintain without it he propose therefore to consider the latter point for as the impracticability of keep up the population there appear to operate as the chief objection he trust that by show it to be ill found he should clear away all other obstacle whatever so that have no ground either of justice or necessity to stand upon there could be no excuse leave to the committee for resist the present motion he might reasonably however hope that they would not reckon any small or temporary disadvantage which might arise from the abolition to be a sufficient reason against it it be surely not any slight degree of expediency nor any small balance of profit nor any light shades of probability on the one side rather than on the other which would determine they on this question he ask pardon even for the supposition the slave trade be a evil of such magnitude that there must be a common wish in the committee at once to put a end to it if there be no great and serious obstacle it be a trade by which multitude of unoffending nation be deprive of the blessing of civilization and have they peace and happiness invade it ought therefore to be no common expediency it ought to be nothing less than the utter ruin of we island which it become those to plead who take upon they to defend the continuance of it he could not help think that the west indium gentleman have manifest a over great degree of sensibility as to the point in question and that they alarm have be unreasonably excite upon it he have examine the subject carefully for himself : and he would now detail those reason which have induce he firmly to believe not only that no permanent mischief would follow from the abolition but not even any such temporary inconvenience as could be state to be a reason for prevent the house from agree to the motion before they on the contrary that the abolition itself would lay the foundation for the more solid improvement of all the various interest of those colony in do this he should apply he observation chiefly to jamaica which contain more than half the slave in the british west indy and if he should succeed in prove that no material detriment could arise to the population there this would afford so strong a presumption with respect to the other island that the house could no longer hesitate whether they should or should not put a stop to this most horrid trade in the twenty year end in 1788 the annual loss of slave in jamaica -lrb- that be the excess of death above the birth -rrb- appear to be one in the hundred in a preceding period the loss be greater and in a period before that greater still there have be a continual gradation in the decrease through the whole time it might fairly be conclude therefore that -lrb- the average log of the last period be one per cent -rrb- the loss in the former part of it would be somewhat more and in the latter part somewhat less than one per cent insomuch that it might be fairly question whether by this time the birth and death in jamaica might not be state as nearly equal it be to be add that a peculiar calamity which sweep away fifteen thousand slave have occasion a part of the mortality in the last-mentioned period the probable loss therefore now to be expect be very inconsiderable indeed there be however one circumstance to be add which the west indium gentleman in state this matter have entirely overlook and which be so material as clearly to reduce the probable diminution in the population of jamaica down to nothing in all the calculation he have refer to of the comparative number of birth and death all the negro in the island be include the newly import who die in the seasoning make apart but these swell most materially the number of the death now as these extraordinary death would cease as soon as the importation cease a deduction of they ought to be make from he present calculation but the number of those who thus die in the seasoning would make up of itself nearly the whole of that one per cent which have be state he particularly press a attention to this circumstance for the complaint of be likely to want hand in jamaica arise from the mistake of include the present unnatural death cause by the seasoning among the natural and perpetual muse of mortality these death be erroneously take into the calculation give the planter a idea that the number could not be keep up these death which be cause merely by the slave trade furnish the very ground therefore on which the continuance of that trade have be think necessary the evidence as to this point be clear for it would be find in that dreadful catalogue of death arise from the seasoning and the passage which the house have be condemn to look into that one half die a annual mortality of two thousand slave in jamaica might be therefore charge to the importation which compare with the whole number on the island hardly fall short of the whole one per cent decrease join this with all the other consideration he would then ask could the decrease of the slave in jamaica be such -- could the colony be so destitute of means -- could the planter when by they own account they be establish daily new regulation for the benefit of the slave -- could they under all these circumstance be permit to plead that total impossibility of keep up they number which they have rest on as be indeed the only possible pretext for allow fresh importation from africa he appeal therefore to the sober judgment of all whether the situation of jamaica be such as to justify a hesitation in agree to the present motion it might be observe also that when the importation should stop that disproportion between the sex which be one of the obstacle to population would gradually diminish and a natural order of thing be establish through the want of this natural order a thousand grievance be create which it be impossible to define and which it be in vain to think that under such circumstance we could cure but the abolition of itself would work this desirable effect the west indian would then feel a near and urgent interest to enter into a thousand little detail which it be impossible for he to describe but which would have the greatest influence on population a foundation would thus be lay for the general welfare of the island a new system would rise up the reverse of the old and eventually both they general wealth and happiness would increase he have now prove far more than he be bind to do for if he could only show that the abolition would not be ruinous it would be enough he could give up therefore three argument out of four through the whole of what he have say and yet have enough leave for he position as to the creole they would undoubtedly increase they differ in this entirely from the import slave who be both a burthen and a curse to themselves and other the measure now propose would operate like a charm and besides stop all the misery in africa and the passage would produce even more benefit in the west indy than legal regulation could effect he would now just touch upon the question of emancipation a rash emancipation of the slave would be mischievous in that unhappy situation to which we baneful conduct have bring ourselves and they it would be no justice on either side to give they liberty they be as yet incapable of it but they situation might be gradually amend they might be relieve from everything harsh and severe raise from they present degraded state and put under the protection of the law till then to talk of emancipation be insanity but it be the system of fresh importation which interfere with these principle of improvement and it be only the abolition which could establish they this suggestion have its foundation in human nature wherever the incentive of honor credit and fair profit appear energy would spring up and when these labourer should have the natural spring of human action afford they they would then rise to the natural level of human industry from jamaica he would now go to the other island in barbado the slave have rather increase in st kitt the decrease for fourteen year have be but three-fourths per cent but here many of the observation would apply which he have use in the case of jamaica in antigua many have die by a particular calamity but for this the decrease would have be trifling in nevi and montserrat there be little or no disproportion of the sex so that it might well be hope that the number would be keep up in these island in dominica some controversy have arise about the calculation but governor orde have state a increase of birth above the death from grenada and st vincent 's no accurate account have be deliver in answer to the query send they but they be probably not in circumstance less favourable than in the other island on a full review then of the state of the negro population in the west indy be there any serious ground of alarm from the abolition of the slave trade where be the impracticability on which alone so many have rest they objection must we not blush at pretend that it would distress we conscience to accede to this measure as far as the question of the negro population be concerned intolerable be the mischief of this trade both in its origin and through every stage of its progress to say that slave could be furnished we by fair and commercial means be ridiculous the trade sometimes cease as during the late war the demand be more or less accord to circumstance but how be it possible that to a demand so exceedingly fluctuate the supply should always exactly accommodate itself alas we make human being the subject of commerce we talk of they as such and yet we would not allow they the common principle of commerce that the supply must accommodate itself to the consumption it be not from war then that the slave be chiefly procure they be obtain in proportion as they be want if a demand for slave arise a supply be force in one way or other and it be in vain overpower as we then be with positive evidence as well as the reasonableness of the supposition to deny that by the slave trade we occasion all the enormity which have be allege against it sir william yonge have say that if we be not to take the african from they country they would be destroy but he have not yet read that all uncivilized nation destroy they captive we assume therefore what be false the very selling of they imply this for if they would sell they captive for profit why should they not employ they so as to receive a profit also nay many of they while there be no demand from the slave merchant be often actually so employ the trade too have be suspend during the war and it be never say or think that any such consequence have then follow the honorable baronet have also say to justification of the slave trade that witchcraft commonly imply poison and be therefore a punishable crime but do he recollect that not only the individual accuse but that he whole family be sell as slave the truth be we stop the natural progress of civilization in africa we cut she off from the opportunity of improvement we keep she down in a state of darkness bondage ignorance and bloodshed be not this a awful consideration for this country look at the map of africa and see how little useful intercourse have be establish on that vast continent while other country be assist and enlighten each other africa alone have none of these benefit we have obtain as yet only so much knowledge of she production as to show that there be a capacity for trade which we check indeed if the mischief there be out of the question the circumstance of the middle passage alone would in he mind be reason enough for the abolition such a scene as that of the slave-ship pass over with they wretched cargo to the west indy if it could be spread before the eye of the house would be sufficient of itself to make they vote in favor of it but when it could be add that the interest even of the west indy themselves rest on the accomplishment of this great event he could not conceive a act of more imperious duty than that which be impose upon the house of agree to the present motion sir archibald edmonstone rise and ask whether the present motion go so far as to pledge those who vote for it to a total and immediate abolition mr alderman watson rise next he defend the slave trade as highly beneficial to the country be one material branch of its commerce but he could not think of the african trade without connect it with the west indian the one hang upon the other a third important branch also depend upon it which be the newfoundland fishery the latter could not go on if it be not for the vast quantity of inferior fish buy up for the negro in the west indy and which quite unfit for any other market if therefore we destroy the african we destroy the other trade mr turgot he say have recommend in the national assembly of france the gradual abolition of the slave trade he would therefore recommend it to the house to adopt the same measure and to soften the rigor of slavery by wholesome regulation but a immediate abolition he could not countenance mr fox at length rise he observe that some expression which he have use on the precede day have be complain of as too harsh and severe he have since consider they but he could not prevail upon himself to retract they because if any gentleman after read the evidence on the table and attend to the debate could avow himself a abettor of this shameful traffic in human flesh it could only be either from some hardness of heart or some difficulty of understanding which he really know not how to account for some have consider this question as a question of political whereas it be a question of personal freedom political freedom be undoubtedly a great blessing but when it come to be compare with personal it sink to nothing to confound the two serve therefore to render all argument on either perplexing and unintelligible personal freedom be the first right of every human be it be a right of which he who deprive a fellow-creature be absolutely criminal in so deprive he and which he who withhold be no less criminal in withhold he could not therefore retract he word with respect to any who -lrb- whatever respect he might otherwise have for they -rrb- should by they vote of that night deprive they fellow-creature of so great a blessing nay he would go further he would say that if the house know what the trade be by the evidence do not by they vote mark to all mankind they abhorrence of a practice so savage so enormous so repugnant to all law human and divine they would consign they character to eternal infamy that the pretence of danger to we west indian island from the abolition of the slave trade be totally unfounded mr wilberforce have abundantly prove but if there be they who have not be satisfy with that proof be it possible to resist the argument of mr pitt on the same subject it have be show on a comparison of the birth and death in jamaica that there be not now any decrease of the slave but if there have be it would have make no difference to he in he vote for have the mortality be ever so great there he should have ascribe it to the system of import negro instead of that of encourage they natural increase be it not evident that the planter think it more convenient to buy they fit for work than to breed they why then be this horrid trade to be keep up -- to give the planter truly the liberty of misuse they slave so as to check population : for it be from ill-usage only that in a climate so natural to they they number could diminish the very ground therefore on which the planter rest the necessity of fresh importation namely the destruction of life in the west indy be itself the strongest argument that could be give and furnish the most imperious call upon parliament for the abolition of the trade against this trade innumerable be the charge a honorable member mr smith have do well to introduce those tragical story which have make such a impression upon the house no one of these have be yet controvert it have indeed be say that the cruelty of the african captain to the child be too bad to be true and we have be desire to look at the cross-examination of the witness as if we should find trace of the falsehood in he testimony there but he cross-examination be peculiarly honorable to he character for after he have be press in the closest manner by some able member of the house the only inconsistency they could fix upon he be whether the fact have happen on the same day of the same month of the year 1764 or the year 1765 but it be idle to talk of the incredibility of such instance it be not deny that absolute power be exercise by the slave-captain and if this be grant all the cruelty charge upon they would naturally follow never do he hear of charge so black and horrible as those contain in the evidence on the table they unfold such a scene of cruelty that if the house with all they present knowledge of the circumstance should dare to vote for its continuance they must have nerve of which he have no conception we might find instance indeed in history of man violate the feeling of nature on extraordinary occasion father have sacrifice they son and daughter and husband they wife but to imitate they character we ought to have not only nerve as strong as the two brutus but to take care that we have a cause as good or that we have motive for such a dereliction of we feeling as patriotic as those which historian have annex to these when they hand they to the notice of the world but what be we motive in the case before we -- to continue a trade which be a wholesale sacrifice of a whole order and race of we fellow-creature which carry they away by force from they native country in order to subject they to the mere will and caprice the tyranny and oppression of other human being for they whole natural life they and they posterity for ever o most monstrous wickedness o unparalleled barbarity and what be more aggravating this most complicated scene of robbery and murder which mankind have ever witness have be honor by the name of trade that a number of human being should be at all time ready to be furnish as fair article of commerce just as we occasion might require be absurd the argument of mr pitt on this head be unanswerable we demand be fluctuate : it entirely cease at some time : at other it be great and press how be it possible on every sudden call to furnish a sufficient return in slave without resort to those execrable means of obtain they which be state in the evidence these be of three sort and he would now examine they captive in war it be urge be consign either to death or slavery this however he believe to be false in point of fact but suppose it be true do it not become we with whom it be a custom found in the wisest policy to pay the captive a peculiar respect and civility to inculcate the same principle in africa but we be so far from do this that we encourage war for the sake of take not man 's goods and possession but man themselves and it be not the war which be the cause of the slave trade but the slave trade which be the cause of the war it be the practice of the slave-merchant to try to intoxicate the african king in order to turn they to they purpose a particular instance occur in the evidence of a prince who when sober resist they wish but in the moment of inebriety he give the word for war attack the next village and sell the inhabitant to the merchant the second mode be kidnapping he refer the house to various instance of this in the evidence : but there be one in particular from which we might immediately infer the frequency of the practice a black trader have kidnap a girl and sell she but he be presently afterwards kidnap and sell himself and when he ask the captain who buy he what do you buy I who be a great trader the only answer be yes i will buy you or she or anybody else provide any one will sell you and accordingly both the trader and the girl be carry to the west indy and sell for slave the third mode of obtain slave be by crime commit or imputed one of these be adultery but be africa the place where englishman above all other be to go to find out and punish adultery do it become we to cast the first stone it be a most extraordinary pilgrimage for a most extraordinary purpose and yet upon this plea we justify we right of carry off its inhabitant the offence allege next be witchcraft what a reproach it be to lend ourselves to this superstition -- yes : we stand by we hear the trial we know the crime to be impossible and that the accuse must be innocent : but we wait in patient silence for he condemnation and then we lend we friendly aid to the police of the country by buy the wretched convict with all he family whom for the benefit of africa we carry away also into perpetual slavery with respect to the situation of the slave in they transportation he know not how to give the house a more correct idea of the horror of it than by refer they to the print section of the slave-ship where the eye might see what the tongue must fall short in describe on this dismal part of the subject he would not dwell he would only observe that the act of barbarity related of the slave-captain in these voyage be so extravagant that they have be attribute in some instance to insanity but be not this the insanity of arbitrary power who ever read the fact record of nero without suspect he be mad who would not be apt to impute insanity to caligulum -- or domitian -- or caracallum -- or commodus -- or heliogabalus here be six roman emperor not connect in blood nor by descent who each of they possess arbitrary power have be so distinguish for cruelty that nothing short of insanity could be imputed to they be not the insanity of the master of slave-ship to be account for on the same principle of the slave in the west indy it have be say that they be take from a worse state to a better a honorable member mr w smith have quote some instance out of the evidence to the contrary he also would quote one or two other a slave under hard usage have run away to prevent a repetition of the offence he owner send for he surgeon and desire he to cut off the man 's leg the surgeon refuse the owner to render it a matter of duty in the surgeon break it now say he you must cut it off or the man will die we might console ourselves perhaps that this happen in a french island but he would select another instance which have happen in one of we own mr ross hear the shriek of a female issue from a out-house and so pierce that he determine to I what be go on on look in he perceive a young female tie up to a beam by she wrist entirely naked and in the act of involuntary writhe and swing while the author of she torture be stand below she with a light torch in he hand which he apply to all the part of she body as it approach he what crime this miserable woman have perpetrate he know not but the human mind could not conceive a crime warrant such a punishment he be glad to see that these tale affect the house would they then sanction enormity the bare recital of which make they shudder let they remember that humanity do not consist in a squeamish ear it do not consist in shrink and start at such tale as these but in a disposition of the heart to remedy the evil they unfold humanity belong rather to the mind than to the nerve but if so it should prompt man to charitable exertion such exertion be necessary in the present case it be necessary for the credit of we jurisprudence at home and we character abroad for what would any man think of we justice who should see another hang for a crime which would be innocence itself if compare with those enormity which be allow in africa and the west indy under the sanction of the british parliament it have be say however in justification of the trade that the african be less happy at home than in the island but what right have we to be judge of they condition they would tell we a very different tale if they be ask but it be ridiculous to say that we better they condition when we drag they from everything dear in life to the most abject state of slavery one argument have be use which for a subject so grave be the most ridiculous he have ever hear mr alderman watson have declare the slave trade to be necessary on account of its connexion with we fishery but what be this but a acknowledgment of the manner in which these miserable being be treat the trade be to be keep up with all its enormity in order that there might be person to consume the refuse fish from newfoundland which be too bad for anybody else to eat it have be say that england ought not to abolish the slave trade unless other nation would also give it up but what kind of morality be this the trade be defensible upon no other principle than that of a highwayman great britain could not keep it upon these term mere gain be not a motive for a great country to rest on as a justification of any measure honor be its superior and justice be superior to honor with regard to the emancipation of those in slavery he coincide with mr wilberforce and mr pitt and upon this principle that it might be as dangerous to give freedom at once to a man use to slavery as in the case of a man who have never see day-light to expose he all at once to the full glare of a meridian sun with respect to the intellect and sensibility of the african it be pride only which suggest a difference between they and ourselves there be a remarkable instance to the point in the evidence and which he would quote in one of the slave-ship be a person of consequence a man once high in a military station and with a mind not insensible to the eminence of he rank he have be take captive and sell and be then in the hold confine promiscuously with the rest happen in the night to fall asleep he dream that he be in he own country high in honor and command caress by he family and friend wait on by he domestic and surround with all he former comfort in life but awake suddenly and find where he be he be hear to burst into the loudest groan and lamentation on the miserable contrast of he present state mix with the meanest of he subject and subject to the insolence of wretch a thousand time lower than himself in every kind of endowment he appeal to the house whether this be not as move a picture of the miserable effect of the slave trade as could be well imagine there be one way by which they might judge of it let they make the case they own this be the christian rule of judge and have mention christianity he be sorry to find that any should suppose that it have give countenance to such a system of oppression so far be this from be the case that he think it one of the most splendid triumph of this religion that it have cause slavery to be so generally abolish on its appearance in the world it have do this by teach we among other beautiful precept that in the sight of they maker all mankind be equal its influence appear to have be more powerful in this respect than that of all the ancient system of philosophy though even in these in point of theory we might trace great liberality and consideration for human rights where could be find finer sentiment of liberty than in demosthene and cicero where bolder assertion of the rights of mankind than in tacitus and thucydide but alas these be the holder of slave : it be not so with those who have be convert to christianity he know however that what he have be ascribe to christianity have be imputed by other to the advance which philosophy have make each of the two party take the merit to itself the philosopher give it to philosophy and the divine to religion he should not then dispute with either of they but as both covet the praise why should they not emulate each other by promote this improvement in the condition of the human race he would now conclude by declare that the whole country indeed the whole civilized world must rejoice that such a bill as the present have be move for not merely as a matter of humanity but as a act of justice for he would put humanity out of the case could it be call humanity to forbear commit murder exactly upon this ground do the motion stand be strictly a question of national justice he thank mr wilberforce for have pledge himself so strongly to pursue he object till it be accomplish and as for himself he declare that in whatever situation he might ever be he would use he warmest effort for the promotion of this righteous cause mr stanley -lrb- the member for lancashire -rrb- rise and declare that when he come into the house he intend to vote against the abolition but that the impression make both on he feeling and on he understanding be such that he could not persist in he resolution he be now convince that the entire abolition of the slave trade be call for equally by sound policy and justice he think it right and fair to avow manfully this change in he opinion the abolition ho be sure could not long fail of be carry the argument for it be irresistible the honorable mr ryder say that he come to the house not exactly in the same circumstance as mr stanley but very undecided on the subject he be however so strongly convince by the argument he have hear that he be become equally earnest for the abolition mr smith -lrb- member for pontefract -rrb- say that he should not trouble the house at so late a hour further than to enter he protest in the most solemn manner against this trade which he consider as most disgraceful to the country and contrary to all the principle of justice and religion mr sumner declare himself against the total immediate and unqualified abolition which he think would wind at least the prejudice of the west indian and might do mischief but a gradual abolition should have he hearty support major scott declare there be no member in the house who would give a more independent vote upon this question than himself he have no concern either in the african or west indian trade but in the present state of the finances of the country he think it would be a dangerous experiment to risk any one branch of we foreign commerce as far as regulation would go he would join in the measure mr burke say he would use but few word he declare that he have for a long time have he mind draw towards this great subject he have even prepare a bill for the regulation of the trade conceive at that time that the immediate abolition of it be a thing hardly to be hope for but when he find that mr wilberforce have seriously undertake the work and that he motion be for the abolition which he approve much more than he own he have burn he papers and make a offering of they in honor of this nobler proposition much in the same manner as we read that the curious book be offer up and burn at the approach of the gospel he highly applaud the confession of mr stanley and mr ryder it would be a glorious tale for they to tell they constituent that it be impossible for they however prejudice if send to hear discussion in that house to avoid surrender up they heart and judgment at the shrine of reason mr drake say that he would oppose the abolition to the utmost we have by a want of prudent conduct lose america the house should be aware of be carry away by the meteor with which they have be dazzle the leader it be true be for the abolition but the minor orator the dwarf the pigmy he trust would that night carry the question against they the property of the west indian be at stake and though man might be generous with they own property they should not be so with the property of other lord sheffield reprobate the overbearing language which have be use by some gentleman towards other who differ in opinion from they on a subject of so much difficulty as the present he protest against a debate in which he could trace nothing like reason but on the contrary downright phrensy raise perhaps by the most extraordinary eloquence the abolition as propose be impracticable he deny the right of the legislature to pass a law for it he warn the chancellor of the exchequer to beware of the day on which the bill should pass as the worst he have ever see mr milne declare that he adopt all those expression against the slave trade which have be think so harsh and that the opinion of the noble lord have be turn in consequence of have become one of the member for bristol he quote a passage from lord sheffield 's pamphlet and insist that the separation of family in the west indy there complain of by himself ought to have compel he to take the contrary side of the question mr wilberforce make a short reply to some argument in the course of the debate after which at half-past three in the morning the house divide there appear for mr wilberforce 's motion eighty-eight and against it one hundred and sixty-three so that it be lose by a majority of seventy-five vote by this unfavourable division the great contest in which we have be so long engage be decide we be oblige to give way to superior number we fall however grievous as it be be render more tolerable by the circumstance of have be prepare to expect it it be render more tolerable also by other consideration for we have the pleasure of know that we have several of the most distinguished character in the kingdom and almost all the splendid talent of the house of common -lrb- a -rrb- in we favor we know too that the question have not be carry against we either by evidence or by argument but that we be the victim of the accident and circumstance of the time and as these consideration comfort we when we look forward to future operation on this great question so we find great consolation as to the past in believe that unless human constitution be stronger than they really be we could not have do more than we have do towards the furtherance of the cause -lrb- footnote a : it be a pity that no perfect list be ever make of this or of any other division in the house of common on this subject i can give however the name of the follow member as have vote for mr wilberforce 's motion at this time mr pitt lord bayham mr duncombe mr fox lord arden mr martin mr burke lord carysfort mr milne mr gray lord muncaster mr steele mr windham lord barnard mr coke mr sheridan lord north mr eliott mr whitbread lord euston mr

for the abolition hold a meeting soon after this we defeat it be the most impressive i ever attend the look of all bespeak the feeling of they heart little be say previously to the opening of the business and after it be open it be conduct with a kind of solemn dignity which become the occasion the committee in the course of its deliberation come to the follow resolution : -- that the thanks of this committee be respectfully give to the illustrious minority of the house of common who lately stand forth the assertor of british justice and humanity and the enemy of a traffic in the blood of man that we acknowledgment be particularly due to william wilberforce esq for he unwearied exertion to remove this opprobrium of we national character and to the right honorable william pitt and the right honorable charle jame fox for they virtuous and dignified co-operation in the same cause that the solemn declaration of these gentleman and of matthew montagu and william smith esqr that they will not relinquish but with life they struggle for the abolition of the slave trade be not only highly honorable to themselves as briton as statesman and as christian but must eventually as the light of evidence shall be more and more diffused be second by the good wish of every man not immediately interested in the continuance of that detestable commerce and lastly that anticipate the opposition they should have to sustain from person train to a familiarity with the rapine and desolation necessarily attendant on the slave trade and sensible also of the prejudice which implicitly arise from long-established usage this committee consider the late decision in the house of common as a delay rather than a defeat in address a free and enlighten nation on a subject in which its justice its humanity and its wisdom be involve they can not despair of final success and they do hereby under a increase conviction of the excellence of they cause and in conformity to the distinguished example before they renew they firm protestation that they will never desist from appeal to they countryman till the commercial intercourse with africa shall cease to be polluted with the blood of its inhabitant these resolution be publish and they be follow by a suitable report the committee in order to strengthen themselves for the prosecution of they great work elect sir william dolben bart henry thornton lewi alexander grant and matthew montagu esqr who be member of parliament and truman harford josiah wedgewood jun esq and john clarkson esq of the royal navy as member of they own body and they elect the rev archdeacon plymley -lrb- afterwards corbett -rrb- a honorary and corresponding member in consequence of the great service which he have render they cause in the shire of hereford and salop and the adjacent county of wale the several committee establish in the country on receive the resolution and report as before mention testify they sympathy in letter of condolence to that of london on the late melancholy occasion and express they determination to support it as long as any vestige of this barbarous traffic should remain at length the session end and though in the course of it the afflicting loss of the general question have occur there be yet a attempt make by the abolitionist in parliament which meet with a better fate the sierra leone company receive the sanction of the legislature the object of this institution be to colonize a small portion of the coast of africa they who be to settle there be to have no concern in the slave trade but to discourage it as much as possible they be to endeavor to establish a new species of commerce and to promote cultivation in its neighborhood by free labor the person more generally fix upon for colonist be such negro with they wife and family as choose to abandon they habitation in nova scotium these have follow the british arm in america and have be settle there as a reward for they service by the british government my brother just mention to have be choose a member of the committee and who have essentially serve the great cause of the abolition on many occasion undertake a visit to nova scotium to see if those in question be willing to undergo the change and in that case to provide transport and conduct they to sierra leone this object he accomplish he embark more than eleven hundred person in fifteen vessel of all which he take the command on land they he become the first governor of the new colony have lay the foundation of it he return to england when a successor be appoint from that time many unexpected circumstance but particularly devastation by the french in the beginning of the war take place which contribute to ruin the trading company which be attach to it it be please however to reflect that though the object of the institution as far as mercantile profit be concerned thus fail the other object belong to it be promote school place of worship agriculture and the habit of civilized life be establish sierra leone therefore now present itself as the medium of civilization for africa and in this latter point of view it be worth all the treasure which have be lose in support it for the slave trade which be the great obstacle to this civilization be now happily abolish there be a metropolis consist of some hundred of person from which may issue the seed of reformation to this injured continent and which when sow may be expect to grow into fruit without interruption new school may be transplant from thence into the interior teacher and traveller on discovery may be send from thence in various direction who may return to it occasionally as to they home the native too able now to travel in safety may resort to it from various part they may see the improvement which be go on from time to time they may send they child to it for education and thus it may become the medium -lrb- a -rrb- of a great intercourse between england and africa to the benefit of each other -lrb- footnote a : to promote this desirable end a association take place last year call the african institution under the patronage of the duke of gloucester as president and of the mend to the african cause particularly of such as be in parliament and as belong to the committee for the abolition of the slave trade -rrb- chapter xxvii -- continuation from July 1791 to July 1792 -- author travel round the kingdom again object of he journey -- people begin to leave off the use of sugar to form committee and to send petition to parliament -- motion make in the house of common for the immediate abolition of the trade debate upon it abolition resolve upon but not to commence till 1796 -- resolution take to the lord latter determine upon hearing evidence evidence at length introduce further hearing of it postpone to the next session the defeat which we have just sustain be a matter of great triumph to we opponent when they consider the majority in the house of common in they favor they view the resolution of the committee which have be detail as the last spiteful effort of a vanquish and die animal and they suppose that they have consign the question to eternal sleep the committee however be too deeply attach to the cause vanquish as they be to desert it and they know also too well the barometer of public feeling and the occasion of its fluctuation to despair in the year 1787 the member of the house of common as well as the people be enthusiastic in behalf of the abolition of the trade in the year 1788 the fair enthusiasm of the former begin to fade in 1789 it die in 1790 prejudice start up as a noxious weed in its place in 1791 this prejudice arrive at its growth but to what be these change owe to delay during which the mind have be gradually lead to the question as a commercial have be gradually take from it as a moral object but it be possible to restore the mind to its proper place add to which that the nation have never desert the cause during this whole period it be much to the honor of the english people that they should have continue to feel for the existence of a evil which be so far remove from they sight but at this moment they feeling begin to be insupportable many of they resolve as soon as parliament have reject the bill to abstain from the use of west indian produce in this state of thing a pamphlet write by william bell crafton of tewksbury and call _ a sketch of the evidence with a recommendation on the subject to the serious attention of people in general _ make its appearance and another follow it write by william fox of london _ on the propriety of abstain from west indium sugar and rum _ these pamphlet take the same ground they inculcate abstinence from these article as a moral duty they inculcate it as a peaceable and constitutional measure and they lay before the reader a truth which be sufficiently obvious that if each would abstain the people would have a complete remedy for this enormous evil in they own power while these thing be go on it devolve upon I to arrange all the evidence on the part of the abolition under proper head and to abridge it into one volume it be intend that a copy of this should be send into different town of the kingdom that all might know if possible the horror -lrb- as far as the evidence contain they -rrb- of this execrable trade and as it be possible that these copy might lie in the place where they be send without a due attention to they contents i resolve with the approbation of the committee to take a journey and for no other purpose than personally to recommend that they might be read the book have be print be despatch before I of this tour i shall give the reader no other account than that of the progress of the remedy which the people be then take into they own hand and first i may observe that there be no town through which i pass in which there be not some one individual who have leave off the use of sugar in the smaller town there be from ten to fifty by estimation and in the larger from two to five hundred who make this sacrifice to virtue these be of all rank and party rich and poor churchman and dissenter have adopt the measure even grocer have leave off trading in the article in some place in gentleman 's family where the master have set the example the servant have often voluntarily follow it and even child who be capable of understand the history of the suffering of the african exclude with the most virtuous resolution the sweet to which they have be accustom from they lip by the best computation i be able to make from note take down in my journey no fewer than three hundred thousand person have abandon the use of sugar have travel over wale and two-third of england i find it would be impossible to visit scotland on the same errand i have already by move upward and downward in parallel line and by intersect these in the same manner pass over six thousand mile by the best calculation i could make i have yet two thousand to perform by means of almost incessant journeying night and day i have suffer much in my health my strength be fail daily i write therefore to the committee on this subject and they communicate immediately with dr dickson who on be apply to visit scotland in my stead he consult first with the committee at edinburgh relative to the circulation of the abridgment of the evidence he then pursue he journey and in conjunction with the unwearied effort of mr campbel haliburton render essential service to the cause for this part of the kingdom on my return to london i find that the committee have take into they own body tf forster bm forster and jame west esqr as member and that they have elect hercule boss esq a honorary and corresponding member in consequence of the handsome manner in which he have come forward as a evidence and of the peculiar benefit which have result from he testimony to the cause the effect of the two journey by dr dickson and myself be soon visible the people could not bear the fact which have be disclose to they by the abridgment of the evidence they be not satisfied many of they with the mere abstinence from sugar but begin to form committee to correspond with that of london the first of these appear at newcastle-upon-tyne so early as the month of October it consist of the rev william turner as chairman and of robert ormston william batson henry taylor ralph bambridge george brown hadwen bragg david sutton anthony clapham george richardson and edward prowit it receive a valuable addition afterwards by the admission of many other the second be establish at nottingham the rev jeremiah bigsby become the president and the rev g walker and j smith and messr dennison evan watson hart storer bott hawkesley pennington wright frith hall and wakefield the committee the third be form at glasgow under the patronage of david dale scott montcrieff robert graham professor millar and other other committee start up in they turn at length public meeting begin to take place and after this petition to be send to parliament and these so generally that there be not a day for three month sunday except in which five or six be not resolve upon in some place or other in the kingdom of the enthusiasm of the nation at this time none can form a opinion but they who witness it there never be perhaps a season when so much virtuous feeling pervade all rank great pain be take by interested person in many place to prevent public meeting but no effort could avail the current run with such strength and rapidity that it be impossible to stem it in the city of london a remarkable instance occur the livery have be long wait for the common council to begin a petition but the lord mayor and several of the alderman stifle it the former indignant at this conduct insist upon a common hall a day be appoint and though the notice give of it be short the assemblage be greater than have ever be remember on any former occasion scarcely a liveryman be absent unless sick or previously engage the petition when introduce be oppose by those who have prevent it in the common council but they voice be drown amidst groan and hissing it be shortly after carry and it have not be sign more than half a hour before it be within the wall of the house of common the reason of this extraordinary despatch be that it have be keep back by intrigue so late that the very hour in which it be deliver to the house be that in which mr wilberforce be to make he new motion and as no petition be ever more respectable than those present on this occasion as far as they breathe the voice of the people and as far as they be found on a knowledge of the object which they solicit so none be ever more numerous as far as we have any record of such transaction not fewer than three hundred and ten be present from england one hundred and eighty-seven from scotland and twenty from wale two other petition also for the abolition come from england but they be too late for delivery on the other side of the question one be present from the town of read for regulation in opposition to that for abolition from the same place there be also four against abolition the first of these be from certain person at derby in opposition to the other from that town the second be from stephen fuller esq as agent for jamaica the third from j dawson esq a slave-merchant at liverpool and the fourth from the merchant planter mortgagee annuitant and other concern in the west indian colony take in all these statement the account stand thus : -- for regulation there be one against all abolition there be four and for the total abolition of the trade five hundred and nineteen on the 2nd of April mr wilberforce move the order of the day which have be agree to sir william dolben be put into the chair he then begin by solicit the candid attention of the west indian to what he be go to deliver to the house however other might have censure they indiscriminately he have always himself make a distinction between they and they system it be the latter only which he reprobate if aristocracy have be think a worse form of government than monarchy because the people have many tyrant instead of one how objectionable must be that form of it which exist in we colony arbitrary power could be buy there by any one who could buy a slave the fierceness of it be doubtless restrain by a elevation of mind in many as arise from a consciousness of superior rank and consequence : but alas it be too often exercise there by the base and vulgar the more liberal too of the planter be not resident upon they estate hence a promiscuous censure of they would be unjust though they system would undoubtedly be odious as for the cure of this monstrous evil he have show last year that internal regulation would not produce it these could have no effect while the evidence of slave be inadmissible what would be the situation of the bulk of the people of this country if only gentleman of five hundred a-year be admit as evidence in we court of law neither be the cure of it in the emancipation of the slave he do not deny that he wish they this latter blessing but alas in they present degraded state they be unfit for it liberty be the child of reason and order it be indeed a plant of celestial growth but the soil must be prepare for its reception he who would see it flourish and bring forth its proper fruit must not think it sufficient to let it shoot in unrestrained licentiousness but if this inestimable blessing be ever to be impart to they the cause must be remove which obstruct its introduction in short no effectual remedy could be find but in the abolition of the slave trade he then take a copious view of the advantage which would arise both to the master and to the slave if this traffic be do away and have recapitulate and answer the different objection to such a measure he go to that part of the subject in which he describe himself to be most interested he have show he say last year that africa be expose to all the horror of war and that most of these war have they origin in the slave trade it be then say in reply that the natural barbarity of the native be alone sufficient to render they country a scene of carnage this be triumphantly instance in the king of dahomey but he honorable friend lord muncaster then in the house have prove in he interesting publication which have appear since call _ historical sketch of the slave trade and of its effect in africa _ address to the people of great britain that the very cruelty of this king on which so much stress have be lay be commit by he in a war which have be undertake expressly to punish a adjacent people for have steal some of he subject and sell they for slave he have show also last year that king be induce to seize and sell they subject and individual each other in consequence of the existence of the slave trade he have show also that the administration of justice be pervert so as to become a fertile source of supply to this inhuman traffic that every crime be punish by slavery that false accusation be make to procure convict and that even the judge have a profit on the conviction he have show again that many act of violence be perpetrate by the european themselves but he would now relate other which have happen since the captain of a english vessel lie in the river cameroon send he boat with three sailor and a slave to get water a black trader seize the latter and take he away he allege in he defense that the captain owe he goods to a greater amount than the value of the slave and that he would not pay he this be tell on board the captain and a part of he crew who be compel to blacken they naked body that they might appear like the native go on shore at midnight arm with musket and cutlass they fire on the trader 's dwelling and kill three of he child on the spot the trader be badly wound die while they be drag he to the boat and he wife be wound also die in half a hour after she be on board the ship resistance have be make to these violent proceedings some of the sailor be wound and one be kill some week after this affray a chieftain of the name of quarmo go on board the same vessel to borrow some cutlass and musket he be go he say into the country to make war and the captain should have half of he booty so well understand be the practice of the trade that he request be grant quarmo however and he associate find thing favourable to they design suddenly seize the captain throw he overboard haul he into they canoe and drag he to the shore where another party of the native lie in ambush seize such of the crew as be absent from the ship but how do these savage behave when they have these different person in they power do they not instantly retaliate by murder they all no -- they only oblige the captain to give a order on the vessel to pay he debt this fact come out only two : month ago in a trial in the court of common plea -- not in trial for piracy and murder but in the trial of a civil suit institute by some of the poor sailor to whom the owner refuse they wages because the native on account of the villainous conduct of they captain have keep they from they vessel by detain they as prisoner on shore this instance he say prove the dreadful nature of the slave trade its cruelty its perfidy and its effect on the african as well as on the european who carry it on the cool manner in which the transaction be conduct on both side show that these practice be not novel it show also the manner of do business in the trade it must be remember too that these transaction be carry on at the very time when the inquiry concern this trade be go forward in parliament and whilst the witness of he opponent be strenuously deny not only the actual but the possible existence of any such depredation but another instance happen only in August last six british ship the thoma captain philip the wasp captain hutchinson the recovery captain kimber of bristol the martha captain houston the betsey captain doyle and the amachree -lrb- he believe -rrb- captain lee of liverpool be anchor off the town of calabar this place be the scene of a dreadful massacre about twenty year before the captain of these vessel think that the native ask too much for they slave hold a consultation how they should proceed and agree to fire upon the town unless they own term be comply with on a certain evening they notify they determination to the trader and tell they that if they continue obstinate they would put it into execution the next morning in this they keep they word they bring sixty-six gun to bear upon the town and fire on it for three hour not a shot be return a canoe then go to offer term of accommodation the party however not agree the firing recommence more damage be do and the native be force into submission there be no certain account of they loss report say that fifty be kill but some be see lie badly wound and other in the agony of death by those who go afterwards on shore he would now say a few word relative to the middle passage principally to show that regulation could not effect a cure of the evil there mr isaac wilson have state in he evidence that the ship in which he sail only three year ago be of three hundred and seventy ton and that she carry six hundred and two slave of these she lose one hundred and fifty-five there be three or four other vessel in company with she and which belong to the same owner one of these carry four hundred and fifty and bury two hundred another carry four hundred and sixty-six and bury seventy-three another five hundred and forty-six and burl one hundred and fifty-eight and from the four together after the landing of they cargo two hundred and twenty die he fall in with another vessel which have lose three hundred and sixty-two but the number which have be buy be not specify now if to these actual death during and immediately after the voyage we be to add the subsequent loss in the seasoning and to consider that this would be greater than ordinary in cargo which be land in such a sickly state we should find a mortality which if it be only general for a few month would entirely depopulate the globe but he would advert to what mr wilson say when examine as a surgeon as to the cause of these loss and particularly on board he own ship where he have the means of ascertain they the substance of he reply be this -- that most of the slave labor under a fix melancholy which now and then break out into lamentation and plaintive song expressive of the loss of they relation friend and country so powerfully do this sorrow operate that many of they attempt in various way to destroy themselves and three actually effect it other obstinately refuse to take sustenance and when the whip and other violent means be use to compel they to eat they look up in the face of the officer who unwillingly execute this painful task and say with a smile in they own language presently we shall be no more this they unhappy state of mind produce a general languor and debility which be increase in many instance by a unconquerable aversion to food arise partly from sickness and partly to use the language of the slave-captain from sulkiness these cause naturally produce the flux the contagion spread several be carry off daily and the disorder aid by so many powerful auxiliary resist the power of medicine and it be worth while to remark that these grievous suffering be not owe either to want of care on the part of the owner or to any negligence or harshness of the captain for mr wilson declare that he ship be as well fit out and the crew and slave as well treat as anybody could reasonably expect he would now go to another ship that in which mr claxton sail as a surgeon afford a repetition of all the horrid circumstance which have be describe suicide be attempt and effect and the same barbarous expedient be adopt to compel the slave to continue a existence which they consider as too painful to be endure the mortality also be as great and yet here again the captain be in no wise to blame but this vessel have sail since the regulate act nay even in the last year the death on shipboard would be find to have be between ten and eleven per cent on the whole number export in truth the house could not reach the cause of this mortality by all they regulation until they could cure a broken heart -- until they could legislate for the affection and bind by they statute the passion and feeling of the mind they labor would be in vain such be the evil of the passage but evil be conspicuous everywhere in this trade never be there indeed a system so replete with wickedness and cruelty to whatever part of it we turn we eye whether to africa the middle passage or the west indy we could find no comfort no satisfaction no relief it be the gracious ordinance of providence both in the natural and moral world that good should often arise out of evil hurricane clear the air and the propagation of truth be promote by persecution pride vanity and profusion contribute often in they remoter consequence to the happiness of mankind in common what be in itself evil and vicious be permit to carry along with it some circumstance of palliation the arab be hospitable the robber brave we do not necessarily find cruelty associate with fraud or meanness with injustice but here the case be far otherwise it be the prerogative of this detest traffic to separate from evil its concomitant good and to reconcile discordant mischief it rob war of its generosity it deprive peace of its security : we see in it the vice of polished society without its knowledge or its comfort and the evil of barbarism without its simplicity no age no sex no rank no condition be exempt from the fatal influence of this wide-wasting calamity thus it attain to the fullest measure of pure unmixed unsophisticated wickedness and scorn all competition and comparison it stand without a rival in the secure undisputed possession of its detestable preeminence but after all this wonderful to relate this execrable traffic have be defend on the ground of benevolence it have be say that the slave be captive and convict who if we be not to carry they away would be sacrifice and many of they at the funeral of people of rank accord to the savage custom of africa he have show however that we supplies of slave be obtain from other quarter than these but he would wave this consideration for the present have it not be acknowledge by he opponent that the custom of ransom slave prevail in africa with respect to human sacrifice he do not deny that there might have be some instance of these but they have not be prove to be more frequent than amongst other barbarous nation and where they exist be act of religion they would not be dispense with for the sake of commercial gain in fact they have nothing to do with the slave trade only perhaps if it be abolish they might by means of the civilization which would follow be do away but exclusively of these sacrifice it have be assert that it be kindness to the inhabitant to take they away from they own country but what say the historian of africa long before the question of the abolition be start axim say bosman be cultivate and abound with numerous large and beautiful village : its inhabitant be industriously employ in trade fishing or agriculture -- the inhabitant of adom always expose large quantity of corn to sale besides what they want for they own use -- the people of acron husband they grounds and time so well that every year produce a plentiful harvest speaking of the fetu country he say -- frequently when walk through it i have see it abound with fine well-built and populous town agreeably enrich with vast quantity of corn and cattle palm-wine and oil the inhabitant all apply themselves without distinction to agriculture some sow corn other press oil and draw wine from the palm-trees smith who be send out by the royal african company in 1726 assure we that the discerning native account it they greatest unhappiness that they be ever visit by the european they say that we christian introduce the traffic of slave and that before we come they live in peace but say they it be observable wherever christianity come there come sword and gun and powder and ball with it the european say bruce be far from desire to act as peace-maker among they it would be too contrary to they interest for the only object of they war be to carry off slave and as these form the principal part of they traffic they would be apprehensive of dry up the source of it be they to encourage the people to live well together the neighborhood of the damel and tin keep they perpetually at war the benefit of which accrue to the company who buy all the prisoner make on either side and the more there be to sell the greater be they profit for the only end of they armament be to make captive to sell they to the white trader artus of dantzic say that in he time those liable to pay fine be banish till the fine be pay when they return to they house and possession bosman affirm that formerly all crime in africa be compensate by fine or restitution and where restitution be impracticable by corporal punishment moore say since this trade have be use all punishment have be change into slavery there be a advantage in such condemnation they strain the crime very hard in order to get the benefit of sell the criminal not only murder theft and adultery be punish by sell the criminal for a slave but every trifling crime be punish in the same manner loyer affirm that the king of sain on the least pretence sell he subject for european goods he be so tyrannically severe that he make a whole village responsible for the fault of one inhabitant and on the least offence sell they all for slave such he say be the testimony not of person whom he have summon not of friend of the abolition but of man who be themselves many of they engage in the slave trade other testimony might be add but these be sufficient to refute the assertion of he opponent and to show the kind service we have do to africa by the introduction of this trade he would just touch upon the argument so often repeat that other nation would carry on the slave trade if we abandon it but how do we know this have not denmark give a noble example to the contrary she have consent to abolish the trade in ten year and have she not do this even though we after a investigation for nearly five year have ourselves hang back but what might not be expect if we be to take up the cause in earnest if we be to proclaim to all nation the injustice of the trade and to solicit they concurrence in the abolition of it he hope the representative of the nation would not be less just than the people the latter have step forward and express they sense more generally by petition than in any instance in which they have ever before interfere to see this great cause thus triumph over distinction and prejudice be a noble spectacle whatever might be say of we political division such a sight have teach we that there be subject still beyond the reach of party that there be a point of elevation where we ascend above the jarring of the discordant element which ruffle and agitate the vale below in we ordinary atmosphere cloud and vapor obscure the air and we be the sport of a thousand conflict wind and adverse current but here we move in a higher region where all be pure and clear and free from perturbation and discomposure : as some tall cliff that lift its awful form swell from the vale and midway leave the storm though round its breast the roll cloud be spread eternal sunshine settle on its head here then on this August eminence he hope we should build the temple of benevolence that we should lay its foundation deep in truth and justice and that we should inscribe upon its gate peace and good will to man here we should offer the first-fruit of we benevolence and endeavor to compensate if possible for the injury we have bring upon we fellow-men he would only now observe that he conviction of the indispensable necessity of immediately abolish this trade remain as strong as ever let those who talk of allow three or four year to the continuance of it reflect on the disgraceful scene which have pass last year as for himself he would wash he hand of the blood which would be spill in this horrid interval he could not however but believe that the hour be come when we should put a final period to the existence of this cruel traffic should he unhappily be mistake he would never desert the cause but to the last moment of he life he would exert he utmost power in its support he would now move that it be the opinion of this committee that the trade carry on by british subject for the purpose of obtain slave on the coast of africa ought to be abolish mr baillie be in hope that the friend of the abolition would have be contented with the innocent blood which have be already shed the great island of st domingo have be tear to piece by insurrection the most dreadful barbarity have be perpetrate there in the year 1789 the import into it exceed five million sterling the export from it in the same year amount to six million and the trade employ three hundred thousand ton of shipping and thirty thousand seaman this fine island thus advantageously situate have be lose in consequence of the agitation of the question of the slave trade surely so much mischief ought to have satisfy those who support it but they require the total destruction of all the west indian colony belong to great britain to complete the ruin the honorable gentleman who have just speak have dwell upon the enormity of the slave trade he be far from deny that many act of inhumanity might accompany it but as human nature be much the same everywhere it would be unreasonable to expect among african trader or the inhabitant of we island a degree of perfection in moral which be not to be find in great britain itself would any man estimate the character of the english nation by what be to be read in the record of the old bailey he himself however have live sixteen year in the west indy and he could bear testimony to the general good usage of the slave before the agitation of this impolitic question the slave be contented with they situation there be a mutual confidence between they and they master : and this continue to be the case till the new doctrine be broach but now depot of arm be necessary on every estate and the scene be totally reverse nor be they religious then inferior to they civil state when the english take possession of grenada where he property lay they find they baptize and instruct in the principle of the roman catholic faith the priest of that persuasion have indeed be indefatigable in they vocation so that import african generally obtain within twelve month a tolerable idea of they religious duty he have see the slave there go through the public mass in a manner and with a fervency which would have do credit to more civilized society but the case be now alter for except where the moravian have be there be no trace in we island of a attention to they religious interest it have be say that they punishment be severe there might be instance of cruelty but these be not general many of they be undoubtedly ill disposed though not more accord to they number on a plantation than in a regiment or in a ship 's crew have we never hear of seaman be flog from ship to ship or of soldier die in the very act of punishment have we not also hear even in this country of boast liberty of seaman be seize and carry away when return from distant voyage after a absence of many year and this without even be allow to see they wife and family as to distressed object he maintain that there be more wretchedness and poverty in st gile 's than in all the west indian island belong to great britain he would now speak of the african and west indian trade the import and export of these amount to upward of ten million annually and they give employment to three hundred thousand ton of shipping and to about twenty-five thousand seaman these trade have be sanction by we ancestor in parliament the act for this purpose might be class under three head first they be such as declare the colony and the trade thereof advantageous to great britain and therefore entitle to she protection secondly such as authorize protected and encourage the trade to africa as advantageous in itself and necessary to the welfare and existence of the sugar colony : and thirdly such as promote and secure loan of money to the proprietor of the say colony either from british subject or from foreigner these act -lrb- a -rrb- he apprehend ought to satisfy every person of the legality and usefulness of these trade they be enact in reign distinguish for the production of great and enlighten character we hear then of no wild and destructive doctrine like the present these be reserve for this age of novelty and innovation but he must remind the house that the inhabitant of we island have as good a right to the protection of they property as the inhabitant of great britain nor could it be diminish in any shape without full compensation the proprietor of land in the cede island which be purchase of government under specific condition of settlement ought to be indemnify they also -lrb- of whom he be one -rrb- who have purchase the territory grant by the crown to general monkton in the island of st vincent ought to be indemnify also the sale of this have go on briskly till it be know that a plan be in agitation for the abolition of the slave trade since that period the original purchaser have do little or nothing and they have many hundred acre on hand which would be of no value if the present question be carry in fact they have a right to compensation the planter generally spend they estate in this country they generally educate they child in it they have never be find seditious or rebellious and they demand of the parliament of great britain that protection which upon the principle of good faith it be in duty bind to afford they in common with the rest of he majesty 's loyal subject -lrb- footnote a : here he quote they specifically -rrb- mr vaughan state that be a west indian by birth and connect with the island he could speak from he own knowledge in the early part of he life he be strongly in favor of the abolition of the slave trade he have be educate by dr priestley and the father of mr barbauld who be both of they friend to that question they sentiment he have imbibe but although breed at the foot of gamaliel he resolve to judge for himself and he leave england for jamaica he find the situation of the slave much better than he have imagine set aside liberty they be as well off as the poor in europe they have little want of clothes or fuel they have a house and garden find they be never imprison for debt nor deter from marry through fear of be unable to support a family they orphan and widow be take care of as they themselves be when old and disabled they have medical attendance without expense they have private property which no master ever take from they and they be resign to they situation and look for nothing beyond it perhaps person might have be prejudice by live in the town to which slave be often send for punishment and where there be many small proprietor or by see no negro otherwise than as belong to the labor poor but they appear to he to want nothing but liberty and it be only occasionally that they be abused there be two prejudice with respect to the colony which he would notice the first be that cruel usage occasion the inequality of birth and death among the slave but do cruelty cause the excess of death above birth in the city of london no -- this excess have other cause so it have among the slave of these more male be import than female : they be dissolute too in they moral they have also disease peculiar to themselves but in those island where they nearly keep up they number there be this difficulty that the equality be preserve by the increase on one estate compensate for the decrease on another these estate however would not interchange they number whereas where freedom prevail the free labourer circulate from one employer to another and appear wherever they be want the second be that all chastisement of the slave be cruelty but this be not true they owner generally withdraw they from public justice so that they who would have be publicly execute elsewhere be often keep alive by they master and be find punish again and again for repeat they fault distributive justice occasion many punishment as one slave be to be protect against every other slave : and when one pilfer from another then the master interfere these punishment be to be distinguish from such as arise from enforce labor or from the cruelty of they owner indeed he have go over the island and he have see but little ill usage he have see none on the estate where he reside the whip the stock and confinement be all the mode of punishment he have observe in other place some slave belong to he father be peculiarly well off they save money and spend it in they own way but notwithstanding all he have say he allow that there be room for improvement and particularly for instil into the slave the principle of religion where this should be realize there would be less punishment more work more marriage more issue and more attachment to master other improvement would be the establishment of medical society the introduction of task-work and grant of premium and honorary distinction both to father and mother accord to the number of child which they should rear besides this negro evidence should be allow in the court of law it be leave to the discretion of the court or jury to take or reject it accord to the nature of the case cruel master also should be keep in order in various way they should he liable to have they slave take from they and put in trust every instrument of punishment should be banish except the whip the number of lash should be limit and the punishment should not be repeat till after interval these and other improvement should be immediately adopt by the planter the character of the exemplary among they be hurt by be confound with that of lower and baser man he conclude by state that the owner of slave be entitle to compensation if by means of the abolition they should not be able to find labourer for the cultivation of they land -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : mr vaughan declare in a future stage of the debate that he wish to see a prudent termination both of the slave trade and of slavery and that though he be the eldest son of he father he never would on any consideration become the owner of a slave -rrb- mr henry thornton conceive that the two last speaker have not speak to the point the first have describe the happy state of the slave in the west indy the latter have make similar representation but yet have allow that much improvement might be make in they condition but this have nothing to do with the question then before they the manner of procure slave in africa be the great evil to be remedy africa be to be strip of its inhabitant to supply a population for the west indy there be a dutch proverb which say my son get money honestly if you can -- but get money : or in other word get slave honestly if you can -- but get slave this be the real grievance and the two honorable gentleman by confine they observation to the west indy have entirely overlook it though this evil have be fully prove he could not avoid state to the house some new fact which have come to he knowledge as a director of the sierra leone company and which would still further establish it the consideration that they have take place since the discussion of the last year on this subject obliged he to relate they mr falconbridge agent to the company sit one evening in sierra leone hear a shout and immediately afterwards the report of a gun fear a attack he arm forty of the settler and rush with they to the place from whence the noise come he find a poor wretch who have be cross from a neighbouring village in the possession of a party of kidnapper who be tie he hand mr falconbridge however dare not rescue he lest in the defenceless state of he own town retaliation might be make upon he at another time a young woman live half a mile off be sell without any criminal charge to one of the slave-ship she be well acquaint with the agent 's wife and have be with she only the day before she cry be hear but it be impossible to relieve she at another time a young lad one of the free settler who go from england be catch by a neighbouring chief as he be straggle alone from home and sell for a slave the pretext be that some one in the town of sierra leone have commit a offence hence the first person belong to it who could be seize be to be punish happily the free settler see he in he chain and they recover he before he be convey to the ship to mark still more forcibly the scene of misery to which the slave trade give birth he would mention a case state to he in a letter by king naimbanna it have happen to respectable person in no less than three instance to have some branch of he family kidnap and carry off to the west indy at one time three young man corpro banna and marbror be decoy on board a danish slave-ship under pretence of buy something and be take away at another time another relation pilot a vessel down the river he beg to be put on shore when he come opposite to he own town but he be press to pilot she to the river 's mouth the captain then plead the impracticability of put he on shore carry he to jamaica and sell he for a slave fortunately however by means of a letter which be convey there the man by the assistance of the governor be send back to sierra leone at another time another relation be also kidnap but he have not the good fortune like the former to return he would mention one other instance a son have sell he own father for whom he obtain a considerable price : for as the father be rich in domestic slave it be not doubt that he would offer largely for he ransom the old man accordingly give twenty-two of these in exchange for himself the rest however be from that time fill with apprehension of be on some ground or other sell to the slave-ship flee to the mountain of sierra leone where they now drag on a miserable existence the son himself be sell in he turn soon after in short the whole of that unhappy peninsula as he learn from eye-witness have be desolate by the trade in slave town be see standing without inhabitant all over the coast in several of which the agent of the company have be there be nothing but distrust among the inhabitant every one if he stir from home feel himself oblige to be arm such be the nature of the slave trade it have unfortunately obtain the name of a trade and many have be deceive by the appellation but it be war and not trade it be a mass of crime and not commerce it be that which prevent the introduction of a trade in africa for it be only by clearing and cultivate the land that the climate could be make healthy for settlement but this wicked traffic by disperse the inhabitant and cause the land to remain uncultivated make the coast unhealthy to european he have find in attempt to establish a colony there that it be a obstacle which oppose itself to he in innumerable way it create more embarrassment than all the natural impediment of the country and it be more hard to contend with than any difficulty of climate soil or natural disposition of the people he would say a few word relative to the numerous petition which be then on the table of the house they have show in a extraordinary manner the opinion of the people he do not wish to turn this into a constitutional question but he would observe that it be of the utmost consequence to the maintenance of the constitution of this country that the reputation of parliament should be maintain but nothing could prejudice its character so much as a vote which should lead the people to believe that the legislative body be the more corrupt part of it and that it be slow to adopt moral principle it have be often insinuate that parliament by interfere in this trade depart from its proper function no idea could be more absurd for be it not its duty to correct abuse and what abuse be greater than robbery and murder he be indeed anxious for the abolition he desire it as a commercial man on account of the commercial character of the country he desire it for the reputation of parliament on which so materially depend the preservation of we happy constitution but most of all he pray for it for the sake of those eternal principle 's of justice which it be the duty of nation as well as of individual to support colonel tarleton repeat he argument of the last year in addition to these he inveigh bitterly against the abolitionist as a junto of secretary sophist enthusiast and fanatic he condemn the abolition as useless unless other nation would take it up he bring to the recollection of the house the barbarous scene which have take place it in st domingo all of which he say have originate in the discussion of this question he describe the alarm in which the inhabitant of we own island be keep lest similar scene should occur from the same cause he ridicule the petition on the table itinerant clergyman mendicant physician and other have extort signature from the sick the indigent and the traveller school-boy be invite to sign they under the promise of a holiday he have letter to produce which would prove all these thing though he be not authorize to give up the name of those who have write they mr montagu say that in the last session he have simply enter he protest against the trade but now he could be no longer silent and as there be many who have conceive regulation to be more desirable than abolition he would himself to that subject regulation as it related to the manner of procure slave be utterly impossible for how could we know the case of each individual whom we force away into bondage could we establish tribunal all along the coast and in every ship to find it out what judge could we get for such a office but if this could not be do upon the coast how could we ascertain the justness of the captivity of by far the greatest number who be bring from immense distance inland he would not dwell upon the proof of the inefficiency of regulation as to the middle passage he honorable friend mr wilberforce have show that however the mortality might have be lessen in some ship by the regulation of sir william dolben yet wherever a contagious disorder break out the greatest part of the cargo be sweep away but what regulation by the british parliament could prevent these contagion or remove they suddenly when they appear neither would regulation be effectual as they relate to the protection of the slave in the west indy it might perhaps be enact as mr vaughan have suggest that they punishment should be moderate and that the number of lash should be limit but the colonial legislature have already do as much as the magic of word alone could do upon this subject yet the evidence upon the table clearly prove that the only protection of slave be in the clemency of they master any barbarity might be exercise with impunity provide no white person be to see it though it happen in the sight of a thousand slave besides by splitting the offence and inflict the punishment at interval the law could be evade although the fact be within the reach of the evidence of a white man of this evasion captain cook of the 89th regiment have give a shocking instance and chief justice ottley have candidly confess that he could devise no method of bring a master so offend to justice while the evidence of the slave continue inadmissible but perhaps council of protection and guardian of the slave might be appoint this again be a expedient which sound well but which would be nugatory and absurd what person would risk the comfort of he life by the exercise of so invidious a interference but suppose that one or two individual could be find who would sacrifice all they time and the friendship of they associate for the good of the slave what could they effect could they be in all place at once but even if act of barbarity should be relate to they how be they to come at the proof of they it appear then that no regulation could be effectual until the slave be admit to give they evidence but to admit they to this privilege in they present state would be to endanger the safety and property of they master mr vaughan have however recommend this measure with limitation but it would produce nothing but discontent for how be the slave to be persuade that it be fit they should be admit to speak the truth and then be disbelieve and disregard what a fermentation would such conduct naturally excite in man dismiss with injury unredressed though abundantly prove in they apprehension by they testimony in fact no regulation would do there be no cure for these evil but in the abolition of the slave trade he call upon the planter to concur with he honorable friend mr wilberforce in this great measure he wish they to consider the progress which the opinion of the injustice of this trade be make in the nation at large as manifest by the petition which have almost obstruct the proceedings of the house by they perpetual introduction it be impossible for they to stifle this great question as for himself he would renew he profession of last year that he would never cease but with life to promote so glorious a end mr whitbread say that even if he could conceive that the trade be as some have assert it to be found on principle of humanity that the african be rescue from death in they own country that upon be carry to the west indy they be put under kind master that they labor there be easy that at evening they return cheerful to they home that in sickness they be attend with care and that they old age be render comfortable even then he would vote for the abolition of the slave trade inasmuch as he be convince that that which be fundamentally wrong no practice could justify no eloquence could persuade he that the african be tear from they country and they dearest connexion merely that they might lead a happier life or that they could be place under the uncontrolled dominion of other without suffer arbitrary power would spoil the heart of the best hence would arise tyranny on the one side and a sense of injury on the other hence the passion would be let loose and a state of perpetual enmity would follow he need only to go to the account of those who defend the system of slavery to show that it be cruel he be forcibly strike last year by a expression of a honorable member a advocate for the trade who when he come to speak of the slave on sell off the stock of a plantation say that they fetch less than the common price because they be damage damage what be they goods and chattel what a idea be this to hold out of we fellow-creature we might imagine how slave be treat if they could be speak of in such a manner perhaps these unhappy people have linger out the best part of they life in the service of they master able then to do but little they be sell for little and the remain substance of they sinew be to be press out by another yet more hardened than the former and who have make a calculation of they vitals accordingly as another proof he would mention a passage in a pamphlet in which the author describe the happy situation of the slave observe that a good negro never want a character a bad one could always be detect by he weal and scar what be this but to say that there be instrument in use which leave indelible mark behind they and who would say that these be use justly a honorable gentleman mr vaughan have say that set aside slavery the slave be better off than the poor in this country but what be it that we wish to abolish be it not the slave trade which would destroy in time the cruel distinction he have mention the same honorable gentleman have also express he admiration of they resignation but might it not be that resignation which be the consequence of despair colonel tarleton have insinuate that the petition on the table have be obtain in a objectionable manner he have the honor to present one from he constituent which he would venture to say have originate with themselves and that there do not exist more respectable name in the kingdom than those of the person who have sign it he have also assert that there be a strong similitude in they tenor and substance as if they have be manufacture by the same person this be by no means to be wonder at there be surely but one plain tale to tell and it be not surprising that it have be clothe in nearly the same expression there be but one boon to ask and that be -- the abolition of this wicked trade it have be say by another -lrb- mr baillie -rrb- that the horrible insurrection in st domingo arise from the discussion of the question of the slave trade he deny the assertion and maintain that they be the effect of the trade itself there be a point of endurance beyond which human nature could not go at which the mind of man rise by its native elasticity with a spring and violence proportion to the degree to which it have be depress the calamity in st domingo proceed from the slave trade alone and if it be continue similar evil be to be apprehend in we own island the cruelty which the slave have perpetrate in that unfortunate colony they have learn from they master have not a african eye have he not ear have he not organ sens and passion if you prick he would he not feel the puncture and bleed if you poison he would he not die and if you wrong he would he not revenge but he have say sufficient for he fear he could not better the instruction mr milbank would only just observe that the policy of the measure of the abolition be as great as its justice be undeniable where slavery exist everything be out of its natural place all improvement be at a end there must also from the nature of the human heart be oppression he warn the planter against the danger of fresh importation and invite they concurrence in the measure mr dunda -lrb- afterwards viscount melville -rrb- declare that he have always be a warm friend to the abolition of the slave trade though he differ from mr wilberforce as to the mode of effect it the abolitionist and those on the opposite side of the question have both of they go into extreme the former be for the immediate and abrupt annihilation of the trade the latter consider it as essentially necessary to the existence of the west indian island and therefore lay it down that it be to be continue for ever such be the vast distance between the party he would now address himself to each he would say first that he agree with he honorable friend mr wilberforce in very material point he believe the trade be not found in policy that the continuation of it be not essential to the preservation of we trade with the west indian island and that the slave be not only to be maintain but increase there by natural population he agree too as to the propriety of the abolition but when he honorable friend talk of direct and abrupt abolition he would submit it to he whether he do not run counter to the prejudice of those who be most deeply interested in the question and whether if he could obtain he object without wound these it would not be better to do it do he not also forget the sacred attention which parliament have ever show to the private interest and patrimonial rights of individual whatever idea man might then have of the african trade certain it be that they who have connect themselves with it have do it under the sanction of parliament it might also be well worth while to consider -lrb- though the conduct of other nation ought not to deter we from do we duty -rrb- whether british subject in the west indy might not be supply with slave under neutral flag now he believe it be possible to avoid these objection and at the same time to act in harmony with the prejudice which have be mention this might be do by regulation by which we should effect the end much more speedily than by the way propose by regulation he mean such as would increase the breed of the slave in the west indy such as would ensure a moral education to they child and such as would even in time extinguish hereditary slavery the extinction however of this be not to be effect by allow the son of a african slave to obtain he freedom on the death of he parent such a son should be consider as bear free he should then be educate at the expense of the person import he parent and when arrive at such a degree of strength as might qualify he to labor he should work for a term of year for the payment of the expense of he education and maintenance it be impossible to emancipate the exist slave at once nor would such a emancipation be of any immediate benefit to themselves but this observation would not apply to they descendant if train and educate in the manner he have propose he would now address himself to those who adopt the opposite extreme and he think he should not assume too much when he say that if both slavery and the slave trade could be abolish with safety to they property it deeply concern they interest to do it such a measure also would only be consistent with the principle of the british constitution it be surely strange that we who be ourselves free should carry on a slave trade with africa and that we should never think of introduce cultivation into the west indy by free labourer that such a measure would tend to they interest he have no doubt do not all of they agree with mr long that the great danger in the west indy arise from the importation of the african slave there mr long have assert that all the insurrection there arise from these if this statement be true how directly it bear upon the present question but we be tell also by the same author that the slave trade give rise to robbery murder and all kind of depredation on the coast of africa have this be answer no : except indeed it have be say that the slave be such as have be condemn for crime well then the import african consist of all the convict rogue thief and vagabond in africa but would the west indian choose to depend on fresh supplies of these for the cultivation of they land and the security of they island when it be also find that every insurrection have arise from they it be plain the safety of the island be concern in this question there would be danger so long as the trade last the planter be by these importation create the engine of they own destruction surely they would act more to they own interest if they would concur in extinguish the trade than by stand up for its continuance he would now ask they what right they have to suppose that africa would for ever remain in a state of barbarism if once a enlighten prince be to rise up there he first act would be to annihilate the slave trade if the light of heaven be ever to descend upon that continent it would directly occasion its downfall it be they interest then to contrive a mode of supply labor without trust to precarious importation from that quarter they might rest assure that the trade could not continue he do not allude to the voice of the people in the petition then lie on the table of the house but he know certainly that a idea not only of the injustice but of the impolicy of this trade have be long entertain by man of the most enlighten understanding in this country be it then a prudent thing for they to rest on this commerce for the further improvement of they property there be a species of slavery prevail only a few year ago in the colliery in certain borough in scotland emancipation there be think a duty by parliament : but what a opposition there be to the measure nothing but ruin would be the consequence of it after several year struggle the bill be carry within a year after the ruin so much talk of vanish in smoke and there be a end of the business it have also be contend that sir william dolben 's bill would be the ruin of liverpool : and yet one of its representative have allow that this bill have be of benefit to the owner of the slave-vessel there be he then ask too much of the west indian to request a candid consideration of the real ground of they alarm he would conclude by state that he mean to propose a middle way of proceed if there be a number of member in the house who think with he that this trade ought to be ultimately abolish but yet by moderate measure which should neither invade the property nor the prejudice of individual he wish they to unite and they might then reduce the question to its proper limit mr addington the speaker -lrb- now viscount sidmouth -rrb- profess himself to be one of those moderate person call upon by mr dunda he wish to see some middle measure suggest the fear of do injury to the property of other have hitherto prevent he from give a opinion against a system the continuance of which he could not countenance he utterly abhor the slave trade a noble and learn lord who have now retire from the bench say on a certain occasion that he pity the loyalty of that man who imagine that any epithet could aggravate the crime of treason so he himself know of no language which could aggravate the crime of the slave trade it be sufficient for every purpose of crimination to assert that man thereby be buy and sell or that he be make subject to the despotism of man but though he thus acknowledge the justice due to a whole continent on the one side he confess there be oppose claim of justice on the other the case of the west indian deserve a tender consideration also he doubt if we be to relinquish the slave trade alone whether it might not be carry on still more barbarously than at present and whether if we be to stop it altogether the island could keep up they present stock it have be assert that they could but he think that the stop of the imputation could not be depend upon for this purpose so much as a plan for provide they with more female with the mode suggest by he right honorable friend mr dunda he be pleased though he do not wholly agree to it he could not grant liberty to the child bear in the island he think also that the trade ought to be permit for ten or twelve year longer under such arrangement as should introduce a kind of management among the slave there favourable to they interest and of course to they future happiness one species of regulation which he should propose would be greater encouragement to the importation of female than of male by means of a bounty on the former till they number should be find equal reward also might be give to those slave who should raise a certain number of child and to those who should devise means of lighten negro-labour if the plan of he honorable friend should comprehend these regulation he would heartily concur in it he wish to see the slave trade abolish indeed it do not deserve the name of a trade it be not a trade and ought not to be allow he be satisfy that in a few year it would cease to be the reproach of this nation and the torment of africa but under regulation like these it would cease without any material injury to the interest of other mr fox say that after what have fall from the two last speaker he could remain no longer silent something so mischievous have come out and something so like a foundation have be lay for preserve not only for year to come but for ever this detestable traffic that he should feel himself want in he duty if he be not to deprecate all such deception and delusion upon the country the honorable gentleman have call themselves moderate man : but upon this subject he neither feel nor desire to feel anything like a sentiment of moderation they speech have remind he of a passage in middleton 's _ life of cicero _ the translation of it be defective though it would equally suit he purpose he say to enter into a man 's house and kill he he wife and family in the night be certainly a most heinous crime and deserving of death but to break open he house to murder he he wife and all he child in the night may be still very right provide it be do with moderation now be there anything more absurd in this passage than to say that the slave trade might be carry on with moderation for if you could not rob or murder a single man with moderation with what moderation could you pillage and wind a whole nation in fact the question of the abolition be simply a question of justice it be only whether we should authorize by law respect africa the commission of crime for which in this country we should forfeit we life : notwithstanding which it be to be treat in the opinion of these honorable gentleman with moderation mr addington have propose to cure the disproportion of the sex in the island by a bounty on the importation of female or in other word by offer a premium to any crew of ruffian who would tear they from they native country he would let loose a bandit against the most weak and defenceless of the sex he would occasion these to kill father husband and brother to get possession of they relative the female who after this carnage be to be reserve for -- slavery he should like to see the man who would pen such a moderate clause for a british parliament mr dunda have propose to abolish the slave trade by better the state of the slave in the island and particularly that of they offspring he plan with respect to the latter be not a little curious they be to become free when bear and then they be to be educate at the expense of those to whom they father belong but it be clear that they could not be educate for nothing in order therefore to repay this expense they be to be slave for ten or fifteen year in short they be to have a education which be to qualify they to become freeman and after they have be so educate they be to become slave but as this free education might possibly unfit they for submit to slavery so after they have be make to bow under the yoke for ten or fifteen year they might then perhaps be equally unfit to become free and therefore might be retain as slave for a few year longer if not for they whole life he never hear of a scheme so moderate and yet so absurd and visionary the same honorable gentleman have observe that the conduct of other nation should not hinder we from do we duty but yet neutral would furnish we island with slave what be the inference from this moderate assertion but that we might as well supply they ourselves he hope if we be yet to be supply it would never be by englishman we ought no longer to be concern in such a crime a adversary mr baillie have say that it would not be fair to take the character of this country from the record of the old bailey he do not at all wonder when the subject of the slave trade be mention that the old bailey naturally occur to he recollection the fact which have be describe in the evidence be associate in all we mind with the idea of criminal justice but mr baillie have forget the essential difference between the two case when we learn from these record that crime be commit in this country we learn also that they be punish with transportation and death but the crime commit in the slave trade be pass over with impunity nay the perpetrator be even send out again to commit other as to the mode of obtain slave it have be suggest as the least disreputable that they become so in consequence of condemnation as criminal but he would judge of the probability of this mode by the reasonableness of it no less than eighty thousand african be export annually by the different nation of europe from they own country be it possible to believe that this number could have be legally convict of crime for which they have justly forfeit they liberty the supposition be ridiculous the truth be that every enormity be practice to obtain the person of these unhappy people he refer those present to the case in the evidence of the african trader who have kidnap and sell a girl and who be afterwards kidnap and sell himself he desire they to reason upon the conversation which have take place between the trader and the captain of the ship on this occasion he desire they also to reason upon the instance mention this evening which have happen in the river cameroon and they would infer all the rapine all the desolation and all the bloodshed which have be place to the account of this execrable trade a attempt have be make to impress the house with the horrible scene which have take place in st domingo as a argument against the abolition of the slave trade but could any more weighty argument be produce in its favor what be the cause of the insurrection there they be two the first be the indecision of the national assembly who wish to compromise between that which be right and that which be wrong on this subject and the second be the oppression of the people of color and of the slave in the first of the cause we see something like the moderation of mr dunda and mr addington one day this assembly talk of liberty and favor the black another day they suspend they measure and favor the whites they wish to steer a middle course but decision have be mercy decision even against the planter would have be a thousand time better than indecision and half measure in the mean time the people of color take the great work of justice into they own hand unable however to complete this of themselves they call in the aid of the slave here begin the second cause for the slave feel they own power begin to retaliate on the whites and here it may be observe that in all revolution the clemency or cruelty of the victor will always be in proportion to they former privilege of they oppression that the slave then should have be guilty of great excess be not to be wonder at for where do they learn they cruelty they learn it from those who have tyrannize over they the oppression which they themselves have suffer be fresh in they memory and this have drive they to exercise they vengeance so furiously if we wish to prevent similar scene in we own island we must reject all moderate measure and at once abolish the slave trade by do this we should procure a better treatment for the slave there and when this happy change of system should have take place we might depend on they for the defense of the island as much as on the whites themselves upon the whole he would give he opinion of this traffic in a few word he believe it to be impolitic -- he know it to be inhuman -- he be certain it be unjust -- he think it so inhuman and unjust that if the colony could not be cultivate without it they ought not to be cultivate at all it would be much better for we to be without they than not abolish the slave trade he hope therefore that member would this night act the part which would do they honor he declare that whether he should vote in a large minority or a small one he would never give up the cause whether in parliament or out of it in whatever situation he might ever be as long as he have a voice to speak this question should never be at rest believe the trade to be of the nature of crime and pollution which stain the honor of the country he would never relax he effort it be he duty to prevent man from prey upon man and if he and he friend should die before they have attain they glorious object he hope there would never be want man alive to they duty who would continue to labor till the evil should be wholly do away if the situation of the african be as happy as servitude could make they he could not consent to the enormous crime of sell man to man nor permit a practice to continue which put a entire bar to the civilization of one quarter of the globe he be sure that the nation would not much longer allow the continuance of enormity which shock human nature the west indian have no right to demand that crime should be permit by this country for they advantage and if they be wise they would lend they cordial assistance to such measure as would bring about in the shortest possible time the abolition of this execrable trade mr dunda rise again but it be only to move a amendment namely that the word gradually should be insert before the word to be abolish in mr wilberforce 's motion mr jenkinson -lrb- afterwards earl of liverpool -rrb- say that the opinion of those who be averse to the abolition have be unfairly state they have be describe as found on policy in opposition to humanity if it could be make out that humanity would be aid by the abolition he would be the last person to oppose it the question be not he apprehend whether the trade be found in injustice and oppression : he admit it be nor be it whether it be in itself abstractedly a evil : he admit this also but whether under all the circumstance of the case any considerable advantage would arise to a number of we fellow-creature from the abolition of the trade in the manner in which it have be propose he be ready to admit that the african at home be make miserable by the slave trade and that if it be universally abolish great benefit would arise to they no one however would assert that these misery arise from the trade as carry on by great britain only other country occasion as much of the evil as we do and if the abolition of it by we should prove only the transfer of it to those country very little benefit would result from the measure what then be the probability of we example be follow by foreign power five year have now elapse since the question be first start and what have any of they do the portuguese continue the trade the spaniard still give a bounty to encourage it he believe there be agent from holland in this country who be then negotiate with person concern in it in order to secure its continuance the abolition also have be propose in the national assembly of france and have be reject there from these circumstance he have a right to infer that if we give up the trade we should only transfer it to those country : but this transfer would be entirely against the african the mortality on board english ship previously to the regulate bill be four and an-eighth per cent since that time it have be reduce to little more than three per cent -lrb- a -rrb- in french ship it be near ten and in dutch ship from five to seven per cent in portuguese it be less than either in french or dutch but more than in english ship since the regulate bill thus the death of the african would be more than double if we be to abolish the trade -lrb- footnote a : mr wilberforce state it on the same evening to be between ten and eleven per cent for the last year the number then export from africa to we island be rather more than 22000 of whom more than 2300 die -rrb- perhaps it might be reply that the importation be stop in we own island fewer african would experience this misery because fewer would be take from they own country on this account but he have a right to infer that as the planter purchase slave at present they would still think it they interest to have they the question then be whether they could get they by smuggling now it appear by the evidence that many hundred slave have be steal from time to time from jamaica and carry into cuba but if person could smuggle slave out of we colony they could smuggle slave into they but particularly when the planter might think it to they interest to assist they with respect to the slave there instance have be relate of they oppression which shock the feeling of all who hear they : but be it fair to infer from these they general ill usage suppose a person be to make a collection of the different abuse which have happen for a series of year under we own happy constitution and use these as a argument of its worthlessness should we not say to he that in the most perfect system which the human intellect could form some defect would exist and that it be unfair to draw inference from such partial fact in the same manner he would argue relative to the alleged treatment of the slave evidence have be produce upon this point on both side he should not be afraid to oppose the authority of lord rodney and other against any however respectable in favor of the abolition but this be not necessary there be another species of fact which would answer the same end previously to the year 1730 the decrease of the slave in we island be very considerable from 1730 to 1755 the death be reduce to only two and a-half per cent above the birth from 1755 to 1768 to only one and three-fourths and from 1768 to 1788 to only one per cent this then on the first view of the subject would show that whatever might have be the situation of slave formerly it have be gradually improve but if in addition to this we consider the peculiar disadvange under which they labor the small proportion of female to male and the hurricane and famine which have sweep away thousand we should find it physically impossible that they could have increase as related if they have be treat as cruelly as the friend of the abolition have describe this species of fact would enable he also to draw still more important conclusion namely that as the slave in the west indy have gradually increase they would continue to increase that very few year would pass not only before the birth be equal to the death but before they be more numerous than the death and that if this be likely to happen in the present state of thing how much more would it happen if by certain regulation the increase of the slave should be encourage the only question then be whether it be more advantageous to breed or to import he think he should prove the former and if so then this increase be inevitable and the importation would necessarily cease in the first place the gradual increase of the slave of late year clearly prove that such increase have be encourage but they price have be double in the last twenty year the planter therefore must feel it he interest to desist from purchase if possible but again the greatest mortality be among the newly import slave the disease they contract on the passage and they death in the seasoning all make for the same doctrine add to this that slave breed in the island be more expert at colonial labor more reconcile to they situation and better disposed towards they master than those who be bring from africa but it have be say that the birth and death in the island be now equal and that therefore no further supply be want he deny the propriety of this inference the slave be subject to peculiar disease they be expose also to hurricane and consequent famine that the day however would come when the stock there would be sufficient no person who attend to the former part of he argument could doubt that they have gradually increase be gradually increase and would by certain regulation increase more and more must be equally obvious but these be all consideration for continue the traffic a little longer he then desire the house to reflect upon the state of st domingo have not its calamity be imputed by its own deputy to the advocate for the abolition be ever any scene of horror equal to those which have pass there and should we when principle of the same sort be lurk in we own island expose we fellow-subject to the same misery who if guilty of promote this trade have at least be encourage in it by ourselves that the slave trade be a evil he admit that the state of slavery itself be likewise a evil he admit and if the question be not whether we should abolish but whether we should establish these he would be the first to oppose himself to they existence but there be many evil which we should have think it we duty to prevent yet which when they have once arise it be more dangerous to oppose than to submit to -- the duty of a statesman be not to consider abstractedly what be right or wrong but to weigh the consequence which be likely to result from the abolition of a evil against those which be likely to result from its continuance agree then most perfectly with the abolitionist in they end he differ from they only in the means of accomplish it he be desirous of do that gradually which he conceive they be do rashly he have therefore draw up two proposition the first be that a address be present to he majesty that he would recommend to the colonial assembly to grant premium to such planter and overseer as should distinguish themselves by promote the annual increase of the slave by birth and likewise freedom to every female slave who have rear five child to the age of seven year the second be that a bounty of five pound per head be give to the master of every slave-ship who should import in any cargo a greater number of female than male not exceed the age of twenty-five year to bring forward these proposition he would now move that the chairman leave the chair mr este wish the debate to be adjourn he allow there be many enormity in the trade which call for regulation there be two proposition before the house : the one for the immediate and the other for the gradual abolition of the trade he think that member should be allow time to compare they respective merit at present he own opinion be that gradual abolition would answer the end propose in the least exceptionable manner mr pitt rejoice that the debate have take a turn which contract the question into such narrow limit the matter then in dispute be merely as to the time at which the abolition should take place he therefore congratulate the house the country and the world that this great point have be gain that we might now consider this trade as have receive its condemnation that this curse of mankind be see in its true light and that the greatest stigma on we national character which ever yet exist be about to be remove mankind he trust be now likely to be deliver from the greatest practical evil that ever afflict the human race -- from the most severe and extensive calamity record in the history of the world he honorable friend -lrb- mr jenkinson -rrb- have insinuate that any act for the abolition would be evade but if we be to enforce this act with all the power of the country how could it fail to be effectual but he honorable friend have himself satisfy he upon this point he have acknowledge that the trade would drop of itself on account of the increase dearness of the commodity import he would ask then if we be to leave to the importer no means of importation but by smuggling and if besides all the present disadvantage we be to load he with all the charge and hazard of the smuggler would there be any danger of any considerable supply of fresh slave be pour into the island through this channel the question under these circumstance he pronounce would not bear a dispute he honorable friend have also maintain that it would be inexpedient to stop the importation immediately because the death and birth in the island be as yet not equal but he -lrb- mr pitt -rrb- have prove last year from the most authentic document that a increase of the birth above the death have already take place this then be the time for begin the abolition but he would now observe that five year have elapse since these document be frame and therefore the presumption be that the black population be increase at a extraordinary rate he have not to be sure in he consideration of the subject enter into the dreadful mortality arise from the clearing of new land importation for this purpose be to be consider not as carry on the trade but as set on foot a slave trade a measure which he believe no one present would then support he therefore ask he honorable friend whether the period he have look to be now arrive whether the west indy at this hour be not in a state in which they could maintain they population it have be argue that one or other of these two assertion be false that either the population of the slave must be decrease -lrb- which the abolitionist deny -rrb- or if it be increase the slave must have be well treat that they population be rather increase than otherwise and also that they general treatment be by no means so good as it ought to have be be both point which have be prove by different witness neither be they incompatible with each other but he would see whether the explanation of this seeming contradiction would not refute the argument of expediency as advance by he honorable friend do the slave decrease in number -- yes then ill usage must have be the cause of it but if so the abolition be immediately necessary to restrain it do they on the other hand increase -- yes but if so no further importation be want be they population -lrb- to take a middle course -rrb- nearly stationary and they treatment neither so good nor so bad as it might be -- yes but if so this be the proper period for stop further supplies for both the population and the treatment would be improve by such a measure but he would show again the futility of the argument of he honorable friend he himself have admit that it be in the power of the colonist to correct the various abuse by which the negro population be restrain but they could not do this without improve the condition of they slave without make they approximate towards the rank of citizen without give they some little interest in they labor which would occasion they to work with the energy of man but now the assembly of grenada have themselves state that though the negro be allow the afternoon of only one day in every week they would do as much work in that afternoon when employ for they own benefit as in the whole day when employ in they master ' service now after this confession the house might burn all he calculation relative to the negro population for if it have not yet quite reach the desirable state which he have point out this confession have prove that further supplies be not want a negro if he work for himself could do double work by a improvement then in the mode of labor the work in the island could be double but if so what would become of the argument of he honorable friend for then only half the number of the present labourer be necessary he would now try this argument of expediency by other consideration the best inform writer on the subject have tell we that the purchase of new negro be injurious to the planter but if this statement be just would not the abolition be beneficial to they that it would be the opinion of mr long they own historian if the slave trade say he be prohibit for four or five year it would enable they to retrieve they affair by prevent they from run into debt either by rent or purchase negro to this acknowledgment he would add a fact from the evidence which be that a north american province by such a prohibition alone for a few year from be deeply plunge in debt have become independent rich and flourish the next consideration be the danger to which the island be expose from the newly import slave mr long with a view of prevent insurrection have advise that a duty equal to a prohibition might be lay on the importation of coromantine slave after notice one insurrection which happen through they means he speak of another in the following year in which thirty-three coromantine most of whom have be newly import murder and wound no less than nineteen whites in the space of a hour to the authority of mr long he would add the recorded opinion of a committee of the house of assembly of jamaica which be appoint to inquire into the best means of prevent future insurrection the committee report that the rebellion have originate like most other with the coromantine and they propose that a bill should he bring in for lay a higher duty on the importation of these particular negro which should operate as a prohibition but the danger be not confine to the introduction of coromantine mr long account for the frequent insurrection in jamaica from the greatness of its general importation in two year and a-half say he twenty-seven thousand negro have be import -- no wonder that we have rebellion surely then when he honorable friend speak of the calamity of st domingo and of similar danger impend over we own island it ill become he to be the person to cry out for further importation it ill become he to charge upon the abolitionist the crime of stir up insurrection who only recommend what the legislature of jamaica itself have lay down in a time of danger with a avowed view to prevent they it be indeed a great satisfaction to himself that among the many argument for prohibit the slave trade the security of we west indian possession against internal commotion as well as foreign enemy be among the most prominent and forcible and here he would ask he honorable friend whether in this part of the argument he do not see reason for immediate abolition why should we any longer persist in introduce those latent principle of conflagration which if they should once burst forth might annihilate the industry of a hundred year which might throw the planter back a whole century in they profit in they cultivation and in they progress towards the emancipation of they slave it be we duty to vote that the abolition of the slave trade should be immediate and not to leave it to he know not what future time or contingency have now do with the argument of expediency he would consider the proposition of he right honorable friend mr dunda that on account of some patrimonial rights of the west indian the prohibition of the slave trade would be a invasion of they legal inheritance he would first observe that if this argument be worth anything it apply just as much to gradual as to immediate abolition he have no doubt that at whatever period we should say the trade should cease it would be equally set up for it would certainly be just as good a argument against the measure in seventy year hence as it be against it now it imply also that parliament have no right to stop the importation : but have this detestable traffic receive such a sanction as place it more out of the jurisdiction of the legislature for ever after than any other branch of we trade in what a situation do the proposition of he honorable friend place the legislature of great britain it be scarcely possible to lay a duty on anyone article which might not in someway affect the property of individual but if the law respect the slave trade imply a contract for its perpetual continuance the house could never regulate any other of the branch of we national commerce but any contract for the promotion of this trade must in he opinion have be void from the beginning : for if it be a outrage upon justice and only another name for fraud robbery and murder what pledge could devolve upon the legislature to incur the obligation of become principal in the commission of such enormity by sanction they continuance but he would appeal to the act themselves that of 23 george ii c 31 be the one upon which the greatest stress be lay how would the house be surprise to hear that the very outrages commit in the prosecution of this trade have be forbid by that act no master of a ship trading to africa say the act shall by fraud force or violence or by any indirect practice whatever take on board or carry away from that coast any negro or native of that country or commit any violence on the native to the prejudice of the say trade and every person so offend shall for every such offence forfeit one hundred pound but the whole trade have be demonstrate to be a system of fraud force and violence and therefore the contract be daily violate under which the parliament allow it to continue but why have the trade ever be permit at all the preamble of the act would show : whereas the trade to and from africa be very advantageous to great britain and necessary for supply the plantation and colony thereunto belong with a sufficient number of negro at reasonable rate and for that purpose the say trade should be carry on -- here then we might see what the parliament have in view when it pass this act but no one of the occasion on which it ground its proceedings now exist he would plead then the act itself as a argument for the abolition if it have be prove that instead of be very advantageous to great britain it be the most destructive to she interest -- that it be the ruin of she seaman -- that it stop the extension of she manufacture -- if it have be prove in the second place that it be not now necessary for the supply of we plantation with negro -- if it have be further establish that it be from the beginning contrary to the first principle of justice and consequently that a pledge for its continuance have one be attempt to be give must have be absolutely void -- where in this act of parliament be the contract to be find by which britain be bind as she be say to be never to listen to she own true interest and to the cry of the native of africa be it not clear that all argument found on the suppose pledge of parliament make against those who employ it but if we be not bind by exist law to the support of this trade we be doubly criminal in pursue it for why ought it to be abolish at all because it be incurable injustice africa be the ground on which he chiefly rest and there it be that he two honorable friend one of whom have propose gradual abolition and the other regulation do not carry they principle to they full extent both have confess the trade to be a moral evil how much stronger then be the argument for immediate than for gradual abolition if on the ground of a moral evil it be to be abolish at last why ought it not now why be injustice to be suffer to remain for a single hour he know of no evil which ever have exist nor could he imagine any to exist worse than the tear of eighty thousand person annually from they native land by a combination of the most civilized nation in the most enlighten quarter of the globe but more especially by that nation which call herself the most free and the most happy of they all he would now notice the objection that other nation would not give up the slave trade if we be to renounce it but if the trade be stain but by a thousandth part of the criminality which he and other after a thorough investigation of the subject charge upon it the house ought immediately to vote for its abolition this miserable argument if persevere in would be a eternal bar to the annihilation of the evil how be it ever to be eradicate if every nation be thus prudentially to wait till the concurrence of all the world should be obtain but it apply a thousand time more strongly in a contrary way how much more justly would other nation say great britain free as she be just and honorable as she be not only have not abolish but have refuse to abolish the slave trade she have investigate it well she senate have deliberate upon it it be plain then that she see no guilt in it with this argument we should furnish the other nation of europe if we be again to refuse to put a end to this cruel traffic and we should have from henceforth not only to answer for we own but for they crime also already we have suffer one year to pass away and now when the question be renew not only have this wretched argument be revive but a proposition have be make for the gradual abolition of the trade he know indeed the difficulty of reform long established abuse but in the present case by propose some other period than the present by prescribe some condition by wait for some contingency perhaps till we obtain the general concurrence of europe -lrb- a concurrence which he believe never yet take place at the commencement of any one improvement in policy or moral -rrb- he fare that this most enormous evil would never be redress be it not folly to wait for the stream to run down before we cross the bed of its channel alas we might wait for ever the river would still flow on we should be no nearer the object which we have in view so long as the step which could alone bring we to it be not take he would now proceed to the civilization of africa and as he eye have just glance upon a west indian law in the evidence upon the table he would begin with a argument which the sight of it have suggest to he this argument have be ably answer in the course of the evening but he would view it in yet another light it have be say that the savage disposition of the african render the prospect of they civilization almost hopeless this argument be indeed of long standing but last year it have be support upon a new ground captain frazer have state in he evidence that a boy have be put to death at cabenda because there be those who refuse to purchase he as a slave this single story be deem by he and have be consider by other as a sufficient proof of the barbarity of the african and of the inutility of abolish the slave trade but they who have use this fact have suppress several circumstance relate to it it appear on question captain frazer afterward that this boy have previously run away from he master three several time that the master have to pay he value accord to the custom of the country every time he be bring back and that partly from anger at the boy for run away so frequently and partly to prevent a repetition of the same expense he determine to destroy he such be the explanation of the signal instance which be to fix barbarity on all africa as it come out in the cross-examination of captain frazer that this african master be unenlightened and barbarous he freely admit but what would a enlighten and civilized west indian have do in a similar case he would quote the law pass in the west indy in 1722 which he have just cast he eye upon in the book of evidence by which law this very same crime of run away be by the legislature of a island by the grave and deliberate sentence of a enlighten legislature punish with death and this not in the case only of the third offence but even in the very first instance it be enact that if any negro or other slave should withdraw himself from he master for the term of six month or any slave who be absent should not return within that time every such person should suffer death there be also another west indian law by which every negro be arm against he fellow negro for he be authorize to kill every runaway slave and he have even a reward hold out to he for so do let the house now contrast the two case let they ask themselves which of the two exhibit the greater barbarity and whether they could possibly vote for the continuance of the slave trade upon the principle that the african have show themselves to be a race of incorrigible barbarian something like a opposite argument but with a like view have be maintain by other on this subject it have be say in justification of the trade that the african have derive some little civilization from they intercourse with we yes we have give they just enough of the form of justice to enable they to add the pretext of legal trial to they other mode of perpetrate the most atrocious crime we have give they just enough of european improvement to enable they the more effectually to turn africa into a ravage wilderness alas alas we have carry on a trade with they from this civilized and enlighten country which instead of diffuse knowledge have be a check to every laudable pursuit we have carry a poison into they country which spread its contagious effect from one end of it to the other and which penetrate to its very center corrupt every part to which it reach we have there subvert the whole order of nature we have aggravate every natural barbarity and furnish to every man motive for commit under the name of trade act of perpetual hostility and perfidy against he neighbor thus have the perversion of british commerce carry misery instead of happiness to one whole quarter of the globe false to the very principle of trade misguided in we policy unmindful of we duty what almost irreparable mischief have we do to that continent how should we hope to obtain forgiveness from heaven if we refuse to use those means which the mercy of providence have still reserve to we for wipe away the guilt and shame with which we be now cover if we refuse even this degree of compensation how aggravate would be we guilt should we delay then to repair these incalculable injury we ought to count the day nay the very hour which intervene to delay the accomplishment of such a work on this great subject the civilization of africa which he confess be near he heart he would yet add a few observation and first he would say that the present deplorable state of that country especially when we reflect that she chief calamity be to be ascribe to we call for we generous aid rather than justified any despair on we part of she recovery and still less a repetition of we injury on what ground of theory or history do we act when we suppose she be never to be reclaim there be a time which it might be now fit to call to remembrance when human sacrifice and even this very practice of the slave trade exist in we own island slave as we may read in henry 's _ history of great britain _ be formerly a established article of we export great number he say be export like cattle from the british coast and be to be see expose for sale in the roman market -- adultery witchcraft and debt say the same historian be probably some of the chief source of supply the roman market with british slave -- prisoner take in war be add to the number -- there might be also among they some unfortunate gamester who after have lose all they goods at length stake themselves they wife and they child now every one of these source of slavery have be state to be at this hour a source of slavery in africa if these practice therefore be to be admit as proof of the natural incapacity of its inhabitant why might they not have be apply to ancient britain why might not then some roman senator point to british barbarian have predict with equal boldness that these be a people who be destine never to be free who be without the understanding necessary for the attainment of useful art depress by the hand of nature below the level of the human species and create to form a supply of slave for the rest of the world but happily since that time notwithstanding what would then have be the justness of these prediction we have emerge from barbarism we be now raise to a situation which exhibit a striking contrast to every circumstance by which a roman might have characterize we and by which we now characterize africa there be indeed one thing want to complete the contrast and to clear we altogether from the imputation of act even to this hour as barbarian for we continue to this hour a barbarous traffic in slave we continue it even yet in spite of all we great pretension we be once as obscure among the nation of the earth as savage in we manners as debased in we moral as degrade in we understanding as these unhappy african but in the lapse of a long series of year by a progression slow and for a time almost imperceptible we have become rich in a variety of acquirement we be favor above measure in the gift of providence we be unrivalled in commerce pre-eminent in art foremost in the pursuit of philosophy and science and establish in all the blessing of civil society we be in the possession of peace of liberty and of happiness we be under the guidance of a mild and a beneficent religion and we be protect by impartial law and the purest administration of justice we be live under a system of government which we own happy experience lead we to pronounce the best and wisest and which have become the admiration of the world from all these blessing we must for ever have be exclude have there be any truth in those principle which some have not hesitate to lay down as applicable to the case of africa and we should have be at this moment little superior either in moral knowledge or refinement to the rude inhabitant of that continent if then we feel that this perpetual confinement in the fetter of brutal ignorance would have be the greatest calamity which could have befall we if we view with gratitude the contrast between we present and we former situation if we shudder to think of the misery which would still have overwhelm we have we country continue to the present time through some cruel policy to be the mart for slave to the more civilized nation of the world -- god forbid that we should any longer subject africa to the same dreadful scourge and exclude the sight of knowledge from she coast which have reach every other quarter of the globe he trust we should no longer continue this commerce and that we should no longer consider ourselves as confer too great a boon on the native of africa in restore they to the rank of human being he trust we should not think ourselves too liberal if by abolish the slave trade we give they the same common chance of civilization with other part of the world if we listen to the voice of reason and duty this night some of we might live to see a reverse of that picture from which we how turn we eye with shame we might live to behold the native engage in the calm occupation of industry and in the pursuit of a just commerce we might behold the beam of science and philosophy breaking in upon they land which at some happy period in still later time might blaze with full lustre and join they influence to that of pure religion might illuminate and invigorate the most distant extremity of that immense continent then might we hope that even africa -lrb- though last of all the quarter of the globe -rrb- should enjoy at length in the evening of she day those blessing which have descend so plentifully upon we in a much earlier period of the world then also would europe participate in she improvement and prosperity receive a ample recompense for the tardy kindness -lrb- if kindness it could be call -rrb- of no longer hinder she from extricate herself out of the darkness which in other more fortunate region have be so much more speedily dispel -------- no primus equi orien afflavit anheli illc serum ruben accendit lumina vesper then might be apply to africa those word originally use indeed with a different view : he demm exacti ------ devenere loco laeto et amoena vireta fortunatorum nemorum sedesque beata largior hc campo aether et lumine vestit purpureo it be in this view -- it be as a atonement for we long and cruel injustice towards africa that the measure propose by he honorable friend mr wilberforce most forcibly recommend itself to he mind the great and happy change to be expect in the state of she inhabitant be of all the various benefit of the abolition in he estimation the most extensive and important he should vote against the adjournment and he should also oppose every proposition which tend either to prevent or even to postpone for a hour the total abolition of the slave trade mr pitt have conclude he speech -lrb- at about six in the morning -rrb- sir william dolben the chairman propose the follow question : -- the first be on the motion of mr jenkinson that the chairman do now leave the chair this be lose by a majority of two hundred and thirty-four to eighty-seven the second be on the motion of mr dunda that the abolition should be gradual when the vote for gradual exceed those for immediate by one hundred and ninety-three to one hundred and twenty-five he then put the amend question that it be the opinion of the committee that the trade ought to be gradually abolish the committee have divide again the vote for a gradual abolition be two hundred and thirty and those against any abolition be eighty-five after this debate the committee for the abolition of the slave trade hold a meeting they vote they thanks to mr wilberforce for he motion and to mr pitt mr fox and those other member of the house who have support it they resolve also that the house of common have determine that the slave trade ought to be gradually abolish have by that decision manifest they opinion that it be cruel and unjust they resolve also that a gradual abolition of it be not a adequate remedy for its injustice and cruelty neither could it be deem a compliance with the general wish of the people as express in they numerous and urgent petition to parliament and they resolve lastly that the interval in which the slave trade should be permit to continue afford a prospect of redoubled cruelty and ravages on the coast of africa and that it impose therefore a additional obligation on every friend to the cause to use all constitutional means to obtain its immediate abolition at a subsequent meeting they vote they thanks to the right honorable lord muncaster for the able support he have give to the great object of they institution by he _ historical sketch of the slave trade and of its effect in africa _ address to the people of great britain and they elect the rev richard gifford and the rev thoma gisborne honorary and corresponding member the first on account of he excellent sermon before-mentioned and other service and the latter on account of he truly christian and seasonable pamphlet entitle _ remark on the late decision of the house of common respect the abolition of the slave trade _ on the 23rd of April the house of common resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to consider the subject again and mr beaufoy be put into the chair mr dunda upon whom the task of introduce a bill for the gradual abolition of the slave trade now devolve rise to offer the outline of a plan for that purpose he intend he say immediately to abolish that part of the trade by which we supply foreigner with slave the other part of it be to be continue seven year from the 1st of January next he ground the necessity of its continuance till this time upon the document of the negro population in the different island in many of these slave be import but they be re-exported nearly in equal number now all these he consider to be in a state to go on without future supplies from africa jamaica and the cede island retain almost all the slave import into they this he consider as a proof that these have not attain the same desirable state and it be therefore necessary that the trade should be continue longer on this account it be he intention however to provide proper punishment while it last for abuse both in africa and in the middle passage he would take care as far as he could that none but young slave should be bring from the coast of africa he would encourage establishment there for a new species of traffic foreign nation should be invite to concur in the abolition he should propose a praedial rather than a personal service for the west indy and institution by which the slave there should be instruct in religious duty he conclude by read several resolution which he would leave to the future consideration of the house mr pitt then rise he deprecate the resolution altogether he deny also the inference which mr dundas have draw from the west indian document relative to the negro population he have look aver he own calculation from the same document again and again and he would submit they with all they datum if it should be necessary to the house mr wilberforce and mr fox hold the same language they contend also that mr dunda have now prove a thousand time more strongly than ever the necessity of immediate abolition all the resolution he have read be operative against he own reasoning the latter observe that the slave-trader be in future only to be allow to steal innocent child from they disconsolate parent after a few observation by lord sheffield mr drake colonel tarleton and mr rolle the house adjourn on the 25th of April it resume the consideration of the subject mr dunda then go over he former resolution and conclude by move that it should not be lawful to import any african negro into any british colony in ship own or navigate by british subject at any time after the 1st of January 1800 lord mornington -lrb- now marqui wellesley -rrb- rise to propose a amendment he congratulate he countryman that the slave trade have receive its death-wound this traffic be found in injustice and between right and wrong there could be no compromise africa be not to be sacrifice to the apparent good of the west indy he would not repeat those enormity out of the evidence which have make such a deep impression upon the house it have be resolve that the trade should be abolish the question then be how long they be to persevere in the crime of its continuance one have say that they might be unjust for ten year longer another only till the beginning of the next century but this diversity of opinion have proceed from a erroneous statement of mr dunda against the clear and irrefragable calculation of mr pitt the former have argue that because jamaica and the cede island have retain almost all the slave which have be import into they they be therefore not yet in a situation to support they population without further supplies from africa but the truth be that the slave so retain be keep not to maintain the population there but to clear new land now the house have determine that the trade be not to be continue for this purpose the population therefore in the island be sufficient to continue the ordinary cultivation of they he deprecate the idea that the slave trade have be so sanction by the act of former parliament that the present could make no alteration in it have not the house alter the import of foreign sugar into we island a measure which at the time affect the property of many have they not prohibit the export of provision from america to the same quarter again as to compact have the african ever be party to these it be rather curious also when king jame the second give a charter to the slave-trader that he should have give they a right to all the south of africa and authority over every person bear therein but by do this it be clear that he give they a right which he never possess himself after many other observation he conclude by move that the year 1793 be substitute in the place of the year 1800 in the course of the debate which follow mr burdon state he conviction of the necessity of immediate abolition but he would support the amendment as the shortest of the term propose mr robert thornton would support it also as the only choice leave he he dare not accede to a motion by which we be to continue for seven year to imbrue we hand in innocent blood mr ryder -lrb- now earl of harrowby -rrb- would not support the trade for one moment if he could avoid it he could not hold a balance with gold in one scale and blood in the other mr william smith expose the wickedness of restrict the trade to certain age the original motion he say would only operate as a transfer of cruelty from the aged and the guilty to the young and the innocent he entreat the house to consider whether if it related to they own child any one of they would vote for it mr windham have hitherto feel a reluctance to speak not from the abstruseness but from the simplicity of the subject but he could not longer be silent when he observe those argument of policy creep again out of they lurking-place which have flee before eloquence and truth the house have clearly give up the policy of the question they have be determine by the justice of it why be they then to be trouble again with argument of this nature these if admit would go to the subversion of all public as well as private morality nation be as much bind as individual to a system of moral though a breach in the former could not be so easily punish in private life morality take pretty good care of itself it be a kind of retail article in which the return be speedy if a man break open he neighbor 's house he would feel the consequence there be a ally of virtue who render it the interest of individual to be moral and he be call the executioner but as such punishment do not always await we in we national concern we should substitute honor as the guardian of we national conduct he hope the west indian would consider the character of the mother-country and the obligation to national as well as individual justice he hope also they would consider the suffering which they occasion both in africa in the passage and in the west indy in the passage indeed no one be capable of describe they the section of the slave-ship however make up the deficiency of language and do away all necessity of argument on this subject disease there have to struggle with the new affliction of chain and punishment at one view be the irksomeness of a goal and the misery of a hospital so that the hold of these vessel put he in mind of the region of the damned the trade he say ought immediately to be abolish on a comparison of the probable consequence of the abolition of it he see on one side only doubtful contingency but on the other shame and disgrace sir jame johnstone contend for the immediate abolition of the trade he have introduce the plough into he own plantation in the west indy and he find the land produce more sugar than when cultivate in the ordinary way by slave even for the sake of the planter he hope the abolition would not be long delay mr dunda reply : after which a division take place the number of vote in favor of the original motion be one hundred and fifty-eight and for the amendment one hundred and nine on the 27th of April the house resume the subject mr dunda move as before that the slave trade should cease in the year 1800 upon which lord mornington move that the year 1795 should be substitute for the latter period in the course of the debate which follow mr hubbard say that he have vote against the abolition when the year 1793 be propose but he think that if it be not to take place till 1795 sufficient time would be allow the planter he would support this amendment and he congratulate the house on the prospect of the final triumph of truth humanity and justice mr addington prefer the year 1796 to the year 1795 mr alderman watson consider the abolition in 1796 to be as destructive as if it be immediate a division have take place the number of vote in favor of the original motion be one hundred and sixty-one and in favor of lord mornington 's amendment for the year 1795 one hundred and twenty-one sir edward knatchbull however see that there be a disposition in the house to bring the matter to a conclusion and that a middle line would be prefer move that the year 1796 should be substitute for this year 1800 upon this the house divide again when there appear for the original motion only one hundred and thirty-two but for the amendment one hundred and fifty-one the gradual abolition have be now finally agree upon for the year 1796 a committee be name which carry the resolution to the lord on the 8th of may the lord be summon to consider it lord stormont after have speak for some time move that they should hear evidence upon it lord grenville oppose the motion on account of the delay which would arise from a examination of the witness by the house at large : but he move that such witness should be examine by a committee of the house upon this a debate ensue and afterwards a division when the original motion be carry by sixty-three against thirty-six on the 15th of may the lord meet again evidence be then order to be summon in behalf of those interested in the continuance of the trade at length it be introduce but on the 5th of June when only seven person have be examine a motion be make and carry that the further examination should be postpone to the next session chapter xxviii continuation from July 1792 to July 1793 -- author travel round the kingdom again -- motion to renew the resolution of the last year in the common motion lose -- new motion in the common to abolish the foreign slave trade motion lose -- proceedings of the lord the resolution adopt by the common that the trade should cease in 1796 be a matter of great joy to many and several in consequence of it return to the use of sugar the committee however for the abolition do not view it in the same favourable light they consider it as a political maneuver to frustrate the accomplishment of the object but the circumstance which give they the most concern be the resolution of the lord to hear evidence it be impossible now to say when the trade would cease the witness in behalf of the merchant and planter have obtain possession of the ground and they might keep it if they choose even till the year 1800 to throw light upon a measure which be to be adopt in 1796 the committee find too that they have again the laborious task before they of find out new person to give testimony in behalf of they cause for some of they former witness be dead and other be out of the kingdom and unless they replace these there would be no probability of make out that strong case in the lord which they have establish in the common it devolve therefore upon I once more to travel for this purpose : but as i be then in too weak a state to bear as much fatigue as formerly dr dickson relieve I by take one part of the tour namely that to scotland upon himself these journey we perform with considerable success during which the committee elect mr joseph townsend of baltimore in maryland a honorary and corresponding member parliament have meet mr wilberforce in February 1793 move that the house resolve itself into a committee of the whole house on Thursday next to consider of the circumstance of the slave trade this motion be oppose by sir william yonge who move that this day six month should be substitute for Thursday next a debate ensue : of this however as well as of several which follow i shall give no account as it would be tedious to the reader to hear a repetition of the same argument suffice it to say that the motion be lose by a majority of sixty-one to fifty-three this sudden refusal of the house of common to renew they own vote of the former year give great uneasiness to the friend of the cause mr wilberforce however resolve that the session should not pass without a attempt to promote it in another form and accordingly on the 14th of may he move for leave to bring in a bill to abolish that part of the slave trade by which the british merchant supply foreigner with slave this motion be oppose like the former but be carry by a majority of seven the bill be then bring in and it pass its first and second reading with little opposition but on the 5th of June notwithstanding the eloquence of mr pitt and of mr fox and the very able speech of mr franci mr courtenay and other it be lose by a majority of thirty-one to twenty-nine in the interval between these motion the question experience in the lord considerable opposition the duke of clarence move that the house should not proceed in the consideration of the slave trade till after the easter recess the earl of abingdon be still more hostile afterwards he deprecate the new philosophy it be as full of mischief as the box of pandora the doctrine of the abolition of the slave trade be a species of it and he conclude by move that all further consideration of the subject be postpone to the epithet then bestow upon the abolitionist by this nobleman the duke of clarence add those of fanatic and hypocrite among whom he include mr wilberforce by name all the other lord however who be present manifest such a dislike to the sentiment of the earl of abingdon that he withdraw he motion after this the hearing of evidence on the resolution of the house of common be resume and seven person be examine before the close of the session chapter xxix -- continuation from July 1793 to July 1794 -- author travel round the kingdom again -- motion to abolish the foreign slave trade renew in the common and carry but lose in the lord further proceedings there -- author on account of he decline health oblige to retire from the cause the committee for the abolition could not view the proceedings of both house of parliament on this subject during the year 1793 without be alarm for the fate of they question the only two source of hope which they could discover be in the disposition then manifest by the peer as to the conduct of the earl of abingdon and in they determination to proceed in the hearing of evidence the latter circumstance indeed be the more favourable as the resolution upon which the witness be to be examine have not be renew by the common these consideration however afford no solid ground for the mind to rest upon they only break in upon it like faint gleam of sunshine for a moment and then be go in this situation the committee could only console themselves by the reflection that they have do they duty in look however to they future service one thing and only one seem practicable and this be necessary namely to complete the new body of evidence which they have endeavor to form in the preceding year the determination to do this render another journey on my part indispensable and i undertake it break down as my constitution then be begin it in September 1793 and complete it in February 1794 mr wilberforce in this interval have digest he plan of operation and accordingly early in the session of 1794 he ask leave to renew he former bill to abolish that part of the trade by means of which british merchant supply foreigner with slave this request be oppose by sir william yonge but it be grant on a division of the house by a majority of sixty-three to forty vote when the bill be bring in it be oppose by the same member upon which the house divide and there appear for sir william yonge 's amendment thirty-eight vote but against it fifty-six on a motion for the recommitment of the bill lord sheffield divide the house against whose motion there be a majority of forty-two and on the third reading of it it be oppose again but it be at length carry the speaker against the bill be : sir william yonge lord sheffield colonel tarleton alderman newnham and messr payne este lechaiere cawthorae jenkinson and dent those who speak in favor of it be : messr pitt fox william smith whitbread franci burdon vaughan barham and serjeant watson and adair while the foreign slave-bill be thus pass through its stage in the common dr horsley bishop of rochester who see no end to the examination while the witness be to be examine at the bar of the house of lord move that they should be take in future before a committee above-stair dr porteus bishop of london and the lord guildford stanhope and grenville support this motion but the lord chancellor thurlow aid by the duke of clarence and by the lord mansfield hay abingdon and other negative it by a majority of twenty-eight at length the bill itself be usher into the house of lord on read it a second time it be oppose by the duke of clarence lord abingdon and other lord grenville and the bishop of rochester decline support it they allege as a reason that they conceive the introduction of it to have be improper pend the inquiry on the general subject of the slave trade this declaration bring up the lord stanhope and lauderdale who charge they with inconsistency as profess friend of the cause at length the bill be lose during these discussion the examination of the witness be resume by the lord but only two of they be hear in this session -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : after this the examination wholly drop in the house of lord -rrb- after this decision the question be in a desperate state for if the common would not renew they own resolution and the lord would not abolish the foreign part of the slave-trade what hope be there of success it be obvious too that in the former house mr pitt and mr dunda vote against each other in the latter the lord chancellor thurlow oppose every motion in favor of the cause the committee therefore be reduce to this -- either they must exert themselves without hope or they must wait till some change should take place in they favor as far as i myself be concern all exertion be then over the nervous system be almost shatter to piece both my memory and my hearing fail I sudden dizziness seize my head a confused singing in the ear follow I wherever i go on go to bed the very stair seem to dance up and down under I so that misplace my foot i sometimes fall talk too if it continue but half a hour exhaust I so that profuse perspiration follow and the same effect be produce even by a active exertion of the mind for the like time these disorder have be bring on by degree in consequence of the severe labor necessarily attach to the promotion of the cause for seven year i have a correspondence to maintain with four hundred person with my own hand i have some book or other annually to write in behalf of the cause in this time i have travel more than thirty-five thousand mile in search of evidence and a great part of these journey in the night all this time my mind have be on the stretch it have be bent too to this one subject for i have not even leisure to attend to my own concern the various instance of barbarity which have come successively to my knowledge within this period have vex harass and afflict it the wound which these have produce be render still deeper by those cruel disappointment before related which arise from the reiterate refusal of person to give they testimony after i have travel hundred of mile in quest of they but the severest stroke be that inflict by the persecution begin and pursue by person interested in the continuance of the trade of such witness as have be examine against they and whom on account of they dependent situation in life it be most easy to oppress as i have be the means of bring these forward on these occasion they naturally come to I when thus persecute as the author of they misery and they ruin from they supplication and want it would have be ungenerous and ungrateful to have flee -lrb- a -rrb- these different circumstance by act together have at length bring I into the situation just mention and i be therefore oblige though very reluctantly to be bear out of the field where i have place the great honor and glory of my life -lrb- footnote a : the late mr whitbread to whom one day in deep affliction on this account i related accidentally a circumstance of this kind generously undertake in order to make my mind easy upon the subject to make good all injury which should in future arise to individual from such persecution and he repair these at different time at a considerable expense i feel it a duty to divulge this circumstance out of respect to the memory of one of the best of man and of one whom if the history of he life be write it would appear to have be a extraordinary honor to the country to have produce -rrb- chapter xxx continuation from July 1794 to July 1799 -- various motion within this period i purpose though it may seem abrupt after the division which have hitherto be make of the contents of this volume to throw the event of the next five year into one chapter mr wilberforce and the member of the committee whose constitution have not suffer like my own be still leave and they determine to persevere in the promotion of they great object as long as they health and they faculty permit they the former accordingly in the month of February 1795 move in the house of common for leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of the slave trade this motion be then necessary if accord to the resolution of that house the slave trade be to cease in 1796 it be oppose however by sir william yonge and unfortunately lose by a majority of seventy-eight to fifty-seven in the year 1796 mr wilberforce renew he effort in the common he ask leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of the slave trade but in a limited time the motion be oppose as before but on a division there be for it ninety-three and against it only sixty-seven the bill have be bring in be oppose in its second reading but it be carry through it by a majority of sixty-four to thirty-one in a future stage it be oppose again but it triumph by a majority of seventy-six to thirty-one mr elliott be then put into the chair several clause be adopt and the first of march 1797 be fix for the abolition of the trade : but in the next stage of it after a long speech from mr dunda it be lose by a majority of seventy-four against seventy mr franci who have make a brilliant speech in the last debate consider that nothing effectual have be yet do on this great question and wish that a practical beginning might be make bring forward soon afterwards a motion relative to the improvement of the condition of the slave in the west indy this after a short debate be negative without a division mr william smith also move a address to he majesty that he would be please to give direction to lay before the house copy of the several act relative to regulation in behalf of the slave pass by the different colonial assembly since the year 1788 this motion be adopt by the house thus pass away the session of 1796 in the year 1797 while mr wilberforce be deliberate upon the best measure for the advancement of the cause mr c elli come forward with a new motion he begin by declare that he agree with the abolitionist as to they object but he differ with they as to the mode of attain it the slave trade he condemn as a cruel and pernicious system but as it have become a inveterate evil he fear it could not be do away all at once without injury to the interest of numerous individual and even to the negro themselves he conclude by move a address to he majesty humbly request that he would give direction to the governor of the west indian island to recommend it to the colonial assembly to adopt such measure as might appear to they best calculate to ameliorate the condition of the negro and thereby to remove gradually the slave trade and likewise to assure he majesty of the readiness of this house to concur in any measure to accelerate this desirable object this motion be second by mr barham it be oppose however by mr wilberforce mr pitt and other but be at length carry by a majority of ninety-nine to sixty-three in the year 1798 mr wilberforce ask leave to renew he former bill to abolish the slave trade within a limited time he be support by mr canning mr hobhouse sir robert buxton mr bouverie and other messr sewell bryan edward henniker and c elli take the opposite side of the question mr elli however observe that he have no objection to restrict the slave trade to plantation already begin in the colony and mr barham profess himself a friend to the abolition if it could be accomplish in a reasonable way on a division there appear to be for mr wilberforce 's motion eighty-three but against it eighty-seven in the year 1799 mr wilberforce undismay by these different disappointment renew he motion colonel m wood mr petrie and other among whom be mr windham and mr dunda oppose it mr pitt mr fox mr w smith sir william dolben sir r milbank mr hobhouse and mr canning support it sir r milbank contend that modification of a system fundamentally wrong ought not to be tolerate by the legislature of a free nation mr hobhouse say that nothing could be so nefarious as this traffic in blood it be unjust in its principle it be cruel in its practice : it admit of no regulation whatever the abolition of it be call for equally by morality and sound policy mr canning expose the folly of mr dunda who bad say that as parliament have in the year 1787 leave the abolition to the colonial assembly it ought not to be take out of they hand this great event he observe could only be accomplish in two way either by these assembly or by the parliament of england now the member of the assembly of jamaica have profess that they would never abolish the trade be it not therefore idle to rely upon they for the accomplishment of it he then take a very comprehensive view of the argument which have be offer in the course of the debate and be severe upon the planter in the house who he say have bring into familiar use certain expression with no other view than to throw a veil over they odious system among these be they right to import labourer but never be the word labourer so prostituted as when it be use for slave never be the word right so prostitute not even when the rights of man be talk of as when the right to trade in man 's blood be assert by the member of a enlighten assembly never be the right of import these labourer worse defend than when the antiquity of the slave trade and its foundation on the ancient act of parliament be bring forward in its support we have be caution not to lay we unhallowed hand on the ancient institution of the slave trade nor to subvert a fabric raise by the wisdom of we ancestor and consecrate by a lapse of age but on what principle do we usually respect the institution of antiquity we respect they when we see some shadow of depart worth and usefulness or some memorial of what have be creditable to mankind but be this the case with the slave trade have it begin in principle of justice or national honor which the change of the world alone have impair have it to plead former service and glory in behalf of its present disgrace in look at it we see nothing but crime and suffering from the beginning -- nothing but what wound and convulse we feeling -- nothing but what excited indignation and horror it have not even to plead what could often be say in favor of the most unjustifiable war though conquest have sometimes originate in ambition and in the worst of motive yet the conqueror and the conquer be sometimes blended afterwards into one people so that a system of common interest arise out of former difference but where be the analogy of the ease be it only at the outset that we could trace violence and injustice on the part of the slave trade be the oppressor and the oppress so reconcile that enmity ultimately cease no be it reasonable then to urge a prescriptive right not to the fruit of a ancient and forget evil but to a series of new violence to a chain of fresh enormity to cruelty continually repeat and of which every instance inflict a fresh calamity and constitute a separate and substantial crime the debate be over the house divide when it appear that there be for mr wilberforce 's motion seventy-four but against it eighty-two the motion for the general abolition of the slave trade have be thus lose again in the common a new motion be make there soon after by mr henry thornton on the same subject the prosecution of this traffic on certain part of the coast of africa have become so injurious to the new settlement at sierra leone that not only its commercial prospects be but its safety endanger mr thornton therefore bring in a bill to confine the slave trade within certain limit but even this bill though it have for its object only to free a portion of the coast from the ravages of this traffic be oppose by mr gascoyne dent and other petition also be present against it at length after two division on the first of which there be thirty-two vote to twenty-seven and on the second thirty-eight to twenty-two it pass through all its stage when it be introduce into the lord the petition be renew against it delay also be interpose to its progress by the examination of witness it be not till the fifth of July that the matter be bring to issue the opponent of the bill at that time be the duke of clarence lord westmoreland lord thurlow and the lord dougla and hay the two latter be earl of morton and kinnoul in scotland the supporter of it be lord grenville who introduce it lord loughborough lord holland and dr horsley bishop of rochester : the latter be peculiarly eloquent he begin he speech by arraign the injustice and impolicy of the trade : -- injustice he say which no consideration of policy could extenuate impolicy equal in degree to its injustice he well know that the advocate for the slave trade have endeavor to represent the project for abolition as a branch of jacobinism but they who support it proceed upon no visionary motive of equality or of the imprescriptible rights of man they strenuously uphold the gradation of civil society : but they do indeed affirm that these gradation be both way both as they ascend and as they descend limited there be a existence of power to which no good king would aspire and there be a extreme condition of subjection to which man could not be degrade without injustice and this they would maintain be the condition of the african who be tear away into slavery he then explain the limit of that portion of africa which the bill intend to set apart as sacred to peace and liberty he show that this be but one-third of the coast and therefore that two-third be yet leave for the diabolical speculation of the slave merchant he express he surprise that such witness as those against the bill should have be introduce at all : he affirm that they oath be falsify by they own log-book and that from they own account the very healthiest of they vessel be little better than pestilential gaol mr robert hume one of these witness have make a certain voyage : he have make it in thirty-three day : he have ship two hundred and sixty-five slave and he have lose twenty-three of they if he have go on lose he slave all of whom be under twenty-five year of age at this rate it be obvious that he would have lose two hundred and fifty-three of they if he passage have last for a year now in london only seventeen would have die of that age out of one thousand within the latter period after have expose the other voyage of mr hume in a similar manner he enter into a commendation of the view of the sierra leone company and then defend the character of the african in they own country as exhibit in the travels of mr mungo park he make a judicious discrimination with respect to slavery as it exist among they : he show that this slavery be analogous to that of the heroic and patriarchal age and contrast it with the west indian in a able manner he advert lastly to what have fall from the learn counsel who have support the petition of the slave-merchant one of they have put this question to they lordship if the slave trade be as wicked as it have be represent why be there no prohibition of it in the holy scripture he then enter into a full defense of the scripture on this ground which he conclude by declare that as st paul have couple men-stealer with murderer he have condemn the slave trade in one of its most productive mode and generally in all its mode and here it be worthy of remark that the word use by the apostle on this occasion and which have be translate men-stealer should have be render slave trader this be obvious from the scholiast of aristophane whom he quote it be clear therefore that the slave trade if murder be forbid have be literally forbid also the learn counsel too have admonish they lordship to beware how they adopt the visionary project of fanatic he do not know in what direction this shaft be shoot and he care not it do not concern he with the highest reverence for the religion of the land with the firmest conviction of its truth and with the deepest sense of the importance of its doctrine he be proudly conscious that the general shape and fashion of he life bear nothing of the stamp of fanaticism but he beg leave in he turn to address a word of serious exhortation to they lordship he exhort they to beware how they be persuade to bury under the opprobrious name of fanaticism the regard which they owe to the great duty of mercy and justice for the neglect of which -lrb- if they should neglect they -rrb- they would be answerable at that tribunal where no prevarication of witness could misinform the judge and where no subtlety of a advocate miscal the name of thing put evil for good and good for evil could mislead he judgment at length the debate end : when the bill be lose by a majority of sixty-eight to sixty-one include personal vote and proxy i can not conclude this chapter without offer a few remark and first i may observe as the substance of the debate have not be give for the period which it contain that mr wilberforce upon whom too much praise can not be bestow for he perseverance from year to year amidst the disheartening circumstance which attend he effort bring every new argument to which either the discovery of new light or the event of the time produce i may observe also in justice to the memory of mr pitt and mr fox that there be no debate within this period in which they do not take a part and in which they do not irradiate other from the profusion of they own light and thirdly that in consequence of the effort of the three conjoin with those of other the great cause of the abolition be secretly gain ground many member who be not connect with the trade but who have yet hitherto support it be on the point of conversion though the question have oscillate backwards and forwards so that a ordinary spectator could have discover no gleam of hope at these time nothing be more certain than that the powerful eloquence then display have smooth the resistance to it have shorten its vibration and have prepare it for a state of rest with respect to the west-indians themselves some of they begin to see through the mist of prejudice which have cover they in the year 1794 when the bill for the abolition of the foreign slave trade be introduce mr vaughan and mr barham support it they call upon the planter in the house to give way to humanity where they own interest could not be affect by they submission this indeed may be say to have be no mighty thing but it be a frank confession of the injustice of the slave trade and the beginning of the change which follow both with respect to themselves and other with respect to the old friend of the cause it be with regret i mention that it lose the support of mr windham within this period and this regret be increase by the consideration that he go off on the avowed plea of expediency against moral rectitude a doctrine which at least upon this subject he have reprobate for ten year it be however some consolation as far as talent be concern -lrb- for there can be none for the loss of virtuous feeling -rrb- that mr canning a new member should have so ably supply he place of the gradual abolitionist whom we have always consider as the most dangerous enemy of the cause mr jenkinson -lrb- afterwards earl of liverpool -rrb- mr addington -lrb- subsequently lord sidmouth -rrb- and mr dunda -lrb- afterwards lord melville -rrb- continue they opposition during all this time of the first two i shall say nothing at present but i can not pass over the conduct of the latter he be the first person as we have see to propose the gradual abolition of the slave trade and he fix a time for its cessation on the 1st of January 1800 he sincerity on this occasion be doubt by mr fox at the very outset for he immediately rise and say that something so mischievous have come out something so like a foundation have be lay for preserve not only for year to come but for anything he know for ever this detestable traffic that he feel it he duty immediately to deprecate all such delusion upon the country mr pitt who speak soon afterwards in reply to a argument advance by mr dunda maintain that at whatever period the house should say that the slave trade should actually cease this defense would equally be set up for it would be just as good a argument in seventy year hence as it be against the abolition then and these remark mr dunda verify in a singular manner within this period : for in the year 1796 when he own bill as amend in the common be to take place he be one of the most strenuous opposer of it and in the year 1799 when in point of consistency it devolve upon he to propose it to the house in order that the trade might cease on the 1st of January 1800 -lrb- which be the time of he own original choice or a time unfettered by parliamentary amendment -rrb- he be the chief instrument of throw out mr wilberforce 's bill which promise even a longer period to its continuance : so that it be obvious that there be no time within he own limit when the abolition would have suit he notwithstanding he profession that he have always be a warm advocate for the measure chapter xxxi continuation from July 1799 to July 1805 -- various motion within this period the question have now be bring forward in almost every possible way and yet have be eventually lose the total and immediate abolition have be attempt and then the gradual the gradual again have be try for the year 1798 then for 1795 and then for 1796 at which period it be decree but never allow to be execute a abolition of a part of the trade as it related to the supply of foreigner with slave be the next measure propose and when this fail the abolition of another part of it as it related to the making of a certain portion of the coast of africa sacred to liberty be attempt but this fail also mr wilberforce therefore think it prudent not to press the abolition as a mere annual measure but to allow member time to digest the eloquence which have be bestow upon it for the last five year and to wait till some new circumstance should favor its introduction accordingly he allow the year 180018011802 and 1803 to pass over without any further parliamentary notice than the move for certain papers during which he take a opportunity of assure the house that he have not grow cool in the cause but that he would agitate it in a future session in the year 1804 which be fix upon for renew exertion the committee for the abolition of the slave trade elect jame stephen zachary macaulay henry brougham esqr and william phillip into they own body four other member also robert grant and john thornton esqr and william manser and william allen be afterwards add to the list among the reason for fix upon this year one may be assign namely that the irish member in consequence of the union which have take place between the two country have then all take they seat in the house of common and that most of they be friendly to the cause this be the situation of thing mr wilberforce on the 30th of march ask leave to renew he bill for the abolition of the slave trade within a limited time mr fuller oppose the motion a debate ensue colonel tarleton mr devayne mr addington and mr manning speak against it however notwithstanding he connection with the west indy say he would support it if a indemnification be offer to the planter in case any actual loss should accompany the measure sir william geary question the propriety of immediate abolition sir robert buxton mr pitt mr fox and mr barbara speak in favor of the motion mr william smith rise when the latter have seat himself and compliment he on this change of sentiment so honorable to he inasmuch as he have espouse the cause of humanity against he supposed interest as a planter mr leigh say that he would not tolerate such a traffic for a moment all the feeling of nature revolt at it lord de blaquiere observe it be the first time the question have be propose to irishmen as legislator he believe it would be support by most of they as to the people of ireland he could pledge himself that they be hostile to this barbarous traffic a amendment have be propose by mr man a division take place upon it when leave be give to bring in the bill by a majority of one hundred and twenty-four to forty-nine on the 7th of June when the second reading of the bill be move it be oppose by sir w yonge dr laurence mr c brook mr dent and other among these lord castlereagh profess himself a friend to the abolition of the trade but he differ as to the mode sir j wrottesley approve of the principle of the bill but would oppose it in some of its detail mr windham allow the justice but differ as to the expediency of the measure mr deverell profess himself to have be a friend to it but he have then change he mind sir laurence parson wish to see a plan for the gradual extinction of the trade lord temple affirm that the bill would seal the death-warrant of every white inhabitant of the island the second reading be support by sir ralph milbank messr pitt fox william smith whitbread franci barham and grenfell and sir john newport mr grenfell observe that he could not give a silent vote when the character of the country be concern when the question of the abolition first come before the public he be a warm friend to it and from that day to this he have cherish the same feeling he assure mr wilberforce of he constant support sir john newport state that the irish nation take a virtuous interest in this noble cause he ridicule the idea that the trade and manufacture of the country would suffer by the measure in contemplation but even if they should suffer he would oppose it fiat justitium ruat coelura upon a division there appear for the second reading one hundred and against it forty-two on the 12th of June when a motion be make to go into a committee upon the bill it be oppose by messr fuller c brook c elli dent deverell and manning : and it be support by sir robert buxton mr barham and the hon j cock the latter condemn the imprudence of the planter instead of profit by the discussion which have take place and make wise provision against the great event of the abolition which would sooner or later take place they have only think of new stratagem to defeat it he declare he abhorrence of the trade which he consider to be a national disgrace the house divide : when there be seventy-nine for the motion and against it twenty on the 27th of June the bill be oppose in its last stage by sir w young messr dickenson mr rise addington and dent and support by : messr pitt w smith franci and barham when it be carry by a majority of sixty-nine to thirty-six it be then take up to the lord but on a motion of lord hawkesbury then a member of that house the discussion of it be postpone to the next year the session be end the committee for the abolition of the slave trade increase its number by the election of the right honorable lord teignmouth dr dickson and wilson birkbeek as member in the year 1805 mr wilberforce renew he motion of the former year colonel tarleton sir william yonge mr puller and mr gascoyne oppose it leave however be give he to introduce he bill on the second reading of it a serious opposition take place and a amendment be move for postpone it till that day six month the amendment be oppose by mr fox and mr huddlestone the latter could not help lift he voice against this monstrous traffic in the sinew and blood of man the toleration of which have so long be the disgrace of the british legislature he do not charge the enormous guilt result from it upon the nation at large for the nation have wash its hand of it by the numerous petition it have send against it and it have since be a matter of astonishment to all christendom how the constitutional guardian of british freedom should have sanction elsewhere the greatest system of cruelty and oppression in the world he say that a curse attend this trade even in the mode of defend it by a certain fatality none but the vilest argument be bring forward which corrupt the very person who use they every one of these be build on the narrow ground of interest -- of pecuniary profit -- of sordid gain -- in opposition to every high consideration -- to every motive that have reference to humanity justice and religion -- or to that great principle which comprehend they all place only before the most determine advocate of this odious traffic the exact image of himself in the garb and harness of a slave drag and whip about like a beast place this image also before he and paint it as that of one without a ray of hope to cheer he and you would extort from he the reluctant confession that he would not endure for a hour the misery to which he condemn he fellow-man for life how dare he then to use this selfish plea of interest against the voice of the generous sympathy of he nature but even upon this narrow ground the advocate for the traffic have be defeat if the unhallowed argument of expediency be worth anything when oppose to moral rectitude or if it be to supercede precept of christianity where be a man to stop on what be he to draw for anything he know it might be physically true that human blood be the best manure for the land but who ought to shed it on that account true expediency however be where it ever would be find on the side of that system which be most merciful and just he ask how it happen that sugar could be import cheaper from the east indy than from the west notwithstanding the vast difference of the length of the voyage but on account of the impolicy of slavery or that it be make in the former case by the industry of free man and in the latter by the languid drudgery of slave as he have have occasion to advert to the eastern part of the world he would make a observation upon a argument which have be collect from that quarter the condition of the negro in the west indy have be lately compare with that of the hindoo but he would observe that the hindoo miserable as he hovel be have source of pride and happiness to which not only the west indian slave but even he master be a stranger he be to be sure a peasant and he industry be subservient to the gratification of a european lord but he be in he own belief vastly superior to he he view he as one of the lowest cast he would not on any consideration eat from the same plate he would not suffer he son to marry the daughter of he master even if she could bring he all the west indy as she portion he would observe too that the hindoo peasant drink he water from he native well that if he meal be scanty he receive it from the hand of she who be most dear to he that when he labor he labor for she and he offspring he daily task be finish he repose with he family no retrospect of the happiness of former day compare with exist misery disturb he slumber nor horrid dream occasion he to wake in agony at the dawn of day no barbarous sound of crack whip remind he that with the form and image of a man he destiny be that of the beast of the field let the advocate for the bloody traffic state what they have to set off on they side of the question against the comfort and independence of the man with whom they compare the slave the amendment be support by sir william yonge sir william pulteney colonel tarleton messr gascoyne c brook and hiley addington on divide the house upon it there appear for it seventy-seven but against it only seventy this loss of the question after it have be carry in the last year by so great a majority be quite unexpected be a matter of severe disappointment and might have discourage the friend of the cause in this infancy of they renew effort if they have not discover the reason of its failure after due consideration it appear that no fewer than nine member who have never be absent once in sixteen year when it be agitate give way to engagement on the day of the motion from a belief that it be safe it appear also that out of the great number of irish member who support it in the former year only nine be in the house when it be lose it appear also that previously to this event a canvass more importunate than have hear of on any former occasion have be make among the latter by those interested in the continuance of the trade many of these unacquainted with the detail of the subject like the english member admit the dismal representation which be then make to they the desire of do good on the one hand and the fear of do injury on the other perplexed they and in this dubious state they absent themselves at the time mention the cause of the failure have be find accidental and capable of a remedy it be resolve that a attempt should be make immediately in the house in a new form lord henry petty signify he intention of bring in a bill for the abolition of the foreign part of the slave trade but the impeachment of lord melville and other weighty matter come on the notice be not act upon in that session chapter xxxii -- continuation from July 1805 to July 1806 -- author return to he duty in the committee -- travel again round the kingdom -- death of mr pitt -- he character as it related to the question -- motion for the abolition of the foreign slave-trade -- resolution to take measure for the total abolition of it -- address to the king to negotiate with foreign power for they concurrence in it -- motion to prevent any new vessel go into the trade -- these carry through both house of parliament it be now almost certain to the inexpressible joy of the committee that the cause with proper vigilance could be carry in the next session in the house of common it become they therefore to prepare to support it in advert to measure for this purpose it occur to they that the house of lord if the question should be then carry to they from the common might insist upon hearing evidence on the general subject but alas even the body of witness which have be last collect be break by death or dispersion it be therefore to be form again in this situation it devolve upon I as i have now return to the committee after a absence of nine year to take another journey for this purpose this journey i perform with extraordinary success in the course of it i have also much satisfaction on another account i find the old friend of the cause still faithful to it it be remarkable however that the youth of the rise generation know but little about the question for the last eight or nine year the committee have not circulate any book and the debate in the common during that time have not furnish they with the means of a adequate knowledge concern it when however i converse with these as i travel along i discover a profound attention to what i say a earnest desire to know more of the subject and a generous warmth in favor of the injured african which i foresaw could soon be turn into enthusiasm hence i perceive that the cause furnish we with endless source of rally : and that the ardor which we have see with so much admiration in former year could be easily renew i have scarcely finish my journey when mr pitt die this event take place in January 1806 i shall stop therefore to make a few observation upon he character as it related to this cause this i feel myself bind in justice to do because he sincerity towards it have be generally question the way in which mr pitt become acquaint with this question have already be explain a few doubt have be remove when it be first start he profess himself a friend to the abolition the first proof which he give of he friendship to it be know but to few but it be nevertheless true that so early as in 1788 he occasion a communication to be make to the french government in which he recommend a union of the two country for the promotion of the great measure this proposition seem to be then new and strange to the court of france and the answer be not favourable from this time he effort be reduce within the boundary of he own power as far however as he have scope he exert they if we look at he in he parliamentary capacity it must be acknowledge by all that he take a active strenuous and consistent part and this year after year by which he realize he profession in my own private communication with he which be frequent he never fail to give proof of a similar disposition i have always free access to he i have no previous note or letter to write for admission whatever papers i want he order he exhibit also in he conversation with I on these occasion mark of a more than ordinary interest in the welfare of the cause among the subject which be then start there be one which be always near he heart this be the civilization of africa he look upon this great work as a debt due to that continent for the many injury we have inflict upon it : and have the abolition succeed sooner as in the infancy of he exertion he have hope i know he have a plan suit no doubt to the capaciousness of he own mind for such establishment in africa as he conceive would promote in due time this important end i believe it will be say notwithstanding what i have advance that if mr pitt have exert himself as the minister of this country in behalf of the abolition he could have carry it this bring the matter to a issue for unquestionably the charge of insincerity as it related to this great question arise from the mistaken notion that as he measure in parliament be support by great majority he could do as he please there but they who hold this opinion must be inform that there be great difficulty against which he have to struggle on this subject the lord chancellor thurlow run counter to he wish almost at the very outset lord liverpool and mr dunda do the same thus to go no further three of the most powerful member of the cabinet be in direct opposition to he the abolition then amidst this difference of opinion could never become a cabinet measure but if so then all he parliamentary effort in this case want they usual authority and he could only exert he influence as a private man -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : this he do with great effect on one or two occasion on the motion of mr cawthorne in 1791 the cause hang as it be by a thread and would have fail that day to my knowledge but for he seasonable exertion -rrb- but a difficulty still more insuperable present itself in a occurrence which take place in the year 1791 but which be much too delicate to be mention the explanation of it however would convince the reader that all the effort of mr pitt from that day be render useless i mean as to bring the question as a minister of state to a favourable issue but though mr pitt do not carry this great question he be yet one of the greatest supporter of it he foster it in its infancy if in he public situation he have then set he face against it where would have be we hope he uphold it also in its childhood and though in this state of its existence it do not gain from he protection all the strength which it be expect it would have acquire he yet keep it from fall till he successor in whose administration a greater number of favourable circumstance concur to give it vigor bring it to triumphant maturity lord grenville and mr fox have be call to the head of the executive government on the death of mr pitt the cause be usher into parliament under new auspices in a former year he majesty have issue a proclamation by which british merchant be forbid -lrb- with certain define exception -rrb- to import slave into the colony which have be conquer by the british arm in the course of the war this circumstance afford a opportunity of try the question in the house of common with the greatest hope of success accordingly sir a pigott the attorney-general as a officer of the crown bring in a bill on the thirty-first of march 1806 the first object of which be to give effect to the proclamation now mention the second be to prohibit british subject from be engage in import slave into the colony of any foreign power whether hostile or neutral and the third be to prohibit british subject and british capital from be employ in carry on the slave trade in foreign ship and also to prevent the outfit of foreign ship from british port sir a pigott on the introduction of this bill make a appropriate speech the bill be support by mr fox sir william yonge mr brook and mr bagwell but oppose by general tarleton and gascoyne mr rise sir robert peel and sir charle price on the third read a division be call for there appear for it thirty-five and against it only thirteen on the 7th of may it be introduce into the lord the supporter of it there be the duke of gloucester lord grenville the bishop of london and st asaph the earl of buckinghamshire and the lord holland lauderdale auckland sidmouth and ellenborough the opposer be the duke of clarence and sussex the marquis of sligo the earl of westmoreland and the lord eldon and sheffield at length a division take place when there appear to be in favor of it thirty-three and against it eighteen during the discussion to which this bill give birth lord grenville and mr fox declare in substance in they respective house of parliament that they feel the question of the slave trade to be one which involve the dearest interest of humanity and the most urgent claim of policy justice and religion and that should they succeed in affect its abolition they would regard that success as entail more true glory on they administration and more honor and advantage on they country than any other measure in which they could he engage the bill have pass -lrb- the first which dismember this cruel trade -rrb- it be think proper to follow it up in a prudent manner and as there be not then time in the advanced period of the session to bring in another for the total extinction of it to move a resolution by which both house should record those principle on which the propriety of the latter measure be found it be judge also expedient that mr fox as the prime minister in the house of common should introduce it there on the 10th of June mr fox rise he begin by say that the motion with which he should conclude would tend in its consequence to effect the total abolition of the slave trade and he confess that since he have sit in that house -lrb- a period of between thirty and forty year -rrb- if he have do nothing else but have only be instrumental in carry through this measure he should think he life well spend and should retire quite satisfied that he have not live in vain in advert to the principle of the trade he notice some strong expression of mr burke concern it to deal in human flesh and blood say that great man or to deal not in the labor of man but in man themselves be to devour the root instead of enjoy the fruit of human diligence mr fox then take a view of the opinion of different member of the house on this great question and show that though many have oppose the abolition all but two or three among whom be the member for liverpool have confess that the trade ought to be do away he then go over the different resolution of the house on the subject and conclude from thence that they be bind to support he motion he combate the argument that the abolition would ruin the west indian island in do this he pay a handsome compliment to the memory of mr pitt whose speech upon this particular point be he say the most powerful and convincing of any he have ever hear indeed they who have not hear it could have no notion of it it be a speech of which he would say with the roman author recite the word of the athenian orator quid esset si ipsum audivissetis it be a speech no less remarkable for splendid eloquence than for solid sense and convincing reason support by calculation found on fact and conclusion draw from premise as correctly as if they have be mathematical proposition all tend to prove that instead of the west indian plantation suffer a injury they would derive a material benefit by the abolition of the slave trade he then call upon the friend of this great man to show they respect for he memory by they vote and he conclude with move that this house consider the african slave trade to be contrary to the principle of justice humanity and policy will with all practicable expedition take effectual measure for the abolition of the say trade in such a manner and at such a period as may be deem advisable sir ralph milbank rise and second the motion general tarleton rise next he deprecate the abolition on account of the effect which it would have on the trade and revenue of the country mr franci say the merchant of liverpool be at liberty to ask for compensation but he for one would never grant it for the loss of a trade which have be declare to be contrary to humanity and justice as a uniform friend to this great cause he wish mr fox have not introduce a resolution but a real bill for the abolition of the slave trade he believe that both house be then dispose to do it away he wish the golden opportunity might not be lose lord castlereagh think it a proposition on which no one could entertain a doubt that the slave trade be a great evil in itself and that it be the duty and policy of parliament to extirpate it but he do not think the means offer be adequate to the end propose the abolition as a political question be a difficult one the year 1796 have be once fix upon by the house as the period when the trade be to cease but when the time arrive the resolution be not execute this be a proof either that the house do not wish for the event or that they judge it impracticable it would be impossible he say to get other nation to concur in the measure and even if they be to concur it could not be effect we might restrain the subject of the parent-state from follow the trade but we could not those in we colony a hundred fraud would be commit by these which we could not detect he do not mean by this that the evil be to go on for ever have a wise plan be propose at first it might have be half-cured by this time the present resolution would do no good it be vague indefinite and unintelligible such resolution be only the slave-merchant ' harvest they would go for more slave than usual in the interim he should have advise a system of duty on fresh importation of slave progressively increase to a certain extent and that the amount of these duty should be give to the planter as a bounty to encourage the negro population upon they estate nothing could be do unless we go hand in hand with the latter but he should deliver himself more fully on this subject when any thing specific should be bring forward in the shape of a bill sir s romilly the solicitor-general differ from lord castlereagh for he think the resolution of mr fox be very simple and intelligible if there be a proposition vague and indefinite it be that advance by the noble lord of a system of duty on fresh importation rise progressively and this under the patronage and co-operation of the planter who could measure the space between the present time and the abolition of the trade if that measure be to depend upon the approbation of the colony the cruelty and injustice of the slave trade have be establish by evidence beyond a doubt it have be show to be carry on by rapine robbery and murder by foment and encourage war by false accusation and imaginary crime the unhappy victim be tear away not only in the time of war but of profound peace they be then carry across the atlantic in a manner too horrible to describe and afterwards subject to eternal slavery in support of the continuance of such a traffic he know of nothing but assertion already disprove and argument already refute since the year 1796 when it be to cease by a resolution of parliament no less than three hundred and sixty thousand african have be tear away from they native land what a accumulation be this to we former guilt general gascoyne make two extraordinary assertion : first that the trade be defensible on scriptural ground -- both thy bondman and thy bondmaid which thou shalt have shall be of the heathen that be round about thee of they shall you have bondmen and bondmaid and thou shalt take they as a heritance for thy child after thee to inherit they for a possession they shall be thy bondman for ever secondly that the trade have be so advantageous to this country that it would have be advisable even to institute a new one if the old have not exist mr wilberforce reply to general gascoyne he then take a view of the speech of lord castlereagh which he answer point by point in the course of he observation he show that the system of duty progressively increase as propose by the noble lord would be one of the most effectual mode of perpetuate the slave trade he expose also the false foundation of the hope of any reliance on the co-operation of the colonist the house he say have on the motion of mr elli in the year 1797 pray he majesty to consult with the colonial legislature to take such measure as might conduce to the gradual abolition of the african slave trade this address be transmit to they by lord melville it be receive in some of the island with a declaration that they possibly might in some instance endeavor to improve the condition of they slave but they should do this not with any view to the abolition of the slave trade for they consider that trade as they birth-right which could not be take from they and that we should deceive ourselves by suppose that they would agree to such a measure he desire to add to this the declaration of general prevost in he public letter from dominica do he not say when ask what step have be take there in consequence of the resolution of the house in 1797 that the act of the legislature entitle a act for the encouragement protection and better government of slave appear to he to have be consider from the day it be pass until this hour as a political measure to avert the interference of the mother country in the management of the slave sir william yonge censure the harsh language of sir samuel romilly who have apply the term rapine robbery and murder to those who be connect with the slave trade he consider the resolution of mr fox as a prelude to a bill for the abolition of that traffic and this bill as a prelude to emancipation which would not only be dangerous in itself but would change the state of property in the island lord henry petty after have comment on the speech of sir samuel romilly and lord castlereagh proceed to state he own opinion on the trade which be that it be contrary to justice humanity and sound policy all of which he consider to be inseparable on its commencement in africa the wickedness begin it produce there fraud and violence robbery and murder it give birth to false accusation and a mockery of justice it be the parent of every crime which could at once degrade and afflict the human race after spread vice and misery all over this continent it doom its unhappy victim to hardship and cruelty which be worse than death the first of these be conspicuous in they transportation it be find there that cruelty begat cruelty that the system wicked in its beginning be equally so in its progress and that it perpetuate its misery wherever it be carry on nor be it baneful only to the object but to the promoter of it the loss of british seaman in this traffic be enormous one-fifth of all who be employ in it perish that be they become the victim of a system which be found on fraud robbery and murder and which procure to the british nation nothing but the execration of mankind nor have we yet do with the evil which attend it for it bring in its train the worst of all moral effect not only as it respect the poor slave when transport to the colony but as it respect those who have concern with they there the arbitrary power which it confer afford man of bad disposition full scope for the exercise of they passion and it render man constitutionally of good disposition callous to the misery of other thus it deprave the nature of all who be connect with it these consideration have make he a friend to the abolition from the time he be capable of reasoning upon it they be consideration also which determine the house in the year 1782 to adopt a measure of the same kind as the present have anything happen to change the opinion of member since on the contrary they have now the clearest evidence that all the argument then use against the abolition be fallacious be found not upon truth but on assertion devoid of all truth and derive from ignorance or prejudice have make these remark he prove by a number of fact the folly of the argument that the african labor under such a total degradation of mental and moral faculty that they be make for slavery he then enter into the great subject of population he show that in all country where there be no unnatural hardship mankind would support themselves he apply this reasoning to the negro population in the west indy which he maintain could not only be keep up but increase without any further importation from africa he then notice the observation of sir william yonge on the word of sir samuel romilly and desire he to reserve he indignation for those who be guilty of act of rapine robbery and murder instead of vent it on those who only do they duty in describe they never be account more shocking than those lately send to government from the west indy lord seaforth and the attorney-general could not refrain in explain they from the use of the word murder and torture and do it become member of that house -lrb- in order to accommodate the nerve of the friend of the slave trade -rrb- to soften down they expression when they be speak on that subject and to desist from call that murder and torture for which a governor and the attorney-general of one of the island could find no better name after make observation relative to the co-operation of foreign power in this great work he hope that the house would not suffer itself to be draw either by opposition or by ridicule to the right or to the left but that it would advance straight forward to the accomplishment of the most magnanimous act of justice that be ever achieve by any legislature in the world mr rise declare that on the very first promulgation of this question he have propose to the friend of it the very plan of he noble friend lord castlereagh namely a system of progressive duty and of bounty for the promotion of the negro population this he say to show that he be friendly to the principle of the measure he would now observe that he do not wholly like the present resolution it be too indefinite he wish also that something have be say on the subject of compensation he be fearful also lest the abolition should lead to the dangerous change of emancipation the negro he say could not be in a better state or more faithful to they master than they be in three attack make by the enemy on dominica where he have a large property arm have be put into they hand and every one of they have exert himself faithfully with respect to the cruel act in barbado a account of which have be send to government by lord seaforth and the attorney-general of barbado he have read they and never have he read anything on this subject with more horror he would agree to the strongest measure for the prevention of such act in future he would even give up the colony which should refuse to make the wilful murder of a slave felony but as to the other or common evil complain of he think the remedy should be gradual and such also as the planter would concur in he would nevertheless not oppose the present resolution mr barham consider compensation but reasonable where loss be to accrue from the measure when it should be put in execution but he believe that the amount of it would be much less than be apprehend he consider emancipation though so many fear have be express about it as form no objection to the abolition though he have estate in the west indy himself such a measure if it could be accomplish successfully would be a honor to the country and a blessing to the planter but preparation must be make for it by render the slave fit for freedom and by create in they a inclination to free labor such a change could only be the work of time sir john newport say that the expression of sir s romilly which have give such offence have be use by other and would be use with propriety while the trade last some slave-dealer of liverpool have lately attempt to prejudice certain merchant of ireland in they favor but none of they representation answer and it be remarkable that the reply make to they be in these word we will have no share in a traffic consist in rapine blood and murder he then take a survey of a system of duty progressively increase and show that it would be utterly inefficient and that there be no real remedy for the different evil complain of but in the immediate prohibition of the trade mr canning renew he profession of friendship to the cause he do not like the present resolution yet he would vote for it he should have be better pleased with a bill which would strike at once at the root of this detestable commerce mr man wish the question to be defer to the next session he hope compensation would then be bring forward as connect with it nothing however effectual could be do without the concurrence of the planter mr william smith notice in a striking manner the different inconsistency in the argument of those who contend for the continuance of the trade mr windham deprecate not only the slave trade but slavery also they be essentially connect with each other they be both evil and ought both of they to be do away indeed if emancipation would follow the abolition he should like the latter measure the better rapine robbery and murder be the true characteristic of this traffic the same epithet have not indeed be apply to slavery because this be a condition in which some part of the human race have be at every period of the history of the world it be however a state which ought not to be allow to exist but notwithstanding all these confession he should weigh well the consequence of the abolition before he give it he support it would be on a balance between the evil themselves and the consequence of remove they that he should decide for himself on this question mr fox take a view of all the argument which have be advance by the opponent of the abolition and have give a appropriate answer to each the house divide when there appear for the resolution one hundred and fourteen and against it but fifteen immediately after this division mr wilberforce move a address to he majesty pray that he would be graciously pleased to direct a negotiation to be enter into by which foreign power should be invite to co-operate with he majesty in measure to be adopt for the abolition of the african slave trade this address be carry without a division it be also move and carry that these resolution be communicate to the lord and that they concurrence should be desire therein on the 24th of June the lord meet to consider of the resolution and address the earl of westmoreland propose that both counsel and evidence should be hear against they but he proposition be overrule lord grenville then read the resolution of the common this resolution he say state first that the slave trade be contrary to humanity justice and sound policy that it be contrary to humanity be obvious for humanity might be say to be sympathy for the distress of other or a desire to accomplish benevolent end by good means but do not the slave trade convey idea the very reverse of this definition it deprive man of all those comfort in which it please the creator to make the happiness of he creature to consist -- of the blessing of society -- of the charity of the dear relationship of husband wife father son and kindred -- of the due discharge of the relative duty of these -- and of that freedom which in its pure and natural sense be one of the greatest gift of god to man it be impossible to read the evidence as it related to this trade without acknowledge the inhumanity of it and we own disgrace by what mean be it keep up in africa by war instigate not by the passion of the native but by we avarice he know it would be say in reply to this that the slave who be purchase by we would be put to death if we be not to buy they but what should we say if it should turn out that we be the cause of those very cruelty which we affect to prevent but if it be not so ought the first nation in the world to condescend to be the executioner of savage another way of keep up the slave trade be by the practice of man-steal the evidence be particularly clear upon this head this practice include violence and often bloodsh the inhumanity of it therefore could not be doubt the unhappy victim be thus procure be convey he say across the atlantic in a manner which justify the charge of inhumanity again indeed the suffering here be so great that neither the mind could conceive nor the tongue describe it he have say on a former occasion that in they transportation there be a greater portion of misery condensed within a smaller space than have ever exist in the known world he would repeat he word for he do not know how he could express himself better on the subject and after all these horror what be they destiny it be such as justified the charge in the resolution again : for after have survive the sickness arise from the passage they be doom to interminable slavery we have be he say so much accustomed to word descriptive of the cruelty of this traffic that we have almost forget they meaning he wish that some person educate as a englishman with suitable power of eloquence but now for the first time inform of all the horror of it be to address they lordship upon it and he be sure that they would instantly determine that it should cease but the continuance of it have render cruelty familiar to we and the recital of its horror have be so frequent that we could now hear they state without be affect as we ought to be he intreat they lordship however to endeavor to conceive the hard case of the unhappy victim of it and as he have lead they to the last stage of they miserable existence which be in the colony to contemplate it there they be there under the arbitrary will of a cruel task-master from morning till night when they go to rest would not they dream be frightful when they awake would they not awake -- -- only to discover sight of woe region of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never come that come to all but torture without end still urge -- they know no change except in the humor of they master to whom they whole destiny be entrust we might perhaps flatter ourselves with say that they be subject to the will of englishman but englishman be not better than other when in possession of arbitrary power the very fairest exercise of it be a never-failing corrupter of the heart but suppose it be allow that self-interest might operate some little against cruelty yet where be the interest of the overseer or the driver but he know it would be say that the evil complain of in the colony have be mitigate there might be instance of this but they could never be cure while slavery exist slavery take away more than half of the human character hence the practice where it exist of reject the testimony of the slave : but if this testimony be reject where could be he redress against he oppressor have show the inhumanity he would proceed to the second point in the resolution or the injustice of the trade we have two idea of justice first as it belong to society by virtue of a social compact and secondly as it belong to man not as citizen of a community but as being of one common nature in a state of nature man have a right to the fruit of he own labor absolutely to himself and one of the main purpose for which he enter into society be that he might be better protect in the possession of he rights in both case therefore it be manifestly unjust that a man should be make to labor during the whole of he life and yet have no benefit from he labor hence the slave trade and the colonial slavery be a violation of the very principle upon which all law for the protection of property be found whatever benefit be derive from that trade to a individual it be derive from dishonor and dishonesty he force from the unhappy victim of it that which the latter do not wish to give he and he give to the same victim that which he in vain attempt to show be a equivalent to the thing he take -- it be a thing for which there be no equivalent and which if he have not obtain by force he would not have possess at all nor could there be any answer to this reasoning unless it could be prove that it have pleased god to give to the inhabitant of britain a property in the liberty and life of the native of africa but he would go further on this subject the injustice complain of be not confine to the bare circumstance of rob they of the right to they own labor it be conspicuous throughout the system they who buy they become guilty of all the crime which have be commit in procure they and when they possess they of all the crime which belong to they inhuman treatment the injustice in the latter case amount frequently to murder for what be it but murder to pursue a practice which produce untimely death to thousand of innocent and helpless being it be a duty which they lordship owe to they creator if they hope for mercy to do away this monstrous oppression with respect to the impolicy of the trade -lrb- the third point in the resolution -rrb- he would say at once that whatever be inhuman and unjust must be impolitic he have however no objection to argue the point upon its own particular merit : and first he would observe that a great man mr pitt now no more have exert he vast power on many subject to the admiration of he hearer but on none more successfully than on the subject of the abolition of the slave trade he prove after make a allowance for the price pay for the slave in the west indy for the loss of they in the seasoning and for the expense of maintain they afterwards and compare these particulars with the amount in value of they labor there that the evil endure by the victim of the traffic be no gain to the master in whose service they take place indeed mr long have lay it down in he _ history of jamaica _ that the best way to secure the planter from ruin would be to do that which the resolution recommend it be notorious that when any planter be in distress and seek to relieve himself by increase the labor on he estate by means of the purchase of new slave the measure invariably tend to he destruction what then be the importation of fresh african but a system tend to the general ruin of the island but it have often be say that without fresh importation the population of the slave could not be support in the island this however be a mistake it have arise from reckon the death of the import african of whom so many be lose in the seasoning among the death of the creole slave he do not mean to say that under the exist degree of misery the population would greatly increase but he would maintain that if the death and the birth be calculate upon those who be either bear or who have be a long time in the island so as to be consider as native it would be find that the population have not only be keep up but that it have be increase if it be true that the labor of a free-man be cheaper than that of a slave and also that the labor of a long-imported slave be cheaper than that of a fresh-imported one and again that the chance of mortality be much more numerous among the newly-imported slave in the west indy than among those of old standing there -lrb- proposition which he take to be establish -rrb- we should see new argument for the impolicy of the trade it might be state also that the importation of vast body of man who have be rob of they rights and grievously irritated on that account into we colony -lrb- where they miserable condition open new source of anger and revenge -rrb- be the importation only of the seed of insurrection into they and here he could not but view with astonishment the reasoning of the west indian planter who hold up the example of st domingo as a warning against the abolition of the slave trade because the continuance of it be one of the great cause of the insurrection and subsequent misery in that devoted island let we but encourage importation in the same rapid progression of increase every year which take place in st domingo and we should witness the same effect in we own island to expose the impolicy of the trade further he would observe that it be a allow axiom that as the condition of man be improve he become more useful the history of we own country in very early time exhibit instance of internal slavery and this to a considerable extent but we should find that precisely in proportion as that slavery be ameliorate the power and prosperity of the country flourish this be exactly applicable to the case in question there could be no general amelioration of slavery in the west indy while the slave trade last : but if we be to abolish it we should make it the interest of every owner of slave to do that which would improve they condition and which indeed would lead ultimately to the annihilation of slavery itself this great event however could not be accomplish at once it could only be effect in a course of time it would be endless he say to go into all the case which would manifest the impolicy of this odious traffic inhuman as it be unjust as it be he believe it to be equally impolitic and if they lordship should be of this opinion also he hope they would agree to that part of the resolution in which these truth be express with respect to the other part of it or that they would proceed to abolish the trade he observe that neither the time nor the manner of do it be specify hence if any of they should differ as to these particulars they might yet vote for the resolution as they be not pledge to anything definite in these respects provide they think that the trade should be abolish at some time or other : and he do not believe that there be any one of they who would sanction its continuance for ever lord hawkesbury say that he do not mean to discuss the question on the ground of justice and humanity as contradistinguish from sound policy if it could fairly be make out that the african slave trade be contrary to justice and humanity it ought to be abolish it do not however follow because a great evil subsist that therefore it should be remove for it might be comparatively a less evil than that which would accompany the attempt to remove it the noble lord who have just speak have exemplify this for though slavery be a great evil in itself he be of opinion that it could not be do away but in a course of time a state of slavery he say have exist in africa from the earliest time and unless other nation would concur with england in the measure of the abolition we could not change it for the better slavery have exist also throughout all europe it have now happily in a great measure be do away but how not by act of parliament for these might have retard the event but by the progress of civilization which remove the evil in a gradual and rational manner he then go over the same ground of argument as when a member of the common in 1792 he say that the inhumanity of the abolition be visible in this that not one slave less would be take from africa and that such as be take from it would suffer more than they do now in the hand of foreigner he maintain also as before that the example of st domingo afford one of the strongest argument against the abolition of the trade and he conclude by object to the resolution inasmuch as it could do no good for the substance of it would be to be discuss again in a future session the bishop of london dr porteus begin by notice the concession of the last speaker namely that if the trade be contrary to humanity and justice it ought to be abolish he expect he say that the noble lord would have prove that it be not contrary to these great principle before he have support its continuance but not a word have he say to show that the basis of the resolution in these respects be false it follow then he think that as the noble lord have not disprove the premise he be bind to abide by the conclusion the way he say in which the african be reduce to slavery in they own country be by war -- many of which be excite for the purpose -- by the break up of village by kidnapping and by conviction for a violation of they own law of the latter class many be accuse falsely and of crime which do not exist he then read a number of extract from the evidence examine before the privy council and from the history of those who have live in africa have throw light upon this subject before the question be agitate all these he say -lrb- and similar instance could be multiply -rrb- prove the truth of the resolution that the african slave trade be contrary to the principle of humanity justice and sound policy it be moreover he say contrary to the principle of the religion we profess it be not superfluous to say this when it have be so frequently assert that it be sanction both by the jewish and the christian dispensation with respect to the jew he would observe that there be no such thing as perpetual slavery among they they slave be of two kind those of they own nation and those from the country round about they the former be to be set free on the seventh year and the rest of whatever nation on the fiftieth or on the year of jubilee with respect to the christian dispensation it be a libel to say that it countenance such a traffic it oppose it both in its spirit and in its principle nay it oppose it positively for it class men-stealer or slave trader among the murderer of father and mother and the most profane criminal upon earth the antiquity of slavery in africa which the noble lord have glance at afford he say no argument for its continuance such a mode of defense would prevent for ever the removal of any evil it would justify the practice of the chinese who expose they infant in the street to perish it would also justify piracy for that practice exist long before we know anything of the african slave trade he then combat the argument that we do a kindness to the african by take they from they home and conclude by state to they lordship that if they refuse to sanction the resolution they would establish these principle that though individual might not rob and murder yet that nation might -- that though individual incur the penalty of death by such practice yet that body of man might commit they with impunity for the purpose of lucre -- and that for such purpose they be not only to be permit but encourage the lord chancellor -lrb- erskine -rrb- confess that he be not satisfy with he own conduct on this subject he acknowledge with deep contrition that during the time he be a member of the other house he have not once attend when this great question be discuss in the west indy he could say personally that the slave be well treat where he have a opportunity of see they but no judgment be to be form there with respect to the evil complain of they must be appreciate as they exist in the trade of these he have also be a eye-witness it be on this account that he feel contrition for not have attend the house on this subject for there be some cruelty in this traffic which the human imagination could not aggravate he have witness such scene over the whole coast of africa and he could say that if they lordship could only have a sudden glimpse of they they would be strike with horror and would be astonish that they could ever have be permit to exist what then would they say to they continuance year after year and from age to age from information which he could not dispute he be warrant in say that on this continent husband be fraudulently and forcibly sever from they wife and parent from they child and that all the tie of blood and affection be tear up by the root he have himself see the unhappy native put together in heap in the hold of a ship where with every possible attention to they they situation must have be intolerable he have also hear prove in court of justice fact still more dreadful than those which he have see one of these he would just mention the slave on board a certain ship rise in a mass to liberate themselves and have advance far in the pursuit of they object it become necessary to repel they by force some of they yield some of they be kill in the scuffle but many of they actually jump into the sea and be drown thus prefer death to the misery of they situation while other hang to the ship repenting of they rashness and bewail with frightful noise they horrid fate thus the whole vessel exhibit but one hideous scene of wretchedness they who be subdue and secure in chain be seize with the flux which carry many of they off these thing be prove in a trial before a british jury which have to consider whether this be a loss which fall within the policy of insurance the slave be regard as if they have be only a cargo of dead matter he could mention other instance but they be much too shocking to be describe surely they lordship could never consider such a traffic to be consistent with humanity or justice it be impossible that the trade have long subsist there be no doubt but this be no argument for its continuance many evil of much longer standing have be do away and it be always we duty to attempt to remove they should we not exult in the consideration that we the inhabitant of a small island at the extremity of the globe almost at its north pole be become the morningstar to enlighten the nation of the earth and to conduct they out of the shades of darkness into the realm of light thus exhibit to a astonished and a admiring world the blessing of a free constitution let we then not allow such a glorious opportunity to escape we it have be urge that we should suffer by the abolition of the slave trade he believe that we should not suffer he believe that we duty and we interest be inseparable and he have no difficulty in say in the face of the world that he own opinion be that the interest of a nation would be best preserve by its adherence to the principle of humanity justice and religion the earl of westmoreland say that the african slave trade might be contrary to humanity and justice and yet it might be politic at least it might be inconsistent with humanity and yet not be inconsistent with justice this be the case when we execute a criminal or engage in war it be however not contrary to justice for justice in this case must be measure by the law of nation but the purchase of slave be not contrary to this law the slave trade be a trade with the consent of the inhabitant of two nation and procure by no terror nor by any act of violence whatever slavery have exist from the first age of the world not only in africa but throughout the habitable globe among the persian greek and roman and he would compare with great advantage to he argument the wretched condition of the slave in these ancient state with that of those in we colony slavery too have be allow in a nation which be under the especial direction of providence the jews be allow to hold the heathen in bondage he admit that what the learn prelate have say relative to the emancipation of the latter in the year of jubilee be correct but he deny that he quotation relative to the stealer of man refer to the christian religion it be a mere allusion to that which be do contrary to the law of nation which be the only measure of justice between state with respect to the inhumanity of the trade he would observe that if they lordship sit there as legislator be to set they face against everything which appear to be inhuman much of the security on which they life and property depend might be shake if not totally destroy the question be not whether there be not some evil attend the slave trade but whether by the measure now before they they should increase or diminish the quantity of human misery in the world he believe for one consider the internal state of africa and the impossibility of procure the concurrence of foreign nation in the measure that they would not be able to do any good by the adoption of it as to the impolicy of the trade the policy of it on the other hand be so great that he tremble at the consequence of its abolition the property connect with this question amount to a hundred million the annual produce of the island be eighteen million and it yield a revenue of four million annually how be this immense property and income to be preserve some have say it would be preserve because the black population in the island could be keep up without further supplies but the planter deny this assertion and they be the best judge of the subject he condemn the resolution as a libel upon the wisdom of the law of the land and upon the conduct of they ancestor he condemn it also because if follow up it would lead to the abolition of the trade and the abolition of the trade to the emancipation of the slave in we colony the bishop of st asaph -lrb- dr horsley -rrb- say that allow the slave in the west indy even to be pampered with delicacy or to be put to rest on a bed of rose they could not be happy for -- a slave would be still a slave the question however be not concern the alteration of they condition but whether we should abolish the practice by which they be put in that condition whether it be humane just and politic in we so to place they this question be easily answer for he find it difficult to form any one notion of humanity which do not include a desire of promote the happiness of other and he know of no other justice than that which be found on the principle of do to other as we should wish they should do to we and these principle of humanity and justice be so clear that he find it difficult to make they clearer perhaps no difficulty be greater than that of argue a self-evident proposition and such he take to be the character of the proposition that the slave trade be inhuman and unjust it have be say that slavery have exist from the beginning of the world he would allow it but have such a trade as the slave trade ever exist before would the noble earl who have talk of the slavery of ancient rome and greece assert that in the course of he whole reading however profound it might have be he have find anything resemble such a traffic where do it appear in history that ship be regularly fit out to fetch away ten of thousand of person annually against they will from they native land that these be subject to personal indignity and arbitrary punishment during they transportation and that a certain proportion of they owe to suffocation and other cruel cause uniformly perish he aver that nothing like the african slave trade be ever practice in any nation upon earth if the trade then be repugnant as he maintain it be to justice and humanity he do not see how without aid and abet injustice and inhumanity any man could sanction it : and he think that the noble baron -lrb- hawkesbury -rrb- be peculiarly bind to support the resolution for he have admit that if it could be show that the trade be contrary to these principle the question would be at a end now this contrariety have be make apparent and he lordship have not even attempt to refute it he would say but little on the subject of reveal religion as it related to this question because the reverend prelate near he have speak so fully upon it he might observe however that at the end of the sixth year when the hebrew slave be emancipate he be to be furnish liberally from the flock the floor and the wine-press of he master lord holland lament the unfaithfulness of the noble baron -lrb- hawkesbury -rrb- to he own principle and the inflexible opposition of the noble earl -lrb- westmoreland -rrb- from both which circumstance he despair for ever of any assistance from they to this glorious cause the latter wish to hear evidence on the subject for the purpose doubtless of delay he be sure that the noble earl do not care what the evidence would say on either side for he mind be make up that the trade ought not to be abolish the noble earl have make a difference between humanity justice and sound policy god forbid that we should ever admit such distinction in this country but he have go further and say that a thing might be inhuman and yet not unjust and he put the case of the execution of a criminal in support of it do he not by this position confound all notion of right and wrong in human institution when a criminal be justly execute be not the execution justice to he who suffer and humanity to the body of the people at large the noble earl have say also that we should do no good by the abolition because other nation would not concur in it he do not know what other nation would do but this he know that we ourselves ought not to be unjust because they should refuse to be honest it be however self-obvious that if we admit no more slave into we colony the evil would be considerably diminish another of he argument do not appear to be more solid for surely the slave trade ought not to be continue merely because the effect of the abolition might ultimately be that of the emancipation of the slave a event which would be highly desirable in its due time the noble lord have also say that the planter be against the abolition and that without they consent it could never be accomplish he differ from he in both these point : for first he be a considerable planter himself and yet he be a friend to the measure : secondly by cut off all further supplies the planter would be oblige to pay more attention to the treatment of they slave and this treatment would render the trade unnecessary the noble earl have assert also that the population in the west indy could not be keep up without further importation and this be the opinion of the planter who be the best judge of the subject as a planter he differ from he lordship again if indeed all the waste land be to be bring into cultivation the present population would be insufficient but the government have already determine that the trade should not be continue for such a purpose we be no longer to continue pirate or executioner for every petty tyrant in africa in order that every holder of a bit of land in we island might cultivate the whole of he allotment a work which might require century make this exception he would maintain that no further importation be necessary few or no slave have be import into antigua for many year and he believe that even some have be export from it as to jamaica although in one year fifteen thousand die in consequence of hurricane and famine the excess of death over the birth during the twenty year precede 1788 be only one per cent deduct however the mortality of the newly import slave and make the calculation upon the negro bear in the island or upon those who have be long there he believe the birth and the death would be find equal he have a right therefore to argue that the negro with better treatment -lrb- which the abolition would secure -rrb- would not only maintain but increase they population without any aid from africa he would add that the newly import african bring with they not only disorder which ravage the plantation but danger from the probability of insurrection he wish most heartily for the total abolition of the trade he be convince that it be both inhuman unjust and impolitic this have always be he opinion as a individual since he be capable of form one it be he opinion then as a legislator it be he opinion as a colonial proprietor and it be he opinion as a englishman wish for the prosperity of the british empire the earl of suffolk contend that the population of the slave in the island could be keep up by good treatment so as to be sufficient for they cultivation he enter into a detail of calculation from the year 1772 downward in support of this statement he believe all the misery of st domingo arise from the vast importation of african he have such a deep sense of the inhumanity and injustice of the slave trade that if ever he wish any action of he life to be record it would be that of the vote he should then give in support of the resolution lord sidmouth say that he agree to the substance of the resolution but yet he could not support it could he be convince that the trade would be injurious to the cause of humanity and justice the question with he would be decide for policy could not be oppose to humanity and justice he have be of opinion for the last twenty year that the interest of the country and those of numerous individual be so deeply blended with this traffic that we should be very cautious how we proceed with respect to the cultivation of new land he would not allow a single negro to be import for such a purpose but he must have a regard to the old plantation when he find a sufficient increase in the black population to continue the cultivation already establish there then but not till then he would agree to a abolition of the trade earl stanhope say he would not detain they lordship long he could not however help express he astonishment at what have fall from the last speaker for he have evidently confess that the slave trade be inhuman and unjust and then he have insinuate that it be neither inhuman nor unjust to continue it a more paradoxical or whimsical opinion he believe be never entertain or more whimsically express in that house the noble viscount have talk of the interest of the planter but this be but a part of the subject for surely the people of africa be not to be forget he do not understand the practice of compliment the planter with the life of man woman and helpless child by thousand for the sake of they pecuniary advantage and they who adopt it whatever they might think of the consistency of they own conduct offer a insult to the sacred name of humanity and justice the noble earl -lrb- westmoreland -rrb- have ask what would be the practical effect of the abolition of the slave trade he would inform he it would do away the infamous practice which take place in africa it would put a end to the horror of the passage it would save many thousand of we fellow-creature from the misery of eternal slavery it would oblige the planter to treat those better who be already in that unnatural state it would increase the population of we island it would give a death-blow to the diabolical calculation whether it be cheaper to work the negro to death and recruit the gang by fresh importation or to work they moderately and to treat they kindly he know of no event which would be attend with so many blessing there be but one other matter which he would notice the noble baron -lrb- hawkesbury -rrb- have assert that all the horror of st domingo be the consequence of the speculative opinion which be current in a neighbouring kingdom on the subject at liberty they have he say no such origin they be owe to two cause first to the vast number of negro recently import into that island and secondly to a scandalous breach of faith by the french legislature this legislature hold out the idea not only of the abolition of the slave trade but also of all slavery but it break its word it hold forth the rights of man to the whole human race and then in practice it most infamously abandon every article in these rights so that it become the scorn of all the enlighten and virtuous part of mankind these be the great cause of the misery of st domingo and not the speculative opinion of france earl grosvenor could not but express the joy he feel at the hope after all he disappointment that this wicked trade would be do away he hope that he majesty 's minister be in earnest and that they would early in the next session take this great question up with a determination to go through with it so that another year should not pass before we extend the justice and humanity of the country to the helpless and unhappy inhabitant of africa earl fitzwilliam say he be fearful lest the calamity of st domingo should be bring home to we own island we ought not he think too hastily to adopt the resolution on that account he should therefore support the previous question lord ellenborough say he be sorry to differ from he noble friend -lrb- lord sidmouth -rrb- and yet he could not help say that if after twenty year during which this question have be discuss by both house of parliament they lordship ' judgment be not ripe for its determination he could not look with any confidence to a time when they would be ready to decide it the question then before they be short and plain it be whether the african slave trade be inhuman unjust and impolitic if the premise be true we could not too speedily bring it to a conclusion the subject have be frequently bring before he in a way which have enable he to become acquaint with it and he be the more anxious on that account to deliver he sentiment upon it as a peer of parliament without reference to anything he have be call upon to do in the discharge of he professional duty when he look at the mode in which this traffic commence by the spoliation of the rights of a whole quarter of the globe by the misery of whole nation of helpless african by tear they from they home they family and they friend when he see the unhappy victim carry away by force thrust into a dungeon in the hold of a ship in which the interval of they passage from they native to a foreign land be fill up with misery under every degree of debasement and in chain and when he see they afterwards consign to a eternal slavery he could not but contemplate the whole system with horror it be inhuman in its beginning inhuman in its progress and inhuman to the very end nor be it more inhuman than it be unjust the noble earl -lrb- westmoreland -rrb- in adverting to this part of the question have consider it as a question of justice between two nation but it be a moral question although the native of africa might be take by person authorize by they own law to take and dispose of they and the practice therefore might be say to be legal as it respect they yet no man could doubt whatever ordinance they might have to sanction it that it be radically essentially and in principle unjust and therefore there could be no excuse for we in continue it on the general principle of natural justice which be paramount to all ordinance of man it be quite impossible to defend this traffic and he agree with the noble baron -lrb- hawkesbury -rrb- that have decide that it be inhuman and unjust we should not inquire whether it be impolitic indeed the inquiry itself would be impious for it be the common ordinance of god that that which be inhuman and unjust should never be for the good of man its impolicy therefore be include in its injustice and its inhumanity and he have no doubt when the importation be stop that the planter would introduce a change of system among they slave which would increase they population so as to render any further supplies from africa unnecessary it have be prove indeed that the negro population in some of the island be already in this desirable state many other happy effect would follow as to the loss which would arise from the abolition of the slave trade they who be interested in the continuance of it have greatly over-rated they when plead formerly in he professional capacity for the merchant of liverpool at they lordship ' bar he have often deliver statement which he have receive from they and which he afterwards discover to be grossly incorrect he could say from he own knowledge that the assertion of the noble earl -lrb- westmoreland -rrb- that property to the amount of a hundred million would be endanger be wild and fanciful he would not however deny that some loss might accompany the abolition but there could be no difficulty in provide for it such a consideration ought not to be allow to impede they progress in get rid of a horrible injustice but it have be say that we should do but little in the cause of humanity by abolish the slave trade because other nation would continue it he do not believe they would he know that america be about to give it up he believe the state of europe would give it up but suppose that they be all to continue it would not we honor be the greater would not we virtue be the more signal for then -- faithful we among the faithless find : to which he would add that undoubtedly we should diminish the evil as far as the number of miserable being be concern which be accustom to be transport to we own colony earl spencer agree with the noble viscount -lrb- sidmouth -rrb- that the amelioration of the condition of the slave be a object which might be effect in the west indy but he be certain that the most effectual way of improve it would be by the total and immediate abolition of the slave trade and for that reason he would support the resolution have the resolution hold out emancipation to they it would not have have he assent for it would have ill become the character of this country if it have be once promise to have withhold it from they it be to such deception that the horror of st domingo be to be attribute he would not enter into the discussion of the general subject at present he be convince that the trade be what the resolution state it to be inhuman unjust and impolitic he wish therefore most earnestly indeed for its abolition as to the mode of effect it it should be such as would be attend with the least inconvenience to all party at the same time he would not allow small inconvenience to stand in the way of the great claim of humanity justice and religion the question be then put on the resolution and carry by a majority of forty-one to twenty the same address also to he majesty which have be agree upon by the common be directly afterwards move this also be carry but without the necessity of a division the resolution and the motion have pass both house one other parliamentary measure be yet necessary to complete the proceedings of this session it be now almost universally believe in consequence of what have already take place there that the slave trade have receive its death-wound and that it would not long survive it it be suppose therefore that the slave-merchant would in the interim fit out not only all the vessel they have but even buy other to make what might be call they last harvest hence extraordinary scene of rapine and murder would be occasion in africa to prevent these a new bill be necessary this be accordingly introduce into the common it enact but with one exception that from and after the first of August 1806 no vessel should clear out for the slave trade unless it should have be previously employ by the same owner or owner in the say trade or should be prove to have be contract for previously to the 10th of June 1806 for the purpose of be employ in that trade it may now be sufficient to say that this bill also pass both house of parliament soon after which the session end chapter xxxiii -- continuation from July 1806 to march 1807 -- death of mr fox -- bill for the total abolition of the slave trade carry in the house of lord send from thence to the common amend and pass there carry back and pass with its amendment by the lord receive the royal assent -- reflection on this great event it be impossible for the committee to look back to the proceedings of the last session as they relate to the great question under they care without feel a profusion of joy as well as of gratitude to those by whose virtuous endeavor they have take place but alas how few of we earthly pleasure come to we without alloy a melancholy event succeed we have the painful intelligence in the month of October 1806 that one of the oldest and warmest friend of the cause be then number with the dead of the character of mr fox as it related to this cause i be bind to take notice and first i may observe that he profess a attachment to it almost as soon as it be usher into the world early in the year 1788 when he be wait upon by a deputation of the committee he language be as have appear in the first volume that he would support they object to its fullest extent be convince that there be no remedy for the evil but in the total abolition of the trade he subsequent conduct evince the sincerity of he promise he be constant in he attendance in parliament whenever the question be bring forward and he never fail to exert he powerful eloquence in its favor the countenance indeed which he give it be of the greatest importance to its welfare for most of he parliamentary friend who follow he general political sentiment patronize it also by the aid of these join to that of the private friend of mr pitt and of other member who espouse it without reference to party it be always so uphold that after the year 1791 no one of the defeat which it sustain be disgraceful the majority on the side of those interested in the continuance of the trade be always so trifling that the abolitionist be preserve a formidable body and they cause respectable i never hear whether mr fox when he come into power make any stipulation with he majesty on the subject of the slave trade : but this i know that he determine upon the abolition of it if it be practicable as the highest glory of he administration and as the greatest earthly blessing which it be in the power of the government to bestow and that he take considerable pain to convince some of he colleague in the cabinet of the propriety of the measure when the resolution which produce the debate in parliament as detail in the last chapter be under contemplation it be think expedient that mr fox as the minister of state in the house of common should introduce it himself when apply to for this purpose he cheerfully undertake the office thus act in consistency with he public declaration in the year 1791 that in whatever situation he might ever be he would use he warmest effort for the promotion of this righteous cause before the next measure or the bill to prevent the sailing of any new vessel in the trade after the 1st of August be publicly disclose it be suggest to he that the session be nearly over that he might possibly weary both house by another motion on the subject and that if he be to lose it or to experience a diminution of he majority in either he might injure the cause which be then in the road to triumph to this objection he reply that he believe both house be dispose to get rid of the trade that he own life be precarious that if he omit to serve the injured african on this occasion he might have no other opportunity of do it and that he dare not under these circumstance neglect so great a duty this prediction relative to himself become unfortunately verify for he constitution after this begin to decline till at length he mortal destiny in the eye of he medical attendant be seal but even then when remove by pain and sickness from the discussion of political subject he never forget this cause in he own suffering he be not unmindful of those of the injured african two thing say he on he death-bed i wish earnestly to see accomplished -- peace with europe -- and the abolition of the slave trade but know well that we could much better protect ourselves against we own external enemy than this helpless people against they oppressor he add but of the two i wish the latter these sentiment he occasionally repeat so that the subject be frequently in he thought in he last illness nay the very hope of the abolition -lrb- to use the expression of lord howick in the house of common -rrb- quiver on he lip in the last hour of it nor be it improbable if earthly scene ever rise to view at that awful crisis and be perceptible that it might have occupy he mind in the last moment of he existence then indeed would joy ineffable from a conviction of have prepare the way for rescue million of human being from misery have attend the spirit on its departure from the body and then also would this spirit most of all purify when in the contemplation of peace good-will and charity upon earth be in the fittest state on glide from its earthly cavern to commix with the endless ocean of benevolence and love at length the session of 1807 commence it be judge advisable by lord grenville that the expect motion on this subject should contrary to the practice hitherto adopt be agitate first in the lord accordingly on the 2nd of January he present a bill call a act for the abolition of the slave trade but he then propose only to print it and to let it lie on the table that it might be maturely consider before it should be discuss on the 4th no less than four counsel be hear against the bill on the 5th the debate commence but of this i shall give no detailed account nor indeed of any of those which follow it the truth be that the subject have be exhaust they who speak in favor of the abolition say very little that be new concern it they who speak against it bring forward as usual nothing but negative assertion and fanciful conjecture to give therefore what be say by both party at these time would be but useless repetition -lrb- a -rrb- to give on the other hand that which be say on one side only would appear partial hence i shall offer to the reader little more than a narrative of fact upon these occasion -lrb- footnote a : the different debate in both house on this occasion would occupy the half of another volume this be another circumstance which reconcile I to the omission but that which reconcile I the most be that they will be soon publish in these debate justice have be do to every individual concerned in they -rrb- lord grenville open the debate by a very luminous speech he be support by the duke of gloucester the bishop of durham -lrb- dr barrington -rrb- the earl moira selkirk and roslyn and the lord holland king and hood the opponent of the bill be the duke of clarence the earl of westmoreland and st vincent and the lord sidmouth eldon and hawkesbury the question be call for at four o'clock in the morning it appear that the personal vote and proxy in favor of lord grenville 's motion amount to one hundred and those against it to thirty-six thus pass the first bill in england which decree that the african slave trade should cease and here i can not omit pay to he highness the duke of gloucester the tribute of respect which be due to he for have oppose the example of he royal relation on this subject in behalf of a helpless and oppressed people the sentiment too which he deliver on this occasion ought not to be forget this trade say he be contrary to the principle of the british constitution it be besides a cruel and criminal traffic in the blood of my fellow-creature it be a foul stain on the national character it be a offence to the almighty on every ground therefore on which a decision can be make on the ground of policy of liberty of humanity of justice but above all on the ground of religion i shall vote for its immediate extinction on the 10th of February the bill be carry to the house of common on the 20th counsel be hear against it after which by agreement the second reading of it take place on the 23rd the question be put for the commitment of it lord viscount howick -lrb- now earl gray -rrb- begin a eloquent speech after he have proceed in it some way he beg leave to enter he protest against certain principle of relative justice which have be lay down the merchant and planter say he have a undoubted right in common with other subject of the realm to demand justice at we hand but that which they denominate justice do not correspond with the legitimate character of that virtue : for they call upon we to violate the rights of other and to transgress we own moral duty that which they distinguish as justice involve in itself the greatest injury to other it be not in fact justice which they demand but -- favor -- and favor to themselves at the expense of the most grievous oppression of they fellow-creature he then argue the question on the ground of policy he show by a number of official document how little this trade have contribute to the wealth of the nation be but a fifty-fourth part of its export trade and he contend that as four-seventh of it have be cut off by he majesty 's proclamation and the passing of the foreign slave bill in a former year no detriment of any consequence would arise from the present measure he enter into a account of the loss of seaman and of the cause of the mortality in this trade he go largely into the subject of negro-population in the island from official document give a account of it up to the latest date he point out the former cause of its diminution and state how the remedy for these would follow he show how even if the quantity of colonial produce should be diminish for a time this disadvantage would in a variety of instance be more than counterbalance by advantage which would not only be great in themselves but permanent he then enter into a refutation of the various objection which have be make to the abolition in a eloquent and perspicuous manner and conclude by appeal to the great authority of mr pitt and mr fox in behalf of the propose measure these precious ornament he say of they age and country have examine the subject with all the force of they capacious mind on this question they have dismiss all animosity -- all difference of opinion -- and have proceed in union and he believe that the best tribute of respect we could show or the most splendid monument we could raise to they memory would be by the adoption of the glorious measure of the abolition of the slave trade lord howick be support by mr roscoe who be then one of the member for liverpool by mr lushington mr fawke lord mahon lord milton sir john doyle sir samuel romilly mr wilberforce and earl percy the latter of whom wish that a clause might be put into the bill by which all the child of slave bear after January 1810 should be make free general gascoyne and mr hibbert oppose the bill mr man hope that compensation would be make to the planter in case of loss mr bathurst and mr hiley addington prefer a plan for gradual abolition to the present mode these have speak it appear on a division that there be for the question two hundred and eighty-three and against it only sixteen of this majority i can not but remark that it be probably the largest that be ever announce on any occasion where the house be call upon to divide i must observe also that there be such a enthusiasm among the member at this time that there appear to be the same kind and degree of feeling as manifest itself within the same wall in the year 1788 when the question be first start this enthusiasm too which be of a moral nature be so powerful that it seem even to extend to a conversion of the heart for several of the old opponent of this righteous cause go away unable to vote against it while other of they staid in they place and vote in its favor on the 27th of February lord howick move that the house resolve itself into a committee on the bill for the abolition of the slave trade sir c pole messr hughan brown bathurst windham and fuller oppose the motion and sir r milbank and messr wynne barham courtenay montague jacob whitbread and herbert -lrb- of kerry -rrb- support it at length the committee be allow to sit _ pro form _ and mr hobhouse be put into the chair the bill then go through it and the house be resume the report be receive and read on the 6th of march when the committee sit again sir c pole move that the year 1812 be substitute for the year 1807 as the time when the trade should be abolish this amendment produce a long debate which be carry on by sir c pole messr fuller hiley addington rise gascoyne and bathurst on one side and by mr ward sir p franci general vyse sir t turton mr whitbread lord henry petty messr can stanhope perceval and wilberforce on the other at length on a division there appear to be one hundred and twenty-five against the amendment and for it only seventeen the chairman then read the bill and it be agree that he should report it with the amendment on Monday the bill enact that no vessel should clear out for slave from any port within the british dominion after the 1st of may 1807 and that no slave should be land in the colony after the 1st of march 1808 on the 16th of march on the motion of lord henry petty the question be put that the bill be read a third time mr hibbert captain herbert mr tw plomer mr windham and lord castlereagh speak against the motion sir p franci mr lyttleton mr h thornton and messr barham sheridan and wilberforce support it after this the bill be pass without a division -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : s lushington esq mp for yarmouth give he voluntary attendance and assistance to the committee during all these motion and j bowdler esq be elect a member of it -rrb- on Wednesday the 18th lord howick accompany by mr wilberforce and other carry the bill to the lord lord grenville on receive it move that it should be print and that if this process could be finish by Monday it should be take into consideration on that day the reason of this extraordinary haste be that he majesty displeased with the introduction of the roman catholic officer ' bill into the common have signify he intention to the member of the exist administration that they be to be displaced this uneasiness which a few day before have spring up among the friend of the abolition on the report that this event be probable begin now to show itself throughout the kingdom letter be write from various part manifest the greatest fear and anxiety on account of the state of the bill and desire answer of consolation nor be this state of the mind otherwise than what might have be expect upon such a occasion for the bill be yet to be print be a amend one it be to be argue again in the lord it be then to receive the royal assent all these operation imply time and it be report that the new ministry -lrb- a -rrb- be form among whom be several who have show a hostile disposition to the cause -lrb- footnote a : the only circumstance which afford comfort at this time be that the hon spencer perceval and mr canning be include in it who be warm patron of this great measure -rrb- on Monday the 23rd the house of lord meet such extraordinary diligence have be use in print the bill that it be then ready lord grenville immediately bring it forward the earl of westmoreland and the marquis of sligo oppose it the duke of norfolk and the bishop of llandaff -lrb- dr watson -rrb- support it the latter say that this great act of justice would be record in heaven the amendment be severally adopt without a division but here a omission of three word be discover namely country territory or place which if not rectify might defeat the purpose of the bill a amendment be immediately propose and carry thus the bill receive the last sanction of the peer lord grenville then congratulate the house on the completion on its part of the most glorious measure that have ever be adopt by any legislative body in the world the amendment now mention occasion the bill to be send back to the common on the 24th on the motion of lord howick it be immediately take into consideration there and agree to and it be carry back to the lord as approve of on the same day but though the bill have now pass both house there be a awful fear throughout the kingdom lest it should not receive the royal assent before the ministry be dissolve this event take place the next day for on Wednesday the 25th at half past eleven in the morning he majesty 's message be deliver to the different member of it that they be then to wait upon he to deliver up the seal of they office it then appear that a commission for the royal assent to this bill among other have be obtain this commission be instantly open by the lord chancellor -lrb- erskine -rrb- who be accompany by the lord holland and auckland and as the clock strike twelve just when the sun be in its meridian splendor to witness this August act this establishment of a magna charta for africa in britain and to sanction it by its most vivid and glorious beam it be complete the ceremony be over the seal of the respective office be deliver up so that the execution of this commission be the last act of the administration of lord grenville a administration which on account of its virtuous exertion in behalf of the oppressed african race will pass to posterity living through successive generation in the love and gratitude of the most virtuous of mankind thus end one of the most glorious contest after a continuance for twenty year of any ever carry on in any age or country a contest not of brutal violence but of reason a contest between those who feel deeply for the happiness and the honor of they fellow-creature and those who through vicious custom and the impulse of avarice have trample under foot the sacred rights of they nature and have even attempt to efface all title to the divine image from they mind of the immense advantage of this contest i know not how to speak indeed the very agitation of the question which it involve have be highly important never be the heart of man so expand never be its generous sympathy so generally and so perseveringly excite these sympathy thus call into existence have be useful in the preservation of a national virtue for anything we know they may have contribute greatly to form a counteract balance against the malignant spirit generate by we almost incessant war during this period so as to have preserve we from barbarism it have be useful also in the discrimination of moral character in private life it have enable we to distinguish the virtuous from the more vicious part of the community -lrb- a -rrb- it have show the general philanthropist it have unmask the vicious in spite of he pretension to virtue it have afford we the same knowledge in public life it have separate the moral statesman from the wicked politician it have show we who in the legislative and executive office of we country be fit to save and who to destroy a nation -lrb- footnote a : i have have occasion to know many thousand person in the course of my travels on this subject and i can truly say that the part which these take on this great question be always a true criterion of they moral character some indeed oppose the abolition who seem to be so respectable that it be difficult to account for they conduct but it invariably turn out in the course of time either that they have be influence by interested motive or that they be not man of steady moral principle in the year 1792 when the national enthusiasm be so great the good be as

a little virtue when properly leaven be make capable of counteract the effect of a mass of vice with respect to the end obtain by this contest or the great measure of the abolition of the slave trade as it have now pass i know not how to appreciate its importance to we own country indeed it be invaluable we have live in consequence of it to see the day when it have be record as a principle in we legislation that commerce itself shall have its moral boundary we have live to see the day when we be likely to be deliver from the contagion of the most barbarous opinion they who support this wicked traffic virtually deny that man be a moral be they substitute the law of force for the law of reason : but the great act now under we consideration have banish the impious doctrine and restore the rational creature to he moral rights nor be it a matter of less pleasing consideration that at this awful crisis when the constitution of kingdom be on the point of dissolution the stain of the blood of africa be no longer upon we or that we have be free -lrb- alas if it be not too late -rrb- from a load of guilt which have long hang like a mill-stone about we neck ready to sink we to perdition in trace the measure still further or as it will affect other land we become only the more sensible of its importance for can we pass over to africa can we pass over to the numerous island the receptacle of miserable being from thence and can we call to mind the scene of misery which have be pass in each of these region of the earth without acknowledge that one of the greatest source of suffer to the human race have as far as we own power extend be do way can we pass over to these region again and contemplate the multitude of crime which the agency necessary for keep up the barbarous system produce without acknowledge that a source of the most monstrous and extensive wickedness have be remove also but here indeed it become we peculiarly to rejoice for though nature shrink from pain and compassion be engender in we when we see it become the portion of other yet what be physical suffering compare with moral guilt the misery of the oppressed be in the first place not contagious like the crime of the oppressor nor be the mischief which it generate either so frightful or so pernicious the body though under affliction may retain its shape and if it even perish what be the loss of it but of worthless dust but when the moral spring of the mind be poison we lose the most excellent part of the constitution of we nature and the divine image be no longer perceptible in we nor be the two evil of similar duration by a decree of providence for which we can not be too thankful we be make mortal hence the torment of the oppressor be but temporary whereas the immortal part of we when once corrupt may carry its pollution with it into another world but independently of the quantity of physical suffering and the innumerable avenue to vice in more than a quarter of the globe which this great measure will cut off there be yet blessing which we have reason to consider as likely to flow from it among these we can not overlook the great probability that africa now free from the vicious and barbarous effect of this traffic may be in a better state to comprehend and receive the sublime truth of the christian religion nor can we overlook the probability that a new system of treatment necessarily spring up in we island the same bright sun of consolation may visit she child there but here a new hope rise to we view who know but that emancipation like a beautiful plant may in its due season rise out of the ash of the abolition of the slave trade and that when its own intrinsic value shall be know the seed of it may be plant in other land and look at the subject in this point of view we can not but be strike with the wonderful concurrence of event as previously necessary for this purpose namely that two nation england and america the mother and the child should in
