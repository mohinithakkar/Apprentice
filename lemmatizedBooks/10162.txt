velitrae in the volscian country and have be leave without a protector by the death of he father octavius he be bring up in the house of he mother and she husband lucius philippus but on attain maturity spend he time with caesar the latter who be childless base great hope upon he and be devote to he intend to leave he as successor to he name authority and supremacy he be influence largely by attium 's explicit affirmation that the youth have be engender by apollo while sleep once in he temple she say she think she have intercourse with a serpent and through this circumstance at the end of the allotted time bear a son before he come to the light of day she see in a dream she womb lift to the heaven and spread out over all the earth and the same night octavius think the sun rise from she vagina hardly have the child be bear when nigidius figulus a senator straightway prophesy for he sole command of the realm -lrb- 2 -rrb- he could distinguish most accurately of he contemporary the order of the firmament and the mutation of the star what they accomplish by separation and what by conjunction in they association and retirement and for this reason have incur the charge of practice some kind of forbid pursuit he accordingly meet on that occasion octavius who be somewhat tardy in reach the senate on account of the birth of the child -- there happen to be a meeting of the senate that day -- and ask he why he be late on learn the cause he cry out : you have beget a master over we -lrb- 3 -rrb- at that octavius be alarm and wish to destroy the infant but nigidius restrain he say that it be impossible for it to suffer any such fate -lrb- -2 - -rrb- this be the conversation at that time while the boy be grow up in the country a eagle snatch from he hand a loaf of bread and after soar aloft fly down and give it back to he -lrb- 4 -rrb- when he be a lad and staying in rome cicero dream that the boy be let down by golden chain to the summit of the capitol and receive a whip from jupiter -lrb- 5 -rrb- he do not know who the youth be but meet he the next day on the capitol itself he recognize he and tell the vision to the bystander catulus who have likewise never see octavius beheld in a vision all the noble child on the capitol at the termination of a solemn procession to jupiter and in the course of the ceremony the god cast what look like a image of rome into that child 's lap startle at this he go up into the capitol to offer prayer to the god and finding there octavius who have ascend the hill for some other reason he compare he appearance with the dream and be satisfy of the truth of the vision when later he have become a young man and be about to reach maturity he be put on the dress of a adult when he tunic be rent on both side from he shoulder and fall to he foot this event of itself not only have no significance as forecasting any good fortune but displeased the spectator considerably because it have happen in he first put on the garb of a man : it occur to octavius to say : i shall put the whole senatorial dignity beneath my foot and the outcome prove in accordance with he word caesar found great hope upon he as a result of this introduce he into the class of patrician and train he for rulership in everything that be proper to come to the notice of one destine to control so great a power well and worthily he educate he with care the youth be train in oratorical speech not only in the latin but in this language -lrb- greek -rrb- labor persistently in military campaign and receive minute instruction in politics and the science of government -lrb- -3 - -rrb- now this octavius chance at the time that caesar be murder to be in apollonium near the ionic gulf pursue he education he have be send thither in advance to look after he patron 's intended campaign against the parthian when he learn of the event he be naturally grieve but do not dare at once to take any radical measure he have not yet hear that he have be make caesar 's son or heir and moreover the first news he receive be to the effect that the people be of one mind in the affair when however he have cross to brundusium and have be inform about the will and the people 's second thought he make no delay particularly because he have considerable money and numerous soldier who have be send on under he charge but he immediately assume the name of caesar succeed to he estate and begin to busy himself with the situation -lrb- -4 - -rrb- at the time he seem to some to have act recklessly and daringly in this but later as a result of he good fortune and the success he achieve he acquire a reputation for bravery in many instance in history man who be wrong in undertake some project have be fame for wisdom because they prove fortunate in it : other who use the best possible judgment have have to stand a charge of folly because they do not attain they end he too act in a blundering and dangerous way he be only just past boyhood -- eighteen year of age -- and see that the succession to the inheritance and the family be sure to provoke jealousy and censure : yet he start in pursuit of object that have lead to caesar 's murder and no punishment befall he and he fear neither the assassin nor lepidus and antony yet he be not think to have plan poorly because he become successful heaven however indicate not obscurely all the upheaval that would result from it as he be enter rome a great variegated iris surround the whole sun -lrb- -5 - -rrb- in this way he that be formerly call octavius but already at this time caesar and subsequently augustus take charge of affair and settle they and bring they to a successful close more vigourously than any mature man more prudently than any graybeard first he enter the city as if for the sole purpose of succeed to the inheritance and as a private citizen with only a few attendant without any ostentation still later he do not utter any threat against any one nor show that he be displeased at what have occur and would take vengeance for it so far from demand of antony any of the money that he have previously plunder he actually pay court to he although he be insult and wrong by he among the other injury that antony do he by both word and deed be he action when the lex curia be propose accord to which the transfer of octavius into caesar 's family be to take place : antony himself of course be active to have it pass but through some tribune he secure its postponement in order that the young man be not yet caesar 's child accord to law might not meddle with the property and might be weaker in all other way -lrb- -6 - -rrb- caesar be restive under this treatment but as he be unable to speak he mind freely he bear it until he have win over the crowd by whose member he understand he father have be raise to honor he know that they be angry at the latter 's death and hope they would be enthusiastic over he as he son and perceive that they hate antony on account of he have be master of the horse and also for he failure to punish the murderer hence he undertake to become tribune as a start point for popular leadership and to secure the power that would result from it and he accordingly become a candidate for the place of cinna which be vacant though hinder by antony 's clique he do not desist and after use persuasion upon tiberius cannutius a tribune he be by he bring before the populace he take as a excuse the gift bequeath by caesar and in he speech touch upon all the important point promise that he would discharge this debt at once and give they cause to hope for much besides after this come the festival appoint in honor of the completion of the temple of venus which some while caesar be alive have promise to celebrate but be now hold in slight regard as they do the horse-race connect with the parilium -lrb- 6 -rrb- and to win the favor of the populace he provide for it at he private expense on the ground that it concern he because of he family at this time out of fear of antony he bring into the theater neither caesar 's gilded chair nor he crown set with precious stone though it be permit by decree -lrb- -7 - -rrb- when however a certain star through all those day appear in the north toward evening some call it a comet and say that it indicate the usual occurrence but the majority instead of believe this ascribe it to caesar interpret it to mean that he have become a god and have be include in the number of the star then octavius take courage and set up in the temple of venus a bronze statue of he with a star above he head through fear of the populace no one prevent this and then at last some of the earlier decree in regard to honor to caesar be put into effect they call one of the month July after he and in the course of certain triumphal religious festival they sacrifice during one special day in memory of he name for these reason the soldier also and particularly since some of they receive largess of money readily take the side of caesar rumor accordingly go abroad and it seem likely that something unusual would take place this idea gain most headway for the reason that when octavius be somewhat anxious to show himself in court in a elevated and conspicuous place as he have be wont to do in he father 's lifetime antony would not allow it but have he lictor drag he down and drive he out -lrb- -8 - -rrb- all be exceedingly vexed and especially because caesar with a view to cast odium upon he rival and arouse the multitude would no longer even frequent the forum so antony become terrify and in conversation with the bystander one day remark that he harbor no anger against caesar but on the contrary owe he affection and feel inclined to dispel the entire cloud of suspicion the statement be report to the other they hold a conference and some thought they have become reconcile as a fact they understand each other 's disposition accurately and think it inopportune at that time to put they to the test they come to term by make a few mutual concession for some day they be quiet then they begin to suspect each other afresh as a result of either some really hostile action or some false report of hostility -- as regularly happen under such condition -- and be again at variance when man become reconcile after a great enmity they be suspicious of many act that contain no malice and of many chance occurrence in brief they regard everything in the light of they former hostility as do on purpose and for a evil end while they be in this condition those who stand on neutral ground aggravate the trouble irritate they still more by bear report to and fro under the pretence of devotion there be a very large element which be anxious to see all those who have power at variance with one another -- a element which consequently take delight in they enmity and join in plot against they and the party which have previously suffer from calumny be very easy to deceive with word adapt to the purpose by a band of friend whose attachment be not under suspicion this also account for the fact that these man who do not trust each other previously become now even more estrange -lrb- -9 - -rrb- antony see that caesar be gain ground attempt to attract the populace by various bait to see if he could detach the people from he rival and number they among he own force hence through lucius antonius he brother who be tribune he introduce a measure that considerable land be open for settlement among the parcel be the region of the pontine marsh which he state have already be fill and be capable of cultivation the three antonius who be brother all hold office at the same time marcus be consul lucius tribune and gaius praetor therefore they could very easily remove those who be temporarily ruler of they ally and subject -lrb- except the majority of the assassin and some other whom they regard as loyal -rrb- and choose other in place of they : they could also grant some the right to hold office for a unusually long term contrary to the law establish by caesar also macedonium which fall to marcus by lot be appropriate by he brother gaius but marcus himself with the legion previously despatch into apollonium lay claim to gaul on this side of the alp to which decimus brutus have be assign the reason be that it seem to be very strong in resource of soldier and money after these measure have be pass the immunity grant to sextus pompey by caesar as to all the rest be confirm : he have already considerable influence it be further resolve that whatever money of silver or gold the public treasury have take from he ancestral estate should be restore as for the land belong to it antony hold the most of they and make no restoration -lrb- -10 - -rrb- this be the business in which they be engage but i shall now go on to describe how sextus have fare when he have flee from corduba he first come to lacetanium and conceal himself there he be pursue to be sure but elude discovery through the fact that the native be kindly dispose to he out of regard for he father 's memory later when caesar have start for italy and only a small army be leave behind in baetica he be join both by the native inhabitant and by those who escape from the battle and with they he come again into baetica because he think it more suitable for the carry on of war there he gain possession of soldier and city particularly after caesar 's death some voluntarily and some by violence the commandant in charge of they gaius asinius pollio hold a force that be far from strong he next set out against spanish carthage but since in he absence pollio make a attack and do some damage he return with a large force meet he opponent and route he after that the follow accident enable he to startle and conquer the rest as well who be contend fiercely pollio have cast off he general 's cloak in order to suffer less chance of detection in he flight and another man of the same name a brilliant horseman have fall the soldier hear the name of the latter who be lie there and see the garment which have be capture be deceive and think that they general have perish surrender in this way sextus conquer and hold possession of nearly that entire region when he be now a powerful factor lepidus arrive to govern the adjoining portion of spain and persuade he to enter into a agreement on condition that he should recover he father 's estate antony influence by he friendship for lepidus and by he hostility toward caesar cause such a decree to be pass so sextus in this way and on these condition hold aloof from spain proper -lrb- -11 - -rrb- caesar and antony in all they act oppose each other but have not fall out openly and whereas in reality they be alienate they try to disguise the fact so far as appearance go as a result all other interest in the city be in a most undecided state and condition of turmoil people be still at peace and yet already at war liberty lead but a shadow existence and the deed do be the deed of royalty to a casual observer antony since he hold the consulship seem to be get the best of it but the enthusiasm of the mass be for caesar this be partly on he father 's account partly on account of the hope he hold out to they but above all because they be displeased at the considerable power of antony and be incline to assist caesar while he be yet devoid of strength neither man have they affection but they be always eager for a change of administration and it be they nature to try to overthrow every superior force and to help any party that be be oppressed consequently they make use of the two to suit they own desire after they have at this period humble antony through the instrumentality of caesar they next undertake to destroy the latter also they irritation toward the man temporarily in power and they liking for the weaker side make they attempt to overthrow the former later they become estrange from the weaker also thus they show dislike for each of they in turn and the same man experience they affection and they hatred they support and they active opposition -lrb- -12 - -rrb- while they be maintain the above attitude toward caesar and antony the war begin as follow antony have set out for brundusium to meet the soldier who have cross over from macedonia caesar send some person to that city with money who be to arrive there before antony and win over the man and himself go to campanium where he collect a large crowd of man chiefly from capua because the people there have receive they land and city from he father whom he say he be avenge he make they many promise and give they on the spot five hundred denarius apiece these man usually constitute the corps of evocatus whom one might term in greek the recall because have end they service they have be recall to it again caesar take charge of they hasten to rome before antony could make he way back and come before the people who have be make ready for he by cannutius there he call to they mind in detail all the excellent work he father have do make a considerable though moderate defense of himself and bring accusation against antony he also praise the soldier who have accompany he say that they be present voluntarily to lend aid to the city that they have elect he to preside over the state and that through he mouth they make know these fact to all for this speech he receive the approbation of he follow and of the throng that stand by after which he depart for etrurium with a view to obtain a accession to he force from that country -lrb- -13 - -rrb- while he be do this antony have be at first kindly receive in brundusium by the soldier because they expect they would secure more from he than be offer they by caesar this belief be base on the idea that he have possession of much more than he rival when however he promise to give each of they a hundred denarius they raise a outcry but he reduce they to submission by order centurion as well as other to be slay before the eye of himself and he wife for the time be the soldier be quiet but on the way toward gaul when they arrive opposite the capital they revolt and many of they despise the lieutenant that have be set over they array themselves on caesar 's side the so-called martian and the fourth legion go over to he in a body he take charge of they and win they attachment by give money to all alike -- a act which add many more to he troops he also capture all the elephant of antony by confront the train suddenly as they be be conduct along antony stop in rome only long enough to arrange a few affair and to bind by oath all the rest of the soldier and the senator who be in they company then he set out for gaul fear that that country too might indulge in a uprising caesar without delay follow behind he -lrb- -14 - -rrb- decimus brutus be at this time governor of that province and antony set great hope upon he because he have be a slayer of caesar but it turn out as follow decimus do not look askance particularly at caesar for the latter have utter no threat against the assassin : on the other hand he see that antony be no more formidable a foe than he rival or indeed than himself or any of the rest who be in power as a result of natural acquisitiveness therefore he refuse to give ground before he caesar when he hear this decision be for some time at a loss what course to adopt the young man hate both decimus and antony but see no way in which he could contend against they both at once he be by no means yet a match for either one of the two and he be further afraid that if he risk such a move he should throw they into each other 's arm and face the unite opposition of the two after stop to reflect that the struggle with antony be already begin and be urgent but that it be not yet a fitting season for take vengeance for he father he decide to make a friend of decimus he understand well that he should find no great difficulty in fight against the latter if with he aid he could first overcome he adversary but that antony would be a powerful antagonist on any subsequent occasion so much do they differ from each other -lrb- -15 - -rrb- accordingly he send a messenger to decimus propose friendship and promising alliance if he would refuse to receive antony this proposal cause the people in the city likewise to join in express they gratitude to caesar just at this time the year be draw to a close and no consul be on the ground dolabellum have be previously send by antony to syrium eulogy however be deliver in the senate by the member themselves and by the soldier who have abandon antony -- with the concurrence also of the tribune when they enter upon the new year they decide in order that they might discuss freely exist condition to employ a guard of soldier at they meeting this pleased nearly all who be in rome at the time -- for they cordially detest antony -- but particularly cicero he on account of he bitter and long-standing hostility toward the man pay court to caesar and so far as he could by speech and action strive to assist he in every way and to injure antony it be for this reason that when he have leave the city to escort he son to athen for the benefit of he education he have return on ascertain that the two be publicly estrange -lrb- -16 - -rrb- besides these event which take place that year servilius isauricus die at a very advanced age i have mention he both for that fact and to show how the roman of that period respect man who be prominent through merit and hate those who behave insolently even on the very slightest grounds this servilius while walk have once meet on the road a man on horseback who so far from dismount on he approach spurn he violently aside later he recognize the fellow in a defendant of a case in court and when he mention the affair to the judge they pay no further attention to the man 's plea but unanimously condemn he -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 711 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -17 - -rrb- in the consulship of aldus hirtius -lrb- who be now appoint consul in spite of the fact that he father 's name have be post on the tablet of sullum -rrb- with he colleague gaius vibius a meeting of the senate be hold and vote be take for three successive day include the first of the month itself as a result of the war which be upon they and the portent very numerous and extremely unfavorable which take place they be so excited that they fail to pass over these _ die nefasti _ on which they ought not to deliberate on any matter touch they interest ominous have be the fall of great number of thunderbolt some of which descend on the shrine sacred to capitoline jupiter that stand in the temple of victory also a great wind arise which snap and scatter the column erect about the temple of saturn and the shrine of fide and likewise knock down and shatter the statue of minerva the protectress which cicero have set up on the capitol before he exile this portended of course the death of cicero himself another thing that frighten the rest of the population be a great earthquake which occur and the fact that a bull which be sacrifice on account of it in the temple of vesta leap up after the ceremony in addition to these clear indication of danger a flash dart across from the place of the rise sun to the place of its setting and a new star be see for several day then the light of the sun seem to be diminish and even extinguish and at time to appear in three circle one of which be surmount by a fiery crown of sheaf this if anything prove as clear a sign as possible to they for three man be in power -- i mean caesar and lepidus and antony -- and of they caesar subsequently secure the victory at the same time that these thing occur all sort of oracle tend to the downfall of the democracy be recite crow moreover fly into the temple of the dioscurus and peck out the name of the consul and of antony and of dolabellum which be inscribe there somewhere on a tablet and by night dog in large number gather throughout the city and especially near the house of the high priest lepidus and set up howl again the po which have flood a large portion of the surround territory suddenly recede and leave behind on the dry land a vast number of snake countless fish be cast up from the sea on the shore near the mouth of the tiber succeed these terror a plague spread over nearly the whole of italy in a malignant form and in view of this the senate vote that the curia hostilium -lrb- 7 -rrb- should be rebuild and the spot where the naval battle have take place be fill up however the curse do not appear disposed to rest even at this point especially when during vibius 's conduct of the initial sacrifice on the first of the month one of he lictor suddenly fall down and die because of these event many man in the course of those day take one side or the other in they speech and advice and among the deliverance be the following of cicero : -- -lrb- -18 - -rrb- you have hear recently conscript father when i make a statement to you about the matter why i make preparation for my departure as if i be go to be absent from the city a very long time and then return rapidly with the idea that i could benefit you greatly i would not endure a existence under a sovereignty or a tyranny since under such form of government i can not enjoy the rights of free -lrb- 8 -rrb- citizenship nor speak my mind safely nor die in a way that be of service to you and again if opportunity be afford to obey any of duty 's call i would not shrink from action though it involve danger i deem it the task of a upright man equally to keep watch over himself for he country 's interest -lrb- guard himself that he may not perish uselessly -rrb- and in this course of action not to fail to say or do whatever be requisite even if it be necessary to suffer some harm in preserve he native land -lrb- -19 - -rrb- these assumption grant a large degree of safety be afford by caesar both to you and to I for the discussion of press question and since you have further vote to assemble under guard we must frame all we word and behavior this day in such a fashion as to establish the present state of affair and provide for the future that we may not again be compel to decide in a similar way about it that we condition be difficult and dangerous and require much care and attention you yourselve have make evident if in no other way at least by this measure for you would not have vote to keep the senate-house under guard if it have be possible for you to deliberate at all with you accustomed orderliness and in quiet free from fear it be necessary for we even on account of the presence of the soldier to accomplish some measure of importance that we may not incur the disgrace that would certainly follow from ask for they as if we fear somebody and then neglect affair as if we be liable to no danger we shall appear to have acquire they only nominally in behalf of the city against antony but to have give they in reality to he against we own self and it will look as if in addition to the other legion which he gather against he country he need to acquire these very man and so prevent you pass any vote against he even to-day -lrb- -20 - -rrb- yet some have attain such a height of shamelessness as to dare to say that he be not war against the state and have credit you with so great folly as to think that they will persuade you to attend to they word rather than to he act but who would choose to desist from regard he performance and the campaign which he have make against we ally without any order from the senate or the people the country which he be overrun the city which he be besiege and the hope upon which he be build in he entire course -- who would distrust i say the evidence of he own eye and to he ruin yield credence to the word of these man and they false statement by which they put you off with pretext and excuse i myself be far from assert that in do this he be carry out any legal act of administration on the contrary because he have abandon the province of macedonium which be assign to he by lot and because he choose instead the province of gaul which in no way pertain to he and because he assume control of the legion which caesar have send ahead against the parthian keep they about he though no danger threaten italy and because he have leave the city during the period of he consulship to go about pillage and injure the country -- for all these reason i declare that he have long be a enemy of we all -lrb- -21 - -rrb- if you do not perceive it immediately at the start or experience vexation at each of he action he deserve to be hate all the more on this account in that he do not cease injure you who be so long-suffering he might perchance have obtain pardon for the error which he commit at first but now by he perseverance in evil he have reach such a pitch of knavery that he ought to be bring to book for he former offence as well and you ought to be especially careful in regard to the situation notice and consider this point -- that the man who have so often despise you in such weighty matter can not submit to be correct by the same gentleness and kindliness that you have show but must now against he will even though never previously be chastise by force of arm and because he partly persuade and partly compel you to vote he some privilege do not think that this make he less guilty or deserving of less punishment quite the reverse -- for this very procedure in particular he merit the infliction of a penalty : he determine from the outset to commit many outrage and after accomplish some of they through you he employ against you own self the resource which come from you which by deception he force you to vote to he though you neither know nor foresee any such result on what occasion do you voluntarily abolish the command give by caesar or by the lot to each man and allow this person to distribute many appointment to he friend and companion send he brother gaius to macedonia and assign gaul to himself with the aid of the legion which he be not by any means keep to use in you defense do you not remember how when he find you startle at caesar 's demise he carry out all the plan that he choose communicate some to you carefully dissimulate and at inopportune moment and on he own responsibility execute other that inflict injury while all he act be characterize by violence he use soldier and barbarian at that against you and need any one be surprise that in those day some vote be pass which should not have be when even now we have not obtain a free hand to speak and do what be requisite in any other way than by the aid of a body-guard if we have be formerly endue with this power he would not have obtain what any one may say he have obtain nor would he have rise to the prominence enable he to do the deed that be a natural sequence accordingly let no one retort that the rights which we be see to give he under command and compulsion and amid lament be legally and rightfully bestow for even in private business that be not consider binding which a man do under compulsion from another -lrb- -23 - -rrb- and yet all these measure which you be see to have vote you will find to be slight and vary but little from establish custom what be there dreadful in the fact that one man be destine to govern macedonium or gaul in place of another or what be the harm if a man obtain soldier during he consulship but these be the fact that be harmful and abominable -- that you land should be damage ally city besiege that we soldier should be arm against we and we means expend to we detriment : this you neither vote nor intend do not merely because you have grant he some privilege allow he to usurp what be not grant he and do not think that just as you have concede some point he ought similarly to be permit to do what have not be concede quite the reverse : you should for this very reason both hate and punish he because he have dare not only in this case but in all other case to use the honor and kindness that you bestow against you look at the matter through my influence you vote that there should be peace and harmony between individual this man be order to manage the business and conduct it in such a way -lrb- take caesar 's funeral as a pretext -rrb- that almost the whole city be burn down and great number be once more slaughter you ratify all the grant make to various person and all the law lay down by caesar not because they be all excellent -- far from it -- but because we mutual and unsuspecting association quite free from any disguise be not further by change any one of those enactment this man appoint to examine into they have abolish many of he act and have substitute many other in the document he have take away land and citizenship and exemption from tax and many other honor from the possessor -- private individual king and city -- and have give they to man who have not receive any alter the memorandum of caesar from those who be unwilling to give up anything to he grasp he take away even what have be give they and sell this and everything else to such as wish to buy yet you foresee this very possibility have vote that no tablet should be set up after caesar 's death which might contain any article give by he to any person notwithstanding it happen many time after that he also say it be necessary for some provision find in caesar 's papers to be specially note and put into effect you then assign to he in company with the foremost man the task of make these excerpt but he pay no attention to he colleague carry out everything alone accord to he wish in regard to the law the exile and other point which i enumerate a few moment since this be the way in which he wish to execute all you decree -lrb- -24 - -rrb- have he then show himself such a character only in these affair while manage the rest rightly in what instance on what motive he be order to search for and declare the public money leave behind by caesar and do he not seize it pay some of it to he creditor and spend some on high living so that he no longer have even any of this leave you hate the name of dictator on account of caesar 's sovereignty and reject it entirely from the constitution : but be it not true that antony though he have avoid adopt it -lrb- as if the name in itself could do any harm -rrb- have exhibit the behavior belong to it and the greed for gain under the title of consulship you assign to he the duty of promote harmony and have he not on he own responsibility begin this great war neither necessary nor sanction against caesar and decimus whom you approve innumerable case might be mention if one wish to go into detail in which you entrust business to he to manage as consul and he have not conduct a single bit of it as the circumstance demand but have do quite the opposite use against you the authority that you impart now will you assume to yourself also these error that he have commit and say that you yourselve be responsible for all that have happen because you assign to he the management and investigation of the matter in question it be ridiculous if some general or envoy that have be choose should fail in every way to do he duty you who send he would not incur the blame for this it would be a sorry state of thing if all who be elect to perform some work should themselves receive the advantage and the honor but lay upon you the complaint and the blame -lrb- -25 - -rrb- accordingly there be no sense in pay any heed to he when he say : ` it be you who permit I to govern gaul you order I to administer the public finances you give I the legion from macedonium ' perhaps these measure be vote -- yet ought you to put it that way and not instead exact punishment from he for he action in compelling you to make that decision at any rate you never at any time give he the right to restore the exile to add law surreptitiously to sell the privilege of citizenship and exemption from tax to steal the public fund to plunder the possession of ally to abuse the city or to undertake to play the tyrant over he native country and you never concede to any one else all that be desire though you have grant by you vote many thing to many person on the contrary you have always punish such man so far as you could as you will also punish he if you take my advice for it be not in these matter alone that he have show himself to be such a man as you know and have see he to be but briefly in all undertaking which he have ever attempt to perform for the commonwealth -lrb- -26 - -rrb- he private life and he private example of licentiousness and avarice i shall willingly pass over not because one would fail to discover that he have commit many abominable outrage in the course of they but because by hercule i be ashamed to describe minutely and separately -- especially to you who know it as well as i -- how he conduct he youth among you who be boy at the time how he auction off the vigor of he prime he secret lapse from chastity he open fornication what he let be do to he as long as it be possible what he do as early as he could he revel he period of drunkenness and all the rest that follow in they train it be impossible for a person bring up in so great licentiousness and shamelessness to avoid defile he entire life : and so from he private concern he bring he lewdness and greed to bear upon public matter on this i will refrain from dilate and likewise by jupiter on he visit to gabinius in egypt and he flight to caesar in gaul that i may not be charge with go minutely into every detail for i feel ashamed for you that know he to be such a man you appoint he tribune and master of the horse and subsequently consul i will at present recite only he drunken insolence and abuse in these very position -lrb- -27 - -rrb- well then when he be tribune he first of all prevent you from settle suitably the work you then have in hand by shout and bawl and alone of all the people oppose the public peace of the state until you become vexed and because of he conduct pass the vote that you do then though by law he be not permit to be absent from town a single night he escape from the city abandon the duty of he office and have go as a deserter to caesar 's camp guide the latter back as a foe to he country drive you out of rome and all the rest of italy and in short become the prime cause of all the civil disorder that have since take place among you have he not at that time act contrary to you wish caesar would never have find a excuse for the war and could not in spite of all he shamelessness have gather a competent force in defiance of you resolution but he would have either voluntarily lay down he arm or be bring to he sens unwillingly as it be this fellow be the man who furnish he with the excuse who destroy the prestige of the senate who increase the audacity of the soldier he it be who plant the seed of evil which spring up afterward : he it be who have prove the common bane not only of we but also of practically the whole world as indeed heaven rather plainly indicate when that be to say he propose those astonishing law the whole air be fill with thunder and lightning yet this accursed wretch pay no attention to they though he claim to be a soothsayer but fill not only the city but the whole world with the evil and war which i mention -lrb- -28 - -rrb- now after this be there any need of mention that he serve as master of the horse a entire year something which have never before be do or that during this period also he be drunk and abusive and in the assembly would frequently vomit the remains of yesterday 's debauch on the rostrum itself in the midst of he harangue or that he go about italy at the head of pimp and prostitute and buffoon woman as well as man in company with the lictor bear festoon of laurel or that he alone of mankind dare to buy the property of pompey have no regard for he own dignity or the great man 's memory but grasp eagerly those possession over which we even now as at that time shed a tear he throw himself upon this and many other estate with the evident intention of make no recompense for they yet with all he insolence and violence the price be nevertheless collect for caesar take this way of discountenance he act and all that he have acquire vast in extent and gather from every source he have consume in dice consume in harlotry consume in feast consume in drinking like a second charybdi -lrb- -29 - -rrb- of this behavior i shall make no chronicle but on the subject of the insult which he offer to the state and the assassination which he cause throughout the whole city alike how can any man be silent be memory lack of how oppressive the very sight of he be to you but most of all he deed he dare o thou earth and ye god first in this place within the wall in the forum in the senate-house on the capitol at one and the same time to array himself in the purple-bordered garb to gird a sword on he thigh to employ lictor and to be escort by armed soldier next whereas he might have check the turmoil of the citizen he not only fail to do so but set you at variance when you be in concord partly by he own act and partly through the medium of other moreover he direct he attention in turn to the latter themselves and by now assist they and now abandon they -lrb- 9 -rrb- incur full responsibility for great number of they be slay and for the fact that the entire region of pontus and of the parthian be not subdue at that time immediately after the victory over pharnace caesar be call hither in haste to see what he be do do not finish entirely any of those project as he be surely intend -lrb- -30 - -rrb- even this result do not sober he but when he be consul he come naked naked conscript father and anoint into the forum take the lupercalium as a excuse then proceed in company with he lictor to the rostrum and there harangue we from the elevation from the day the city be found no one can point to any one else even a praetor or tribune or aedile let alone a consul who have do such a thing to be sure it be the festival of the lupercalium and the lupercalium have be put in charge of the julian college -lrb- 10 -rrb- yes and sextus clodius have train he to conduct himself so upon receipt of two thousand plethra of the land of leontinus -lrb- 11 -rrb- but you be consul respected sir -lrb- for i will address you as though you be present -rrb- and it be neither proper nor permissible for you as such to speak in such a way in the forum hard by the rostrum with all of we present and to cause we both to behold you remarkable body so corpulent and detestable and to hear you accursed voice choke with unguent speak those outrageous word for i will preferably confine my comment to this point about you mouth the lupercalium would not have miss its proper reverence but you disgrace the whole city at once -- not to speak a word yet about you remark on that occasion who be unaware that the consulship be public the property of the whole people that its dignity must be preserve everywhere and that its holder must nowhere strip naked or behave wantonly -lrb- -31 - -rrb- do he perchance imitate the famous horatius of old or cloelium of bygone day but the latter swam across the river with all she clothing and the former cast himself with he armor into the flood it would be fitting -- would it not -- to set up also a statue of this consul so that people might contrast the one man arm in the tiber and the other naked in the forum it be by such conduct as have be cite that those hero of yore be wont to preserve we and give we liberty while he take away all we liberty from we so far as be in he power destroy the whole democracy set up a despot in place of a consul a tyrant in place of a dictator over we you remember the nature of he language when he approach the rostrum and the style of he behavior when he have ascend it but when a man who be a roman and a consul have dare to name any one king of the roman in the roman forum close to the rostrum of liberty in the presence of the entire people and the entire senate and straightway to set the diadem upon he head and further to affirm falsely in the hearing of we all that we ourselves bid he say and do this what most outrageous deed will that man not dare and from what action however revolt will he refrain -lrb- -32 - -rrb- do we lay this injunction upon you antony we who expel the tarquin who cherish brutus who hurl capitolinus headlong who put to death the spurius -lrb- 12 -rrb- do we order you to salute any one as king when we have lay a curse upon the very name of monarch and furthermore upon that of dictator as the most similar do we command you to appoint any one tyrant we who repulse pyrrhus from italy who drive back antiochus beyond the taurus who put a end to the tyranny even in macedonium no by the rod of valerius and the law of porcius no by the leg of horatius and the hand of mucius no by the spear of decius and the sword of brutus but you unspeakable villain beg and plead to be make a slave as postumius plead to be deliver to the samnite as regulus to be give back to the carthaginian as curtius to be throw into the chasm and where do you find this record in the same place where you discover that the cretan have be make free after brutus be they governor when we vote after caesar 's death that he should govern they -lrb- -33 - -rrb- so then see that you have detect he baneful disposition in so many and so great enterprise will you not take vengeance on he instead of wait to learn by experience what the man who cause so much trouble naked will do to you when he be arm do you think that he be not eager for the tyrant 's power that he do not pray to obtain it some day or that he will put the pursuit of it out of he thought when he have once allow it a resting-place in he mind and that he will ever abandon the hope of sole rulership for which he have speak and act so impudently without punishment what human being who while master of he own voice would undertake to help some one else secure a honor would not appropriate it himself when he become powerful who that have dare to nominate another as tyrant over he country and himself at once would himself refuse to be monarch -lrb- -34 - -rrb- hence even if you spare he formerly you must hate he now for these act do not desire to learn what he will do when he success equal he wish but on the basis of he previous venture plan beforehand to suffer no further outrage what defense could any one make of what take place that caesar act rightly at that time in accept neither the name of king nor the diadem if so this man do wrong to offer something which please not even caesar or on the other hand that the latter err in endure at all to look on at and listen to such proceedings if so and caesar justly suffer death for this error do not this man admit in a certain way that he desire a tyranny most richly deserve to perish that this be so be evident from what i have previously say but be prove most clearly by what he do after that what other end than supremacy have he in mind that he have undertake to cause agitation and to meddle in private business when he might have enjoy quiet with safety what other end that he have enter upon campaign and warfare when it be in he power to remain at home without danger for what reason when many have dislike to go out and take charge even of the office that belong to they do he not only lay claim to gaul which pertain to he in not the slightest degree but use force upon it because of its unwillingness for what reason when decimus brutus be ready to surrender to we himself and he soldier and the city have this man not imitate he instead of besiege and shut he up the only interpretation to be put upon it be that he be strengthen himself in this and every other way against we and to no other end -lrb- -35 - -rrb- see this do we delay and give way to weakness and train up so monstrous a tyrant against we own self be it not disgraceful that we forefather bring up in slavery feel the desire for liberty but we who have live under a independent government become slave of we own free will or again that we be glad to rid ourselves of the dominion of caesar though we have first receive many favor from he hand and accept in he stead this man a self-elected despot who be far worse than he this allegation be prove by the fact that caesar spare many after he victory in war but this follower of he before attain any power have slaughter three hundred soldier among they some centurion guilty of no wrong at home in he own quarter before the face and eye of he wife so that she too be defile with blood what do you think that the man who treat they so cruelly when he owe they care will refrain from do to all of you -- aye down to the utmost outrage -- if he shall conquer and how can you believe that the man who have live so licentiously even to the present time will not proceed to all extreme of wantonness if he shall further secure the authority give by arm -lrb- -36 - -rrb- do not then wait until you have suffer some such treatment and begin to rue it but guard yourselve before you be molest it be out of the question to allow danger to come upon you and then repent of it when you might have anticipate they and do not choose to neglect the seriousness of the present situation and then ask again for another cassius or some more brutus it be ridiculous when we have the power of aid ourselves in time to seek later on man to set we free perhaps we should not even find they especially if we handle in such a way the present situation who would privately choose to run risk for the democracy when he see that we be publicly resign to slavery it must be evident to every man that antony will not rest contented with what he be now do but that in far off and small concern even he be strengthen himself against we he be war against decimus and besiege mutina for no other purpose than to provide himself by conquer and capture they with resource against we he have not be wrong by they that he can appear to be defend himself nor do he merely desire the property that they possess and with this in mind endure toil and danger while ready and willing to relinquish that belong to we who own they property and much beside shall we wait for he to secure the prize and still more and so become a dangerous foe shall we trust he deception when he say that he be not war against the city -lrb- -37 - -rrb- who be so silly as to decide whether a man be make war on we or not by he word rather than by he deed i do not say that now for the first time be he unfriendly to we when he have abandon the city and make a campaign against ally and be assail brutus and besiege the city but on the basis of he former evil and licentious behavior not only after caesar 's death but even in the latter 's lifetime i decide that he have show himself a enemy of we government and liberty and a plotter against they who that love he country or hate tyranny would have commit a single one of the many and manifold offence lay to this man 's charge from every point of view he be prove to have long be a enemy of ours and the case stand as follow if we now take measure against he with all speed we shall get back all that have be lose : but if neglect to do this we wait till he himself admit that he be plot against we we shall lose everything this he will never do not even if he should actually march upon the city any more than marius or cinna or sullum do but if he get control of affair he will not fail to act precisely as they do or still worse man who be anxious to accomplish a object be wont to say one thing and those who have succeed in accomplish it be wont to do quite a different thing to gain they end they pretend anything but have obtain it they deny themselves the gratification of no desire furthermore the last bear always desire to surpass what they predecessor have venture : they think it a small thing to behave like they and do something that have be effect before but determine that something original be the only thing worthy of they because unexpected -lrb- -38 - -rrb- see this then conscript father let we no longer delay nor fall a prey to the indolence that the moment inspire but let we take thought for the safety that concern the future surely it be a shame when caesar who have just emerge from boyhood and be recently register among those have attain year of discretion show such great interest in the state as to spend he money and gather soldier for its preservation that we should neither ourselves perform we duty nor coperate with he even after obtain a tangible proof of he good-will who be unaware that if he have not reach here with the soldier from campanium antony would certainly have come rush from brundusium instanter just as he be and would have burst into we city with all he army like a winter torrent -lrb- 13 -rrb- there be moreover a striking inconsistency in we conduct man who have long be campaign voluntarily have put themselves at you service for the present crisis regard neither they age nor the wound which they receive in past year while fight for you and you both refuse to ratify the war in which these very man elect to serve and show yourselve inferior to they who be ready to face danger for while you praise the soldier that detect the defilement of antony and withdraw from he though he be consul and attach themselves to caesar -lrb- that be to you through he -rrb- you shrink from vote for that which you say they be right in do also we be grateful to brutus that he do not even at the start admit antony to gaul and be try to repel he now that antony confront he with a force why in the world do we not ourselves do the same why do we not imitate the rest whom we praise for they sound judgment there be only two course open to we -lrb- -39 - -rrb- one be to say that all these man -- caesar i mean and brutus the old soldier the legion -- have decide wrongly and ought to submit to punishment because without we sanction or that of the people they have dare to offer armed resistance to they consul some have desert he standard and other have be gather against he the other be to say that antony by reason of he deed have in we judgment long since admit that he be we enemy and by public consent ought to be chastise by we all no one can be ignorant that the latter decision be not only more just but more expedient for we the man neither understand how to handle business himself -lrb- how or by what means could a person that live in drunkenness and dicing -rrb- nor have he any companion who be of any account he love only such as be like himself and make they the confidant of all he open and secret undertaking also he be most cowardly in extreme danger and most treacherous even to he intimate friend neither of which quality be suit for generalship or war -lrb- -40 - -rrb- who can be unaware that this very man cause all we internal trouble and then share the danger to the slightest possible degree he tarry long in brundusium through cowardice so that caesar be isolate and on account of he almost fail : likewise he hold aloof from all succeed war -- that against the egyptian against pharnace the african and the spanish who be unaware that he win the favor of clodius and after use the latter 's tribuneship for the most outrageous end would have kill he with he own hand if i have accept this promise from he again in the matter of caesar he be first associate with he as quaestor when caesar be praetor in spain next attach himself to he during the tribuneship contrary to the liking of we all and later receive from he countless money and excessive honor : in return for this he try to inspire he patron with a desire for supremacy which lead to talk against he and be more than anything else responsible for caesar 's death -lrb- -41 - -rrb- yet he once state that it be i who direct the assassin to they work he be so senseless as to venture to invent so great praise for I and i for my part do not affirm that he be the actual slayer of caesar -- not because he be not willing but because in this too he be timid -- yet by the very course of he action i say that caesar perish at he hand for this be the man who provide a motive so that there seem to be some justice in plot against he this be he who call he ` king ' who give he the diadem who previously slander he actually to he friend do i rejoice at the death of caesar i who never enjoy anything but liberty at he hand and be antony grieve who have rapaciously seize he whole property and commit many injury on the pretext of he letter and be finally hasten to succeed to he position of ruler -lrb- -42 - -rrb- but i return to the point that he have none of the quality of a great general or such as to bring victory and do not possess many or formidable force the majority of the soldier and the best one have abandon he to he fate and also by jupiter he have be deprive of the elephant the remainder have perfect themselves rather in outrage and pillage the possession of the ally than in wage war a proof of the sort of spirit that animate they lie in the fact that they still adhere to he and of they lack of fortitude in that they have not take mutina though they have now be besiege it for so long a time such be the condition of antony and of he follower find to be but caesar and brutus and those array with they be firmly intrench without outside aid caesar in fact have win over many of he rival 's soldier and brutus be keep the same usurper out of gaul : and if you come to they assistance first by approve what they have do of they own motion next by ratify they act at the same time give they legal authority for the future and next by send out both the consul to take charge of the war it be not possible that any of he present associate will continue to aid he however even if they should cling to he most tenaciously they would not he able to resist all the rest at once but he will either lay down he arm voluntarily as soon as he ascertain that you have pass this vote and place himself in you hand or he will be capture involuntarily as the result of one battle i give you this advice and if it have be my lot to be consul i should have certainly carry it out as i do in former day when i defend you against catiline and lentulus -lrb- a relative of this very man -rrb- who have form a conspiracy -lrb- -43 - -rrb- perhaps some one of you regard these statement as well put but think we ought first to despatch envoy to he then after learn he decision in case he will voluntarily give up he arm and submit himself to you to take no action but if he stick to the same principle then to declare war upon he : this be the advice which i hear some person wish to give you this policy be very attractive in theory but in fact it be disgraceful and dangerous to the city be it not disgraceful that you should employ herald and embassy to citizen with foreign nation it be proper and necessary to treat by herald in advance but upon citizen who be at all guilty you should inflict punishment straightway by try they in court if you can get they under the power of you vote and by war against they if you find they in arm all such be slave of you and of the people and of the law whether they wish it or not and it be not fitting either to coddle they or to put they on a equal footing with the highest class of free person but to pursue and chastise they like runaway servant with a feeling of you own superiority -lrb- -44 - -rrb- be it not a disgrace that he should not delay to wrong we but we delay to defend ourselves or again that he should for a long time weapon in hand have be carry on the entire practice of war while we waste time in decree and embassy and that we should retaliate only with letter and phrase upon the man whom we have long since discover by he deed to be a wrongdoer what do we expect that he will some day render we obedience and pay we respect how can this prove true of a man who have come into such a condition that he would not be able even should he wish it to be a ordinary citizen with you under a democratic government if he be willing to conduct he life on fair and equitable principle he would never have enter in the first place upon such a career as he : and if he have do it under the influence of folly or recklessness he would certainly have give it up speedily of he own accord as the case stand since he have once overstep the limit impose by the law and the government and have acquire some power and authority by this action it be not conceivable that he would change of he own free will or heed any one of we resolution but it be absolutely requisite that such a man should be chastise with those very weapon with which he have dare to wrong we -lrb- -45 - -rrb- and i beg you now to remember particularly a sentence which this man himself once utter that it be impossible for you to be save unless you conquer hence those who bid you send envoy be do nothing else than plan how you may be dilatory and the body of you ally become as a consequence more feeble and dispirited while he on the other hand will be do whatever he please will destroy decimus storm mutina and capture all of gaul : the result will be that we can no longer find means to deal with he but shall be under the necessity of tremble before he pay court to he worship he this one thing more about the embassy and i be do : -- that antony also give you no account of what business he have in hand because he intend that you should do this i therefore for these and all other reason advise you not to delay nor to lose time but to make war upon he as quickly as possible you must reflect that the majority of enterprise owe they success rather to a opportune occasion than to they strength and you should by all means feel perfectly sure that i would never give up peace if it be really peace in the midst of which i have most influence and have acquire wealth and reputation nor have urge you to make war do i not think it to you advantage -lrb- -46 - -rrb- and i advise you calenus and the rest who be of the same mind as you to be quiet and allow the senate to vote the requisite measure and not for the sake of you private good-will toward antony recklessly betray the common interest of all of we indeed i be of the opinion conscript father that if you heed my counsel i may enjoy in you company and with thorough satisfaction freedom and preservation but that if you vote anything different i shall choose to die rather than to live i have in general never be afraid of death as a consequence of my outspokenness and now i fear it least of all that account indeed for my overwhelming success the proof of which lie in the fact that you decree a sacrifice and festival in memory of the deed do in my consulship -- a honor which have never before be grant to any one even to one who have achieve some great end in war death if it befall I would not be at all unseasonable especially when you consider that my consulship be so many year ago yet remember that in that very consulship i utter the same sentiment to make you feel that in any and all business i despise death to dread any one however that be against you and in you company to be a slave to any one would prove exceedingly unseasonable to I wherefore i deem this last to be the ruin and destruction not only of the body but of the soul and reputation by which we become in a certain sense immortal but to die speaking and act in you behalf i regard as equivalent to immortality -lrb- -47 - -rrb- and if antony also feel the force of this he would never have enter upon such a career but would have even prefer to die like he grandfather rather than to behave like cinna who kill he for put aside other consideration cinna be in turn slay not long afterward for this and the other sin that he have commit so that i be surprised also at this feature in antony 's conduct that imitate he work as he do he show no fear of some day fall a victim to a similar disaster : the murder man however leave behind to this very descendant the reputation of greatness but the latter have no longer any claim to be save on account of he relative since he have neither emulate he grandfather nor inherit he father 's property who be unaware of the fact that in restore many who be exile in caesar 's time and later in accordance forsooth with direction in he patron 's papers he do not aid he uncle but bring back he fellow-gambler lenticulus who be exile for he unprincipal life and cherish bambalio who be notorious for he very name while he have treat he nearest relative as i have describe and as if he be half angry at they because he be bear into that family consequently he never inherit he father 's goods but have be the heir of very many other some whom he never see or hear of and other who be still live that be he have so strip and despoil they that they differ in no way from dead man dio 's roman history 46 the following be contain in the forty-sixth of dio 's rome : how calenus reply to cicero in defense of antony -lrb- chapter 1-28 -rrb- how antony be defeat at mutina by caesar and the consul -lrb- chapter 29-38 -rrb- how caesar come to rome and be appoint consul -lrb- chapter 39-49 -rrb- how caesar antony and lepidus form a solemn pact of union -lrb- chapter 50-56 -rrb- duration of time one year in which there be the follow magistrate here enumerate : c vibius c filius pansa capronianus aulus hirtius aulus filius -lrb- bc 43 = a u 711 -rrb- -lrb- _ book 46 boissavain _ -rrb- -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 711 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -1 - -rrb- when cicero have finish speak in this vein quintus fufius calenus arise and say : -- ordinarily i should not have wish either to say anything in defense of antony or to assail cicero i really do not think it proper in such discussion as be the present to do either of these thing but simply to make know what one 's opinion be the former method belong to the courtroom whereas this be a matter of deliberation since however he have undertake to speak ill of antony on account of the enmity that exist between they instead of send he a summons as he ought if antony be guilty of any wrong and since he have further mention I in a calumnious fashion as if he could not have exhibit he cleverness without heedlessly insulting one or two person it behoove I also to set aside the imputation against antony and to bring counter-charge against the speaker i would not have he innate impudence fail of a response nor let my silence aid he by incur the suspicion of a guilty conscience nor would i have you deceive by what he say come to a less worthy decision by accept he private spleen against antony in exchange for the common advantage -lrb- -2 - -rrb- he wish to effect nothing else than that we should abandon look out for the safest course for the commonwealth and fall into discord again it be not the first time that he have do this but from the outset ever since he have to do with politics he have be continually cause disturbance one way or the other be he not the one who embroil caesar with pompey and prevent pompey from become reconcile with caesar the one who persuade you to pass that vote against antony by which he irritated caesar and persuade pompey to leave italy and transfer he quarter to macedona this prove the chief cause of all the evil which befall we subsequently be not he the one who kill clodius by the hand of milo and slew caesar by the hand of brutus the one who make catiline hostile to we and despatch lentulus without a trial -lrb- -3 - -rrb- hence i should be very much surprised at you see that you then change you mind about he conduct just mention and make he pay the penalty for it if you should now heed he again when he talk and action be similar do you not see too that after caesar 's death when we affair be settle in a most tranquil way by antony as not even he accuser can deny the latter left town because he deem we life of harmony to be alien and dangerous to he that when he perceive that turmoil have again arise he bid a long farewell to he son and to athen and return that he insult and abuse antony whom he be wont to say he love and coperates with caesar whose father he kill and if chance so favor he will ere long attack caesar also for the fellow be naturally distrustful and turbulent and have no ballast in he soul and he be always stir thing up and twist about turn more way than the sea-passage to which he flee and get the title of deserter for it ask all of you to take that man for friend or foe whom he bid -lrb- -4 - -rrb- for these reason be on you guard against man he be a juggler and imposter and grow rich and strong from the ill of other blackmail drag tear the innocent as do dog but in the midst of public harmony he be embarrassed and withers away it be not friendship or good-will among we that can support this kind of orator from what other source do you think he have become rich or from what other source great certainly neither family nor wealth be bequeath he by he father the fuller who be always trading in grape and olive a man who be glad to make both end meet by this and by he wash and whose time be take up every day and night with the vilest occupation the son have be bring up in they not unnaturally trample and dows he superior use a species of abuse invent in the workshop and on the street corner -lrb- -5 - -rrb- now be of such a origin yourself and after grow up naked among you naked companion pick up pig manure and sheep dung and human excrement have you dare o most accursed wretch first to slander the youth of antony who have the advantage of pedagogue and teacher as he rank demand and next to impugn he because in celebrate the lupercalium a ancestral festival he come naked into the forum but i ask you you that always use all the clothes of other on account of you father 's business and be strip by whoever meet you and recognize they what ought a man who be not only priest but also leader of he fellow priest to have do not to conduct the procession not to celebrate the festival not to sacrifice accord to ancestral custom not to appear naked not to anoint himself ` but it be not for that that i censure he ' he answer ` but because he deliver a speech and that kind of speech naked in the forum ' of course this man have become acquaint in the fuller 's shop with all minute matter of etiquette that he should detect a real mistake and be able to rebuke it properly -lrb- -6 - -rrb- in regard to this matter i will say later all that need to be say but just now i want to ask the speaker a question or two be it not true that you for you part be nourish by the ill of other and educate in the misfortune of you neighbor and for this reason be acquaint with no liberal branch of knowledge that you have establish a kind of association here and be always wait like the harlot for a man who will give something and that have many man in you pay to attract profit to you you pry into people 's affair to find out who have wrong -lrb- or seem to have wrong -rrb- whom who hate whom and who be plot against whom with these man you make common cause and through these man you be support sell they the hope that chance bestow trading in the decision of the juror deem he alone a friend who give more and more and all those enemy who furnish you no business or employ some other advocate while you pretend not even to know those who be already in you clutch and affect to be bore by they but fawn upon and giggle at those just approach like the mistress of inn -lrb- -7 - -rrb- how much better it be that you too should have be bear bambalio -- if this bambalio really exist -- than to have take up such a livelihood in which it be absolutely inevitable that you should either sell you speech in behalf of the innocent or else preserve the guilty yet you can not do even this effectively though you waste three year in athen on what occasion by what help why you always come tremble up to court as if you be go to fight in armor and after speak a few word in a low and half-dead voice you go away not remember a word of the speech you practice at home before you come and without find anything to say on the spur of the moment in make affirmation and promise you surpass all mankind in audacity but in the contest themselves beyond utter some word of abuse and defamation you be most weak and cowardly do you think any one be ignorant of the fact that you never deliver one of those wonderful speech of yours that you have publish but write they all up afterward like person who form general and masters-of-horse out of day if you feel doubtful of this point remember how you accuse verre -- though to be sure you only give he a example of you father 's trade when you make water -lrb- -8 - -rrb- but i hesitate for fear that in say precisely what fit you case i may seem to be utter word that be unfitting for myself -lrb- 14 -rrb- this i will pass over and further by jupiter also the affair of gabinius against whom you prepare accuser and then plead he cause in such a way that he be condemn and the pamphlet which you compose against you friend in regard to which you feel yourself so guilty that you do not dare to make they public yet it be a most miserable and pitiable state to be in not to be able to deny these charge which be the most disgraceful conceivable to admit but i will leave these to one side and bring forward the rest well though we do grant the trainer as you say two thousand plethra of the ager leontinus we still learn nothing adequate from it -lrb- 15 -rrb- but who should not admire you system of instruction and what be it you be ever jealous of you superior you always toady to the prominent man you slander he who have attain distinction you inform against the powerful and you hate equally all the excellent and you pretend love only for those through whom you may do some mischief this be why you be always incite the younger against they elder and lead those who trust you even in the slightest into danger where you desert they -lrb- -9 - -rrb- a proof of this be that you have never accomplish any achievement worthy of a distinguished man either in war or in peace how many war have we win under you as praetor and what kind of territory do we acquire with you as consul you private activity all these year have consist in continually deceive some of the foremost man and win they to you side and manage everything you like while publicly you have be shout and bawl out at random those detestable phrase -- ' i be the only one that love you ' or if it should so chance ` and what be - his-name all the rest hate you ' and ' i alone be friendly to you all the rest be engage in plot ' and other such stuff by which you fill some with elation and conceit only to betray they and scare the rest so that you gain they attachment if any service be render by any one whomsoever of the whole people you lay claim to it and write you own name upon it repeat : ' i move it i propose it it be through I that this be do so ' but if anything happen that ought not to have occur you take yourself out of the way and censure all the rest say : ` you see i be not praetor you see i be not envoy you see i be not consul ' and you abuse everybody everywhere all the time set more store by the influence which come from appear to speak you mind boldly than by say what duty demand : and you exhibit no important quality of a orator -lrb- -10 - -rrb- what public advantage have be preserve or establish by you who that be really harm the city have you indict and who that be really plot against we have you bring to light to neglect the other case -- these very charge which you now bring against antony be of such a nature and so many that no one could ever suffer any adequate penalty for they why then if you see we be wrong by he at the start as you assert do you never attack or accuse he at the time instead of tell we now all the transgression he commit when tribune all he irregularity when master of horse all he villany when consul you might at once at the time in each specific instance have inflict the appropriate penalty upon he if you have want to show yourself in very deed a patriot and we could have impose the punishment in security and safety during the course of the offence themselves one of two conclusion be inevitable -- either that you believe this to be so at the time and renounce the idea of a struggle in we behalf or else that you could not prove any of you charge and be now engage in a reckless course of blackmail -lrb- -11 - -rrb- that this be so i will show you clearly conscript father by go over each point in detail antony do say some word during he tribuneship in caesar 's behalf : cicero and some other speak in behalf of pompey why now do he accuse he of prefer one man 's friendship but acquit himself and the rest who warmly embrace the opposite cause antony to be sure hinder at that time some measure adverse to caesar from be pass : and cicero hinder practically everything that be know to be favorable to caesar ` but antony obstruct ' he reply ` the public judgment of the senate ' well now in the first place how could one man have have so much power second if he have be condemn for this as be say how could he have escape punishment ` oh he flee he flee to caesar and get out of the way ' of course you cicero do not ` leave town ' just now but you flee as in you former exile -lrb- 16 -rrb- do not be so ready to apply you own shame to all of we to flee be what you do in fear of the court and pronounce condemnation on yourself beforehand yes to be sure a ordinance be pass for you recall how and for what reason i do not say but at any rate it be pass and you do not set foot in italy before the recall be grant but antony both go away to caesar to inform he what have be do and return without ask for any decree and finally effect peace and friendship with he for all those that be find in italy and the rest too would have have a share in it if they have not take you advice and flee -lrb- -12 - -rrb- now in view of those circumstance do you dare to say he lead caesar against he country and stir up the civil war and become more than any one else responsible for the subsequent evil that befall we not so but you who give pompey legion that belong to other and the command and undertake to deprive caesar even of those that have be give he : it be you who agree with pompey and the consul not to accept the offer make by caesar but to abandon the city and the whole of italy : you who do not see caesar even when he enter rome but have run off to pompey and into macedonium not even to he however do you prove of any assistance but you neglect what be go on and then when he meet with misfortune you abandon he therefore you do not aid he at the outset on the ground that he have the juster cause but after set in motion the dispute and embroil affair you lay in wait at a safe distance for a favorable turn you at once desert the man who fail as if that somehow prove he guilty and go over to the victor as if you deem he more just and in addition to you other defect you be so ungrateful that not only be you not satisfied to have be preserve by he but you be actually displeased that you be not make master of the horse -lrb- -13 - -rrb- then with this on you conscience do you dare to say that antony ought not to have hold the office of master of the horse for a year and that caesar ought not to have remain dictator for a year but whether it be wise or necessary for these measure to be frame at any rate they be both pass and they suit we and the people censure these man cicero if they have transgress in any particular but not by jupiter those whom they have choose to honor for show themselves worthy of so great a reward for if we be force by the circumstance that then surround we to act in this way and contrary to good policy why do you now lay this upon antony 's shoulder and why do you not oppose it then if you be able because by jupiter you be afraid then shall you who be at that time silent obtain pardon for you cowardice and shall he because he be prefer before you submit to penalty for he excellence where do you learn that this be just or where do you read that this be lawful -lrb- -14 - -rrb- ` but he do not rightly use he position as master of horse ' why ` because ' he answer ` he buy pompey 's possession ' how many other be there who purchase numberless article no one of whom be blame that be the purpose in confiscate certain article and expose they in the market and proclaim they by the voice of the public crier to have somebody buy they ` but pompey 's goods ought not to have be sell ' then it be we who err and do wrong in confiscate they or -lrb- to clear you skirt and ours -rrb- it be at least caesar who act irregularly he who order this to be do : yet you do not censure he at all i maintain that in this charge he be prove to be absolutely beside himself he have bring against antony two quite opposite accusation -- one that after help caesar in very many way and receive in return vast gift from he he be then require under compulsion to surrender the price of they and the second that he inherit naught from he father spend all that he have like charybdi -lrb- the speaker be always bring in some comparison from sicily as if we have forget that he have be exile there -rrb- and pay the price of all that he purchase -lrb- -15 - -rrb- so in these charge this remarkable orator be convict of violently contradict himself and by jupiter again in the follow statement at one time he say that antony take part in everything that be do by caesar and by this mean become more than any one else responsible for all we internal evil and again he charge he with cowardice reproach he with not have share in any other exploit than those perform in thessaly and he make a complaint against he to the effect that he restore some of the exile and find fault with he because he do not secure the recall of he uncle as if any one believe that he would not have restore he first of all if he have be able to recall whomsoever he please since there be no grievance on either side between they as this speaker himself know indeed though he tell many wretched lie about antony he do not dare to say anything of that kind but he be utterly reckless about let slip anything that come to he tongue 's end as if it be mere breath -lrb- -16 - -rrb- why should one follow this line of refutation further turn now to the fact that he go about with such a tragic air and have but this moment say in the course of he remark that antony render the sight of the master of the horse most oppressive by use everywhere and under all circumstance the sword the purple the lictor and the soldier at once let he tell I clearly how and in what respect we have be wrong by this he will have no statement to make for if he have have he would have sputter it out before anything else quite the reverse of he charge be true those who be quarrel at that time and cause all the trouble be trebellius and dolabellum : antony do no wrong and be active in every way in we behalf so much so that he be entrust by we with guard the city against those very man and not only do this remarkable orator not oppose it -lrb- he be there -rrb- but even approve it else let he show what syllable he utter on see the licentious and accursed fellow -lrb- to quote from he abuse -rrb- besides do nothing that the occasion require secure also so great authority from you he will have nothing to show so it look as if not a word of what he now shout aloud be venture at that time by this great and patriotic orator who be everywhere and always say and repeat : ' i alone be contend for freedom i alone speak freely for the democracy i can not be restrain by favor of friend or fear of enemy from look out for you advantage i even if it should be my lot to die in speak in you behalf will perish very gladly ' and he silence be very natural for it occur to he to reflect that antony possess the lictor and the purple-bordered vesture in accordance with the custom of we ancestor in regard to master of horse and that he be use the sword and the soldier perforce against the rebel for what most excessive outrage would they not have commit but for he be hedge about with these protection when some of they so despise he as it be -lrb- -17 - -rrb- that these and all he other act be correct and most thoroughly in accord with caesar 's intention the fact themselves show the rebellion go no further and antony far from pay a penalty for he course be subsequently appoint consul notice i beg of you how he administer this office of he you will find if you scrutinize the matter minutely that its tenure prove of great value to the city he traducer know this could not endure he jealousy but dare to slander he for those deed which he would have long to do himself that be why he introduce the matter of he strip and anoint and those ancient fable not because there be any pertinence in they now but in order to obscure by external noise he opponent 's consummate skill and success yet this same antony o thou earth and ye god -lrb- i shall call louder than you and invoke they with greater justice -rrb- see that the city be already in reality under a tyranny through the fact that all the legion obey caesar and all the people together with the senate submit to he to such a extent that they vote among other measure that he should be dictator for life and use the appurtenance of a king then he show caesar he error most convincingly and restrain he most prudently until the latter abashed and afraid would not accept either the name of king or the diadem which he have in mind to bestow upon himself even against we will any other man would have declare that he have be order to do it by he master and put forward the compulsion as a excuse would have obtain pardon for it -- yes indeed he would when you think of what kind of vote we have pass at that time and what power the soldier have secure antony however because he be thoroughly acquaint with caesar 's disposition and accurately aware of all he be prepare to do by great good judgment succeed in turn he aside from he course and retard he ambition the proof of it be that afterward he no longer behave in any way like a monarch but mingle publicly and unprotected with we all and that account most of all for the possibility of he meet the fate that he do -lrb- -18 - -rrb- this be what be do o cicero or cicerulus or ciceracius or ciceriscus or graeculus -lrb- 17 -rrb- or whatever you like to be call by the uneducated the naked the anointed man : and none of it be do by you the clever the wise the user of much more olive oil than wine you who let you clothing drag about you ankle not by jupiter as the dancer do who teach you intricacy of reasoning by they pose but in order to hide the ugliness of you leg oh no it be not through modesty that you do this you who deliver that long screed about antony 's habit who be there that do not see these soft clothes of yours who do not scent you carefully comb gray lock who be there unaware that you put away you first wife who have bear you two child and at a advanced age marry another a mere girl in order that you might pay you debt out of she property and you do not even retain she to the end that you might keep caerellium fearlessly whom you debauch when she be as much older than yourself as the maiden you marry be younger and to whom you write such letter as a jester at no loss for word would write if he be try to get up a amour with a woman seventy year old this which be not altogether to my taste i have be induce to say conscript father in the hope that he should not go away without get as good as he send in the discussion again he have venture to reproach antony for a little kind of banquet because he as he say drink water he purpose be to sit up at night and compose speech against we -- though he bring up he son in such drunkenness that the latter be sober neither night nor day furthermore he undertake to make derogatory remark about antony 's mouth this man who have show so great licentiousness and impurity throughout he entire life that he would not keep he hand off even he closest kin but let out he wife for hire and deflower he daughter -lrb- -18 - -rrb- these particulars i shall leave as they stand and return to the point where i start that antony against whom he have inveigh see caesar exalt over we government cause he by grant what seem personal favor to a friend not to put into effect any of the project that he have in mind nothing so divert person from object which they may attain without care to secure they righteously as for those who fear such result to appear to endure the former 's conduct willingly these person in authority have no regard for they own consciousness of guilt but if they think they have be detect they be ashamed and afraid : thereafter they usually take what be say to they as flattery and believe the opposite and any action which may result from the word as a plot be suspicious in the midst of they shame antony know this thoroughly and first of all he select the lupercalium and that procession in order that caesar in the relaxation of he spirit and the fun of the affair might be rebuke with immunity and next he select the forum and the rostrum that he patron might be shame by the very place and he fabricate the command from the populace in order that hear they caesar might reflect not on what antony be say at the time but on what the roman people would order a man to say how could he have believe that this injunction have really be lay upon any one when he know that the people have not vote anything of the kind and do not hear they shout out but it be right for he to hear this in the roman forum where we have often join in many deliberation for freedom and beside the rostrum from which we have send forth thousand and thousand of measure in behalf of the democracy and at the festival of the lupercalium in order that he should remember romulus and from the mouth of the consul that he might call to mind the deed of the early consul and in the name of the people that he might ponder the fact that he be undertake to be tyrant not over african or gaul or egyptian but over very roman these word make he turn about they humiliate he and whereas if any one else have offer he the diadem he might have take it he be then stop short by that speech and feel a shudder of alarm these then be the deed of antony : he do not uselessly break a leg in order himself to escape nor burn off a hand in order to frighten porsenna but by he cleverness and consummate skill he put a end to the tyranny of caesar better than any spear of decius and better than the sword of brutus -lrb- -20 - -rrb- but you cicero what do you effect in you consulship not to mention wise and good thing that be not deserving of the greatest punishment do you not throw we city into uproar and party strife when it be quiet and harmonious and fill the forum and capitol with slave among other that you have call to you aid do you not ruin miserably catiline who be overanxious for office but otherwise guilty of no violence do you not pitiably destroy lentulus and he follower who be not guilty not try and not convict in spite of the fact that you be always and everywhere prate interminably about the law and about the court if any one should take these phrase from you speech there be nothing leave you censure pompey because he conduct the trial of milo contrary to legalize precedent : yet you afford lentulus no privilege great or small that be enjoin in these case but without a speech or trial you cast he into prison a man respectable aged whose ancestor have give many great pledge that he would be friendly to he country and who by reason of he age and he character have no power to do anything revolutionary what trouble do he have that would have be cure by the change of condition what blessing do he possess that would not certainly be jeopardize by rebellion what arm have he collect what ally have he equip that a man who have be consul and be praetor should be so pitilessly and impiously cast into a cell without be allow to say a word of defense or hear a single charge and die there like the basest criminal for this be what this excellent tullius most of all desire -- that in -lrb- the tullianum -rrb- the place that bear he name he might put to death the grandson of that lentulus once become the head of the senate -lrb- -21 - -rrb- what would he have do if he have obtain authority to bear arm see that he accomplish so many thing of such a nature by he word alone these be you brilliant achievement these be you great exhibition of generalship and not only be you condemn for they by the rest but you be so ready to vote against you own self in the matter that you flee before you trial come on yet what greater demonstration of you bloodguiltiness could there be than that you come in danger of perish at the hand of those very person in whose behalf you pretend you have do this that you be afraid of the very one whom you say you have benefit by these act and that you do not wait to hear from they or say a word to they you clever you extraordinary man you aider of other people but secure you safety by flight as if from a battle and you be so shameless that you have undertake to write a history of these event that i have relate whereas you ought to have pray that no other man even should give a account of any of they : then you might at least derive this advantage that you doings should die with you and no memory of they be transmit to posterity now gentleman if you want to laugh listen to he clever device he set himself the task of write a history of the entire existence of the city -lrb- for he pretend to be a sophist and poet and philosopher and orator and historian -rrb- and he begin not from the founding of it like the rest be similarly busy but from he own consulship so that he might proceed backwards make that the beginning of he account and the kingdom of romulus the end -lrb- -22 - -rrb- tell I now you who write such thing and do such thing what the excellent man ought to say in popular address and do in action : for you be better at advise other about any matter whatsoever than at do you own duty and better at rebuke other than at reform yourself yet how much better it be for you instead of reproach antony with cowardice to lay aside yourself that effeminacy both of spirit and of body instead of bring a charge of disloyalty against he to cease yourself from do anything disloyal or play the deserter instead of accuse he of ingratitude to cease yourself from wrong you benefactor for this i must tell you be one of he inherent defect that he hate above all those who have do he any favor and be always fawn upon somebody else but plot against these person to leave aside other instance he be pity and preserve by caesar and enrol among the patrician after which he kill he -- no not with he own hand -lrb- he be too cowardly and womanish -rrb- but by persuade and make ready other who should do it the man themselves show that i speak the truth in this when they run out into the forum with they naked blade they invoke he by name say ` cicero ' repeatedly as you all hear he benefactor caesar then he slew and as for antony from whom he obtain personally safety and a priesthood when he be in danger of perish at the hand of the soldier in brundusium he repay he with this sort of thanks by accuse he for deed with which neither he himself nor any one else ever find any fault and attack he for conduct which he praise in other yet he see this caesar who have not attain the age yet to hold office or have any part in politics and have not be choose by you see he equip with power and standing as the author of a war without we vote or order and not only have no blame to bestow but pronounce laudation so you perceive that he investigate neither what be just with reference to the law nor what be useful with reference to the public weal but simply manage everything to suit he own will censure in some what he extol in other spread false report against you and calumniate you gratuitously -lrb- -23 - -rrb- for you will find that all of antony 's act after caesar 's demise be order by you to speak about the disposition of the fund and the examination of the letter i deem to be superfluous why so because first it would be the business of the one who inherit he property to look into the matter and second if there be any truth in the charge of malfeasance it ought to have be stop then on the moment for none of the transaction be carry on underhandedly cicero but they be all record on tablet as you yourself affirm if antony commit he many wrong so openly and shamelessly as you say and plunder the whole of crete on the pretext that in accord with caesar 's letter it have be leave free after the governorship of brutus though the latter be later give charge of it by we how could you have keep silent and how could any one else have bear it but these matter as i say i shall pass over for the majority of they have not be mention individually and antony be not present who could inform you exactly of what he have do in each instance as to macedonia and gaul and the remain province and legion yours be the decree conscript father accord to which you assign to the various governor they separate charge and deliver to antony gaul together with the soldier this be know also to cicero he be there and help vote for all of they just like you yet how much better it would have be for he then to speak in opposition if any item of business be not go as it should and to instruct you in these matter that be now bring forward than to be silent at the time and allow you to make mistake and now nominally to censure antony but really to accuse the senate -lrb- -24 - -rrb- any sensible person could not assert either that antony force you to vote these measure he himself have no band of soldier so as to compel you to do anything contrary to you inclination and further the business be do for the good of the city for since the legion have be send ahead and unite there be fear that when they hear of caesar 's assassination they might revolt put some inferior man at they head and begin to wage war again : so it seem good to you take a proper and excellent course to place in command of they antony the consul who be charge with the promotion of harmony who have reject the dictatorship entirely from the system of government and that be the reason that you give he gaul in place of macedonium that he should stay here in italy commit no harm and do at once whatever errand be assign he by you -lrb- -25 - -rrb- this i have say to you that you may know that you decide rightly for cicero that other point of mine be sufficient -- namely that he be present during all these proceedings and help we to pass the measure though antony have not a soldier at the time and could not have bring to bear on we pressure in the shape of any terror that would have make we neglect a single point of we interest but even if you be then silent tell we now at least : what ought we to have do under the circumstance leave the legion leaderless would they have fail to fill both macedonium and italy with countless evil commit they to another and whom could we have find more closely related and suit to the business than antony the consul the director of all the city 's affair the one who have take such good care of harmony among we the one who have give countless example of he affection for the state some one of the assassin perhaps why it be not even safe for they to live in the city some one of the party oppose to they everybody suspect those people what other man be there surpass he in esteem excel he in experience or be you vex that we do not choose you what kind of administration would you have give what would you not have do when you get arm and soldier consider that you occasion so many and so great instance of turmoil in you consulship as a result of these elaborate antithesis which you have make you specialty of which alone you be master -lrb- -26 - -rrb- but i return to my point that you be present when it be be vote and say nothing against it but assent to all the measure as be obviously excellent and necessary you do not lack opportunity to speak indeed you roar out considerable that be beside the purpose nor be you afraid of anybody how could you who do not fear the armed warrior have quail before the defenceless man or how have fear he alone when you do not dread he in the possession of many soldier yes you also give yourself air for absolutely despise death as you affirm since these fact be so which of the two senator seem to be in the wrong antony who be manage the force grant he by we or caesar who be surround with such a large band of he own antony who have depart to take up the office commit to he by we or brutus who prevent he from set foot in the country antony who wish to compel we ally to obey we decree or they who have not receive the ruler send they by we but have attach themselves to the man who be vote against antony who keep we soldier together or the soldier who have abandon they commander antony who have introduce not one of these soldier grant he by we into the city or caesar who by money persuade those who have long ago be in service to come here i think there be no further need of argument to answer the imputation that he do not seem to be manage correctly all the duty lay upon he by we and to show that these man ought to suffer punishment for what they have venture on they own responsibility therefore you also secure the guard of soldier that you might discuss in safety the present situation not on account of antony who have cause no trouble privately nor intimidate you in any way but on account of he rival who both have gather a force against he and have often keep many soldier in the city itself -lrb- -27 - -rrb- i have say so much for cicero 's benefit since it be he who begin unfair argument against we i be not generally quarrelsome as he be nor do i care to pry into other ' misdeed as he continually give himself air for do now i will tell you what advice i have to give not favor antony at all nor calumniating caesar or brutus but plan for the common advantage as be proper i declare that we ought not yet to make a enemy of either of these man in arm nor to enquire exactly what they have be do or in what way the present crisis be not suitable for this action and as they be all alike we fellow-citizen if any one of they fail the loss will be ours or if any one of they succeed he aggrandizement will be a menace to we wherefore i believe that we ought to treat they as friend and citizen and send messenger to all of they alike bid they lay down they arm and put themselves and they legion in we hand and that we ought not yet to wage war on any one of they but after they reply have come back approve those who be willing to obey we and fight against the disobedient this course be just and expedient for we -- not to be in a hurry or do anything rashly but to wait and after give the leader themselves and they soldier a opportunity to change they mind then if in such case there be need of war to give the consul charge of it -lrb- -28 - -rrb- and you cicero i advise not to show a womanish sauciness nor to imitate bambalio even in make war -lrb- 18 -rrb- nor because of you private enmity toward antony to plunge the whole city publicly again into danger you will do well if you even become reconcile to he with whom you have often enjoy friendly intercourse but even if you continue embittered against he at least spare we and do not after act as the promoter of friendship among we then destroy it remember that day and the speech which you deliver in the precinct of tellus and yield a little to this goddess of concord under whose guidance we be now deliberate and avoid discrediting those statement and make they appear as if not utter from a sincere heart or by somebody else on that occasion this be to the advantage of the state and will bring you most renown do not think that audacity be either glorious or safe and do not feel sure of be praise just for say that you despise death such man all suspect and hate as be likely to venture some deed of evil through desperation those whom they see however pay greatest attention to they own safety they praise and laud because such would not willingly do anything that merit death do you therefore if you honestly wish you country to be safe speak and act in such a way as will both preserve yourself and not by jupiter involve we in you destruction -lrb- -29 - -rrb- such language from calenus cicero would not endure he himself always speak he mind intemperately and immoderately to all alike but he never think he ought to get a similar treatment from other on this occasion too he give up consider the public interest and set himself to abuse he opponent until that day be spend and naturally for the most part uselessly on the follow day and the third many other argument be adduce on both side but the party of caesar prevail so they vote first a statue to the man himself and the right to deliberate among the ex-quaestor as well as of be a candidate for the other office ten year sooner than custom allow and that he should receive from the city the money which he have spend for he soldier because he have equip they at he own cost for she defense : second that both he soldier and those that have abandon antony should have the privilege of not fight in any other war and that land should be give they at once to antony they send a embassy which should order he to give up the legion leave gaul and withdraw into macedonium -- and to he follower they issue a proclamation to return home before a give day or to know that they would occupy the position of enemy moreover they remove the senator who have receive from he governorship over the province and resolve that other should be send in they place these measure be ratify at that time not long after before learn he decision they vote that a state of rebellion exist change they senatorial garb give charge of the war against he to the consul and caesar -lrb- a kind of pretorian office -rrb- and order lepidus and lucius munatius plancus who be govern a portion of transalpine gaul to render assistance -lrb- -30 - -rrb- in this way do they themselves furnish a excuse for hostility to antony who be without this anxious to make war he be please to receive news of the decree and forthwith violently reproach the envoy with not treat he rightly or fairly as compare with the youth -lrb- meaning caesar -rrb- he also send other in he turn so as to put the blame of the war upon the senator and make some counter-proposition which save he face but be impossible of performance by caesar and those who side with he he intend not to fulfill one of they demand well aware that they too would not take up with anything that he submit he promise however that he would do all that they have determine that he himself might have a refuge in say that he would have do it while at the same time he opponent 's party would be before he in become responsible for the war by refuse the term he lay before they in fine he say that he would abandon gaul and disband he legion if they would grant these soldier the same reward as they have vote to caesar 's and would elect cassius and marcus brutus consul he bring in the name of these man in he request with the purpose that they should not harbor any ill-will toward he for he operation against they fellow-conspirator decimus -lrb- -31 - -rrb- antony make these offer know well that neither of they would be act upon caesar would never have endure that the murderer of he father should become consul or that antony 's soldier by receive the same as he own should feel still more kindly toward he rival nor as a matter of fact be he offer ratify but they again declare war on antony and give notice to he associate to leave he appoint a different day all even such as be not to take the field array themselves in military cloak and they commit to the consul the care of the city attach to the decree the customary clause to the end that it suffer no harm and since there be need of large fund for the war they all contribute the twenty-fifth part of the property they own and the senator also four ass -lrb- 19 -rrb- per tile of all the house in the city that they themselves own or dwelt in belong to other the very wealthy besides donate no little more while many city and many individual manufacture gratuitously weapon and other necessary accoutrements for a campaign the public treasury be at that time so empty that not even the festival which be due to fall during that season be celebrate except some small one out of religious scruple -lrb- -32 - -rrb- these subscription be give readily by those who favor caesar and hate antony the majority however be oppress by the campaign and the tax at once be irritated particularly because it be doubtful which of the two would conquer but quite evident that they would be slave of the conqueror many of those therefore that wish antony well go straight to he among they tribune and a few praetor : other remain in they place one of whom be calenus but do all that they could for he some thing secretly and other thing with a open defense of they conduct hence they do not change they costume immediately and persuade the senate to send envoy again to antony among they cicero : in do this they pretend that the latter might persuade he to make term but they real purpose be that he should be remove from they path he too reflect on this possibility and become alarmed would not venture to expose himself in the camp of antony as a result none of the other envoy set out either -lrb- -33 - -rrb- while this be be do portent of no small moment again occur significant for the city and for the consul vibius himself in the last assembly before they set out for the war a man with the so-called sacred disease -lrb- 20 -rrb- fall down while vibius be speak also a bronze statue of he which stand at the porch of he house turn around of itself on the day and at the hour that he start on the campaign and the sacrifice customary before war could not be interpret by the seer by reason of the quantity of blood likewise a man who be just then bring he a palm slip in the blood which have be shed fall and defile the palm these be the portent in he case now if they have befall he when a private citizen they would have pertain to he alone but since he be consul they have a bearing on all alike they include the follow incident : the figure of the mother of the god on the palatine formerly face the east turn around of its own accord to the west that of minerva hold in honor near mutina where the most fight be go on send forth after this a quantity of blood and milk furthermore the consul take they departure just before the feriae latina and there be no case where this happen that the force fare well so at this time too both the consul and a vast multitude of the people perish some immediately and some later and also many of the knight and senator include the most prominent for in the first place the battle and in the second place the assassination at home which occur again as in the sullan rgime destroy all the flower of they except those actually concern in the murder -lrb- -34 - -rrb- responsibility for these evil rest on the senator themselves for whereas they ought to have set at they head some one man of superior judgment and to have coperated with he continuously they fail to do this but make protgs of a few whom they strengthen against the rest and later undertake to overthrow these favorite as well and consequently they find no one a friend but all hostile the comparative attitude of man toward those who have injure they and toward they benefactor be different for they remember a grudge even against they will but willingly forget to be thankful this be partly because they disdain to appear to have be kindly treat by any person since they will seem to be the weaker of the two and partly because they be irritated at the idea that they will be think to have be injure by anybody with impunity since that will imply cowardice on they part so those senator by not take up with some one person but attach themselves to one and another in turn and voting and do now something for they now something against they suffer much because of they and much also at they hand all the leader have one purpose in the war -- the abolition of the popular power and the set up of a sovereignty some be fight to see whose slave they should be and other to see who should be they master and so both of they equally work havoc and each of they win glory accord to fortune which vary the successful warrior be deem shrewd and patriotic and the defeat one be call both enemy of they country and pestilential fellow -lrb- -35 - -rrb- this be the state that the roman affair have at that time reach : i shall now go on to describe the separate event there seem to I to be a very large amount of self-instruction possible when one take fact as the basis of he reasoning investigate the nature of the former by the latter and then prove he reasoning true by its correspondence with the fact the precise reason for antony 's besiege decimus in mutina be that the latter would not give up gaul to he but he pretend that it be because decimus have be one of caesar 's assassin for since the true cause of the war bring he no credit and at the same time he see the popular party flock to caesar to avenge he father he put forward this excuse for the conflict that it be a mere pretext for get control of gaul he himself make plain in demand that cassius and marcus brutus be appoint consul each of these two utterance of the most opposite character as they be he make with a eye to he own advantage caesar have begin a campaign against he rival before the war be grant he by the vote but have do nothing worthy of importance when he learn of the decree pass he accept the honor and be glad especially because when he be sacrifice at the time of receive the distinction and authority of praetor the liver of all the victim twelve in number be find to be double he be impatient to be sure at the fact that envoy and proposal have be send also to antony instead of unrelenting war be declare against he at once and most of all because he ascertain that the consul have forward some private despatch to he rival about harmony that when some letter send by the latter to certain senator have be capture these official have hand they to the person address conceal the transaction from he and that they be not carry on the war zealously or promptly make the winter they excuse however as he have no means of make know these fact -- for he do not wish to alienate they and on the other hand he be unable to use any persuasion or force -- he stay quiet himself in winter quarter in forum cornelium until he become frightened about decimus -lrb- -36 - -rrb- the latter have previously be vigorously fight antony off on one occasion suspect that some man have be send into the city by he to corrupt the soldier he call all those present together and after give they a few hint proclaim by herald that all the man under arm should go to one side of a certain place that he point out and the private citizen to the other side of it : in this way he detect and arrest antony 's follower who be isolate and do not know which way to turn later he be entirely shut in by a wall and caesar fear he might be capture by storm or capitulate through lack of provision compel hirtius to join a relief party vibius be still in rome raise levy and abolish the law of antony accordingly they start out and without a blow take possession of bononia which have be abandon by the garrison and route the cavalry who later confront they : by reason of the river however near mutina and the guard beside it they find themselves unable to proceed farther they wish notwithstanding even so to make know they presence to decimus that he might not in undue season make term and at first they try send signal from the tallest tree but since he do not understand they scratch a few word on a thin sheet of lead and roll it up like a piece of paper give it to a diver to carry across under water by night thus decimus learn at the same time of they presence and they promise of assistance and send they a reply in the same fashion after which they continue uninterruptedly to communicate all they plan to each other -lrb- -37 - -rrb- antony therefore see that decimus be not incline to yield leave he to the charge of he brother lucius and himself proceed against caesar and hirtius the two army face each other for a number of day and a few insignificant cavalry battle occur with honor even finally the celtic cavalry of whom caesar have gain possession along with the elephant withdraw to antony 's side again they have start from the camp with the rest and have go on ahead as if intend to engage separately those of the enemy who come to meet they but after a little they turn about and unexpectedly attack those follow behind -lrb- who do not stand they ground -rrb- kill many of they after this some forage party on both side fall to blow and when the remainder of each party come to the rescue a sharp battle ensue between the two force in which antony be victorious elate by he success and in the knowledge that vibius be approach he assail the antagonist ' fortification think possibly to destroy it beforehand and make the rest of the conflict easier they in consideration of they disaster and the hope which vibius inspire keep guard but would not come out for battle hence antony leave behind there a certain portion of he army with order to come to close quarter with they and so make it appear as much as possible that he himself be there and at the same time to take good care that no one should fall upon he rear after issue these injunction he set out secretly by night against vibius who be approach from bononia by a ambush he succeed in wound the latter severely in kill the majority of he soldier and confine the rest within they rampart he would have annihilate they have he proceed to besiege they for any time at all as it be after accomplish nothing at the first assault he begin to be alarm lest while he be delay he should receive some setback from caesar and the rest so he again turn against they wearied by the journey both way and by the battle he be also in doubt whether he should find that he opponent have conquer the force hostile to they and in this condition he be confront by hirtius and suffer a decisive defeat for when hirtius and caesar perceive what be go on the latter remain to keep watch over the camp while the former set out against antony -lrb- -38 - -rrb- upon the latter 's defeat not only hirtius be salute as imperator by the soldier and by the senate but likewise vibius though he have fare badly and caesar who have do no fighting even to those who have participate in the conflict and have perish there be vote a public burial and it be resolve that the prize of war which they have take while alive should be restore to they father and son follow this official action pontius aquilum one of the assassin and a lieutenant of decimus conquer in battle titus munatius plancus who oppose he and decimus when a certain senator desert to antony so far from display anger toward he send back all he baggage and whatever else he have leave behind in mutina the result be that the affection of many of antony 's soldier grow cool and some of the nation which have previously sympathize with he proceed to rebel : caesar and hirtius however be elate at this and approach the fortification of antony challenge he to combat he for a time be alarmed and remain quiet but later when some reinforcement send by lepidus come to he he take courage lepidus himself do not make it clear to which of the two side he send the army : he think well of antony who be a relative but have be summon against he by the senate and for these reason he make plan to have a refuge in store with both party by not give to marcus silanus the commander order that be in the least clear but he doubtless know well he master 's frame of mind go on he own responsibility to antony -lrb- -39 - -rrb- so when the latter have be thus assist he become bold and make a sudden sally from the gate : there be great slaughter on both side but at last he turn and flee up to this time caesar be be strengthen by the people and the senate and because of this expect that among other honor to be bestow he would be forthwith appoint consul it happen that hirtius perish in the occupation of antony 's camp and vibius die of he wound not long after so that caesar be charge with have cause they death that he might succeed to the office but the senate have previously while it be still uncertain which of the two would prevail do away with all the privilege which formerly grant to any person beyond the custom of the forefather have pave the way to sovereignty : they vote that this edict should apply to both party intend by it to anticipate the victor while lay the blame upon the other who should be defeat first they forbid any one to hold office more than a year and second that any superintendent of grain supplies or commissioner of food should be choose when they ascertain the outcome they rejoice at antony 's defeat change they raiment once more and celebrate a solemn thanksgiving for sixty -lrb- 21 -rrb- day all those array on he side they hold in the light of enemy and take possession of they property as they do of the leader 's -lrb- -40 - -rrb- nor do they propose that caesar any longer should receive any great reward but even undertake to overthrow he by allow decimus to secure all the prize for which he be hope they vote decimus not only the right of sacrifice but a triumph and give he charge of the rest of the war and of the legion -- those of vibius and other upon the soldier that have be besiege with he they resolve that eulogy should be bestow and all the other reward which have formerly be offer to caesar 's man although these troops have contribute nothing to the victory but have merely behold it from the wall aquilum who have die in the battle they honor with a image and restore to he heir the money which he have expend from he own purse for the equipment of decimus 's soldier in a word practically every advantage that have be give caesar against antony be vote to other against the man himself and to the end that no matter how much he might wish it he should not be able to do any harm they arm all he enemy against he to sextus pompey they entrust the fleet to marcus brutus macedonium and to cassius syrium together with the war against dolabellum they would certainly have further deprive he of the force that he have but they be afraid to vote this openly owe to they knowledge that he soldier be devote to he still even so they strive to set he follower at variance with one another and with he they do not wish to approve and honor all of they for fear they should fill they with too great conceit nor again to dishonor and neglect all for fear they should alienate they the more and as a consequence force they to agree together hence they adopt a middle course and by approve some of they and other not by allow some to wear a olive garland at the festival and other not and furthermore by vote to some money to the extent of twenty-five hundred denarius and to other not a farthe they hope to bring about between they and by that mean weaken they -lrb- -41 - -rrb- those charge with these commission also they send not to caesar but to the man in the field he become enraged at this but nominally allow the envoy to mix with the army without he presence though he send word beforehand that no answer should be give and that he himself should be at once send for so when he come into the camp and join they in listen to the despatch he succeed in conciliate they much more by that very action those who have be prefer in honor be not so delighted at this precedence as they be suspicious of the affair particularly as a result of caesar 's influence and those who have be slight be not at all angry at they comrade but add they doubt of the sincerity of the decree impute they dishonor to all and share they anger with they the people in the city on learn this though frightened do not even so appoint he consul for which he be most anxious but grant he the distinction of consular honor so that he might now record he vote along with the ex-consul when he take no account of this they vote that he should be make a praetor of the first rank and subsequently also consul in this way do they think they have handle caesar cleverly as if he be in reality a mere youth and child as they be always repeat he however be exceedingly vex at they general behavior and especially at this very fact that he be call child and so make no further delay but turn against they camp and power with antony he secretly arrange a truce and he assemble the man who have escape from the battle whom he himself have conquer and the senate have vote to be enemy and in they presence make many accusation against both the senate and the people -lrb- -42 - -rrb- the people in the city on hearing this for a time hold he in contempt but when they hear that antony and lepidus have become of one mind they begin again to court he favor -- for they be in ignorance of the proposition he have make to antony -- and assign to he charge of the war against the two caesar be accordingly ready to accept even this if he could be make consul for it he be work in every way to be elect through cicero among other and so earnestly that he promise to make he he colleague when he be not even then choose he make preparation to be sure to carry on war as have be decree but meanwhile arrange that he own soldier -lrb- of they own motion of course -rrb- should suddenly take a oath not to fight against any legion that have be caesar 's this have a bearing on lepidus and antony since the majority of they adherent be of that class so he wait and send as envoy to the senate on this business four hundred of the soldier themselves -lrb- -43 - -rrb- this be the excuse that they have for a embassy but in addition they demand the money that have be vote they and urge that caesar be appoint consul while the senator be postpone they reply which require deliberation as they say they ask -lrb- naturally on the instruction from caesar -rrb- that amnesty be grant to some one who have embrace antony 's cause they be not really anxious to obtain it but want to test the senator and see if they would grant the request or if such be not the issue whether to pretend to be displeased about it would serve as a start point for indignation they fail to gain they petition for while no one speak against it there be many prefer the same request on behalf of other and thus among a mass of similar representation they demand also be reject on some plausible excuse then they openly show they anger and one of they issue from the senate-chamber and grasp a sword -lrb- they have go in unarmed -rrb- say : if you do not grant the consulship to caesar this shall grant it and cicero interrupt he answer : if you exhort in this way he will get it now for cicero this instrument have destruction in readiness caesar do not censure the soldier 's act but make a complaint because they have be oblige to lay aside they arm on enter the senate and because one of they be ask whether they have be send by the legion or by caesar he summon in haste antony and lepidus -lrb- whom he have attach to he through friendship for antony -rrb- and he himself pretend to have be force to such measure by he soldier set out with all of they against rome -lrb- -44 - -rrb- some -lrb- 22 -rrb- of the knight and other who be present they suspect be act as spy and they consequently slew they besides injure the land of such as be not in accord with they and do much other damage with this excuse the senator on ascertain they approach send they they money before they come near hope that when the invader receive that they might retire and when they still press on they appoint caesar consul nothing however be gain by this step the soldier be not at all grateful to they for what they have do not willingly but under compulsion but be even more embolden in the idea that they have thoroughly frightened they learn of this the senate alter its policy and bid the host not approach the city but remain over one hundred and fifty stadium from it they themselves also change they garb again and commit to the praetor the care of the city as have be the custom and besides garrison other point they occupy janiculum in advance with the soldier that be at hand and with other from africa -lrb- -45 - -rrb- while caesar be still on the march this be the condition of thing and all the people who be at that time in rome with one accord seek a share in the proceedings as the majority of man be wont to be bold until they come in sight and have a taste of danger when however he arrive in the suburb they be alarm and first some of the senator later many of the people go over to he side thereupon the praetor also come down from janiculum and surrender to he they soldier and themselves thus caesar take possession of the city without a blow and be appoint consul also by the people though two proconsul be choose to hold the election it be impossible accord to precedent for a interrex to be create for so short a period merely to superintend the comitium because many man who hold the curule office be absent from the city they endure have the two proconsul name by the praetor urbanus rather than to have the consul elect under he direction because now these proconsular official would limit they activity to the election and consequently would appear to have be invest with no power outlast they -lrb- 23 -rrb- this be of course do under pressure of arm caesar that he might appear to not to have use any force upon they do not enter the assembly -- as if it be he presence that any one fear instead of he power -lrb- -46 - -rrb- thus he be choose consul and there be give he as a fellow-official -- perhaps one ought to say _ under _ - official -- quintus pedius he be very proud of this fact that he be to be consul at a earlier age than it have ever be the lot of any one else and further that on the first day of the election when he have enter the campus martius he see six vulture and later while harangue the soldier twelve other for compare it with romulus and the omen that have befall the latter he begin to expect that he should obtain he sovereignty he do not however simply on the ground that he have already be give the distinction of the consular honor assume distinction as be consul for the second time this custom be since then observe in all similar case to we own day the emperor severus be the first to change it for he honor plautianus with the consular honor and afterward introduce he to the senate and appoint he consul proclaim that he be enter the consulship the second time in imitation of he the same thing be do in other instance caesar accordingly arrange affair in general in the city to suit he taste and give money to the soldier to some what have be vote from the fund prescribe and to the rest individually from he private fund as the story go but in reality from the public store in this way and for the reason mention do the soldier receive the money on that occasion but some of they get a wrong idea of the matter and think it be compulsory for absolutely all the citizen force at all time to be give the twenty-five hundred denarius if they go to rome under arm for this reason the follower of severus who have come to the city to overthrow julianus behave most terrifyingly both to they leader himself and to we while demand it and they be win over by severus with two hundred and fifty denarius while people in general be ignorant what claim be be set up -lrb- -47 - -rrb- caesar while give the soldier the money also express to they he fullest and sincerest thanks he do not even venture to enter the senate-chamber without a guard of they to the senate he show gratitude but it be all fictitious and pretend for he be accept as if it be a favor receive from willing hand what he have attain by violence and they actually take great credit to themselves for they behavior as if they have give he the office voluntarily and moreover they grant to he whom previously they have not even wish to choose consul the right after he term expire to be honor as often as he should be in camp above all those who be consul at one time or another to he on whom they have threaten to inflict penalty because he have gather force on he own responsibility without the passing of any vote they assign the duty of collect other : and to the man for whose disenfranchisement and overthrow they have order decimus to fight with antony they add decimus 's legion finally he obtain the guardianship of the city so that he be able to do everything that he wish accord to law and he be adopt into caesar 's family in the regular way as a consequence change he name he have as some think be even before this accustomed to call himself caesar as soon as this name be bequeath to he together with the inheritance he be not however exact about he title nor do he use the same one in deal with everybody until at this time he have ratify it in accordance with ancestral custom and be thus name after he famous predecessor gaius julius caesar octavianus for it be the custom when a person be adopt for he to take most of he appellation from he adopter but to keep one of he previous name slightly alter in form this be the status of the matter but i shall call he not octavianus but caesar because this name have prevail among all such as secure dominion over the roman he take another one in addition namely _ augustus _ and therefore the subsequent emperor assume it that one will be give when it come up in the history but until then the title caesar will be sufficient to show that octavianus be indicate -lrb- -48 - -rrb- this caesar then as soon as he have conciliate the soldier and enslave the senate turn himself to avenge he father 's murder as he be afraid of somehow cause a upheaval among the populace in the pursuit of this business he do not make known he intention until he have see to the payment of the bequest make to they when they have be make docile by means of the money although it belong to the public fund and have be collect on the pretext of war then at length he begin to follow up the assassin in order that this procedure of he might not appear to be characterize by violence but by justice he propose a law about they trial and try the case in they absence the majority of they be out of town and some even hold governorship over province those who be present also do not come forward by reason of fear and withdraw unobserved consequently they be convict by default and not only those who have be the actual murderer of caesar and they fellow-conspirator but many other who so far from plot against caesar have not even be in the city at the time this action be direct chiefly against sextus pompey the latter though he have have no share whatever in the attack be nevertheless condemn because he have be a enemy those adjudged guilty be debar from fire and water and they property be confiscate the province -- not only those which some of they be govern but all the rest -- be commit to the friend of caesar -lrb- -49 - -rrb- among those hold liable be also publius servilius casca the tribune he have suspect caesar 's purpose in advance before he enter the city and have quietly slipped away for this act he be at once remove from he office on the charge of have leave the city contrary to precedent by the populace convene by he colleague publius titius and in this way he be condemn when titius not long after die the proverbial fate that have be observe from of old be once more in evidence no one up to that time who have expel a colleague have live the year out : but first brutus after the expulsion of collatinus die in he turn then gracchus be stab after expel octavius and cinna who put marullus and flavus out of the way not long after perish this have be the general experience now the assassin of caesar have many accuser who be anxious to ingratiate themselves with he son and many who be persuade so to act by the reward offer they receive money from the estate of the convict man and the latter 's honor and office if he have any and exemption from further service in the army applicable to themselves and they child and grandchild of the juror the majority vote against the accuse out of fear of caesar and a wish to please he generally hint that they be justify in do this some cast they vote in consideration of the law enact about punish the culprit and other in consideration of the arm of caesar and one silicius corona a senator vote outright to acquit marcus brutus he make a great boast of this at the time and secretly receive approval from the rest : that he be not immediately put to death gain for caesar a great reputation for toleration but later he be execute as the result of a proscription -lrb- -50 - -rrb- after accomplish this caesar 's next step be naturally a campaign against lepidus and antony antony on flee from the battle describe have not be pursue by caesar on account of the war be entrust to decimus and the latter have not pursue because he do not wish a rival to caesar to be remove from the field hence the fugitive collect as many as he could of the survivor of the battle and come to lepidus who have make preparation to march himself into italy in accordance with the decree but have again be order to remain where he be for the senator when they ascertain that silanus have embrace antony 's cause be afraid that lepidus and lucius plancus might also coperate with he and send to they to say that they have no further need of they to prevent they suspect anything ulterior and consequently cause trouble they order they to help in build home for the man once drive out of vienna -lrb- in gallium narbonensis -rrb- by the allobroge and then located between the rhone and the arar at they confluence therefore they submit and found the so-called lugudunum now know as lugdunum they might have enter italy with they arm have they wish for the decree by this time exert a very weak influence upon such as have troops but with a eye to the outcome of the war antony be conduct they wish to appear to have yield obedience to the senate and incidentally to strengthen they position -lrb- -51 - -rrb- indeed lepidus censure silanus severely for make a alliance with antony and when the latter himself come would not hold conversation with he immediately but send a despatch to the senate contain a accusation of he own against he and for this stand he receive praise and command of the war against antony hence the first part of the time he neither admit antony nor repel he but allow he to be near and to associate with he follower he would not however hold a conference with he but when he ascertain antony 's agreement with caesar he then come to term with both of they himself marcus juventius -lrb- 24 -rrb- he lieutenant learn what be be do and at first try to alter he purpose then when he do not succeed in persuade he he make away with himself in the sight of the soldier for this the senate vote eulogy and a statue to juventius and a public funeral but lepidus they deprive of he image which stand upon the rostrum and make he a enemy they also set a certain day for he comrade and threaten they with war if they should not abandon he before that day furthermore they change they clothing again -- they have resume citizen 's apparel in honor of caesar 's consulship -- and summon marcus brutus and cassius and sextus to proceed against they when the latter seem likely to be too slow in respond they commit the war to caesar be ignorant of the conspiracy exist -lrb- -52 - -rrb- he nominally receive it in spite of have make he soldier give voice to a sentiment previously mention -lrb- 25 -rrb- but accomplish no corresponding result this be not because he have form a compact with antony and through he with lepidus -- little he care for that fact -- but because he see they be powerful and know they purpose be link by the band of kinship and he could not use force with they and besides he cherish hope of bring about through they the downfall of cassius and brutus who be already very influential and subsequently of wear they out one against the other accordingly even against he will he keep he covenant with they and direct he effort to effect a reconciliation for they with the senate and with the people he do not himself propose the matter lest some suspicion of what have really take place should arise but he set out as if to make war on they while quintus urge as if it be he own idea that amnesty and restoration be grant they he do not secure this however until the senate have communicate it to the supposedly ignorant caesar and he have unwillingly agree to it compel as he allege by the soldier -lrb- -53 - -rrb- while this be be do decimus at first set forth in the intention of make war upon the pair and associate with he lucius planeus since the latter have be appoint in advance as he colleague for the following year learn however of he own condemnation and of they reconciliation he wish to lead a campaign against caesar but be abandon by plancus who favor the cause of lepidus and antony then he decide to leave gaul and hasten into macedonium on land through illyricum to marcus brutus and send ahead some of the soldier while he be engage in finish some business he have in hand but they embrace caesar 's cause and the rest be pursue by lepidus and antony and then be win over through the agency of other so be desert he be seize by a personal foe when he be about to be execute he complain and lament so loudly that one helvius blasio who be kindly dispose to he from association on campaign in he sight voluntarily slew himself first -lrb- -54 - -rrb- so decimus afterward die also antony and lepidus leave lieutenant in gaul and themselves proceed to join caesar in italy take with they the larger and the better part of they army they do not trust he very far and wish not to owe he any favor but to seem to have obtain amnesty and restoration on they own merit and by they own strength and not through he they also hope to become master of whatever they desire of caesar and the rest in the city by the size of they army with such a feeling they march through the country accord it friendly treatment still it be damage by they number and audacity no less than if there have be a war they be meet near bononium by caesar with many soldier : he be exceedingly well prepare to defend himself against they if they should offer any violence yet at this time he find no need of arm to oppose they they really hate one another bitterly but because they have just about equal force and desire one another 's assistance to take vengeance first on the rest of they enemy they enter upon a simulated agreement -lrb- -55 - -rrb- they come together to confer not alone but bring a equal number of soldier on a little island in the river that flow past bononia with the understanding that no one else should be present on either side first they withdraw to a distance from the various follower and search one another carefully to make sure that no one have a dagger hide under he arm then they consider at leisure different point and in general make a solemn compact for secure sovereignty and overthrow enemy but to prevent its appear that they be head straight toward a oligarchy and so envy and opposition arise on the part of the people at large the three be to be choose in common as a kind of commissioner and corrector for the administration and settlement of affair this office be not to be perpetual but for five year under the general proviso that they should manage all question whether they make any communication about they to the people and the senate or not and give the office and other honor to whomsoever they please the private arrangement however in order that they should not be think to be appropriate the entire sovereignty be that both libyas sardinia and sicily should be give to caesar all of spain and gallium narbonensis to lepidus and the rest of gaul south and north of the alp to antony to rule the former be call gallium toga as i have say because it seem to be more peaceful than the other division and because the dweller there already employ roman citizen-garb : the other be term gallium coma because the gaul there mostly let they hair grow long and be in this way distinguish from the other -lrb- -56 - -rrb- so they make these allotment for the purpose of secure the strongest province themselves and give other the impression that they be not strive for the whole a further agreement be that they should cause assassination of they enemy that lepidus after be appoint consul in decimus 's stead should keep guard over rome and the remainder of italy and that the other should make a expedition against brutus and cassius they also pledge themselves to this course by oath after this in order to let the soldier hear and be witness of the term they have make they call they together and make know to they in advance all that it be proper and safe to tell they meanwhile the soldier of antony of course at the latter 's direction commit to caesar 's charge the daughter of fulvium -lrb- antony 's wife -rrb- whom she have by clodius -- and this in spite of caesar 's be already betroth to another he however do not refuse she for he do not think this inter-marriage would hinder he at all in the design which he have against antony among other point for he reflection be he knowledge that he father caesar have not fail to carry out all of he plan against pompey in spite of the relationship between the two dio 's roman history 47 the following be contain in the forty-seventh of dio 's rome : how caesar antony and lepidus come to rome and institute a reign of slaughter -lrb- chapter 1-19 -rrb- about brutus and cassius and what they do before the battle of philippus -lrb- chapter 20-36 -rrb- how brutus and cassius be defeat by caesar and perish -lrb- chapter 37-49 -rrb- duration of time the remainder of the consulship of gaius vibius pansa and aulus hirtius together with one additional year in which there be the follow magistrate here enumerate : m aemilius mf lepidus cos -lrb- ii -rrb- l munatius lf plancus -lrb- bc 42 = a u 712 -rrb- -lrb- _ book 47 boissevain _ -rrb- -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 711 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -1 - -rrb- after form these compact and take mutual oath they hasten to rome under the assumption that they be all go to rule on equal term but each one have the intention of get the entire power himself yet they have learn in advance very clearly before this but most plainly at this time what would be the future in the case of lepidus a serpent coil about a centurion 's sword and a wolf that enter he camp and he tent while he be eat dinner and knock down the table indicate at once power and disappointment as a result of power : in that of antony milk flow about the rampart and a kind of chant echo about at night signify gladness of heart and destruction succeed it these portent befall they before they enter italy in caesar 's case at the very time after the covenant have be make a eagle settle upon he tent and kill two crow that attack it and try to pluck out its feather -- a sign which grant he victory over he two rival -lrb- -2 - -rrb- so they come to rome first caesar then the other each one separately with all they soldier and immediately through the tribune enact such law as pleased they the order they give and force that they use thus acquire the name of law and furthermore bring they supplication for they require to be besought earnestly when they be to pass any measure consequently sacrifice be vote for they as if for good fortune and the people change they attire as if they have secure prosperity although they be considerably terrify by the transaction and still more by omen for the standard of the army guard the city be cover with spider and weapon be see reach up from earth to heaven while a great din resound from they and in the shrine of aesculapius bee gather in number on the roof and crowd of vulture settle on the temple of the genius populus and on that of concord -lrb- -3 - -rrb- and while these condition still remain practically unchanged those murder by proscription which sullum have once cause be put into effect and the whole city be fill with corpse many be kill in they house many in the street and scatter about in the forum and near the temple : the head of such be once more attach to the rostrum and they trunk fling out to be devour by the dog and bird or cast into the river everything that have be do before in the day of sullum find a counterpart at this time except that only two white tablet be post one for the senator and one for the rest the reason for this i have not be able to learn from any one else nor to find out myself the cause which one might have imagine that fewer be put to death be least of all true : for many more name be list because there be more leader concern in this respect then the case differ from the murder that have earlier take place : but that the name of those prominent be not post with the rabble but separately appear very nonsensical to the man who be to be murder in the same way besides this no few other very unpleasant condition fall to they lot although the former rgime one would have say have leave nothing to be surpass -lrb- -4 - -rrb- but in sullum 's time those guilty of such murderous measure have some excuse in they very hardihood : they be try the method for the first time and not with set intention hence in most case they behave less maliciously since they be act not accord to definite plan but as chance dictate and the victim succumb to sudden and unheard of catastrophe find some alleviation in the unexpectedness of they experience at this time on the other hand they be execute in person or beholding or at least understanding thoroughly by fresh description merely deed that have be dare before in the interval expect a recurrence of similar act some be invent various new method to employ and other be become afflict by new fear that they too should suffer the perpetrator resort to most unusual device in they emulation of the outrage of yore and they consequent eagerness to add through the resource of art novel feature to they attempt the other reflect on all that they might suffer and hence even before they body be harm they spirit be thoroughly on the rack as if they be already undergo the trial -lrb- -5 - -rrb- another reason for they faring worse on this occasion than before be that previously only sullum 's own enemy and the foe of the leader associate with he be destroy : among he friend and the people in general no one perish at he bidding so that except the very wealthy -- and these can never be at peace with the stronger element at such a time -- the remainder take courage in this second series of assassination however not only the man 's enemy or the rich be be kill but also they best friend and quite without look for it on the whole it may be say that almost nobody have incur the enmity of those man from any private cause that should account for he be slay by they politics and compromise regard post of authority have create both they friendship and they violent hatred all those that have aid or assist one of the group in any way the other hold in the light of a enemy so it come about that the same person have become friend to some one of they and enemy to the entire body so that while each be privately quell he antagonist they destroy the dearest friend of all in general in the course of they joint negotiation -lrb- 26 -rrb- they make a kind of account of who be on they side and who be oppose and no one be allow to take vengeance on one of he own enemy who be a friend of another without give up some friend in he turn : and because of they anger over what be past and they suspicion of the future they care nothing about the preservation of a associate in comparison with vengeance on a adversary and so give they up without much protest -lrb- -6 - -rrb- thus they offer one another staunch friend for bitter enemy and implacable foe for close comrade and sometimes they exchange even number at other several for one or fewer for more altogether carry on the transaction as if at a market and overbid one another as at a auction room if some one be find just equivalent to another and the two be rank alike the exchange be a simple one but all whose value be raise by some excellence or esteem or relationship could be despatch only in return for several as there have be civil war last a long time and embrace many event not a few man during the turmoil have come into collision with they nearest relative indeed lucius caesar antony 's uncle have become he enemy and lepidus 's brother lucius paulus hostile to he the life of these be save but many of the rest be slaughter even in the house of they very friend and relative from whom they especially expect protection and honor and in order that no person should feel less inclined to kill any one out of fear of be deprive of the reward -lrb- remember that in the time of sullum marcus cato who be quaestor have demand of some of the murderer all they have receive for they work -rrb- they proclaim that the name of no proscribed person should be register in the public record on this account they slew ordinary citizen more readily and make away with the prosperous even though they have no dislike for a single one of they for since they stand in need of vast sum of money and have no other source from which to satisfy the desire of they soldier they affect a kind of common enmity against the rich among the other transgression they commit in the line of this policy be to declare a mere child of age so that they might kill he as already exercise the privilege of a man -lrb- -7 - -rrb- most of this be do by lepidus and antony they have be honor by the former caesar for a very long time and as they have be in office and hold governorship most of the period they have many enemy it appear as if caesar have a part in the business merely because of he share the authority for he himself be not at all anxious to kill any large number he be not naturally cruel and have be bring up in he father 's way moreover as he be young and have just enter the political arena there be no inevitable necessity for he bitterly hate many person and he wish to have people 's affection this be indicate by the fact that from the time he break off he joint rulership with he colleague and hold the power alone he do nothing of the sort and at this time he not only refrain from destroy many but preserve a large number those also who betray they master or friend he treat most harshly and those who help anybody most leniently a instance of it occur in the case of tanusium a woman of note she conceal she husband titus vinius who be proscribe at first in a chest at the house of a freedman name philopoeman -lrb- 27 -rrb- and so make it appear that he have be kill later she wait for a national festival which a relative of hers be to direct and through the influence of he sister octavium bring it about that caesar alone of the three enter the theater then she spring up and inform he of the deception of which he be still ignorant bring in the very chest and lead from it she husband caesar astonished release all of they -lrb- death be the penalty also for such as conceal any one -rrb- and enrol philopoeman among the knight -lrb- -8 - -rrb- he then save the life of as many as he could lepidus allow he brother paulus to escape to miletus and toward other be not inexorable but antony kill savagely and relentlessly not only those whose name have be post but likewise those who have attempt to assist any of they he have they head in view when he happen to be eat and sate himself to the fullest extent on this most unholy and pitiable sight fulvium also put to death many herself both by reason of enmity and on account of they money and some with whom she husband be not acquaint when he see the head of one man he exclaim : i do not know about he cicero 's head also be bring to they -lrb- he have be overtake and slay while try to flee -rrb- antony utter many bitter reproach against he and then order it to be expose on the rostrum more prominently than the rest in order that he might be see in the place from which he use to be hear inveigh against he -- together with he right hand just as it have be cut off before it be take away fulvia take it in she hand and after abuse it spitefully and spit upon it set it on she knee open the mouth and pull out the tongue which she pierce with the brooch that she use for she hair at the same time utter many brutal jest yet even this pair save some person from whom they get more money than they could expect to obtain by they death but in order that the place for they name on the tablet might not be empty they inscribe other in they stead except that antony do release he uncle at the earnest entreaty of he mother julium he perform no other praiseworthy act -lrb- -9 - -rrb- for these cause the murder have great variety of detail and the rescue that fall to the lot of some be of many kind number be ruin by they most intimate friend and number be save by they most inveterate foe some slew themselves and other be give freedom by the very pursuer who approach as if to murder they some who betray master or friend be punish and other be honor for this very reason : of those who help other to survive some pay the penalty and other receive reward since there be not one man but three who be act in all case each accord to he own desire and for he private advantage and since the same person be not enemy or friend of the whole group since also two of they might be anxious for some one to be save whom the third wish to destroy or for some one to perish whom the third wish to survive many complicated situation result accord as they feel good-will or hatred toward any one -lrb- -10 - -rrb- i accordingly shall omit a accurate and detailed description of all the event -- it would be a vast undertaking and would not add much to the history -- but shall relate what i deem to be most worthy of remembrance here be one a slave have hide he master in a cave and then when even so through another 's information he be likely to perish this slave change clothes with he and wear he master 's apparel confront the pursuer as the man himself and be slay so they be turn aside think they have despatch the desire man but he when they have depart make he escape to some other place or a second another slave have likewise change he entire accoutrement with he master and enter a covered litter which he make the other help to carry when they be overtake the one in the litter be kill without be even look at and the master as a baggage-carrier be save those service be render by those servant to they benefactor in return for some kindness previously receive there be also a branded runaway who so far from betray the man who have brand he very willingly preserve he he be detect in carry he away and be be pursue when he kill somebody who meet he by chance and give the latter 's clothes to he master have then place he upon a pyre he himself take he master 's clothing and ring and go to meet the pursuer pretend that he have kill the man while flee because of he spoil and the mark of the brand he be believe and both save the person in question and be himself honor the name connect with the above anecdote have not be preserve but in the case of hosidius greta he son arrange a funeral for he as though already dead and preserved he in that way quintus cicero the brother of marcus be secretly lead away by he child and save so far as he rescuer 's responsibility go the boy conceal he father so well that he could not be discover and when torment for it by all kind of torture do not utter a syllable he father learn what be be do be fill at once with admiration and pity for the boy and therefore come voluntarily to view and surrender himself to the slayer -lrb- -11 - -rrb- this give a idea of the greatness of the manifest achievement of virtue and piety at the time it be popillius laena who kill marcus cicero in spite of the latter 's have do he favor as he advocate and in order that he might depend not wholly on hearsay but also on the sense of sight to establish himself as the murderer of the orator he set up a image of himself wear a crown beside he victim 's head with a inscription that give he name and the service render by this act he please antony so much that he secure more than the price offer marcus terentius varro be a man who have give no offence but as he appellation be identical with that of one of the proscribed except for one name he be afraid that this might lead he to suffer such a fate as do cinna therefore he issue a statement make know this fact he be tribune at the time for this he become the subject of much idle amusement and laughter the uncertainty of life however be evidence by the very fact that lucius philuscius who have previously be proscribe by sullum and have escape have he name now inscribe again on the tablet and perish whereas marcus valerius messalum condemn to death by antony not only continue to live in safety but be later appoint consul in place of antony himself thus many survive from inextricable difficulty and no fewer be ruin through a spirit of confidence hence a man ought not to be alarm to the point of hopelessness by the calamity of the moment nor to be elate to heedlessness by temporary exultation but by place he hope of the future half-way between both to make reliable calculation for either event -lrb- -12 - -rrb- this be the way it befall at that time : very many of those not proscribe be involve in the downfall of other on account of spite or money and very many whose name be proclaim not only survive but return to they home again and some of they even hold office they have a refuge of course with brutus and cassius and sextus and the majority direct they flight toward the last mention he have be choose formerly to command the fleet and have hold sway for some time on the sea so that he have surround himself with a force of he own though he be afterward deprive of he office by caesar he have occupy sicily and then when the order of proscription be pass against he too a host of assassination take place he aid greatly those who be in like condition anchoring near the coast of italy he send word to rome and to the other city offer among other thing to those who save anybody double the reward advertise for murder the same and promising to the man themselves a reception and assistance and money and honor -lrb- -13 - -rrb- therefore great number come to he i have not even now record the precise total of those who be proscribe or slaughter or who escape because many name originally inscribe on the tablet be erase and many be later inscribe in they place and of these not a few be save while many outside of these succumb it be not even allow anybody to mourn for the victim but several perish from this cause also and finally when the calamity break through all the pretence they could assume and no one even of the most stout-hearted could any longer wear a air of indifference to they but in all they work and conversation they countenance be overcast and they be not intend to celebrate the usual festival at the beginning of the year they be order by a public notice to appear in good spirit on pain of death if they should refuse to obey so they be force to rejoice over the common evil as over blessing yet why need i have mention it when they vote to those man -lrb- the triumvir i mean -rrb- civic crown and other distinction as to benefactor and savior of the state they do not think of be hold to blame because they be kill a few but wish to receive additional praise for not put more out of the way and to the populace they once openly state that they have emulate neither the cruelty of marius and sullum so as to incur hatred nor the mildness of caesar so as to be despise and as a result become object of a conspiracy -lrb- -14 - -rrb- such be the condition of the murder but many other unusual proceedings take place in regard to the property of person leave alive they actually announce as if they be just and humane ruler that they would give to the widow of the slay they dowry to the male child a tenth and to the female child a twentieth of the property of each one 's father this be not however grant save in a few case : of the rest all the possession without exception be ruthlessly plunder in the first place they levy upon all the house in the city and those in the rest of italy a yearly rent which be the entire amount from dwelling which people have let and half from such as they occupy themselves with reference to the value of the domicile again from those who have land they take away half of the proceeds besides they have the soldier get they support free from the city in which they be winter and distribute they to various rural district pretend that they be send to take charge of confiscate territory or that of person who still oppose they for this last class they have term likewise enemy because they have not change they attitude before the appoint day so that the whole country outside the town be also pillage the autocrat allow the soldier to do this to the end that have they pay before the work they might devote all they energy to they commander ' interest and promise to give they city and land : and with this in view they further assign to they person to divide the land and settle they the mass of the soldier be make loyal by this course : of the more prominent they tempt some with the goods of those that have be despatch by lower the price on certain article and grant other to they free and other they honor with the office and priesthood of the victim the commander to make sure that they themselves should get the finest both of land and building and give they follower what they please give notice that no one else should frequent the auction room unless he want to buy something : whoever do so should die and they handle bona fide purchaser in such a way that the latter discover nothing and pay the very highest price for what they want and consequently have no desire to buy again -lrb- -15 - -rrb- this be the course follow in regard to possession as to the office and priesthood of such as have be put to death they distribute they not in the fashion prescribe by law but however it suit they caesar resign the office of consul give up willingly that which he have so desire as to make war for it and he colleague give up he place whereupon they appoint publius ventidius though praetor and one other and to the former 's praetorship they promote one of the aedile afterward they remove all the praetor -lrb- who hold office five day longer than ventidius -rrb- and send they to be governor of the province while they install other in they place some law be abolish and other introduce instead and in brief they order everything else just as seem good to they they do not to be sure lay claim to title which be offensive and have be therefore do away with but they manage matter accord to they own wish and desire so that caesar 's sovereignty by comparison appear all gold -lrb- bc 42 -lrb- _ a u _ 712 -rrb- -rrb- in addition to transact that year the business mention they vote a temple to serapi and isis -lrb- -16 - -rrb- when marcus lepidus and lucius plancus become consul tablet be again expose not bring death to any one any longer but defraud the living of they property they be collect fund because they be in need of more money due to the fact that they owe large sum to large number of soldier be expend considerable on work undertake by the latter and think they should lay out far more still on war in prospect the fact that those tax which have be formerly abrogate be now again put in force or establish on a new basis and the institution of joint contribution many of which keep be levy on the land and on the servant displeased people moderately it can not be deny but to have those who be in the slightest degree still prosperous not only of the senator or knight but even among the freedman and man and woman alike bulletine on the tablet and another tenth of they wealth confiscate disturbed all beyond measure for it be only nominally that a tenth of he property be exact from each one : in reality not so much as a tenth be leave they be not order to contribute a state amount accord to the value of they possession but they have the duty of estimate they own goods and then be accuse of not have make a fair estimate they lose the rest besides -lrb- -17 - -rrb- if any still escape this somehow yet they be bring into strait by the assessment and as they be terribly destitute of money they too be in a way deprive of everything moreover the follow device distressing to hear but most distressing in practice be put into operation whoever of they wish be allow by abandon he property afterward to make a requisition for one-third of it which mean get nothing and also have trouble for when they be be openly and violently despoil of two-third how should they get back one-third especially since goods be be sell for a infinitesimal price in the first place since many wares be be advertise for sale at once and the majority of man be without gold or silver and the rest do not dare to buy because it would look as if they have something and they would place in jeopardy the remnant of they wealth the price be relax : in the second place everything be sell to the soldier far below its value hence no one of the private citizen save anything worth mention in addition to other drain they surrender servant for the fleet buy they if they have none and the senator repair the road at they individual expense only those who wield arm enjoy superlative wealth _ they _ to be sure be not satisfy with they pay though it be in full nor with they outside perquisite though of vast extent nor with the very large prize bestow for the murder nor with the acquisition of land which be make almost without cost to they but in addition some would ask for and receive all the property of the die and other still force they way into the family of such as be old and childless to such a extent be they fill with greed and shamelessness that one man ask from caesar himself the property of attium caesar 's mother who have die at the time and have be honor by a public burial -lrb- -18 - -rrb- while these three man be behave in this wise they be also magnify the former caesar to the greatest degree as they be all aim at sole supremacy and be all strive for it they vindictively pursue the remainder of the assassin apparently in the idea that they be prepare from afar immunity for themselves in what they be do and safety and everything which tend to he honor they readily take up in expectation of some day be themselves deem worthy of similar distinction : for this reason they glorify he by the decree which have be pass and by other which they now add to they on the first day of the year they themselves take a oath and make other swear that they would consider bind all he act this action be still take in the case of all official who successively hold power or again of those who live in he era and have not be dishonor they also lay the foundation of a hero-shrine in the forum on the spot where he have be burn and escort a kind of image of he at the horse-race together with a second statue of venus in case news of a victory come from anywhere they assign the honor of a thanksgiving to the victor by himself and to caesar though dead by himself they compel everybody to celebrate he birthday wear laurel and in good spirit pass a law that all other neglect it be accurse before jupiter and before he while any senator or they son should forfeit twenty-five myriad of denarius now it happen that the ludus apollinare fall on the same day and they therefore vote that he natal feast should be hold on the previous day -lrb- 28 -rrb- because -lrb- they say -rrb- there be a oracle of the sibyl forbid a festival to be celebrate during that twenty-four hour to any god except apollo -lrb- -19 - -rrb- besides grant he these privilege they regard the day on which he have be murder -lrb- on which there be always a regular meeting of the senate -rrb- as a die nefa the room in which he have be murder they close immediately and later transform it into a privy they also build the curia julium call after he next to the so-named comitium as have be vote besides they forbid any likeness of he because he be in very truth a god to be carry at the funeral of he relative which ancient custom be still be observe and they enact that no one who take refuge in he shrine to secure immunity should be banish or strip of he goods -- a right give to no one of the god even save to such as have a place in the day of romulus yet after man begin to gather there the place have inviolability in name without its effect for it be so fenced about that no one at all could any longer enter it in addition to those gift to caesar they allow the vestal virgin to employ one lictor each because one of they have be insult owe to not be recognize while return home from dinner toward evening the office in the city they assign for a greater number of year in advance thus at the same time give honor through the expect office to those fit for they and retain a grasp on affair for a longer time by means of those who be to hold sway -lrb- -20 - -rrb- when this have be accomplish lepidus remain there as i have say to take up the administration of the city and of the rest of italy and caesar and antony start on they campaign brutus and cassius have at first after the compact make by they with antony and the rest go into the forum and discharge the activity of praetorship with the same diligence as before -lrb- bc 44 -lrb- _ a u _ 710 -rrb- -rrb- but when some begin to be displeased at the killing of caesar they withdraw pretend to be in haste to reach the governorship abroad to which they have be appoint cassius who be praetor urbanus -lrb- 29 -rrb- have not yet finish he duty in connection with the ludus apollinare however though absent he accomplish that task most brilliantly through the medium of he fellow-praetor antony and do not himself sail away from italy at once but linger with brutus in campanium to watch the course of event and in they capacity as praetor they send a certain number of letter to rome to the people until such time as caesar octavianus begin to aspire to public position and to win the affection of the populace then in despair of the republic and fear of he they set sail the athenian give they a splendid reception for though they be indeed honor by nearly everybody else for what they have do the inhabitant of this city vote they bronze image beside that of harmodius and that of aristogeiton as have emulate they -lrb- -21 - -rrb- meanwhile learn that caesar be make progress they neglect the cretan and bithynian to whom they be direct they course for among they they see no aid forthcoming worthy the name : but they turn to syrium and to macedonium which do not to be sure appertain to they in the least because they be teem with money and troops for the occasion cassius proceed to the syrian country because its inhabitant be acquaint with he and friendly as a result of he campaign with crassus while brutus unite greece and macedonium the inhabitant would have follow he anywhere because of the glory of he deed and in the hope of similar achievement and they be further influence by the fact that he have acquire numerous soldier some survivor of the battle of pharsalus who be still at this time wander about in that region and other who either by reason of disease or because of want of discipline have be leave behind from the contingent that take the field with dolabellum money come to he too from trebonius in asia so without the least effort perhaps because it contain no force worth mention he by this mean gain the country of greece he reach macedonium at the time that gaius antonius have just arrive and quintus hortensius who have govern it previously be about to lay down he office however he experience no trouble the depart official embrace he cause at once and antonius be weak be hinder by caesar 's supremacy in rome from perform any of the duty belong to he office the neighbor territory of illyricum be govern by vatinius who come thence to dyrrachium and occupy it in advance he be a political adversary of brutus but could not injure he at all for he soldier who dislike he and furthermore despise he by reason of a disease go over to the other side -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 711 -rrb- -rrb- brutus take charge of these lead a expedition against antonius who be in apollonium : the latter come out to meet he whereupon brutus win over he soldier and confine he within the wall whither he flee before he after this antonius be by betrayal take alive but no harm be do to he -lrb- -22 - -rrb- close upon this success the victor acquire all of macedonium and epirus and then despatch a letter to the senate state what have be accomplish and place himself the province and the soldier at its disposal the senator who by chance already feel suspicious of caesar praise he strongly and bid he govern all that region when then he have confirm he leadership by the decree he himself feel more encouraged and he find he subject ready to support he unreservedly for a time he communicate with caesar when the latter appear to be hostile to antony urge he to resist he enemy and be reconcile with he -lrb- brutus -rrb- and he be make preparation to sail to italy because the senate summon he after caesar however have matter thoroughly in hand in rome and proceed openly to take vengeance on he father 's slayer brutus remain where he be deliberate how he should successfully ward off the other 's attack when it occur : and besides manage admirably the other district as well as macedonium he calm the mind of he legion when they have be throw into a state of discontent by antonius -lrb- -23 - -rrb- for the latter although he conqueror have not even deprive he of a praetor 's perquisite do not enjoy keep quiet in safety and honor but connive at a revolt among the soldier of brutus be discover at this work before he have do any great harm he be strip of he praetor 's insignia and deliver to be guard without confinement that he might not cause a uprising yet not even then do he remain quiet but concoct more scheme of rebellion than ever so that some of the soldier come to blow with one another and other start for apollonium after antonius himself in the intention of rescue he this however they be unable to do : brutus have learn in advance from some intercept letter what be to be do and by put he into a enclosed chair get he out of the way on the pretence that he be move a sick man the soldier not be able to find the object of they search in fear of brutus seize a point of high ground command the city brutus induce they to come to a understanding and by execute a few of the most audacious and dismiss other from he service he set matter in such a light that the man arrest and kill those send away on the ground that they be most responsible for the sedition and ask for the surrender of the quaestor and the lieutenant of antonius -lrb- -24 - -rrb- brutus do not give up any of the latter but put they aboard boat with the avowed intention of drown they and so convey they to safety fear however that when they should hear the next news of more terrifying transaction in rome they might change they attitude he deliver antonius to a certain gaius clodius to guard and leave he at apollonium meanwhile brutus himself take the largest and strongest part of the army and retire into upper macedonium whence he later sail to asia to the end that he might remove he man as far as possible from italy and support they on the subject territory there among other ally whom he win over at this time be deiotarus although he be of a great age and have refuse assistance to cassius while he be delay here a plot be form against he by gellius poplicolum and mark antony send some man to attempt to rescue he brother clodius accordingly as he could not guard he prisoner safely kill he either on he own responsibility or accord to instruction from brutus for the story be that at first the latter make he safety of supreme importance but later learn that decimus have perish care nothing more about it gellius be detect but suffer no punishment brutus release he because he have always hold he to be among he best friend and know that he brother marcus messalum be on very close term with cassius the man have also attack cassius but have suffer no evil in that case either the reason be that he mother pollum learn of the plot in advance and be very fearful lest cassius should be overtake by he fate -lrb- for she be very fond of he -rrb- and lest she son should be detect voluntarily inform cassius of the plot herself beforehand and receive the preservation of she son as a reward he easy escape however do not improve he at all and he desert he benefactor to join caesar and antony -lrb- -25 - -rrb- as soon as brutus learn of the attempt of mark antony and of the killing of he brother he fear that some other insurrection might take place in macedonium during he absence and immediately hasten to europe on the way he take charge of the territory which have belong to sadalus -lrb- who die childless and leave it to the roman -rrb- and invade the country of the bessus to see if he could at the same time recompense they for the trouble they be cause and surround himself with the name and reputation of imperator which would enable he to fight more easily against caesar and antony both project he accomplish be chiefly aid by rhascupori a certain prince after go thence into macedonium and make himself master of everything there he withdraw again into asia -lrb- bc 44 -lrb- _ a u _ 710 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -26 - -rrb- brutus besides do this have stamp upon the coin which be be mint he own likeness and a helmet and two dagger indicate by this and by the inscription that in company with cassius he have liberate he country at that same period cassius have cross over to trebonius in asia ahead of dolabellum and after secure money from he and a number of the cavalry whom dolabella have send before he into syrium attach to he cause many other of the asiatic and cilician as a result he bring tarcondimotus -lrb- 30 -rrb- and the people of tarsus into the alliance though they be reluctant for the tarsian be so devoted to the former caesar -lrb- and out of regard for he to the second also -rrb- that they have change the name of they city to juliopoli after he this do cassius go to syrium and without strike a blow assume entire direction of the nation and the legion -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 710 -rrb- -rrb- the situation in syrium at that time be this caecilius bassus a knight who have make the campaign with pompey and in the retreat have arrive at tyre continue to spend he time there incognito on ` change now sextus be govern the syrian for caesar since he be quaestor and also a relative of he have entrust to he care all roman interest in that quarter on the occasion of he own march from egypt against pharnace so bassus at first remain quiet satisfied to be allow to live : when however some similar person have associate themselves with he and he have attract to he enterprise various soldier of sextus who at various time come there to garrison the city and likewise many alarming report keep come in from africa about caesar he be no longer please with exist circumstance but raise a rebellion he aim be either to help the follower of scipio and cato and the pompeian or to clothe himself in some authority sextus discover he before he have finish he preparation but he explain that he be collect this body as a auxiliary force for mithridate of pergamum against bosporus he story be believe and he be release so after this he forge a epistle which he pretend have be send to he by scipio in which he announce that caesar have be defeat and have perish in africa and state that the governorship of syrium have be assign to he he next step be to use the force he have in readiness for occupy tyre and from there he approach the camp of sextus in the attack on the latter which follow bassus be defeat and wound consequently after this experience he no longer employ violent tactic but send message to he opponent 's soldier and in some way or other so prevail over some of they that they take upon themselves the murder of sextus -lrb- -27 - -rrb- the latter out of the way the usurper gain possession of all he army except some few the soldier winter in apamea withdraw before he reach they toward cilicium and be pursue but be not win over bassus return to syria where he be name commander and he conquer apamea so as to have it as a base for warfare he enlist not only the free but the slave fight population gather money and accumulate arm while he be thus engage one gaius antistius invest the position he be hold and the two have a nearly even struggle in which neither party succeed in gain any great advantage thereupon they part without any definite truce to await the bring up of ally the troops of antistius be increase by such person in the vicinity as favored caesar and soldier that have be send by he from rome those of bassus by alchaudonius the arabian the latter be the leader who have formerly make a arrangement with lucullus as i mention -lrb- 31 -rrb- and later join with the parthian against crassus on this occasion he be summon by both side but enter the space between the city and the camp and before make any answer auction off he service and as bassus offer more money he assist he and in the battle work great havoc with he arrow the parthian themselves too come at the invitation of bassus but on account of the winter fail to remain with he for any considerable time and hence do not accomplish anything of importance this commander then have he own way for a time but be later again hold in check by marcius crispus -lrb- 32 -rrb- and lucius staius murcus -lrb- -28 - -rrb- thing be in this condition among they when cassius come on the scene and at once conciliate all the city through the reputation of what he have do in he quaestorship and he other fame and attach the legion of bassus and of the rest without additional labor while he be encamp in one spot with all of they a great downpour from the sky suddenly occur during which wild swine rush into the camp through all the gate at once overturn and mix up everything there some accordingly infer from this that he power be only temporary and that disaster be subsequently come have secure possession of syrium he set out into judea on learn that the follower of caesar leave behind in egypt be approach without effort he enlist both they and the jew in he undertaking next he send away without harm in the least bassus and crispus and such other as do not care to share the campaign with he for staius he preserve the rank with which he have come there and besides entrust to he the fleet thus do cassius in brief time become strong : and he send a despatch to caesar about reconciliation and to the senate about the situation couch in similar language to that of brutus therefore the senate confirm he governorship of syrium and vote for the war with dolabellum -lrb- -29 - -rrb- the latter have be appoint to govern syrium and have start out while consul but he proceed only slowly through macedonium and thrace into the province of asia and delay there also while he be still there he receive news of the decree and do not go forward into syrium but remain where he be treat trebonius in such a way as to make he believe most strongly that dolabellum be he friend trebonius have he free permission to take food for he soldier and to live on intimate term with he when he dupe become in this way imbue with confidence and cease to be on he guard dolabellum by night suddenly seize smyrna where the other be slew he and hurl he head at caesar 's image and thereafter occupy all of asia when the roman at home hear of this they declare war against he for as yet caesar have neither conquer antony nor obtain a hold upon affair in the city the citizen also give notice to dolabellum 's follower of a definite day before which they must leave off friendship with he in order to avoid be regard also in the light of enemy and they instruct the consul to carry on opposition to he and the entire war as soon as they should have bring they temporary business to a successful conclusion -lrb- not know yet that cassius hold syrium -rrb- but in order that he should not gain still greater power in the interval they give the governor of the neighboring province charge of the matter later they learn the news about cassius and before anything whatever have be do by he opponent at home they pass the vote that i cite -lrb- -30 - -rrb- dolabellum accordingly after become in this way master of asia come into cilicium while cassius be in palestine take over the people of tarsus with they consent conquer a few of cassius 's guard who be at aegea and invade syrium from antioch he be repulse by the contingent guard the place but gain laodicea without a struggle on account of the friendship which its inhabitant feel for the former caesar upon this he spend some day in acquire new strength -- the fleet among other reinforcement come to he speedily from asia -- and cross over into aradus with the object of get both money and ship from the people also there he be intercept with but few follower and run into danger he have escape from this when he encounter cassius march toward he and give battle which result in he own defeat he be then shut up and besiege in laodicea where he be entirely cut off from the land to be sure -lrb- cassius be assist by some parthian among other -rrb- but retain some power through the asiatic ship and the egyptian one which cleopatra have send he and furthermore by means of the money which come to he from she so he carry on maraud expedition until staius get together a fleet and sailing into the harbor of laodicea vanquish the ship that move out to meet he and bar dolabellum from the sea also then prevent on both side from bring up supplies he be lead by lack of necessaries to make a sortie however he be quickly hurl back within the fortress and see that it be be betray he fear that he might be take alive and so despatched himself he example be follow by marcus octavius he lieutenant these be deem worthy of burial by cassius although they have cast out trebonius unbury the man who have participate in the campaign with they and survive obtain both safety and amnesty in spite of have be regard as enemy by the roman at home nor yet do the laodicean suffer any harm beyond be oblige to contribute money but for that matter no one else though many subsequently plot against cassius be chastise -lrb- bc 42 -lrb- _ a u _ 712 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -31 - -rrb- while this be go on the people of tarsus have attempt to keep from the passage through the taurus tillius cimber a assassin of caesar who be then govern bithynium and be hurry forward to help cassius out of fear however they abandon the spot and at the time make a truce with he because they think he strong but afterward they perceive the small number of he soldier and neither take he into they city nor furnished he provision he construct a kind of fort over against they and set out for syrium believe it to be of more importance to aid cassius than himself to destroy they city they then make a attack upon this and get possession of it after which they start for adana a place on they border always at variance with they give as a excuse that it be follow the cause of cassius the latter when he hear of it first while dolabellum be still alive send lucius rufus against they but later come himself to find that they have already capitulate to rufus without a struggle upon they he inflict no severe penalty save to take away all they money private and public as a result the people of tarsus receive praise from the triumvirate who now hold sway in rome and be inspire with hope of obtain some return for they loss cleopatra also on account of the detachment she have send to dolabellum be grant the right to have she son call king of egypt this son whom she name ptolemy she also pretend be spring from caesar and she be therefore wont to address he as caesarion -lrb- -32 - -rrb- cassius when he have settle matter in syrium and in cilicium come to meet brutus in asia for when they learn of the union of the triumvir and what the latter be do against they they come together there and make common cause more than ever as they have a like responsibility for the war and look forward to a like danger and do not even now recede from they position regard the freedom of the people and as they be eager also to overthrow they opponent three in number and the author of such deed they could plan and accomplish everything in common with much greater zest to be brief they resolve to enter macedonium and to hinder the other from cross over there or else to cross into italy before the other start since the man be say to be still settle affair in rome and it be think likely that they should have they hand full with sextus lie in wait near by they do not carry out they plan immediately instead they go about themselves and send other in various direction win over such as be not yet in accord with they and gather money and soldier -lrb- -33 - -rrb- in this way nearly all the rest even those who have before pay no attention to they at once make agreement with they but ariobarzane the rhodian and the lycian though they do not oppose they be still unwilling to form a alliance with they these be therefore suspect by brutus and cassius of favor they antagonist since they have be well treat by the former caesar and fear be entertain by the two leader lest when they themselves depart this group should cause some turmoil and lead the rest to revolt hence they determine to turn first in the direction of these doubtful party hope that since they be far stronger in point of weapon and be willing to bestow favor ungrudgingly they might soon either persuade or force they to join the rhodian who have so great a opinion of they seamanship that they anticipate cassius by sail to the mainland and display to he army the fetter they be bring with the idea that they be go to capture many alive be yet conquer by he first in a naval battle near myndus and later close to rhode itself the command officer be staius who overcome they skill by the number and size of he ship thereupon cassius himself cross over to they island where he meet with no resistance possess as he do they goodwill because of the stay he have make there in the interest of he education and he do they no hurt except to appropriate they ship and money and holy and sacred vessel -- all save the chariot of the sun afterward he arrest and kill ariobarzane -lrb- -34 - -rrb- brutus overcome in battle the public army of the lycian which confront he near the border and enter the citadel at the same time as the fugitive capture it at a single stroke the majority of the city he bring to he side but xanthus he shut up in a state of siege suddenly the inhabitant make a sortie and themselves rush in with they and once inside arrow and javelin at once render he position very dangerous he would indeed have perish utterly have not he soldier push they way through the very fire and unexpectedly attack the assailant who be light-armed these they hurl back within the wall and themselves rush in with they and once inside cast some of the fire on several house terrifying those who see what be be do and give those at a distance the impression that they have simply capture everything the result be that the native of they own accord help set fire to the rest and most of they slew one another next brutus come to patara and invite the people to conclude friendship but they would not obey for the slave and the poorer portion of the free population who have receive in advance for they service the former freedom the latter remission of debt prevent any compact be make so at first he send they the captive xanthian to whom many of they be relate by marriage in the hope that through these he might bring they to term when they yield none the more in spite of he give to each man gratuitously he own kin he erect a kind of salesroom in a safe spot under the very wall where he lead each one of the prominent man past and auction he off to see if by this mean at least he could gain the patarean they be as little inclined as ever to make concession whereupon he sell a few and let the rest go when those within saw this they no longer be stubborn but forthwith attach themselves to he cause regard he as a upright man and they be punish only in a pecuniary way the people of myra take the same action when after capture they general at the harbor he then release he similarly in a short time he secure control of the rest -lrb- -35 - -rrb- when both have effect this they come again into asia and all the suspicious fact they have hear from slanderous talk which will arise under such condition they bring up in common one case at a time and after they be settle hasten into macedonium they have be anticipate by gaius norbanus and decidius saxa who have cross over into ionium before staius reach there have occupy the whole country as far as pangaeum and have encamp near philippus this city be located close beside mount pangaeum and close beside symbolon symbolon be a name they give the place for the reason that the mountain mention correspond -lrb- _ symballeus _ -rrb- to another that rise in the interior and it be between neapoli and philippi the former be near the sea across from thaso while the latter have be build within the mountain on the plain saxa and norbanus happen to have occupy the shortest path across therefore brutus and cassius do not even try to get through that way but go around by a longer path -- the so-called crenide -lrb- 33 -rrb- here too they encounter a guard but overpower it get inside the mountain approach the city along the high ground and there encamp each one apart -- if we be to follow the story as a matter of fact they bivouac in one spot in order that the soldier might preserve better discipline and be easier to manage the camp be make up of two separate division : but as all of it include the intervene space be surround by a ditch and a rampart the entire circuit belong to both and from it they derive safety in common -lrb- -36 - -rrb- they be far superior in number to they adversary then present and by that mean get possession of symbolon have first eject the inhabitant in this way they be able to bring provision from the sea over a shorter stretch of country and have only to make a descent from the plain to get they for norbanus and saxa do not venture to offer they battle with they entire force though they do send out horseman to make sortie wherever opportunity offer accomplish nothing however they be rather careful to keep they camp well guard than to expose it to danger and send in haste for caesar and antony these leader on learn that cassius and brutus be for some time busy with the rhodian and the lycian have think that they adversary would have more fight on they hand there and so instead of hasten have send saxa and norbanus forward into macedonium on find out that they representative be catch they bestow praise on the lycian and rhodian promise to make they a present of money and they themselves at once set out from the city both however encounter a delay of some time -- antony near brundusium because block by staius and caesar near rhegium have first turn aside to meet sextus hold sicily and be make a attempt on italy -lrb- -37 - -rrb- when it seem to they to be impossible to dislodge he and the case of cassius and brutus appear to be more urgent they leave a small part of they army to garrison italy and with the major portion safely cross the ionian sea caesar fall sick and be leave behind at dyrrachium while antony march for philippus for a time he be a source of some strength to he soldier but after lay a ambush for some of the opposite party that be gather grain and fail in he attempt he be no longer of good courage himself caesar hear of it and fear either possible outcome that he colleague should be defeat in a separate attack or again that he should conquer : in the former event he feel that brutus and cassius would attain power and in the latter that antony would have it all himself therefore he make haste though still unwell at this action the follower of antony also take courage and since it do not seem safe for they to refuse to encamp together they bring the three division together to one spot and into one stronghold while the opposing force be face each other sally and excursion take place on both side as chance dictate for some time however no order battle be join although caesar and antony be exceedingly anxious to bring on a conflict they force stronger than those of they adversary but they be not so abundantly supply with provision because they fleet be away fight sextus and they be therefore not master of the sea -lrb- -38 - -rrb- hence these man for the reason specify and because of sextus who hold sicily and be make a attempt on italy be excite by the fear that while they delay he might capture italy and come into macedonium cassius and brutus have no particular aversion to a battle -- they have the advantage in the number of soldier though the latter be deficient in strength -- but some reflection on they own condition and that of they opponent show they that ally be be add to they own number every day and that they have abundant food by the help of the ship consequently they put off action in the hope of gain they end without danger and loss of man because they be lover of the people in no pretended sense and be contend with citizen they consult the interest of the latter no less than those of they own associate and desire to afford preservation and liberty to both alike for some time therefore they wait not wish to provoke a contest with they the troops however be compose mostly of subject nation be oppress by the delay and despise they antagonist who apparently out of fear offer within the fortification the sacrifice of purification which regularly precede struggle hence they urge a battle and spread a report that if there should be more delay they would abandon the camp and disperse and at this the leader though against they will go to meet the foe -lrb- -39 - -rrb- you might not unnaturally guess that this struggle prove tremendous and surpass all previous civil conflict of the roman this be not because these contestant excel those of the old day in either the number or the valor of the warrior for far larger mass and braver man than they have fight on many field but because on this occasion they contend for liberty and for democracy as never before and they come to blow with one another again later just as they have previously but the subsequent struggle they carry on to see to whom they should belong : on this occasion the one side be try to bring they into subjection to sovereignty the other side into a state of autonomy hence the people never attain again to the absolute right of free speech in spite of be vanquish by no foreign nation -lrb- the subject population and the ally nation then present on both side be merely a kind of complement of the citizen army -rrb- : but the people at once gain the mastery over and fall into subjection to itself it defeat itself and be defeat and in that effort it exhaust the democratic element and strengthen the monarchical i do not say that the people 's defeat at that time be not beneficial -lrb- what else can one say regard those who fight on both side than that the roman be conquer and caesar be victorious -rrb- they be no longer capable of concord in the established form of government for it be impossible for a unadulterated democracy that have grow to acquire domain of such vast size to have the faculty of moderation after undertake many similar conflict repeatedly one after another they would certainly some day have be either enslave or ruin -lrb- -40 - -rrb- we may infer also from the portent which appear to they on that occasion that the struggle between they be clearly tremendous heaven as it be ever accustom to give indication before most remarkable event foretell to they accurately both in rome and in macedonium all the result that would come from it in the city the sun at one time appear diminish and grow extremely small and again show itself now huge now triple in form and once shine forth at night thunderbolt descend on many spot and most significantly upon the altar of jupiter victor flash dart hither and thither note of trumpet clashing of arm and cry of camp be hear by night from the garden of caesar and of antony located close together beside the tiber moreover a dog drag the body of a dog to the temple of cere where he dig the earth with he paw and bury it a child be bear with hand that have ten finger and a mule give birth to a prodigy of two species the front part of it resemble a horse and the rest a mule the chariot of minerva while return to the capitol from a horse-race be dash to piece and the statue of jupiter at albanum send forth blood at the very time of the feria from its right shoulder and right hand these be advance indication to they from heaven and the river also in they land give out entirely or begin to flow backward and any chance deed of man seem to point to the same end during the feriae the prefect of the city celebrate the festival of latiari -lrb- 34 -rrb- which neither belong to he nor be ordinarily observe at that time and the plebeian aedile offer to cere contest in armor in place of the horse-race this be what take place in rome where certain oracle also both before the event and pertain to they be recite tend to the downfall of the democracy in macedonium to which pangeaum and the territory surround it be regard as belong bee in swarm pervade the camp of cassius and in the course of its purification some one set the garland upon he head wrong end foremost and a boy while carry a victory in some procession such as the soldier inaugurate fall down -lrb- 35 -rrb- but the thing which most of all portend destruction to they so that it become plain even to they enemy be that many vulture and many other bird too that devour corpse gather only above the head of the conspirator gaze down upon they and squawk and screech with terrible and bloodcurdling note -lrb- -41 - -rrb- to that party these sign bring evil while the other so far as we know be visit by no omen but see some such vision as the follow in dream a thessalian dream that the former caesar have bid he tell caesar that the battle would occur on the second day after that one and that he should resume some of the insignia which he predecessor wear while dictator : caesar therefore immediately put he father 's ring on he finger and wear it often afterward that be the vision which that man see whereas the physician who attend caesar think that minerva enjoin he to lead he patient though still in poor health from he tent and place he in line of battle : and by this act he be save in most case safety be the lot of such as remain in the camp and of those in the fortification while danger accompany those who proceed into the midst of weapon and battle but this be reverse in the case of caesar it be quite visibly the result of he leave the rampart and mingle with the fight man that he survive although from sickness he stand with difficulty even without he arm -lrb- -42 - -rrb- the engagement be of the follow nature no arrangement have be make as to when they should enter battle yet as if by some compact they all arm themselves at dawn advance into the square intervene between they quite leisurely as though they be competitor in game and there be quietly marshal when they stand oppose advice be give partly to the entire body and partly to individual of both force by the general and lieutenant and subaltern they make many suggestion touch the immediate danger and many adapt to the future word such as man would speak who be to encounter danger on the moment and be endeavor to anticipate trouble to come for the most part the speech be very similar inasmuch as on both side alike there be roman together with ally still there be a difference the officer of brutus offer they man the prize of liberty and democracy of freedom from tyrant and freedom from master they point out to they the excellency of equality in government and all the unfairness of monarchy that they themselves have experience or have hear in other case they call to the attention of the soldier the separate detail of each system and besought they to strive for the one and to take care not to endure the other the oppose officer urge they army to take vengeance on the assassin to possess the property of they antagonist to be fill with a desire to rule all of they race and -lrb- the clause which inspire they most -rrb- they promise to give they five thousand denarius apiece -lrb- -43 - -rrb- thereupon they first send around they watchword -- the follower of brutus use liberty and the other whatever happen to be give out -- and then one trumpeter on each side sound the first note follow by the blare of the remainder those in front sound the at rest and the ready signal on they trumpet in a kind of circular spot and then the rest come in who be to rouse the spirit of the soldier and incite they to the onset then there be suddenly a great silence and after wait a little the leader issue a clear command and the line on both side join in a shout after that with a yell the heavy-armed dash they spear against they shield and hurl the former at each other while the slinger and the archer send they stone and missile then the two body of cavalry trot forward and the contingent shield with breastplate follow behind join in hand to hand combat -lrb- -44 - -rrb- they do a great deal of push and a great deal of stab look carefully at first to see how they should wind other and not be wound themselves they desire both to kill they antagonist and to save themselves later when they charge grow fiercer and they spirit flame up they rush together without stop to consider and pay no more attention to they own safety but would even sacrifice themselves in they eagerness to destroy they adversary some throw away they shield and seize hold of those arrayed opposite they either strangle -lrb- 36 -rrb- they in they helmet and strike they from the rear or snatch away they defense in front and deliver a stroke on they breast other take hold of they sword and then run they own into the body of the man opposite who have be make as good as unarmed and some by expose some part of they body to be wound could use the rest more readily some clutch each other in a embrace that prevent the possibility of striking but they perish in the intertwining of sword and body some die of one blow other of many and neither have any perception of they wound die too soon to feel pain nor lament they take off because they do not reach the point of express grief one who kill another think in the excessive joy of the moment that he could never die whoever fall lose consciousness and have no knowledge of he state -lrb- -45 - -rrb- both side remain stubbornly in they place and neither side retire or pursue but there just as they be they wound and be wound slew and be slay until late in the day and if all have contest with all as may happen under such circumstance or if brutus have be array against antony and cassius against caesar they would have prove equally match as it be brutus force the invalid caesar from he path while antony overrule cassius who be by no mean he equal in warfare at this juncture because not all be conquer the other side at once but both party be in turn defeat and victorious the result -lrb- 37 -rrb- be practically the same both have conquer and have be defeat each have route they adversary and have be route pursuit and flight have fall to the lot of both alike and the camp on both side have be capture as they be many they occupy a large expanse of plain so that they could not see each other distinctly in the battle each one could recognize only what be opposite he and when the rout take place each side flee the opposite way to its own fortification situate at a distance from each other without stop to look back because of this fact and of the immeasurable quantity of dust that rise they be ignorant of the termination of the battle and those who have conquer think they have be victorious over everything and those who be defeat deem they have be worst everywhere they do not learn what have happen until the rampart have be lay in ruin and the victor on each side on retire to they own head-quarter encounter each other -lrb- -46 - -rrb- so far then as the battle be concern both side both conquer thus and be defeat at this time they do not resume the conflict but as soon as they have retire and behold each other and recognize what have take place they both withdraw not venture anything further they have beat and have prove inferior to each other this be show first by the fact that the entire rampart of caesar and antony and everything within they have be capture -lrb- that prove practically the truth of the dream for if caesar have remain in he place he would certainly have perish with the rest -rrb- it be show again in the fate of cassius he come away safe from the battle but strip of he fortification he have flee to a different spot and suspect that brutus too have be defeat and that several of the victor be hasten to attack he he make haste to die he have send a certain centurion to view the situation and report to he where brutus be and what he be do this man fall in with some horseman whom brutus have dispatch to seek he colleague turn back with they and proceed leisurely with the idea that there be hurry because no danger present itself cassius see they afar off suspect they be enemy and order pindarus a freedman to kill he the centurion on learn that he leader 's death be due to he dilatoriness slew himself upon he body -lrb- -47 - -rrb- brutus immediately send the body of cassius secretly to thaso he shrink from bury it upon the ground for fear the army would be fill with grief and dejection at sight of the preparation the remainder of he friend 's soldier he take under he charge console they in a speech win they devotion by a gift of money to make up for what they have lose and then transfer he position to they enclosure which be more suitable from there he start out to harass he opponent in various way especially by assault they camp at night he have no intention of join issue with they again in a set battle but have great hope of overcome they without danger by the lapse of time hence he try regularly to startle they in various way and disturb they by night and once by divert the course of the river he wash away considerable of they wall caesar and antony be get short of both food and money and consequently give they soldier nothing to replace what have be seize and carry off furthermore the force that be sail to they in transport from brundusium have be destroy by staius yet they could not safely transfer they position to any other quarter nor return to italy and so even as late as this they set all they hope upon they weapon -- hope not merely of victory but even of preservation they be eager to meet the danger before the naval disaster become noised abroad among they opponent and they own man -lrb- -48 - -rrb- as brutus evince a unwillingness to meet they in open fight they somehow cast pamphlet over he palisade challenge he soldier either to embrace they cause -lrb- promise be attach -rrb- or to come into conflict if they have the least particle of strength during this delay some of the celtic force desert from they side to brutus and amyntas the general of deiotarus and rhascupori desert to they the latter as some say immediately return home brutus be afraid when this happen that there might be further similar rebellion and decide to join issue with they and since there be many captive in he camp and he neither have any way to guard they during the progress of the battle and could not trust they to refrain from do mischief he despatch the majority of they contrary to he own inclination be a slave in this matter to necessity but he be the more ready to do it because of the fact that he opponent have kill such of he soldier as have be take alive after do this he arm he man for battle when the oppose rank be array two eagle that fly above the head of the two army battle together and indicate to the combatant the outcome of the war the eagle on the side of brutus be beat and flee : and similarly he heavy-armed force after a contest for the most part even be defeat and then when many have fall he cavalry though it fight nobly give way thereupon the victor pursue they as they flee this way and that but neither kill nor capture any one and then they keep watch of the separate contingent during the night and do not allow they to unite again -lrb- -49 - -rrb- brutus who have reach in flight a steep and lofty spot undertake to break through in some way to the camp in this he be unsuccessful and on learn that some of he soldier have make term with the victor he have no further hope but despair of safety and disdain capture he himself also take refuge in death he utter aloud this sentence of heracle : unhappy virtue thou wert but a name while i deem thy godhead real follow thee on who be but fortune 's slave -lrb- 38 -rrb- then he call one of the bystander to kill he he body receive burial by antony -- all but he head which be send to rome : but as the ship encounter a storm during the voyage across from dyrrachium that be throw into the sea at he death the mass of he soldier on amnesty be proclaim for they immediately transfer they allegiance portium perish by swallow red-hot charcoal most of the prominent man who have hold any office or belong to the assassin or the proscribed straightway kill themselves or like favonius be capture and destroy : the remainder at this time escape to the sea and thereafter join sextus dio 's roman history 48 the following be contain in the forty-eighth of dio 's rome : how caesar contend with fulvium and lucius antonius -lrb- chapter 1-16 -rrb- how sextus pompey occupy sicily -lrb- chapter 17-23 -rrb- how the parthian occupy the country to the edge of the hellespont -lrb- chapter 24-26 -rrb- how caesar and antony reach a agreement with sextus

chapter 49-54 -rrb- duration of time five year in which there be the follow magistrate here enumerate : l antonius m f pietas p servilius p f isauricus consul -lrb- ii -rrb- -lrb- bc 41 = a u 713

-rrb- -lrb- bc 42 -lrb- _ a u_712 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -1 - -rrb- so perish brutus and cassius slay by the sword with which they have despatch caesar the rest also who have share in the plot against he be all except a very few destroy some previously some at this time and some subsequently justice and the divine will seem to sweep onward and lead forward to such a fate the man who have kill they benefactor one who have attain such eminence in both excellence and good fortune caesar and antony for the moment secure a advantage over lepidus because he have not share the victory with they yet they be destine ere long to turn they arm against each other it be a difficult matter for three man or two that be equal in rank and have come into power over such vast interest as a result of war to be of one accord hence whatever they have gain for a time while in harmony for the purpose of the overthrow of they adversary they now begin to set up as prize in they rivalry with each other they immediately redistribute the empire so that spain and numidium fall to caesar gaul and africa to antony they further agree that in case lepidus show any vexation at this africa should be evacuate for he -lrb- -2 - -rrb- this be all they could allot between they since sextus be still occupy sardinium and sicily and other region outside of italy be in a state of turmoil about the peninsula itself i need say nothing for it have always remain a kind of choice exception in such division : and not even now do they talk as if they be struggle to obtain it but to defend it so leave these other region to be common property antony take it upon himself to settle affair of nation that have fight against they and to collect the money which have be offer to the soldier in advance : caesar be charge with curtail the power of lepidus if he should make any hostile move with conduct the war against sextus and with assign to those of he campaigner who have pass the age limit the land which he have promise they and these he forthwith dismiss furthermore he send with antony two legion of he follower and he colleague send word that he would give he in return a equal number of those station at that tune in italy after make these compact separately put they in write and seal they they exchange the document to the end that if any transgression be commit it might be prove from the very record thereupon antony set out for asia and caesar for italy -lrb- -3 - -rrb- sickness attack the latter violently on the journey and during the voyage give rise in rome to a expectation of he death they do not believe however that he be linger so much by reason of ill health as because he be devise some harm and consequently they expect to fall victim to every possible persecution yet they vote to these man many honor for they victory such as would have be give assuredly to the other have they conquer in such crisis it be ever the case that all trample on the loser and honor the victor and in particular they decide though against they will to celebrate thanksgiving during practically the entire year this caesar order they outright to do in gratitude for vengeance upon the assassin at any rate during he delay all sort of story be current and all sort of behavior result for example some spread a report that he be dead and arouse delight in many breast : other say he be plan some evil and fill numerous person with fear therefore some hide they property and take care to protect themselves and other consider in what way they might make they escape other and the majority not be able to apprehend anything clearly by reason of they excessive fear prepare to meet a certain doom the confident element be extremely small and its number few in the light of the former frequent and diverse destruction of both person and possession they expect that anything similar or still worse might happen because now they have be utterly vanquished wherefore caesar in dread that they might take some rebellious step especially since lepidus be there forward a letter to the senate urge its member to be of good cheer and further promising that he would do everything in a mild and humane way after the manner of he father -lrb- bc 41 -lrb- _ a u_713 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -4 - -rrb- this be what then take place the succeed year publius servilius and lucius antonius nominally become consul but in reality it be the latter and fulvium she the mother-in-law of caesar and wife of antony have no respect for lepidus because of he slothfulness and herself manage affair so that neither the senate nor the people dare transact any business contrary to she pleasure actually when lucius himself be anxious to have a triumph over certain people dwelling in the alp on the ground that he have conquer they for a time fulvium oppose he and no one would grant it but when she favor be court and she permit it all vote for the measure : therefore it be nominally antonius over the people whom he say he have vanquish -lrb- in reality he have do nothing deserving a triumph nor have any command at all in those region -rrb- -- but in truth fulvium -lrb- 40 -rrb- and have the procession and she assume a far prouder bearing over the affair than do he because she have a truer cause to give any one authority to hold a triumph be greater than to celebrate it by secure the privilege from another except that lucius don the triumphal apparel mount the chariot and perform the other rite customary in such case fulvia herself seem to be give the spectacle employ he as she assistant it take place on the first day of the year and lucius just as marius have do exult in the circumstance that he hold it on the first day of the month that he begin to be consul moreover he exalt himself even above he predecessor say that he have voluntarily lay aside the decoration of the procession and have assemble the senate in he street dress whereas marius have do it unwillingly he add that the latter have receive a crown from almost nobody whereas he obtain many and particularly from the people tribe by tribe as have never be the case with any former triumphator -lrb- it be do by the aid of fulvium and by the money which he have secretly give some person to spend -rrb- -lrb- -5 - -rrb- it be in this year that caesar arrive in rome and after take the usual step to celebrate the victory turn he attention to the administration and despatch of business for lepidus through fear of he and out of he general weakness of heart have not rebel and lucius and fulvium on the supposition that they be relative and sharer in he supremacy be quiet -- at least at first as time go on they become at variance the person just mention because they do not get a share in the portion of land to be assign which belong to antony and caesar because he do not get back he troops from the other two hence they kinship by marriage be dissolve and they be bring to open warfare caesar would not endure the domineering way of he mother-in-law and choose to appear to be at odds with she rather than with antonius send back she daughter whom he declare on oath to be still a virgin in pursue such a course he be careless whether it should be think that the woman have remain a virgin in he house so long a time for common-place reason or whether it should seem that he have plan the situation considerably in advance as a measure of preparation for the future after this action there be no longer any friendship between they lucius together with fulvium attempt to get control of affair pretend to be do this in behalf of marcus and would yield to caesar on no point : therefore on account of he devotion to he brother he take the additional title of pieta caesar naturally find no fault with marcus not wish to alienate he while he be attend to the nation in asia but reproach and resist the pair give out that they be behave in all respects contrary to they brother 's desire and be eager for individual supremacy -lrb- -6 - -rrb- in the land allotment both place the greatest hope of power and consequently the beginning of they quarrel be concern with they caesar for he part wish to distribute the territory to all such as have make the campaign with himself and antony accord to the compact make with they after the victory that by so do he might win they good-will : the other demand to receive the assignment that appertain to they party and settle the city themselves in order that they might get the power of these settlement on they side it seem to both to be the simplest method to grant the land of the unarmed to those who have participate in the conflict contrary to they expectation great disturbance result and the matter take the aspect of a war for at first caesar be for take from the possessor and give to the veteran all of italy -lrb- except what some old campaigner have receive as a gift or buy from the government and be now hold -rrb- together with the band of slave and other wealth the person deprive of they property be terribly enrage against he and cause a change of policy fulvium and the consul now hope to find more power in the cause of the other the oppressed and consequently neglect those who be to receive the field but turn they attention to that party which be of greater number and be animated by a righteous indignation at the deprivation they be suffer next they take some of they individually aid and unite they so that the man who be before afraid of caesar now that they have get leader become courageous and no longer give up any of they property : they think that marcus too would approve they course -lrb- -7 - -rrb- among these therefore lucius and fulvium secure a follow and still make no assault upon the adherent of caesar they attitude be not that there be no need for the soldier to receive allotment but they maintain that the goods of they adversary in the combat be sufficient for they especially they point out land and furniture some still be hold intact other that have be sell of which they declare the former ought to be give to the man outright and in the second case the price realize should be present to they if even this do not satisfy they they try to secure the affection of they all by hold out hope in asia in this way it quickly come about that caesar who have forcibly rob the possessor of any property and cause trouble and danger on account of it to all alike find himself dislike by both party whereas the other two since they take nothing from anybody and show those who be to receive the gift a way to the fulfillment of the pledge from already exist asset and without a combat win over each of the body of man as a result of this and through the famine which be try they greatly at this time because the sea off sicily be in control of sextus and the ionian gulf be in the grasp of gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus caesar find himself in a considerable dilemma for domitius be one of the assassin and have escape from the battle fight at philippus he have get together a small fleet have make himself for a time master of the gulf and be do the greatest damage to the cause of he opponent -lrb- -8 - -rrb- there be not only this to trouble caesar greatly but also the fact that in the dispute which have be inaugurate between the ex-soldier and the senator as well as the rest of the multitude that possess land -- and these prove very numerous because the contestant be struggle for the greatest interest -- he could not attach himself to either side without danger it be impossible for he to please both the one side wish to run riot the other to be unharmed : the one side to get the other 's property the other to hold what belong to it as often as he give the preference to the interest of this party or that accord as he find it necessary he incur the hatred of the other : and he do not meet with so much gratitude for the favor he confer as with anger for what he fail to yield those benefit take all that be give they as they due and regard it as no kindness and the opposite party be wrathful because rob of they own belongings and as a result he continue to offend either this group or the other at one time reproach with be a friend of the people and again with be a friend of the army he could make no headway and further learn by actual experience that arm have no power to hold those injure friendly toward he and that it be possible for all such as would not submit to perish by the use of weapon but out of the question for any one to be force to love a person whom he will not after this though reluctantly he stop take anything from the senator previously he use to deem it he right to distribute everything that be theirs ask seriously : from what source else shall we pay the prize of war to those who have serve -- as if any one have command he to wage war or to make such great promise he also keep he hand off the valuable -- whatever costly object woman have for dowry or other have less in value than the land individually give to the old soldier -lrb- -9 - -rrb- when this be do the senate and the rest finding nothing take from they become fairly resign to he rule but the veteran be indignant regard he sparingness and the honor show to the other to be they own dishonor and loss since they be to receive less they kill not a few of the centurion and the other intimate of caesar who try to restrain they from mutiny and come very near compass they leader 's own destruction use every plausible excuse possible for they anger they do not cease they irritation till the land that belong to they relative and the father and son of those fall in battle but be hold by somebody else be grant to these three class freely this measure cause the soldier element to become somewhat more conciliatory but that very thing produce vexation again among the people the two use to come in conflict and there be continual fighting amongst they so that many be wound and kill on both side alike the one party be superior by be equip with weapon and have experience in war and the other by its number and the ability to pelt opponent from the roof owe to this a number of house be burn down and to those dwelling in the city rent be entirely remit to the extent of five hundred denarius while for those in the rest of italy it be reduce a fourth for one year for they use to fight in all the city alike wherever they fall in with each other -lrb- -10 - -rrb- when this take place constantly and soldier send ahead by caesar into spain make a kind of uprising at placentium and do not come to order until they receive money from the people there and they be furthermore hinder from cross the alp by calenus and ventidius who hold farther gaul caesar become afraid that he might meet with some disaster and begin to wish to be reconcile with fulvium and the consul he could not accomplish anything by send message personally and with only he own authorization and so go to the veteran and through they attempt to negotiate a settlement elate at this they take charge of those who have lose they land and lucius go about in every direction unite they and detach they from caesar while fulvium occupy praeneste have senator and knight for she associate and be wont to conduct all she deliberation with they help even send order to whatever point require it why should any one be surprise at this when she be gird with a sword and use to pass the watchword to the soldier yes often harangue they -- a additional means of give offence to caesar -lrb- -11 - -rrb- the latter however have no way to overthrow they be far inferior to they not only in troops but in good-will on the part of the population for he cause many distress whereas they fill every one with hope he have often privately through friend propose reconciliation to they and when he accomplish nothing he send envoy from the number of the veteran to they he expect by this stroke pretty surely to obtain he request to adjust present difficulty and to gain a strength equal to theirs for the future and even though he should fail of these aim he expect that not he but they would bear the responsibility for they quarrel this actually take place when he effect nothing even through the soldier he despatch senator show they the covenant make between himself and antony and offer the envoy as arbitrator of the difference but he opponent in the first place make many counter-proposition demand with which caesar be sure not to comply and again in respect to everything that they do say they be do it by the order of mark antony so that when nothing be gain in this way either he betake himself once more to the veteran -lrb- -12 - -rrb- thereupon these assemble in rome in great number with the avowed intention of make some communication to the people and the senate but instead of troubling themselves about this errand they collect on the capitol and command that the compact which antony and caesar make be read to they they ratify these agreement and vote that they should be make arbitrator of the difference exist after record these act on tablet and seal they they deliver they to the vestal virgin to keep to caesar who be present and to the other party by a embassy they give order to meet for adjudication at gabius on a state day caesar show he readiness to submit to arbitration and the other promise to put in a appearance but out of fear or else perhaps disdain do not come -lrb- for they be wont to make fun of the warrior call they among other name _ senatus caligatus _ on account of they use of military boot -rrb- so they condemn lucius and fulvium as guilty of some injustice and give precedence to the cause of caesar after this when the latter 's adversary have deliberate again and again they take up the war once more and do not make ready for it in any quiet fashion chief among they measure be to secure money from source even from temple they take away all the votive offering that could be turn into bullion those deposit in rome itself as well as those in the rest of italy that be under they control both money and soldier come to they also from gallia togata which have be include by this time in the domain of italy to the end that no one else under the plea that it be a single district should keep soldier south of the alp -lrb- -13 - -rrb- caesar then be make preparation and fulvium and lucius be gather hoard of supplies and assemble force meanwhile both send embassy and despatched soldier and officer in every direction and each manage to seize some place beforehand and be repulse from other the most of these transaction and those connect with no great or important occurrence i shall pass over and briefly relate the point which be of chief value caesar make a expedition against nursium among the sabinus and route the garrison encamp before it but be repulse from the city by tisienus gallus accordingly he go over into umbrium and lay siege to sentinum but fail to capture it lucius have meanwhile be send on one excuse and another soldier to he friend in rome and then come suddenly on the scene himself conquer the cavalry force that meet he hurl the infantry back to the wall and after that take the city since those that have be there for some day help the defender within by attack the besieger lepidus to whom have be entrust the guard of the place make no resistance by reason of he inherent slothfulness nor do servilius the consul who be too easy-going on ascertain this caesar leave quintus salvidienus rufus to look after the people of sentinum and himself set out for rome hearing of this movement lucius withdraw in advance have have vote to he the privilege of go out on some war indeed he deliver a address in soldier 's costume which no one else have do thus caesar be receive into the capital without strike a blow and when he do not capture the other by pursuit he return and keep a more careful watch over the city meantime as soon as caesar have leave sentinum gaius furnius the guarder of the fortification have issue forth and pursue he a long distance and rufus unexpectedly attack the citizen within capture the town plunder and burn it the inhabitant of nursium come to term -- and suffer no ill treatment when however after bury those that have fall in the battle which have take place between themselves and caesar they inscribe on they tomb that they have die contend for liberty a enormous fine be impose upon the people so that they abandon they city and entire country together -lrb- -14 - -rrb- while they be so engage lucius on set out from rome after he occupancy have proceed toward gaul : he road be block however and so he turn aside to perusia a etruscan city there he be cut off first by the lieutenant of caesar and later by caesar himself and be besiege the investing of the place prove a long operation : the situation be naturally a strong one and have be amply stock with provision and horseman send out by he before he be entirely hem in harass he antagonist greatly while many other moreover from various section vigorously defend he many attempt be make upon the besiege individually and there be sharp fighting close to the wall until the follower of lucius in spite of be generally successful be nevertheless overcome by hunger the leader and some other obtain pardon but most of the senator and knight be put to death and the story go that they do not merely suffer death in a simple form but be lead to the altar consecrate to the former caesar and there sacrifice -- three hundred -lrb- 41 -rrb- knight and many senator among they tiberius cannutius who formerly during he tribuneship have assemble the populace for caesar octavianus of the people of perusium and the rest there capture the majority lose they life and the city itself except the temple of vulcan and statue of juno be entirely destroy by fire this piece of sculpture be preserve by some chance and be bring to rome in accordance with a vision that caesar saw in a dream : there it accord those who desire to undertake the task permission to settle the city again and place the deity on she original site -- only they do not acquire more than seven and one-half stadium of the territory -lrb- bc 40 -lrb- _ a u _ 714 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -15 - -rrb- when that city have be capture during the consulship of gnaeus calvinus and asinius pollio -- the former holding office the second time -- other post in italy partly perforce and partly voluntarily capitulate to caesar for this reason fulvium with she child make she escape to she husband and many of the other foremost man make they way some to he and some to sextus in sicily julium the mother of the antonius go there at first and be receive by sextus with extreme kindness later she be send by he to she son marcus carry proposition of friendship and with envoy whom she be to conduct to he presence in this company which at that time turn its step away from italy to antony be also tiberius claudius nero he be hold a kind of fort in campanium and when caesar 's party get the upper hand set out with he wife livium drusillum and with he son tiberius claudius nero this episode illustrate remarkably the whimsicality of fate this livium who then flee from caesar later on be marry to he and this tiberius who then escape with he parent succeed he in the office of emperor -lrb- -16 - -rrb- all this be later at that time the inhabitant of rome resume the garb of peace which they have take off without any decree under compulsion from the people they give themselves up to merrymaking convey caesar in he triumphal robe into the city and honor he with a laurel crown so that he enjoy this decoration as often as the celebrator of triumph be accustom to use it caesar when italy have be subdue and the ionian gulf have be clear -- for domitius despairing of continue to prevail any longer by himself have sail away to antony -- make preparation to proceed against sextus when however he ascertain he power and the fact that he have be in communication with antony through the latter 's mother and through envoy he fear that he might get embroil with both at once therefore prefer sextus as more trustworthy or else as stronger than antony he send he he mother mucium and marry the sister of he father-in-law lucius scribonius libo in the hope that by the aid of he kindness and he kinship he might make he a friend -lrb- bc 44 -lrb- _ a u _ 710 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -17 - -rrb- sextus after he have originally leave spain accord to he compact with lepidus and not much later have be appoint admiral be remove from he office by caesar for all that he hold on to he fleet and have the courage to sail to italy but caesar 's adherent be already secure control of the country and he learn that he have be number among the assassin of caesar 's father -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 711 -rrb- -rrb- therefore he keep away from the mainland but sail about among the island maintain a sharp watch on what be go on and supply himself with food without resort to crime as he have not take part in the murder he expect to be restore by caesar himself when however he name be expose on the tablet and he know that the edict of proscription be in force against he also he despair of get back through caesar and put himself in readiness for war he have trireme build receive the deserter make a alliance with the pirate and take under he protection the exile by these means in a short time he become powerful and be master of the sea off italy so that he make descent upon the harbor cut loose the boat and engage in pillage as matter go well with he and he activity supply he with soldier and money he sail to sicily where he seize myla and tyndari without effort but be repulse from messana by pompeius bithynicus then governor of sicily instead of retire altogether from the place he overrun the country prevent the importation of provision gain the ascendancy over those who come to the rescue -- fill some with fear of suffer a similar hardship and damaging other by some form of ambuscade -- win over the quaestor together with the fund and finally obtain messana and also bithynicus by a agreement that the latter should enjoy equal authority with he the governor suffer no harm at least for the time be : the other have they arm and money take from they he next step be to win over syracuse and some other city from which he gather more soldier and collect a very strong fleet quintus cornificius also send he quite a force from africa -lrb- -18 - -rrb- while he be thus grow strong caesar for a time take no action in the matter both because he despise he and because the business in hand keep he occupy -lrb- bc 42 -lrb- _ a u _ 712 -rrb- -rrb- but when owe to the famine the death in the city become numerous and sextus commence to make attempt on italy also caesar begin to have a small fleet equip and send salvidienus rufus with a large force ahead to rhegium rufus manage to repel sextus from italy and when the latter retire into sicily he undertake to manufacture boat of leather similar to those adapt to ocean sailing he make a framework of light rod for the interior and stretch on the outside a uncured oxhide make a affair like a oval shield for this he get laugh at and decide that it would be dangerous for he to try to use they in cross the strait so he let they go and venture to undertake the passage with the fleet that have be equip and have arrive he be not able however to accomplish he purpose for the number and size of he ship be no match for the skill and daring of the enemy this take place in the course of caesar 's expedition into macedonium and he himself be a eye-witness of the battle the result fill he with chagrin most of all because he have be defeat in this they first encounter for this reason he no longer venture although the major part of he fleet have be preserve to cross over by main force : he frequently try to effect it secretly feel that if he could once set foot on the island he could certainly conquer it with he infantry after a time since the vigilant guard keep in every quarter prevent he from gain anything he order other to attend to the blockade of sicily and he himself go to meet antony at brundusium whence with the aid of the ship he cross the ionian gulf -lrb- -19 - -rrb- upon he departure sextus occupy all of the island and put to death bithynicus on the charge that the latter have plot against he he also produce a triumphal spectacle and have a naval battle of the captive in the strait close to rhegium itself so that he opponent could look on in this combat he have wooden boat contend with other of leather in the intention of make fun of rufus after this he build more ship and dominate the sea all round about acquire some renown in which he take pride base on the assumption that he be the son of neptune and that he father have once rule the whole sea so he fare as long as the resistance of cassius and brutus hold out when they have perish lucius staius and other take refuge with he he be at first glad to receive this ally and incorporate the troops that staius lead in he own force : subsequently see that the new accession be a active and high-spirited man he execute he on a charge of treachery then he acquire the other 's fleet and the mass of slave who keep arrive from italy and gain tremendous strength so many person in fact desert that the vestal virgin pray in the name of the sacrifice that they desertion might be restrain -lrb- bc 40 -lrb- _ a u _ 714 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -20 - -rrb- for these reason and because he give the exile a refuge be negotiate friendship with antony and plunder a great portion of italy caesar feel a wish to become reconcile with he when he fail of that he order marcus vipsanius agrippa to wage war against he and himself set out for gaul sextus when he hear of that keep watch of agrippa who be busy superintend the ludus apollinare this person be praetor at the time hold a brilliant position in many way because he be such a intimate friend of caesar and for two day he have be conduct the horse-race and enjoy the so-called troy contest carry on by child of the nobility which add to he glory while he be so engage sextus cross over into italy and remain there carry on maraud expedition until agrippa arrive then after leave a garrison at certain point he sail back again -- caesar have formerly try as have be describe to get possession of gaul through other but have not be able on account of calenus and the rest who follow antony 's fortune but now he occupy it in person for he find calenus dead of a disease and acquire he army without difficulty meanwhile see that lepidus be vex at be deprive of the office that belong to he he send he to africa for he propose by be the sole bestower of that position instead of allow antony to share in the appointment to gain in a greater degree lepidus 's attachment -lrb- bc 44 -lrb- _ a u _ 710 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -21 - -rrb- as i have remark -lrb- 42 -rrb- the roman have two province in that part of libya the governor before the union of the three man be titus sextius over the numidian region and cornificius with decimus laelius over the rest the former be friendly to antony the latter two to caesar for a time sextius wait in the expectation that the other who have a far larger force would invade he domain and prepare to withstand they there when they delay he begin to disdain they and he be further elate by a cow as they say that utter human speech bidding he lay hold of the prize before he and by a dream in which a bull that have be bury in the city of tucca seem to urge he to dig up its head and carry it about on a spear-shaft since by this mean he should conquer without hesitation then especially when he find the bull in the spot where the dream say it be he invade africa first himself -lrb- bc 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 711 -rrb- -rrb- at the beginning he occupy adrymetum and some few other place take by surprise at he sudden assault then while in a unguarded state because of this very success he be ambush by the quaestor lose a large portion of he army and withdraw into numidium he misfortune have happen to occur when he be without the protection of the bull 's head and he therefore ascribe he defeat to that fact and make preparation to take the field again meantime he opponent anticipate he by invade he domain while the rest be besiege cirta the quaestor with the cavalry proceed against he overcome he in a few cavalry battle and win over the other quaestor after these experience sextius who have secure some fresh reinforcement risk battle again conquer the quaestor in he turn and shut up laelius who be overrun the country within he fortification he deceive cornificius who come to the defense of he colleague make he believe that the latter have be capture and after thus throw he into a state of dejection defeat he so cornificius meet he death in battle and laelius who make a sally with the intention of take the enemy in the rear be also slay -lrb- -22 - -rrb- when this have be accomplish sextius occupy africa and govern both province without interference until caesar accord to the covenant make by he with antony and lepidus take possession of the office and assign gaius fuficius fango to take charge of the people then the governor voluntarily give up the province when the battle with brutus and cassius have be fight caesar and antony redistribute the world caesar take numidium for he share of libya and antony africa lepidus as i have state -lrb- 43 -rrb- have power among the three only in name and often be not record in the document even to this extent when therefore this occur fulvium bid sextius resume he rule of africa he be at this time still in libya make the winter season he plea but in reality he linger there be due to he certain knowledge that there would be some kind of upheaval as he could not persuade fango to give up the country he associate himself with the native who detest they ruler he have do evil in he office for he be one of that mercenary force many of whose member as have be state in my narrative -lrb- 44 -rrb- have be elect even into the senate at this turn of affair fango retire into numidium where he accord harsh treatment to the people of cirta because they despise he on see he condition there be also one arabio who be a prince among the barbarian dwelling close at hand who have first help laelius and later attach himself to sextius : he he eject from he kingdom when he refuse to make a alliance with he arabio flee to sextius and fango demand he surrender when he request be refuse he grow angry invade africa and do some damage to the country : but sextius take the field against he and he be defeat in conflict that be slight but numerous consequently he retire again into numidium sextius go after he and be in hope of soon vanquish he especially with the aid of arabio 's horse but he become suspicious of the latter and treacherously murder he after which he accomplish for the time be nothing further for the cavalry enrage at arabio 's death leave the roman in the lurch and most of they take the side of fango -lrb- -23 - -rrb- after these skirmish they conclude friendship agree that the cause for war between they have be remove later fango watch until sextius trusting in the truce be free from fear and invade africa then they join battle with each other and at first both side conquer and be beat the one leader prevail through the numidian horseman and the other through he citizen infantry so that they plunder each other 's camp and neither know anything about he fellow-soldier when as they retire they ascertain what have happen they come to blow again the numidian be route and fango temporarily flee to the mountain during the night some hartbeeste run across the hill and think that the enemy 's cavalry be at hand he commit suicide thus sextius gain possession of nearly everything without trouble and subdue zama which hold out longest by famine thereafter he govern both the province again until such time as lepidus be send against he he make no demonstration either because he think the step have the approval of antony or because he be far inferior to he in troops -lrb- bc 40 -lrb- _ a u _ 714 -rrb- -rrb- he remain quiet pretend that the necessity be a favor to himself in this way lepidus take charge of both province -lrb- bc 42 -lrb- _ a u _ 712 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -24 - -rrb- about this same period that the above be take place and after the battle the scene of which be lay at philippi mark antony come to the mainland of asia and there by visit some point himself and send deputy elsewhere he levy contribution upon the city and sell the position of authority meanwhile he fall in love with cleopatra whom he have see in cilicium and no longer give a think to honor but be a slave of the fair egyptian and tarry to enjoy she love this cause he to do many absurd thing one of which be to drag she brother from the temple of artemi at ephesus and put they to death finally leave plancus in the province of asia and saxa in syrium he start for egypt many disturbance result from this action of he : the aradius islander would not yield any obedience to the messenger send by he to they after the money and also kill some of they and the parthian who have previously be restless now assail the roman more than ever they leader be labienus and pacorus the latter the son of king orode and the former a child of titus labienus i will narrate how he come among the parthian and what he do in conjunction with pacorus he be by chance a ally of brutus and cassius and have be send to orode before the battle to secure some help : he be detain by he a long time -lrb- over three line start at line beginning constant ill treatment -rrb- : and he presence ignore because the king hesitate to conclude the alliance with he yet fear to refuse -lrb- bc 41 -lrb- _ a u _ 713 -rrb- -rrb- subsequently when news of the defeat be bring and it appear to be the intention of the victor to spare no one who have resist they he remain among the barbarian choose to live with they rather than perish at home this labienus accordingly as soon as he perceive antony 's relaxation he passion and he journey into egypt persuade the parthian monarch to make a attempt upon the roman he say that they army have be partly ruin partly damage and that the remainder of the warrior be in revolt and would again be at war therefore he advise the king to subjugate syrium and the adjoining district while caesar be detain in italy and with sextus and antony abandon himself to love in egypt he promise that he would act as leader in the war and announce that in this way he could detach many of the province inasmuch as they be hostile to the roman owe to the latter 's constant ill treatment of they -lrb- -25 - -rrb- by such word labienus persuade orode to wage war and the king entrust to he a large force and he son pacorus and with they invade phoenicium they march to apamea and be repulse from the wall but win over the garrison in the country without resistance these have belong to the troops that follow brutus and cassius antony have incorporate they in he own force and at this time have assign they to garrison syrium because they know the country so labienus easily win over these man since they be well acquaint with he all except saxa they temporary leader he be a brother of the general and be quaestor and hence he alone refuse to join the parthian invader saxa the general be conquer in a set battle through the number and ability of the cavalry and when later by night he make a dash from he entrenchment to get away he be pursue he flight be due to he fear that he associate might take up with the cause of labienus who labor to prevail upon they by shoot various pamphlet into the camp labienus take possession of these man and slew the greater part then capture apamea which no longer resist when saxa have flee into antioch since he be believe to be dead he later capture antioch which the fugitive have abandon and at last pursue he in he flight into cilicium seize the man himself and kill he -lrb- -26 - -rrb- upon he death pacorus make himself master of syrium and subjugate all of it except tyre this city the roman that survive and the native who side with they have occupy in advance and neither persuasion nor force -lrb- for pacorus have no fleet -rrb- could prevail against they they accordingly remain secure from capture the rest pacorus gain and then invade palestine where he remove from office hyrcanus to whom the affair of the district have be entrust by the roman and set up he brother aristobulus -lrb- 45 -rrb- as ruler instead because of the enmity exist between they meantime labienus have occupy cilicium and have obtain the allegiance of the city of the mainland except stratonicea plancus in fear of he have cross over to the island : most of these town he take without conflict but mylasa and alabanda with great peril these city have accept garrison from he but murder they on the occasion of a festival and revolt for this he himself punish the people of alabanda when he have capture it and raze to the ground mylasa abandon by the dweller there stratonicea he besiege for a long time but be unable to capture it in any way in satisfaction of the defection mention he continue to levy money and rob the temple and he name himself imperator and parthicus -- the latter be quite the opposite of the roman custom in that he take he title from those he have lead against he countryman : whereas regularly it would imply that he have conquer the parthian instead of citizen -lrb- -28 - -rrb- antony keep hearing of these operation as he do of whatever else be be do such as matter in italy of which he be not in the least ignorant but in each instance he fail to make a timely defense for owe to passion and drunkenness he devote no thought either to he ally or to he enemy while he have be class as a subordinate and be pursue high prize he give strict attention to he task : when however he attain power he no longer give painstaking care to any single matter but join in the wanton life of cleopatra and the rest of the egyptian until he be entirely undo -lrb- bc 40 -lrb- _ a u _ 714 -rrb- -rrb- rather late he be at last force to bestir himself and sail to tyre with the announcement that he be go to aid it but on see that the remainder of the country have be occupy before he come he desert the inhabitant on the pretext that he have to wage war against sextus on the other hand he excuse he dilatoriness with regard to the latter by bring forward the activity of the parthian so on account of sextus he give no assistance to he ally and on account of he ally no assistance to italy but coast along the mainland as far as asia and cross into greece there after meet he mother and wife he make caesar he enemy and cement a friendship with sextus after this he go over to italy and get possession of sipontum but besiege brundusium which refuse to come to term with he -lrb- -28 - -rrb- while he be thus engage caesar who have already arrive from gaul have collect he force and have send publius servilius rullus to brundusium and agrippa against sipontum the latter take the city by storm but servilius be suddenly attack by antony who destroy many and win over many other the two leader have thus break out into open war and proceed to send about to the city and to the veteran or to any place whence they think they could get any aid all italy be again throw into turmoil and rome especially some be already choose one side or the other and other be hesitate while the chief figure themselves and those who be to follow they fortune be in a quiver of excitement fulvium die in sicyon -- the city where she be stay antony be really responsible for she death through he passion for cleopatra and the latter 's lewdness but at any rate when this news be announce both side lay down they arm and effect a reconciliation either because fulvium have actually be the original cause of they variance or because they choose to make she death a excuse in view of the fear with which each inspire the other and the equality of they force and hope the arrangement make allot to caesar sardinium dalmatium spain and gaul and to antony all the district that belong to the roman across the ionian sea both in europe and in asia the province in libya be hold by lepidus and sicily by sextus -lrb- -29 - -rrb- the government they divide anew in this way and the war against sextus they make a common duty although antony through messenger have take oath before he against caesar and it be chiefly for this reason that caesar have school himself to receive under a general amnesty all those who have go over to the enemy in the war with lucius antony 's brother some among they domitius particularly who have be of the assassin as well as all those whose name have be post on the tablet or have in any way coperated with brutus and cassius and later embrace the cause of antony so great be the irony to be find in faction and war for those in power decide nothing accord to justice but determine on friend and foe as they temporary need and advantage demand therefore they regard the same man now as enemy now as useful helper accord to the occasion -lrb- -30 - -rrb- when they have reach this agreement in the camp outside brundusium they entertain each other caesar in a soldierly roman fashion and antony with asiatic and egyptian manners as it appear that they have become reconcile the soldier who be at that time follow caesar surround antony and demand of he the money which they have promise they before the battle of philippus it be for this he have be send into asia to collect as much as possible and when he fail to give they anything they would certainly have do he some harm if caesar have not restrain they by feed they with new hope after this experience to guard against further unruliness they send those soldier who be clearly disqualify by age into the colony and then take up the war anew for sextus have come into italy accord to the agreement make between himself and antony intend with the latter 's help to wage war against caesar : when he learn that they have settle they difficulty he himself go back into sicily but order mena a freedman of he on whom he place great reliance to coast about with a portion of the fleet and damage the interest of the other side he accordingly inflict injury upon considerable of etrurium and manage to capture alive marcus titius the son of titius who have be proscribe and be then with sextus this son have gather ship for enterprise of he own and be blockade the province of narbonensis titius undergo no punishment be preserve for he father 's sake and because he soldier carry the name of sextus on they shield : he do not however recompense he benefactor fairly but fight he to the last ditch and finally slew he so that he name be remember among the most prominent of he kind mena besides the exploit mention sail to sardinium and have a conflict with marcus lurius the governor there and at first he be route but later when the other be pursue he heedlessly he await the attack and contrary to expectation win a victory in turn thereupon he enemy abandon the island and he occupy it all the town capitulate save carali which he take by siege : it be there that many fugitive from the battle have take refuge he release without ransom among other of the captive helenus a freedman of caesar in whom he master take especial delight : he thus lay up for himself with that ruler a kindness long in advance by way of prepare a refuge for himself if he should ever need aught at caesar 's hand -lrb- -31 - -rrb- he be occupy as above describe and the people in rome refuse to remain quiet since sardinium be in hostile hand the coast be be pillage and they have be cut off from importation of grain while famine and the great number of tax of all sort that be be impose and the contribution in addition that be lay upon such as possess slave irritated they greatly as much as they be please with the reconciliation of antony and caesar -- for think that harmony between these man mean peace for themselves -- they be equally or more displeased at the war the two man be carry on against sextus but a short time previously they have bring the two ruler into the city mount on horse as if at a triumph and have bestow upon they the triumphal robe precisely similar to that worn by person celebrate have make they view the festival from they chair of state and have hasten to espouse to antony when once she husband be dead octavium the sister of caesar though she be then pregnant now however they change they behavior to a remarkable degree at first form in group or gather at some spectacle they urge antony and caesar to secure peace cry out a great deal to this effect when the man in power would not heed they they fall at odds with they and favor sextus they talk frequently in he behalf and at the horse-race honor by a loud clapping of hand the statue of neptune carry in the procession evince great pleasure at it when for some day it be not bring in they take stone and drive the official from the forum throw down the image of caesar and antony and finally on not accomplish anything in this way even rush violently upon they as if to kill they caesar although he follower be wound rent he clothes and betook himself to supplicate they whereas antony present a less yielding front hence because the wrath of the populace be arouse to the highest pitch and it be fear that they would commit some violence the two ruler be force unwillingly to make proposition of peace to sextus -lrb- -32 - -rrb- meantime they remove the praetor and the consul though it be now near the close of the year and appoint other instead care little that these would have but a few day to hold office -lrb- one of those who at this time become consul be lucius cornelius balbus of gade who so much surpass the man of he generation in wealth and munificence that at he death he leave a bequest of twenty-five denarius to each of the roman -rrb- they not only do this but when a aedile die on the last day of the year they choose another to fill out the closing hour it be at this same time that the so-called julian supply of water be pipe into rome and the festival that have be vow for the successful completion of the war against the assassin be hold by the consul the duty belong to the so-called septemvirus be perform by the pontifice since none of the former be present : this be also do on many other occasion -lrb- -33 - -rrb- besides these event which take place that year caesar give a public funeral to he pedagogue sphaerus who have be free by he also he put to death salvidienus rufus suspect of plot against he this man be of most obscure origin and while he be a shepherd a flame have issue from he head he have be so greatly advance by caesar that he be make consul without even be a member of the senate and he brother who die before he have be lay to rest across the tiber a bridge be construct for this very purpose but nothing human be last and he be finally accuse in the senate by caesar himself and execute as a enemy of he and of the entire people thanksgiving be offer for he downfall and furthermore the care of the city be commit to the triumvir with the customary admonition that it should suffer no harm -lrb- bc 41 -lrb- _ a u _ 713 -rrb- -rrb- in the year previous to this man belong to the order of knight have slaughter wild beast at the horse-race which come in the course of the ludus apollinare and a intercalary day be insert contrary to custom in order that the market hold every nine day should not fall on the first day of the following year -- something which be strictly forbid from very early time naturally the day have to be subtract again later in order that the calendar should run accord to the system devise by the former caesar the domain of attalus and of deiotarus who have both die in gaul be give to a certain castor also the so-called lex falcidium which have the greatest force even still in regard to the succession to inheritance be enact by publius falcidius a tribune : its term be that if a heir feel oppress in any way he may secure at least a fourth of the property leave behind by surrender the rest -lrb- bc 39 -lrb- _ a u _ 715 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -34 - -rrb- these be the event of the two year the next season when lucius marcius and gaius sabinus hold the consulship the act of the triumvir from the time they have form a close combination receive ratification at the hand of the senate and certain further tax be impose by they because the expenditure prove far greater than have be allow for in the time of the former caesar for they be expend vast sum especially upon the soldier and be ashamed of be the only one to lay out money contrary to custom then i might mention that caesar now for the first time shave he beard and hold a magnificent entertainment himself besides grant all the other citizen a festival at public expense he also keep he chin smooth afterward like the rest he be already begin to conceive a passion for livium and for this reason divorce at once scribonium who have bear he a daughter hence as the expenditure grow far greater than before and the revenue be not anywhere sufficient but at this time come in in even smaller amount by reason of the factional dispute they introduce certain new tax and they enrol in the senate as many person as possible not only from among the ally or soldier or son of freedman but even slave at any rate one maximus when about to become quaestor be recognize by he master and take away and he incur no injury through have dare to stand for the office : but another who have be catch serve as a praetor be hurl down the rock of the capitol have be first free that there might be some legal justification for he punishment -lrb- 46 -rrb- -lrb- -35 - -rrb- the expedition which antony be get in readiness against the parthian afford they some excuse for the mass of prospective senator the same plea permit they to extend all the office for a number of year and that of consul to eight full year reward some of those who have coperated with they and bring other to trial they choose not two annual consul as have be the custom but now for the first time several and on the very day of the election formerly to be sure some have hold office after other who have neither die nor be remove for disenfranchisement or in any other way : but those person have become official as suit those who have be elect for the entire year whereas now no magistrate be choose to serve for a year but first one then another would be appoint for different division of the entire time also the man first to enter upon office be accustom to hold the title of the consulship through the entire year as be now do : the rest be accord the same title by the dweller in the capital themselves and by the people in the rest of italy during each period of they office -lrb- as be also now the custom -rrb- but those in outside nation know few or none of they and therefore call they lesser consul -lrb- -36 - -rrb- this be the situation at home when the leader first make proposal to sextus through companion as to how and on what term they could effect a reconciliation afterward the party concern hold a conference near misenum the two from the capital take they stand on the land the other on a kind of mound construct for he safety in the sea by which it be purposely surround not far from they there be also present the entire fleet of sextus and the entire infantry force of the other two and not that merely but the one command have be draw up on the shore and the other on the ship both fully arm so that this very fact make it perfectly evident to all that it be from fear of they accoutrement and from necessity that the two ruler be make peace because of the people and sextus because of he adherent the compact be frame upon the following condition -- that the deserter from among the slave should be free and that all those drive out save the assassin should be restore the latter of course they have to exclude but in reality several of they be destine to return sextus himself indeed be think to have be one of they it be record at any rate that all the rest save those mention should be allow to return under a general amnesty and with a right to a quarter of they confiscate property that tribuneship praetorship and priesthood should be give to some of they immediately that sextus himself should be choose consul and be appoint augur should obtain seventeen hundred and fifty myriad of denarius from he paternal estate and should govern sicily sardinia and achaea for five year not receive deserter nor acquire more ship nor keep any garrison in italy but bend he effort to secure peace on the sea for the peninsula and send a state amount of grain to the people of the city they limit he to this period of time because they wish it to appear that they also be hold merely a temporary and not a unending authority -lrb- -37 - -rrb- after settle and draft these compact they deposit the document with the priestess -- the vestal virgin -- and then exchange pledge and treat one another as friend upon this a tremendous and inextinguishable shout arise from the mainland and the ship at once for many soldier and many individual who be present suddenly utter a cry in unison because they be terribly tired of the war and vehemently desire peace and the mountain resound so that great panic and alarm be spread and many die of fright at the very reverberation while other perish by be trample under foot and suffocate those who be in the small boat do not wait to reach the land itself but jump out into the sea and the rest rush out into the breaker meantime they embrace one another while swimming and throw they arm around one another 's neck under water make a diversified picture accompany by diversified sound some know that they relative and associate be live and see they present give way to unrestrained joy other think that those dear to they have die previously see they now unexpectedly and for a long time know not what to do but be render speechless distrust they sight yet pray that it might be true and they be not sure of they until they have call they name and have hear they say something they rejoice as if the man have be bring to life again but as they be force to share they pleasure with a multitude they do not continue without tear again some who be unaware that they loved one have perish and think they be alive and present seek for they and go about ask every one they meet regard they as long as they could learn nothing they be like maniac and be tear different way both hope to find they and fear that they be dead -- not able to despair in view of they desire nor to indulge in grief in view of they hope on learn at last the truth they would tear they hair and rend they clothing call upon the lose by name as if they could hear anything and give way to grief as if they friend be just dead and lie there somewhere and if any of they be affect in no such way they be at least disturb by the experience of the rest they either rejoice with somebody in joy or grieve with somebody in pain and so even if they be free from personal interest yet they could not remain indifferent on account of they connection with the rest as a result there be no possibility of they be either sate or ashamed because they be all affect in the same way and they spend the entire day as well as the greater part of the night in this behavior -lrb- -38 - -rrb- after this the party chiefly concern as well as the rest receive one another and inaugurate entertainment in turn first sextus on the ship and then caesar and antony on the shore sextus so far surpass they in power that he would not disembark to meet they on the mainland until they have go aboard he boat in the course of this proceeding however he refuse to murder they both in the small boat with only a few follower though he might easily have do so and mena advise it -lrb- 47 -rrb- to antony who have possession of he ancestral home at carina -lrb- the spot so name be in the city of rome -rrb- he utter a jest in the happiest manner say that he be entertain they at carina -- that be on the keel of ship which be the meaning of the word in latin nevertheless he do not act in any way as if he bear malice toward they and on the follow day he be feast in turn and betroth he daughter to marcus marcellus the nephew of caesar -lrb- -39 - -rrb- this war then have be defer : that of labienus and the parthian come to a end in the following way antony himself return from italy to greece and delay there a very long time satisfy he desire and harm the city to the end that they should be deliver to sextus in the weakest possible condition he live during this time in many way contrary to the custom of he country he call himself the younger dionysus and insist on be call so by other when the athenian in view of this and he other behavior betroth athena to he he declare he accept the marriage and he exact from they a dowry of one hundred myriad while he be occupy in this way he send publius ventidius before he into asia the latter come upon labienus before he presence be announce and terrify he by the suddenness of he approach and by he legion for the parthian leader be separate from the member of he tribe and have only soldier from the neighborhood ventidius find that he would not even risk a conflict and so push he back and pursue he into syrium take the lightest part of he fight force with he on the expedition he overtake he near the taurus range and allow he to proceed no farther and they encamp there quietly for several day labienus await the parthian and ventidius the heavy-armed soldier -lrb- -40 - -rrb- both come at once during the same day and ventidius through fear of the barbarian cavalry remain on the high ground where he be encamp the parthian because of they number and because they have conquer once before despise they opponent and ride up to the hill at dawn before join labienus as no one come out to meet they they attack it charge straight up the incline when they be in that position the roman rush out and easily route they as it be down-hill many of the assailant be kill in conflict but still more in turn back be confuse with one another for some have already be route and other be come up the survivor take refuge not with labienus but in cilicium ventidius pursue they as far as the camp and there see labienus stop the latter marshal he force as if to offer he battle but perceive that he soldier be deject by reason of the flight of the barbarian he do not then venture any opposition and when night come he attempt to escape in some direction ventidius learn beforehand from deserter of the contemplated move and by post ambush kill many in the retreat and take possession of the rest who be abandon by labienus the latter by change he dress reach safety and for some time escape detection in cilicium later he be capture by demetrius a freedman of the former caesar who have at this time be assign to cyprus by antony he learn that labienus be in hiding and make a search for he which result in the fugitive 's arrest -lrb- -41 - -rrb- after this ventidius recover cilicium and attend himself to the administration of this district but send ahead pompaedius silo with cavalry to amanus this be a mountain on the border between cilicium and syrium and contain a pass so narrow that a wall and gate be once build across it and the place receive its name from that fact silo however find himself unable to occupy it and run in danger of be annihilate by phranapate lieutenant of pacorus who be guard the passage and that would have be he fate have not ventidius by chance come upon he when he be fight and defend he he attack the barbarian who be not look for he arrival and be likewise fewer in number and slew phranapate and many other in this way he gain syrium desert by the parthian -- all except the district of the aradius -- and subsequently without effort occupy palestine by scare away from it king antigonus besides accomplish this he exact large sum of money from the rest individually and large sum also from antigonus and antiochus and malchus the nabathaean because they have give help to pacorus ventidius himself receive no reward for these achievement from the senate since he be act not with full power but as a lieutenant : antony however obtain praise and thanksgiving as for the aradius they be afraid that they might have to pay the penalty for what they have venture against antony and would not come to term though they be besiege by he for a time later they be with difficulty capture by other -lrb- -40 - -rrb- about this same time a uprising take place in parthian illyricum but be put down by pollio after some conflict there be another on the part of the ceretanus in spain and they be subjugate by calvinus after he have have some little preliminary success and also a preliminary setback this last be occasion by he lieutenant who be ambuscade by the barbarian and desert by he soldier they leader undertake no operation against the enemy until he have punish they call they together as if for some other purpose he have the rest of the army surround they and out of two company of a hundred he choose out every tenth man for punishment and chastise the centurion who be serve in the so-called primus pilus as well as many other after do this and gain like marcus crassus a renown for he discipline the army he set out against he opponent and with no great difficulty vanquish they he obtain a triumph in spite of the fact that spain be assign to caesar for the ruler could at will grant the honor to those who serve as they lieutenant the money customarily give by the city for the purpose calvinus take only from the spanish town and of it he spend a part on the festival but the greater portion on the palace it have be burn down and he build it up adorn it splendidly at the dedication with various object and with image in particular which he ask from caesar imply that he would send they back though ask for they later he do not return they excuse himself by a witticism pretend that he have not enough assistant he say : send some man and take they caesar shrink from seizure of sacred thing and hence allow they to remain as votive offering -lrb- bc 38 -lrb- _ a u _ 716 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -43 - -rrb- this be what happen at that time now in the consulship of appius claudius and gaius norbanus who be the first to have two quaestor apiece as associate the populace revolt against the tax gatherer who oppress they severely and come to blow with the man themselves they assistant and the soldier that help they to exact the money and sixty-seven praetor one after another be appoint and hold office one who be choose to be quaestor while still reckon as a child then on the next day obtain the standing of a iuveni : and another person who have be enrol in the senate desire to fight in the arena he be prevent however from do this and a act be pass prohibit any senator from take part in gladiatorial combat any slave from serve as lictor and any burning of dead body from be carry on within fifteen stadium of the city many thing of a portentous nature have come to pass even before that time -lrb- such as olive oil spout beside the tiber -rrb- and many also precisely then the tent of romulus be burn as a result of some ritual which the pontifice be perform in it a statue of virtus standing before some of the gate fall upon its face and certain person render inspire by the mother of the god declare that the goddess be angry with they on this point the sibylline book be consult they make the same statement and prescribe that the statue be take down to the sea and purify with water from it in obedience to the order the goddess go very far indeed out into the surge where she remain a extremely long time and return only quite late -- she action cause the roman no little fear so that they do not recover courage until four palm tree grow up round about she temple and in the forum -lrb- -44 - -rrb- besides these occurrence at the time caesar marry livium she be the daughter of livius drusus who have be among those proscribe by the tablet and have commit suicide after the defeat in macedonium and the wife of nero whom she have accompany in he flight as have be related she be also in the sixth month with child from he when caesar accordingly hesitate and enquire of the pontifice whether it be permissible to wed she while pregnant they answer that if the origin of the foetus be doubtful the marriage should be put off but if it be definitely admit nothing prevent a immediate consummation perhaps they really find this among the ordinance of the forefather but certainly they would have say so even have they not find it the woman be give in marriage by she husband himself as some father might do and the follow incident occur at the marriage feast one of the prattle boy such as woman frequently keep about they naked to play with -lrb- 48 -rrb- on see livium recline in one place with caesar and nero in another with some man go up to she and say : what be you do here mistress for you husband point he out be recline over there after these event when the woman go to live with caesar she give birth to claudius drusus nero caesar take he and send he to he father make this entry in the record that caesar return to its father nero the child bear by livium he own wife nero die not long after and leave caesar himself as guardian to this boy and to tiberius : the populace have a good deal to say about this among other thing that the prosperous have child in three month and this say pass into a proverb -lrb- -45 - -rrb- at just about the same time that this be go on in the city bogud the moor sail to spain act either on instruction from antony or on he own motion and do much damage receive also considerable injury in return : meantime the people of he own land in the neighborhood of tingus rise against he and so he evacuate spain but fail to win back he own domain for the adherent of caesar in spain and bocchus come to the aid of the rebel and prove too much for he bogud depart to join antony while bocchus forthwith take possession of he kingdom and this act be afterward confirm by caesar the tingitanian be give citizenship at this time and even earlier sextus and caesar have break out into war for since they have come to a agreement not of they own free will or choice but under compulsion they do not abide by it any time at all so to speak but break the truce at once and stand oppose they be destine to come to war under any condition even if they have find no excuse they allege grievance however be the follow mena who be at this time still in sardinium as if he be a kind of praetor have incur the suspicion of sextus by he release of helenus and because he have be in communication with caesar and he be slander to some extent by he peer who envy he position of power he be therefore summon by sextus on the pretext that he should give a account of the grain and money of which he have charge instead of obey he seize and kill the man send to he on this errand and after negotiate with caesar surrender to he the island the fleet together with the army and himself caesar be glad to see he and declare that sextus be harbor deserter contrary to the treaty have trireme build and keep garrison in italy : and so far from give up mena on demand he support he in great honor give he the decoration of gold ring and enrol he in the order of the knight the matter of the gold ring be as follow of the ancient roman no one -- not to mention such as have once be slave -- who have grow up as a free citizen even be allow to wear gold ring save senator and knight -- as have be state therefore they be give to those freedman whom the man in power may select although they may use gold in other way this be still a additional honor and distinguish they as superior or as capable through have be free of become knight -lrb- -46 - -rrb- such be the matter in question sextus have this as a reproach against caesar and the further fact that achaea have be impoverish and the rights agree upon be not grant either to he or to the restore exile send to italy menecrate another freedman of he and have he ravage volturnum and other part of campanium caesar on learn this take the document contain the treaty from the vestal virgin and send for antony and lepidus lepidus do not at once obey antony come to brundusium from greece where by chance he still be : but before he meet caesar who be in etrurium he become alarmed because a wolf have enter he head-quarter and kill soldier so he sail back to greece again make the urgency of the parthian situation he excuse caesar however much he feel that he have be abandon by he colleague with the purpose that he should face the difficulty of the war alone nevertheless show no anger openly sextus keep repeat that antony be not for punish he and set himself more zealously to the task in hand finally he sail against italy land at different point inflict much injury and endure much in return meantime off cyme there be a naval battle between menecrate and calvisius sabinus in this several ship of caesar be destroy because he be array against expert seafarer but menecrate out of rivalry attack mena and perish make the loss of sextus a equal one for this reason the latter lay no claim to victory and caesar console himself over the defeat -lrb- -47 - -rrb- he happen at this time to be in rhegium and the party of sextus fear he would cross over into sicily and be somewhat disheartened too at the death of menecrate they set sail from cyme sabinus pursue they as far as scyllaeum the italian promontory without trouble but as he be round that point a great wind fall upon he hurl some of the ship against the promontory sink other out at sea and scatter all the rest sextus on ascertain this send the fleet under command of apollophane against they he discover caesar coast along somewhere in these part with the intention of cross into sicily along with sabinus make a dash upon he caesar have the ship come to anchor marshal the heavy-armed soldier upon they and at first make a noble resistance the ship be draw up with prow face outward and so offer no safe point for attack but be shorter and higher could do more hurt to those that approach they and the heavy-armed fighter when they could come in conflict with the enemy prove far superior apollophane however transfer such as be wound and be in difficulty from time to time to other ship assign for the purpose by back water and take on board fresh man he also make constant charge and use missile carry fire so that he adversary be at last route flee to the land and come to anchor when even then the pursuer press he hard some of caesar 's ship suddenly cut they anchor and unexpectedly offer opposition it be only this and the fact that night interrupted operation that keep apollophane from burn some of the ship and tow all the rest away -lrb- -48 - -rrb- after this event a ill-fated wind on the follow day fall upon caesar and sabinus as they be anchor together and make they previous reverse seem small the fleet of sabinus suffer the less for mena be a old hand on the sea foresee the storm he immediately station he ship out at sea let they ride with slack anchor some distance apart so that the rope should not be stretch and break then he row directly against the wind and in this way no rope be strain and he remain constantly in the same position recover by the use of the oar all the distance which he lose by the impetus of the wind the remain commander because they have go through a severe experience the day before and as yet have no precise knowledge of nautical matter be cast out upon the shore close by and lose many ship the night which have be of the greatest aid to they before be now among the chief agency in promote disaster all through it the wind blow violently tear the vessel from they anchor and dash they against the rock that of course be the end of they and the sailor and marine likewise perish without hope of rescue since the darkness prevent they from see ahead and they could not hear a word because of the uproar and the reverberation from the mountain especially since the wind smite they in the face so it be that caesar despaired of sicily and be satisfy to guard the coast country : sextus on the other hand be still more elated believe himself in very truth to be the son of neptune and he put on a dark blue robe besides as some relate cast horse as well as man alive into the strait he plunder and harass italy himself send apollophane to libya the latter be pursue by mena who overtake and injure he the island round about sicily go over to the side of sextus whereupon caesar seize the territory of the liparean in advance and eject they from the island convey they to campanium where he force they to live in neapoli so long as the war should continue -lrb- -49 - -rrb- meantime he keep have boat make throughout almost all of italy and collect slave for rower first from he friend who be suppose to give willingly and then from the rest -- senator and knight and well-to-do private citizen he also assemble heavy-armed troops and gather money from all citizen ally and subject both in italy and abroad this year and the follow he spend on the construction of ship and the gathering and training of rower -lrb- bc 37 -lrb- _ a u _ 717 -rrb- -rrb- he himself oversee and arrange these detail and all other matter in italy and in gaul -lrb- where there be a slight uprising -rrb- to agrippa he entrust the equipment of the boat he send for this man who be fight against the revolt gaul at the time when he have be the second of the roman to cross the rhine for purpose of warfare and he honor he by bestow a triumph and bidding he to secure the building and training of the fleet agrippa -- he be consul with lucius gallus -- would not hold the triumph deem it disgraceful for he to exalt himself when caesar have fare poorly but set to work heart and soul to fit out the fleet all along the coast of italy vessel be take shape but since no shore be find safe for they to ride at anchor -- the majority of the coast land be still in those day without harbor -- he conceive and execute a magnificent enterprise which i shall describe at some length show its nature and the present characteristic of the locality where it take place -lrb- -50 - -rrb- at cyme in campanium between misenum and puteolus there be a crescent-shaped spot it be shut in by small hill bare except in a few place and the sea there form a kind of triple bay the first be outside and near the city the second be separate from it by a small passage and the third like a real harbor be see far back the last name be call avernus and the middle bay lucrinus : the outer one belong to the tyrrhenian sea and take its name from that water in this roadstead within the other two which have but narrow entrance then agrippa by cut channel close along the shore through the land separate lucrinus from the sea on each side produce harbor afford most safe anchorage for ship while the man be work a certain image situate above avernus either of calypso to whom this place whither they say odysseus also sail be devoted or to some other heroine be cover with sweat like a human body -lrb- -51 - -rrb- now what this import i can not say but i will go on to tell of everything else worth report which i saw in that place these mountain close to the inner body of water have spring full of both fire and water in considerable quantity mix together neither of the two element be anywhere to be find by itself -lrb- that be neither pure fire or cold water alone be to be see -rrb- but from they association the water be heated and the fire moisten the former on its way down the foothill to the sea run into reservoir and the inhabitant conduct the steam from it through pipe into room set up high where they use the steam for vapor bath the higher it ascend from the earth and from the water the dryer it become costly apparatus have be install for turn both the fire and the vapor to practical use and they be very well suit for employment in the conduct of daily life and also for effect cure now besides these product that mountain make a earth the peculiar nature of which i be go to describe since the fire have not the power of burning -lrb- for by its union with the water all its blaze quality be extinguish -rrb- but be still able to separate and melt the substance with which it come in contact it follow that the oily part of the earth be melt by it whereas the hard and what i might call the bony part of it be leave as it be hence the mass of earth necessarily become porous and when expose to the dry air crumble into dust but when they be place in a swirl of water and sand grow into a solid piece as much of they as be in the liquid harden and petrify the reason for this be that the brittle element in they be disintegrate and break up by the fire which possess the same nature but by the admixture of dampness be chill and so be compress all over through and through become indissoluble such be baiae where agrippa as soon as he have construct the entrance collect ship and rower of which he fortify the former with armor and train the latter to row on wooden bench -lrb- -52 - -rrb- now the population of rome be be disturb by sign among the various piece of news bring to they be one to the effect that many dolphin battle with one another and perish near aspis the african city and in the vicinity of the city blood descend from heaven and be smear all about by the bird when at the ludus romanus not one of the senator be entertain on the capitol as have be the custom they take this too as a portent again the incident that happen to livium cause she pleasure but inspire the rest with terror a white bird carry a sprig of fruited laurel have be throw by a eagle into she lap as this seem to be a sign of no small importance she take care of the bird and plant the laurel the latter take root and grow so that it amply supply those who be afterward to celebrate triumph and livium be destine to hold caesar 's power in a fold of she robe and to dominate he in everything -lrb- -53 - -rrb- the rest however in the city have they peace of mind thoroughly shatter by this and the difference between official not only the consul and praetor but even the quaestor be array against one another and this last for some time the reason be that all be anxious not so much to hold office a longer time at home as to be count among the ex-official and secure the outward honor and influence that belong to that class they be no longer choose for any specified time but take just long enough to enter upon the title of the office and resign whenever it so seem good to those in power many do both on the same day some actually have to abandon hope of office through poverty and in this i be not speak of those then support sextus who have be disenfranchise as if by some principle of right but we have the case of a certain marcus oppius who through lack of means desire to resign the aedileship -- both he and he father have be among the proscribe -- and the populace would not permit it but contribute money for he various necessity of life and the expense of he office and the story go that some criminal too really come into the theater in mask as if they be actor and leave they money there with the rest so this man be love by the multitude while in life and at he death not long after be carry to the campus martius and there burn and bury the senate be indignant at the utter devotion of the mass to he and take up he bone on the plea that it be impious for they to lie in that consecrated spot they be persuade by the pontifice to make this declaration although they bury many other man there both before and after -lrb- -54 - -rrb- at this same period antony come into italy again from syrium the reason he give be that he intend to bear he share of the war against sextus because of caesar 's mishap he do not however stay by he colleague but have come to spy upon he action rather than to accomplish anything he give he some ship and promise to send other in return for which he receive heavy-armed infantry and set sail himself state that he be go to conduct a campaign against the parthian before he depart they present to each other they mutual grievance at first through friend and then personally as they have no leisure for war together they become reconcile in a way chiefly through the instrumentality of octavium in order that they might be bind by still more tie of relationship caesar betroth he daughter to antyllis antony 's son and antony betroth to domitius though he have be a assassin of caesar and have be proscribe to die he own daughter bear to he by octavium this be all mutual pretence they have no intention of carry out any of these union but be act a part in view of the need of the exist situation furthermore antony send octavium herself at once from corcyra to italy that she might not share he danger while he be war against the parthian besides the above negotiation at that time they remove sextus from he priesthood as well as from the consulship to which he have be appoint and grant themselves chief authority for another five year since the first period have elapse after this antony hasten to syria and caesar give he attention to the war nearly everything go as he wish but mena who be naturally untrustworthy and always follow the fortune of the stronger and be further vex because he hold no office but have be make a subordinate of sabinus desert again to sextus dio 's roman history 49 the following be contain in the forty-ninth of dio 's rome how caesar conquer sextus and overthrow lepidus -lrb- chapter 1-18 -rrb- how ventidius conquer and slew pacorus and expel the parthian drive they across the euphrate -lrb- chapter 19-21 -rrb- how antony be

-1 - -rrb- this happen in the winter when lucius gellius and cocceius nerva become consul caesar when he fleet have be make ready and spring set in start from baise and coast along italy have great hope of encompass sicily on all side for he be sail thither with many ship and those of antony be already in the strait also lepidus though reluctantly have promise to assist he he greatest ground of confidence lay in the height of the vessel and the thickness of the timber they have be build unusually stout and unusually high so as to carry the largest number of marine possible indeed they be surmount by tower in order that the conflict might be wage from a higher point as if from a wall : they be further intend to resist the ramming of antagonist and to bend aside they beak by make the collision more violent with such calculation caesar be hasten to sicily as he be pass the promontory of palinurus so-called a great storm fall upon he this destroy many ship and mena come upon the rest in confusion burn a number and tow away the rest and have he not again change side on the promise of immunity and through some other hope besides betray the whole fleet that he command by receive some trireme that simulated desertion caesar 's voyage to sicily on this occasion also would have prove fruitless mena 's action be due to the fact that he be not allow by sextus to fight against lepidus and be under suspicion in nearly every way caesar be then extremely glad to receive he but trust he no longer he first repair the damaged ship free the slave that serve on the trireme and assign the spare seaman -lrb- many of whom when they vessel be destroy in the wreck have dive and escape by swimming -rrb- to antony 's fleet which be short of man then he come to lipara and leave there agrippa and the ship return to the mainland with the intention of transport the infantry across into sicily when a opportunity should arise -lrb- -2 - -rrb- on learn this sextus himself lay quietly at anchor off messana watch for he attempt to cross and order demochare to anchor opposite agrippa at mylae this pair spend most of the time in testing each other 's strength accord as each one would temporarily give way a little yet they do not dare to risk a engagement with they entire armament they be not acquaint with each other 's force and on both side they figure everything about they opponent as be greater and more terrible than the reality finally agrippa comprehend that it be not advantageous for he to delay -- for the adherent of sextus occupy a friendly position have no need to hurry -- and take the best of he ship set out for myla to spy out the number of the enemy as he could not see they all and no one of they manifest any inclination to come out into the open sea he despise they and on he return make preparation to sail against myla on the follow day with all he ship demochare come to much the same conclusion he have the idea that the ship which have approach he be the only one and see that they sail very slowly by reason of they size he send for sextus by night and make preparation to assail lipara itself when day break they be sail against each other expect to meet inferior number -lrb- -3 - -rrb- as they come near together and each contrary to he expectation see that he opponent be many more than he have think they be at first both alike throw into confusion and some even back water then fear flight more than battle because in the latter they hope to prevail but in the former they expect to be utterly destroy they move toward each other and join in conflict on the sea the one side surpass in the number of its ship the other in the experience of its sailor : to the first the height of the vessel the thickness of the cathead and the tower be a help but charge straight ahead further the progress of the second and the strength of caesar 's marine be match by the daring of they antagonist for the majority of they be deserter from italy be quite desperate as a result possess the mutual advantage and deficiency which i have mention they have equal power contribute by they evenly balanced equipment and so they contest be close for a very long period the follower of sextus alarm they opponent by the way they dash up the wave : and they knock hole in some ship by assail they with a rush and burst open the part outside the oar but as they be strike from the tower in the combat and bring alongside by grapple iron they suffer no less harm than they inflict the caesarian also when they come into close conflict and have cross over to the hostile ship prove superior but as the enemy leap out into the sea whenever the boat sink and by they swimming well and be lightly equipped succeed easily in climb upon other the attacker be at a corresponding disadvantage meantime the rapidity with which the ship of the one party could sail prove a offset to the solidity of those on the other side and the heaviness of the latter counterbalance the agility of the former -lrb- -4 - -rrb- late in the day near nightfall caesar 's party finally conquer but institute no pursuit : the reason as it appear to I and may be conjecture from probability be that they could not overtake the flee ship and be afraid of run aground in the shallows with which they be unacquainted near the coast some say that agrippa because he be battle for caesar and not for himself think it sufficient merely to rout he adversary for he have be in the habit of say to he most intimate associate that the majority of those hold sovereign power wish no one to display more ability than themselves and that they attend personally to nearly all such matter as afford they a conquest without effort but assign the less favorable and more complicated business to other and if they ever be force to entrust some choice enterprise to they assistant they be irritated and displeased at the latter 's renown they do not pray that these subordinate may be defeat and fare badly yet they do not choose to have they win a complete success and secure glory from it he advice therefore be that the man who intend to survive must relieve he master of the annoyance incident to such undertaking and still reserve for they the successful completion of the work as for I i know that the above be regularly true and that agrippa pay attention to it but i be not set down that on that particular occasion this be the cause of he failure to pursue for he be not able no matter how much he might have desire it to follow up the foe -lrb- -5 - -rrb- while the naval battle be in progress caesar as soon as he perceive that sextus be go from messana and that the strait be destitute of guard do not let slip this opportunity of the war but immediately embark on antony 's vessel and cross to tauromenium yet this seizure of the opportunity be not accompany by good fortune no one prevent he from sailing or disembarking and he construct he camp as he have do everything else at leisure when however the naval battle have end sextus get back to messana with speed and learning of caesar 's presence he quickly fill the ship with fresh warrior and assail he with the vessel and also with he heavy-armed man on land caesar do not come out to fight the latter but sail out against sextus through contempt of the few oppose ship and because they have be previously defeat : then it be that he lose the majority of he fleet and barely avoid destruction himself he could not even escape to he own man that be in sicily but be glad to reach the mainland in safety he be himself then in security but be mightily disturb at see he army cut off on the island he confidence be not restore until a fish of its own accord jump out of the sea and fall at he foot by this incident he spirit be invigorate and he believe the soothsayer who have tell he that he should make sicily he slave -lrb- -6 - -rrb- caesar in haste send for agrippa to render aid to they and meantime they be be besiege when provision begin to fail they and no rescue force appear cornificius they leader become afraid that if he stay where he be he should in the course of time be compel by hunger to yield to the besiege party and he reflect that while he delay there in that way none of the enemy would come into conflict with he because he be stronger in point of heavy-armed infantry but if he should go forward in any direction one of two thing would happen -- either they would be attack by the enemy and come off victorious or if they adversary be unwilling to do this they would retire to a place of safety get a supply of provision and obtain some help from caesar or from agrippa therefore he burn all the vessel which have survive from the sea-fight and have be cast up against the rampart and start out himself as if to proceed to mylae both cavalry and light-armed troops attack he from a distance -lrb- not daring to come to close quarter -rrb- and prove frightfully troublesome to he for the enemy come close whenever there be good opportunity and again turn back with rapidity but he man be heavy-armed could not pursue they in any way owe to the weight of they armor and be endeavor to protect the unarmed who have be save from the fleet as a result they be continually suffer disastrously and could do no damage in return for in case they make a rush upon any group they would put the foe to flight but not be able to pursue farther they find themselves in a worse plight on they return since by they sortie they have be isolate they endure the greatest hardship throughout they entire journey but chiefly in cross the river then they adversary hem they in as they be go along rapidly in disorder a few at a time as usual on such occasion and strike they in favorable spot that they see expose they be shoot at moreover whenever they encounter place that be muddy or where the current be strong and when they happen to be stick for a moment or be carry down stream -lrb- -7 - -rrb- this the enemy do for three whole day and on the last demoralize they completely especially since sextus with he heavy-armed contingent have be add to they attack force consequently the caesarian no longer mourn such as be perish but count they fortunate to escape from further torment and in they hopelessness wish that they too be among those already dead wound be far more in number than those die and be strike from a distance with stone and javelin and receive no blow from near at hand they wound be in many place and not as a rule favorably located these man be themselves in great distress and they cause the survivor far more trouble than do the enemy for if they be carry they usually bring about the death of the man support they and if they be leave behind they throw the whole army into dejection by they lament the detachment would have perish utterly have not the foe though reluctantly take they hand off they agrippa after win the naval battle have sail back to lipara but when he learn that sextus have flee to messana and demochare have go off in some other direction he cross over to sicily occupied myla and tyndari and send food and soldier to the other party sextus think that agrippa himself would come likewise become frightened and beat a hasty retreat before he approach even abandon some baggage and supplies in he fortification the follower of cornificius obtain from these ample support and make they way in safety to agrippa caesar receive they back with praise and gift although he have treat they after the victory of agrippa in a very supercilious manner think the latter have finish the war cornificius indeed pride himself so much upon he preservation of the soldier that in rome whenever he go out of he house to dine he always return home on the back of a elephant -lrb- -8 - -rrb- caesar after this enter sicily and sextus encamped opposite he in the vicinity of artemisium they do not have any great battle at once but indulge in a few slight cavalry skirmish while they be station there in hostile array sextus receive as a accession tisienus gallus and caesar lepidus with he force lepidus have encounter the storm which i mention and also demochare and he have lose a number of ship : he do not come to caesar immediately but on account of he reverse or to the end that he colleague should face difficulty by himself or in the wish to draw sextus away from he he have make a assault on lilybaeum gallus be send thither by sextus and contend against he from there both the contestant as they accomplish nothing go to artemisium gallus prove a source of strength to sextus but lepidus quarrel with caesar he claim the privilege of manage everything on equal term with caesar as he fellow-commander whereas he be employ by he entirely in the capacity of lieutenant : therefore he incline to favor sextus and secretly hold communication with he caesar suspect this but dare not give expression to he doubt and alienate he openly nor could he safely conceal he thought : he feel it would look suspicious if he should not consult he at all and that it would be dangerous to reveal all he plan hence he determine to dispose of the uncertainty as quickly as possible before there be any rebellion though for most reason there be no need of particular haste he have as much food and as much money as sextus and therefore hope to overthrow he without effort before a great while still when he have once reach this decision he himself lead out he land force and marshal it in front of the camp while simultaneously agrippa sail close in and lay at anchor sextus whose force be far inferior to theirs would not oppose they on either element this last for several day finally pompey become afraid that he might be despise for he behavior and be desert by he ally hence he give order for the ship to weigh anchor in these he repose he chief trust -lrb- -9 - -rrb- when the signal be raise and the trumpet give the first call all the boat join battle near the land and the infantry force of both alike be marshal at the very edge of the breaker so that the spectacle be a most notable one the whole sea in that vicinity be full of ship -- they be so many that they form a long line -- and the land just back of it be occupy by the armed man while that further remove but adjoining be take up by the rest of the throng that follow each side wherefore though the struggle seem to be between the fighter on the ship alone in reality the other too participate for those on the ship contend more valiantly in order to exhibit they prowess to those behold they and the latter in spite of be considerably separate from they nevertheless in watch the man in action be themselves in a way concern in the conflict the battle be for a long time a even one the fighting be precisely similar to that in previous encounter and the man on shore follow it with mind equally intent they be very hopeful of have the whole war settle by this engagement : yet they feel encouraged even should that not prove the case the one party expect that if they should conquer then no further labor of importance would be theirs and that if they should prevail on this occasion they would incur no further danger of defeat accordingly in order that they might keep they eye fix upon the action and not incommode those take part in it they be silent or employ but little shout they cry be direct to the combatant or be address by way of invocation to the god such as get the upper hand receive praise and such as give way abuse and besides utter many exhortation to they warrior they shout not a little against each other wish they own man to hear more easily what be say and they opponent to catch familiar word less frequently -lrb- -10 - -rrb- while the two side be equally match these be the condition among both party alike and they even try to show by gesture of the whole body that they could see and understand when however the adherent of sextus be route then in unison and with one impulse the one side raise the paean and the other a wail of lamentation the soldier as if they too have share defeat at once retire to messana caesar take up such of the vanquish as be cast on shore and go into the sea itself to set on fire all the vessel that run aground in shoal water thus there be no safety for such as continue to sail for they would be disable by agrippa nor for such as try to land anywhere for they be destroy by caesar except for a few that make good they escape to messana in this hard position demochare on the point of be take slew himself and apollophane who have he ship unscathed and might have flee go over to caesar the same be do by other -- by gallus and all the cavalry that follow he and subsequently by some of the infantry -lrb- -11 - -rrb- this most of all cause sextus to despair of the situation and he resolve to flee he take he daughter and certain other person he money and the rest of he chief valuable put they by night aboard of such ship as sail best out of the number that have be preserve and depart no one pursue he for he sailing have be secret and caesar be temporarily in the midst of great disturbance lepidus have attack messana and on be admit to the town set fire to some of it and pillage other portion when caesar on ascertain this come up quickly and withstand he he be alarm and slip out of the city but encamp on a strong hill and make complaint about he treatment he detail all the slight he have receive and demand all that have be concede to he accord to they first compact and further lay claim to sicily on the ground that he have help subdue it he send some man to caesar with these charge and challenge he to submit to arbitration : he force consist of troops which he have bring in from libya and all of those who have be leave behind in messana for he have be the first to enter it and have suggest to they some hope of a change in the government -lrb- -12 - -rrb- caesar make no answer to it think that he have justice all on he side and in he weapon since he be stronger than he rival he immediately set out however against he with some few follower expect to alarm he by he suddenness -- lepidus not be of a energetic nature -- and to win over he soldier on account of the fewness of the man accompany he they think when he enter the camp that he be on a peaceful errand but as he word be not at all to they liking they become irritated and attack he even kill some of the man : he himself quickly receive aid and be save after this he come against they once more with he entire army shut they within they rampart and besiege they this make they afraid of capture and without create any general revolt through dread of lepidus they individually a few at a time or one by one desert he and transfer they allegiance in this way he too be compel on he own initiative to array himself in mourn garment and become a suppliant of caesar as a result lepidus be shear of all authority and could not even live in italy without a guard of those who have be enlist in the cause of sextus member of the senatorial or equestrian class be punish save a few while in the case of the rank and file all free citizen be incorporate in the legion of caesar and those that have be slave be give back to they master for vengeance : in case no master could be find for any one of they he be impale of the city some voluntarily open they gate to the victor and receive pardon and other resist he and be discipline -lrb- -13 - -rrb- while caesar be thus occupy he soldier revolt be so many they draw encouragement from they very number and when they stop to think of they danger and the hope that rest on they they become insatiable in the matter of reward and gathering in group they demand whatever each one long for when they talk have no effect -- for caesar since no enemy longer confront he make light of they -- they become clamorous setting before he all the hardship they have endure and bring to he notice any promise he have ever make they they utter many threat besides and think to render he willy-nilly they slave as they gain nothing this way they demand with much heat and deafening shout to be relieve at least from further service say they be wear out this be not because they really wish to be free from it for most of they be in they prime but because they have a inkling of the come conflict between caesar and antony and for that reason set a high value upon themselves and what they could not obtain by request they expect they could secure by threaten to abandon he not even this however serve they purpose caesar would not yield to they even if he know for a absolute certainty that the war be go to occur and clearly understand they wish he do not think it proper for a commander to do anything against he will under compulsion from the soldier because they would be sure if he do to want to get the advantage of he again in some other matter -lrb- -14 - -rrb- so he pretend that they request be a fair one and they desire only human and dismiss first those that have accompany he in the campaign against antony at mutina and next since the rest be troublesome all of they who have be ten year in the service and in order to restrain the remainder he give further notice that he would no longer employ any one of they no matter how much such a person might wish it on hear this they utter not another word but begin to exhibit great devotion toward he because he announce that he would give to the man that have be release -- not to all save to the first of they but to the worthiest -- everything that he have promise and would assign they land they be also influence by the fact that he give to all of they five hundred denarius and to those who have be victor in the sea-fight a crown of olive besides after this he inspire they all personally with great hope and the centurion with the idea that he would appoint they to the senatorial body in they native land upon he lieutenant he bestow various gift and upon agrippa a golden crown adorn with beak of ship -- a decoration give to nobody before or since and it be later ratify by a decree that as often as any person celebrate a triumph wear -lrb- 49 -rrb- the laurel crown agrippa should always wear this trophy of the naval encounter in this way caesar calm the soldier temporarily the money he give they at once and the land not much later and since what be still hold by the government at the time do not suffice he buy more in addition especially considerable from the campanian dwelling in capua since they city need a number of settler to they he also give in return the so-called julian supply of water one of they chief source of pride at all time and the gnosian territory -lrb- 50 -rrb- from which they still gather harvest that take place later at the time under discussion he administer the government in sicily and through statilius taurus win both the libya without a struggle and send back to antony a number of ship equivalent to those lose -lrb- -15 - -rrb- meantime condition in etrurium which have be full of rebellion regain a state of quiet when the inhabitant hear of he victory the people of the capital unanimously bestow laudation upon he and image the right to front seat and a arch surmount by a trophy as well as the privilege of ride into the city on horseback of wear the laurel crown on all occasion and of hold a banquet with he wife and child in the precinct of the capitoline jupiter on the anniversary of the day that he have conquer which be to be a perpetual day of thanksgiving this be what they grant he directly after the victory the person to announce it be first a soldier station in the city who on the very day in question have become possess by some god and after say and do many unusual thing finally run up to the temple on the capitol and lay he sword at the foot of jupiter to signify that there would be no further use for it after that come the rest who have be present at the action and have be send to rome by caesar when he arrive himself he assemble they accord to ancestral custom outside the pomerium give they a account of what have be do and renounce some of the honor vote he he then remit the tribute call for by the register list and everything else that be owe the government since before the period of the civil war abolish certain tax and refuse to accept the priesthood of lepidus which be offer to he for it be not lawful to take away the appointment from a man still alive at this time they vote he many other distinction some at once declare that this striking magnanimity of he at this time be due to the calumny of antony and of lepidus and be intend to lay the blame of former unjust behavior upon they alone other say that since he be unable in any way to collect the debt he make of the people 's impotency a favor that cost he nothing in spite of this various talk that gain currency in different quarter they now resolve that a house be present to he from the public treasury he have make the place on the palatine which he have buy to erect a structure public property and have consecrate it to apollo because a thunderbolt descend upon it hence they vote he the house and protection from any insult by deed or word any one who commit such a offence be to be bind by the same penalty as prevail in the case of a tribune for he receive permission to sit upon the same bench with they -lrb- -16 - -rrb- these be the gift bestow upon caesar by the senate as for he he enrol among the augur above the proper number valerius messalum whom he previously in the proscription condemn to death make the people of utica citizen and give order that no one should wear purple clothing except senator and such as hold public office for it have be already appropriate by ordinary individual in a few case in this same year there be no aedile owe to a lack of candidate and the praetor and the tribune perform the aedile ' duty : also no praetor urbanus be appoint for the feria but some of the regular praetor discharge he function other matter in the city and in the rest of italy be under the charge of one gaius maecena a knight both then and for a long time afterward -lrb- -17 - -rrb- now sextus after take ship from messana be afraid of pursuit and suspect that there might be some act of treachery on the part of he retinue therefore he give notice to they that he be go to sail seaward but when he have extinguish the light which flagship exhibit during night voyage for the purpose of have the rest follow close behind he coast along italy then go over to corcyra and from there come to cephallenia here the remainder of he vessel which have by chance be drive from the course by a storm join he again accordingly after call they together he take off he general 's uniform and make a address of which the substance be that while they remain together they could render no lasting aid to one another or escape detection but if they scatter they could more easily make good they escape and he advise each man to look out individually and separately for he own safety the majority be lead to give ear to he argument and they depart in different direction while he with the remainder cross over to asia with the intention of go straight to antony when he reach lesbo and learn that the latter have go on a campaign against the mede and that caesar and lepidus have become estrange he decide to winter in the country the lesbian indeed out of affectionate remembrance for he father be ready to receive and detain he he ascertain however that antony have meet with a mishap in media and reflect further that gaius furnius temporarily the governor of asia be not friendly to he hence he do not remain but hope to succeed to antony 's leadership because a number of man have come to he from sicily and still other have rally around he some draw by the glamour of he father 's renown and some who be seek a livelihood he resume the outfit of a general and continue he preparation to occupy the opposite shore -lrb- -18 - -rrb- meantime antony have get back again into friendly territory and on learn what sextus be do promise he would grant he amnesty and favor if he would lay down he arm sextus write back to the effect that he would obey he but do not do so because he feel a contempt for the man inspire by he recent disaster and because he immediately set off for egypt hence he hold to he previous design and enter into negotiation with the parthian antony ascertain this but without turn back send against he the fleet and marcus titius who have formerly come to he from sextus and be still with he sextus receive information of this move in advance and in alarm since he preparation be not yet complete abandon he anchorage he go forward then take the course which seem most likely to afford escape and reach nicomedea where he be overtake at this he open negotiation with antony place some hope in he because of the kindness which have be show he when the chieftain however refuse to enter into a truce with he without first take possession of the ship and the rest of he force sextus despaired of safety by sea put all of he heavier baggage into the ship -lrb- which he thereupon burn -rrb- and proceed inland titius and furnius pursue he and overtake he at midaeium in phrygium surround he and capture he alive when antony learn this he at first under the influence of anger send a despatch that the captive should be put to death but again not long after repent -lrb- 51 -rrb- that he life should be spare -lrb- 51 -rrb- now the bearer of the second letter come in before the first and later titius receive the epistle in regard to kill he think therefore that it be really the second or else know the truth but not care to heed it he follow the order of the arrival of the two but not they manifest intention so sextus be execute in the consulship of lucius cornificius and one sextus pompeius -lrb- bc 35 -lrb- _ a u _ 719 -rrb- -rrb- caesar hold a horse-race in honor of the event and set up for antony a chariot in front of the rostrum and image in the temple of concord give he also authority to hold banquet there with he wife and child this be similar to the decree that have once be pass in he own honor he pretend to be still antony 's friend and be endeavor to console he for the disaster inflict by the parthian and in that way to cure any jealousy that might be feel at he own victory and the decree which follow it -lrb- bc 38 -lrb- _ a u _ 716 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -19 - -rrb- this be what caesar do : antony 's experience with the barbarian be as follow publius ventidius hear that pacorus be gather a army and be invade syrium and become afraid since the city have not grow quiet and the legion be still scatter in winter-quarter and so he act as follow to delay he and make the assemble of a army a slow process he know that a certain prince channaeus with whom he enjoy a acquaintance be rather dispose to favor the parthian cause ventidius then honor he as if he have he entire confidence and take he as a adviser in some matter where he could not himself be injure and would cause channaeus to think he possess he most hidden secret have reach this point he affect to be afraid that the barbarian might abandon the place where they customarily cross the euphrate near where the city zeugma be located and use some other road farther down the river the latter he say be in a flat district convenient for the enemy whereas the former be hilly and suit _ they _ best he persuade the prince to believe this and through the latter deceive pacorus the parthian leader take the route through the flat district where ventidius keep pretend he hope he would not go and as this be longer than the other it give the roman time to assemble he force -lrb- -20 - -rrb- so he meet pacorus when he have advance to cyrrestician syrium and conquer he for he do not prevent they from cross the river and when they have get across he do not at once attack they so that they imputed sloth and weakness to the roman and therefore march against the roman fortification although on higher ground expect to take it without resistance when a sally be suddenly make the attack party be cavalry be drive back without effort down the slope at the foot they defend themselves valiantly -- the majority of they be in armor -- but be confuse by the unexpectedness of the onslaught and stumble over one another be damage most of all by the heavy-armed man and the slinger the latter strike they from a distance with powerful weapon and prove a very great annoyance the fall of pacorus at this critical juncture injure they most of all as soon as they see that they leader have perish a few steadily contend over he body but when these be destroy all the rest give way some of they desire to escape homeward across the bridge and be not able be cut off and kill before they could reach it and other flee for refuge to antiochus in commagene ventidius easily reduce the rest of the place in syrium whose attitude have depend on the outcome of the war by send the monarch 's head about through the different city they doubtful allegiance have be due to they extreme love for pacorus because of he justness and mildness -- a love which have equal that bestow by they upon any previous sovereign the general himself lead a expedition against antiochus on the plea that he have not deliver up the suppliant but really because of he money of which he have vast store -lrb- -21 - -rrb- when he have progress so far antony suddenly come upon he and so far from be please be actually jealous of he have gain some reputation by he own effort consequently he remove he from he command and employ he on no other business either at the time or later though he obtain thanksgiving for both achievement and a triumph for he assistant 's work the roman of the capital vote these honor to antony as a result of he prominence and in accordance with law because he be commander : but they vote they also to ventidius since they think that he have pay the parthian in full through the death of pacorus for the disaster that roman arm have incur in the time of crassus especially since both event have befall on the same day of the corresponding year and it turn out that ventidius alone celebrate the triumph even as the victory have be he alone for antony meet a untimely fate and he acquire a greater reputation from this fact and the irony of fortune alike he himself have once march in procession with the other captive at the triumph of pompeius strabo and now he be the first of the roman to celebrate a triumph over the parthian -lrb- -22 - -rrb- this take place at a later period : at the time mention antony attack antiochus shut he up in samosa and proceed to besiege he as he accomplish nothing and the time be spend in vain and he suspect that the soldier feel coldly toward he on account of he dishonor ventidius he secretly open negotiation with the foe and make fictitious agreement with he so that he might have a fair appear reason for withdrawal in the end antony get neither hostage -lrb- except two and these of little importance -rrb- nor the money which he have demand but he grant antiochus the death of one alexander who have earlier desert from he to the roman side after do this he set out for italy and gaius sosius receive from he the governorship of syrium and cilicium this man subdue the aradius who have be besiege up to this time and have be reduce to hard strait by famine and disease and conquer antigonus in battle after kill the roman guard that he keep about he and reduce he by siege when he take refuge in jerusalem the jew have commit many outrage upon the roman -- for the race be very bitter when arouse to anger -- but they suffer far more themselves the first of they be capture fight for the precinct of they god and later the rest on the day even then call the day of saturn and so great still be they religious scruple that the man who have be first capture along with the temple obtain leave from sosius when the day of saturn come around again and go up with the remain population into the building where they perform all the customary rite these people antony entrust to one herod to govern and antigonus he bind to a cross and flog -- treatment accord to no other king by the roman -- and subsequently slew he -lrb- bc 37 -lrb- _ a u _ 717 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -23 - -rrb- this be the course of event in the day of claudius and norbanus : the following year the roman accomplish nothing worthy of note in syrium antony arrive in italy and return again to the province consume the entire season : and sosius because he would be advance he master 's interest and not he own and furthermore dread he jealousy and anger spend the time in devise mean not for achieve success and draw down he enmity but for please he by remain quiet parthian affair with no outside interference undergo a severe revolution from the follow cause orode they king succumb to age and grief for pacorus combine and while still alive deliver the government to phraate the eldest of he remain child he in he discharge of it prove himself the most impious of man he treacherously murder he brother son of the daughter of antiochus because they be he superior in excellence and -lrb- on they mother 's side -rrb- in family : when antiochus chafe under this outrage he kill he in addition and after that destroy the noblest man in the remain population and keep commit many other abuse consequently a number of the more prominent person abandon he and betake themselves to various place some go to antony among whom be monaese this happen in the consulship of agrippa and gallus -lrb- bc 36 -lrb- _ a u _ 718 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -24 - -rrb- during the remainder of winter when gallus and nerva be hold office publius canidius crassus make a campaign against the iberian that inhabit this portion of the world conquer in battle they king pharnabazus and bring they into alliance with this king he invade albanis the adjoining country and after overcome the dweller there and they king zober conciliate they likewise antony be elate at this and furthermore base great hope upon monaese who have promise he to lead he army and bring over to he most of parthium without conflict hence the roman take up the war against the parthian in earnest and besides make various present to monaese give he three roman city to govern until he should finish the war and promise he in addition the parthian kingdom while they be so occupied phraate become terrify especially because the parthian take the flight of monaese very much amiss and he open negotiation with he offer he anything whatever and so persuade he to return when antony find this out he be naturally angry but do not kill monaese although the latter be still in he power for he feel sure he could not win the confidence of any other of the barbarian in case he should do such a thing and he want to try a little trick against they he accordingly release monaese apparently suppose the latter be go to bring the parthian affair under he control and send envoy with he to phraate nominally he be arrange for peace on the condition of get back the standard and the prisoner capture in the disaster of crassus intend to take the king off he guard while the latter be expect a pacific settlement but in fact he be put everything in readiness for war -lrb- -25 - -rrb- and he go as far as the euphrate think it be free of guard when however he find that whole region carefully guard he turn aside from it but lead a campaign against artavasde the king of the mede persuade thereto by the king of greater armenia who have the same name and be a enemy of the aforementioned just as he be he at once advance toward armenia and learn there that the mede have go a considerable distance from he own land in the discharge of he duty as a ally of the parthian king he leave behind the beast of burden and a portion of the army with oppius statianus give order for they to follow and himself take the cavalry and the strongest of the infantry hurry on in the confidence of seize all he opponent 's stronghold at one blow he assail praaspa the royal residence heap up mound and make constant attack when the parthian and the medan king ascertain this they leave he to continue he idle toil -- for the wall be strong and many be defend they -- but assail statianus off he guard and weary on the march and slew the whole detachment except polemon king of pontus who be then accompany the expedition he alone they take alive and release in exchange for ransom they be able to accomplish this because the armenian king be not present at the battle but though he might have help the roman as some say he neither do this nor join antony but retire to he own country -lrb- -26 - -rrb- antony hasten at the first message send he by statianus to go to he assistance but be too late for except corpse he find no one this outcome cause he fear but inasmuch as he fall in with no barbarian he suspect that they have depart in some direction through terror and this lend he new courage hence when he meet they a little later he route they for he slinger be numerous and as the latter could shoot farther than would the bow they inflict severe injury upon the man in armor however he do not kill any remarkable number of they because the barbarian could ride fast so he proceed again against praaspa and besiege it though he do no great damage to the enemy for the man inside the wall repulse he vigorously and those outside could not easily be entrap into a combat thus he lose many of he own man in search for and bring provision and many by he own discipline at first as long as they could get they food from somewhere in the neighborhood they have no difficulty about either undertaking : they could attend to the siege and safely secure supplies both at once when however all material at hand have be use up and the soldier be oblige to go to some distance it happen to they that if few be send anywhere not only do they not bring anything but they perish as well if a number be send they leave the wall destitute of besieger and meantime lose many man and many engine at the hand of the barbarian who would make a sortie against they -lrb- -27 - -rrb- for this reason antony give they all barley instead of wheat and destroy every tenth man in some instance : indeed the entire force which be suppose to be besiege endure the hardship of person besiege the man within the wall watch carefully for opportunity to make sally and those outside harass fearfully the roman that remain in position as often as they become separated accomplish this by make a sudden charge and wheeling about again in a narrow space : this force outside do not trouble the food train while the latter be en route to the village but would fall upon they unexpectedly when scatter in the homeward march but since antony even under these condition maintain he place before the city phraate fear that in the long run he might do it some harm either by himself or through secure some ally force secretly send some man to open negotiation with he and persuade he by pretend that it would be very easy to secure peace after this when man be send to he by antony he hold a conference with they seat upon a golden chair and twang he bowstring he first inveigh against they at length but finally promise that he would grant peace if they would straightway remove they camp on hearing this antony be both alarm at he boastfulness and ready to believe that a truce could be secure if he himself should shift he position : hence he withdraw without destroy any of he implement of siege but behave as if in friendly territory -lrb- -28 - -rrb- when he have do this and be await the truce the mede burn the engine and scatter the mound while the parthian make no proposition to he respect peace but suddenly attack he and inflict very serious damage he find out that he have be deceive and do not venture to employ any further envoy be sure that the barbarian would not agree to any reasonable term and not wish to cast the soldier into dejection by fail to arrange a truce therefore he resolve since he have once start to hurry on into armenia he troops take another road since the one by which they have come they believe to have be block entirely and on the way they suffering be unusually great they come into unknown region where they wander at random and furthermore the barbarian seize the pass in advance of they approach digging trench outside of some and build palisade in front of other spoil the water-courses everywhere and drive away the flock in case they ever get a chance to march through more favorable territory the enemy would turn they aside from such place by false announcement that they have be occupy beforehand and cause they to take different road along which ambuscade have be previously post so that many perish through such mishap and many of hunger -lrb- -29 - -rrb- as a result there be some desertion and they would all have go over have not the barbarian shoot down before the eye of the other any who dare to take this course consequently the man refrain from this and from fortune 's hand obtain the follow relief one day when they fall into a ambush and be strike with fast-flying arrow they suddenly make by join shield the _ testudo _ and rest they leave knee on the ground the barbarian have never see anything of the kind before and think that they have fall from they wound and need only one finish blow so they throw aside they bow leap from they horse and draw they dagger come close to put a end to they at this the roman rise to they foot spread out the phalanx at a word and each one attack the man nearest and face he thus they cut down great number since they be contend arm against a unprotected foe man prepare against man off they guard heavy infantry against archer roman against barbarian all the survivor immediately retire and no one follow they for the future -lrb- -30 - -rrb- this _ testudo _ and the way in which it be form deserve a word of explanation the baggage animal the light-armed troops and the cavalry be marshal in the center of the army those infantryman who use the oblong hollow grooved shield be draw up around the edge make a rectangular figure and face outward with spear-point project -lrb- 52 -rrb- they enclose the rest the other infantryman who have flat shield form a compact body in the center and raise they shield above themselves and above all the rest so that nothing but shield can be see in every part of the phalanx alike and all the man by the density of formation be under shelter from missile it be so marvelously strong that man can walk upon it and when ever they get into a hollow narrow passage even horse and vehicle can be drive over it such be the method of this arrangement and this show why it have receive the title of _ testudo _ -lrb- 53 -rrb- -- with reference to its strength and to the excellent shelter it afford they use it in two way : either they approach some fort to assault it often even enable man to scale the very wall or where sometimes they be surround by archer they all bend together -- even the horse be teach to kneel and recline -- and thereby cause the foe to think that they be exhaust then when the other draw near they suddenly rise to the latter 's great alarm -lrb- -31 - -rrb- the _ testudo _ then be the kind of device just describe as for antony he suffer no further harm from the enemy but undergo severe hardship by reason of the cold it be now winter and the mountain district of armenia through which as the only route open to he he be actually thankful to be able to proceed be never free from snow and ice the wound of which the man have many there create especial discomfort so many keep perish and be continually render useless for fight that he would not allow report of each individual case but forbid any one to bring he any such news and although he be angry with the armenian king for desert they and anxious to take vengeance on he he nevertheless humiliate himself before the monarch and pay court to he for the purpose of obtain provision and money from he finally as the soldier could not hold out to march farther in the winter time too and be at any rate go to have they hardship for nothing since he be mind to return to armenia before a great while he flatter the prince tremendously and make he many attractive promise to get he to allow the man to winter where they be he say that in the spring he would make another campaign against the parthian money also come to he from cleopatra so that to each of the infantryman be give one hundred denarius -lrb- 54 -rrb- and to the rest a proportionate allowance but inasmuch as the amount send be not enough for they he pay the remainder from he own fund and though the expense be he own he give cleopatra the credit of the favor for he both solicit contribution from he friend and levy a great deal of money upon the ally -lrb- -32 - -rrb- follow these transaction he depart for egypt now the roman at home be not ignorant of anything that have take place in spite of the fact that he despatch do not contain the truth for he conceal all he unpleasant experience and some of they he describe as just the opposite make it appear that he be progress famously : but for all that rumor report the truth and caesar and he circle investigate it carefully and discuss it they do not however make public they evidence but instead sacrifice cattle and hold festival since caesar at that time be still get the worst of it against sextus the truth of the fact could not be render fitting or opportune besides he above action antony assign position of government give gaul to amynta though he have be only the secretary of deiotarus and also add to he domain lycaonium with portion of pamphylium and bestow upon archelaus cappadocium after drive out ariarathe this archelaus on he father 's side belong to those archelause who have contend against the roman but on he mother 's side be the son of glaphyra a hetaera it be quite true that for these appointment antony who could be very magnanimous in deal with the possession of other people be somewhat less ill speak of among the soldier but in the matter of cleopatra he incur outspoken dislike because he have take into he family child of hers -- the elder one be alexander and cleopatra twin at a birth and the younger one ptolemy call also philadelphus -- and because he have grant to they a great deal of arabium both the district of malchus and that of the ituraean -lrb- for he execute lysania whom he have himself make king over they on the charge that he have favor paccrus -rrb- and also a great deal of phoenicium and palestine together with part of crete and cyrene and cyprus -lrb- bc 35 -lrb- _ a u _ 719 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -33 - -rrb- these be he act at that time : the following year when pompeius and cornificius be consul he attempt to conduct a campaign against the armenian prince and as he place no little hope in the mede because the latter be indignant at phraate owe to not have receive from he much of the spoil or any other honor and be anxious to punish the armenian king for bring in the roman antony send polemon to he and request friendship and alliance and he be so well satisfy with the business that he both make term with the mede and later give polemon lesser armenia as a reward for he embassy first he summon the armenian to egypt as a friend intend to seize he there without effort and make away with he but when the prince suspect this and do not obey he plot to deceive he in another fashion he do not openly evince anger toward he in order not to alienate he but to the end that he might find he foe unprepared set sail from egypt with the avowed object of make one more campaign against the parthian on the way antony learn that octavium be arrive from rome and go no farther but return this he do in spite of have at once order she to go home and later accept the gift which she send some of they be soldier which she have beg from she brother for this very purpose -lrb- -34 - -rrb- as for he he become more than ever a slave to the passion and wiles of cleopatra caesar meantime since sextus have perish and affair in libya require settlement go to sicily as if intend to take ship thither but after delay there find that the winter make it too late for cross now the salassus tauriscus liburnus and iapude have not for a long time be behave fairly toward the roman but have fail to contribute revenue and sometimes would invade and harm the neighbor district at this time in view of octavius 's absence they be openly in revolt consequently he turn back and begin he preparation against they some of the man who have be dismiss when they become disorderly and have receive nothing wish to serve again : therefore he assign they to one camp in order that be alone they might find it impossible to corrupt any one else and in case they should wish to show themselves rebellion might be detect at once as this do not teach they moderation any the more he send out a few of the eldest of they to become colonist in gaul thinking that thus he would inspire the rest with hope and win they devotion since even then they continue audacious some of they pay the penalty the rest display rage at this whereupon he call they together as if for some other purpose have the rest of the army surround they take away they arm and remove they from the service in this way they learn both they own weakness and caesar 's force of mind and so they really experience a change of heart and after urgent supplication be allow to enter the service anew for caesar be in need of soldier and fear that antony would appropriate they say that he pardon they and he find they most useful for all task -lrb- -35 - -rrb- it be later that they prove they sincerity at this time he himself lead the campaign against the iapude assign the rest of the tribe to other to subdue those that be on he side of the mountain dwelling not far from the sea he reduce with comparatively little trouble but he overcome those on the height and beyond they with no small hardship they strengthen metulum the largest of they city and repulse many assault of the roman burn to the ground many engine and lay low octavius himself as he be try to step from a wooden tower upon the circuit of the wall later when he still do not desist but keep send for additional force they pretend to wish to negotiate term and receive member of garrison into they citadel then by night they destroy all of these and set fire to they house some killing themselves and some they wife and child in addition so that nothing whatever remain for caesar for not only they but also such as be capture alive destroy themselves voluntarily shortly afterward -lrb- -36 - -rrb- when these have perish and the rest have be subdue without perform any exploit of note he make a campaign against the pannonian he have no complaint to bring against they not have be wrong by they in any way but he want both to give he soldier practice and to support they abroad : for he regard every demonstration against a weaker party as just when it please the man whom weapon make they superior the pannonian be settle near dalmatium close along the ister from noricum to european moesium and lead the most miserable existence of mankind they be not well off in the matter of land or sky they cultivate no olive or vine except to the slightest extent and these wretched variety since the greater part of they day be pass in the midst of most rigorous winter but they drink as well as eat barley and millet they have be consider very brave however during all period of which we have cognizance for they be very quick to anger and ready to slay inasmuch as they possess nothing which can give they a happy life this i know not by hearsay or read only but i have learn it from actual experience as they governor for after my term as ruler in africa and in dalmatium -- the latter position my father also hold for a time -- i be appoint -lrb- 55 -rrb- to upper pannonium so-called and hence my record be found on exact knowledge of all condition among they they name be due to the fact that they cut up a kind of toga in a way peculiar to themselves into strip which they call _ pannus _ and then stitch these together into sleeved tunic for themselves they have be name so either for this or for some other reason but certain of the greek who be ignorant of the truth have speak of they as paeone which be a old word but do not belong there but rather apply to rhodope close to the present macedonium as far as the sea wherefore i shall call the dweller in the latter district paeone but the other pannonian just as they themselves and as the roman do -lrb- -37 - -rrb- it be against this people then that caesar at that time conduct a campaign at first he do not devastate or plunder at all although they abandon they village in the plain he hope to make they he subject of they free will but when they harass he as he advance to siscia he become angry burn they land and take all the booty he could when he draw near the city the native for a moment listen to they ruler and make term with he and give hostage but afterward shut they gate and accept a state of siege they possess strong wall and be in general encourage by the presence of two navigable river the one name the colop -lrb- 56 -rrb- flow past the very circuit of the wall and empty into the savus not far distant : it have now encircle the entire city for tiberius give it this shape by construct a great canal through which it rejoin its ancient course at that time between the colop on the one hand which flow on past the very wall and the savus on the other which flow at a little distance a empty space have be leave which have be buttress with palisade and ditch caesar secure boat make by the ally in that vicinity and after tow they through the ister into the savus and through that stream into the colop he assail the enemy with infantry and ship together and have some naval battle on the river for the barbarian prepare in turn some boat make of one piece of wood with which they risk a conflict and on the river they kill besides many other mena the freedman of sextus and on the land they vigorously repulse the invader until they ascertain that some of they ally have be ambush and destroy then in dejection they yield when they have thus be capture the remainder of pannonian territory be induce to capitulate -lrb- -38 - -rrb- after this he leave fufius geminus there with a small force and himself return to rome the triumph which have be vote to he he defer but grant octavium and livium image the right of administer they own affair without a supervisor and freedom from fear and inviolability equally with the tribune -lrb- bc 34 -lrb- _ a u _ 720 -rrb- -rrb- in emulation of he father he have start out to lead a expedition into britain and have already advance into gaul after the winter in which antony for the second time and lucius libo be consul when some of the newly capture and dalmatian with they rise in revolt geminus although expel from siscium recover the pannonian by a few battle and valerius messalum overthrow the salassus and the rest who have join they in rebellion against the dalmatian first agrippa and then caesar also make campaign the most of they they subjugate after undergo many terrible experience themselves such as caesar 's be wound barley be give to some of the soldier instead of wheat and other who have desert the standard be decimate : with the remain tribe -lrb- 57 -rrb- statilius taurus carry on war -lrb- -39 - -rrb- antony meanwhile resign he office as soon as appoint put lucius sempronius atratinus in he place consequently some name the latter and not the former in the enumeration of the consul in the course of he effort to take vengeance on the armenian king with least trouble to himself he ask the hand of he daughter pretend to want to unite she in marriage to he son alexander he send on this errand one quintus deillius who have once be a favorite of he and promise to give the monarch many gift finally at the beginning of spring he come suddenly into nicopoli -lrb- found by pompey -rrb- and send for he state that he want to deliberate on and execute with he aid some measure against the parthian the king suspect the plot do not come so he send deillius to have another talk with he and march with undiminished haste toward artaxa in this way after a long time partly by persuade he through friend and partly by scare he through he soldier and write and act toward he in every way as thoroughly friendly he induce he to come into he camp thereupon the roman arrest he and at first keep the prince without bond he lead he around among the garrison with whom he treasure be deposit to see if he could win they without a struggle he make a pretence of have arrest he for no other purpose than to collect tribute of the armenian that would ensure both he preservation and he sovereignty when however the guardian of the gold would have nothing to do with he and the troops under arm choose artax the eldest of he child king in he stead antony bind he in silver chain it seem disgraceful probably for one who have be a king to be make fast in iron bond -lrb- -40 - -rrb- after this capture some settlement peaceably and some by force antony occupy all of armenia for artax after fight a engagement and be worst retire to the parthian prince after do this he betroth to he son the daughter of the median king with the intention of make he still more he friend then he leave the legion in armenia and go once more to egypt take the great mass of booty and the armenian with he wife and child he send they ahead with the other captive for a triumph hold in alexandrium and himself drive into the city upon a chariot and among the other favor he grant to cleopatra he bring before she the armenian and he family in golden bond she be seat in the midst of the populace upon a platform plate with silver and upon a gilded chair the barbarian would not be she suppliant nor do obeisance to she though much coercion be bring to bear upon they and hope be hold out to persuade they but they merely address she by name : this give they a reputation for spirit but they be subject to a great deal of ill usage on account of it -lrb- -41 - -rrb- after this antony give a entertainment to the alexandrian and in the assemblage have cleopatra and she child sit by he side : also in the course of a public address he enjoin that she be call queen of monarch and ptolemy -lrb- whom he name caesarion -rrb- king of king he then make a different distribution by which he give they egypt and cyprus for he declare that one be the wife and the other the true son of the former caesar and he make the plea that he be do this as a mark of favor to the dead statesman -- he purpose be to cast reproach in this way upon octavianus caesar because he be only a adopt and not a real son of he besides make this assignment to they he promise to give to he own child by cleopatra the follow land -- to ptolemy syrium and all the region west of the euphrate as far as the hellespont to cleopatra libya about cyrene and to they brother alexander armenia and the rest of the district across the euphrate as far as the indus the latter he bestow as if they be already he not only do he say this in alexandrium but send a despatch to rome in order that it might secure ratification also from the people there nothing of this however be read in public -lrb- bc 32 -lrb- _ a u _ 722 -rrb- -rrb- domitius and sosius be consul by that time and be extremely devoted to he refuse to accede to caesar 's urgent demand that they should publish it to all though they prevail in this matter caesar win a victory in turn by not have anything that have be write about the armenian king make know to the public he feel pity for the prince because he have be secretly in communication with he for the purpose of injure antony and he grudge the latter he triumph while antony be engage as describe he dare to write to the senate that he wish to give up he office and put all affair into the hand of that body and of the people : he be not really intend to do anything of the kind but he desire that under the influence of the hope he rouse they might either compel caesar because on the spot to give up he arm first or begin to hate he if he would not heed they -lrb- -42 - -rrb- in addition to these event at that time the consul celebrate the festival hold in honor of venus genetrix during the feriae prefect boy and beardless youth appoint by caesar and spring from knight but not from senator direct ceremony also aemilius lepidus paulus construct at he own expense the so-called _ porticus paulus _ and dedicate it in he consulship for he be consul a portion of that year and agrippa restore from he own purse the so-called marcian water-supply which have be cut off by the destruction of the pipe and carry it in pipe to many part of the city these man though rival in the outlay of they private fund still dissemble the fact and behave sensibly : other who be hold even some most insignificant office strove to get a triumph vote to themselves some through antony and some through caesar and on this pretext they levy large sum upon foreign nation for gold crown -lrb- bc 33 -lrb- _ a u _ 721 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -43 - -rrb- the next year agrippa agree to be make aedile and without take anything from the public treasury repair all the public building and all the road clean out the sewer and sail through they underground into the tiber and see that in the hippodrome man make mistake about the number of turn necessary he establish the system of dolphin and egg-shaped object so that by they the number of time the track have be circle might be clearly show furthermore he distribute to all olive oil and salt and have the bath open free of charge throughout the year for the use of both man and woman in the many festival of all kind which he give -lrb- so many that the child of senator could perform the troy equestrian exercise -rrb- he also pay barber to the end that no one should be at any expense for they service finally he rain upon the head of the people in the theater ticket that be good for money in one case clothes in another and something else in a third and he also would place various other large stock of goods in the square and allow the people to scramble for they besides do this agrippa drive the astrologer and charlatan from the city during these same day a decree be pass that no one belong to the senatorial class should be try for piracy and so those who be under any such charge at the time be release and some be give _ carte blanche _ to commit crime in future caesar become consul for the second time with lucius tullus as he colleague but on the very first day as antony have do he resign and with the sanction of the senate he introduce some person from the populace to the rank of patrician when a certain lucius asellius who be praetor on account of a long sickness wish to lay down he office he appoint he son in he stead and another praetor die on the last day of he term whereupon caesar choose another for the remain hour at the decease of bocchus he give he kingdom to no one else but enrol it among the roman province and since the dalmatian have be utterly subdue he erect from the spoil thus gain the portico and secure the collection of book call the octavian after he sister -lrb- -44 - -rrb- antony meantime have march as far as the arax presumably to conduct a campaign against the parthian but be satisfy to arrange term with the median monarch they make a covenant to serve each other as ally the one against the parthian and the other against caesar and to cement the compact they exchange some soldier the median prince receive a portion of the newly acquire armenia and antony he daughter iotape to be unite in marriage with alexander and the military standard take in the battle with statianus after this antony bestow upon polemon as i have state lesser armenia both make lucius flavius consul and remove he -lrb- as he colleague -rrb- and set out for ionium and greece to wage war against caesar the median at first by employ the roman as ally conquer the parthian and artax who come against he but as antony send for he soldier and moreover retain those of the prince the latter be in turn defeat and capture and so armenia be lose together with media dio 's roman history 50 the following be contain in the fiftieth of dio 's rome how caesar and antony commence hostility against each other -lrb- chapter 1-14 -rrb- how caesar conquer antony at actium -lrb- chapter 15-35 -rrb- duration of time two year in which there be the follow magistrate here enumerate : cn domitius lfcnn ahenobarbus c sosius cf tn -lrb- bc 32 = a u 722 -rrb- caesar -lrb- iii -rrb- m valerius mf messalum corvinus -lrb- bc 31 = a u 723 -rrb- -lrb- _ book 50 boissevain _ -rrb- -lrb- -1 - -rrb- the roman people have be rob of democracy but have not become definitely a monarchy : antony and caesar still controlled affair on a equal footing have divide the management of most of they and nominally consider that the rest belong to they in common though in reality they endeavor to appropriate each interest as fast as either be able to gain any advantage over the other sextus have now perish the armenian king have be capture the party hostile to caesar be silent the parthian show no sign of restlessness and so after this they turn openly against each other and the people become entirely enslave the cause for the war or the pretext be as follow antony charge against caesar that he have remove lepidus from he position and have take possession of he territory and the troops of both he and sextus which ought to have be common property he demand the half of these as well as the half of the soldier that have be levy in the part of italy which belong to both of they caesar 's charge against he be that he be hold egypt and other country that he have not draw by lot have kill sextus -lrb- whom he would willingly have spare he say -rrb- and by deceive and bind the armenian king have cause much ill repute to attach to the roman people he too demand half of the spoil and above all reproach he with cleopatra and the child of hers which he have see fit to regard as he own the gift bestow upon they and particularly that he call the boy such a name as caesarion and place he in the family of caesar -lrb- -2 - -rrb- these be they mutual charge and to a certain extent mutual rejoinder be make some send by letter to each other and other give to the public by caesar orally by antony in write on this pretext also they keep constantly send envoy back and forth wish to appear as far as possible justified in the complaint they make and to reconnoitre each other 's position at the same time -lrb- bc 32 -lrb- _ a u _ 722 -rrb- -rrb- meanwhile they be collect money avowedly for some different purpose and be make all other preparation for war as if against other person until the time that gnaeus domitius and gaius sosius both belong to antony 's party become consul then they make no further concealment but admit they alienation outright it happen in the following way domitius do not openly attempt any radical measure since he have have the experience of many calamity sosius however have never experience such evil and so on the very first day of the month he speak at length in praise of antony and inveigh forcibly against caesar indeed he would have immediately introduce measure against the latter have not nonius balbus a tribune prevent it caesar have suspect what he be go to do and wish neither to permit it to come to pass nor by offer opposition to appear to be commence war hence he do not enter the senate at this time nor even live in the city at all but invent some excuse which take he out of town he be not only influence by the above consideration but desire to deliberate at leisure accord to the report bring to he and decide by mature reflection upon the proper course later he return and convene the senate he be surround by a guard of soldier and friend who have dagger conceal and sit between the consul upon he chair of state he speak at length and calmly from where he sit regard he own position and bring many accusation against sosius and antony when neither of the consul themselves nor any one else venture to utter a word he bid they come together again on a specify day give they to understand that he would prove by certain document that antony be in the wrong the consul do not dare to reply to he and could not endure to be silent and therefore secretly leave the city before the time come for they to appear again after that they take they way to antony follow by not a few of the senator who be leave caesar on learn this declare to prevent its appear that he have be abandon by they as a result of some injustice that he have send they out voluntarily and that he grant the rest who so wish permission to depart unarmed to antony -lrb- -3 - -rrb- this action of theirs just mention be counterbalance by the arrival of other who have flee from antony to caesar -- among they titius and plancus though they be honor by antony among the foremost and know all he secret they desertion be due to some friction between themselves and the roman leader or perhaps they be disgust in the matter of cleopatra : at any rate they leave soon after the consul have take the final step and caesar in the latter 's absence have convene the senate and read and speak all that he wish upon hearing of which antony assemble a kind of senate from the rank of he follower and after considerable talk on both side of the question take up the war and renounce he connection with octavium caesar be very glad to receive the pair and learn from they about antony 's condition what he be do what he have in mind what be write in he will and the name of the man that have it for they have take part in seal it he become still more violently enrage from this cause and do not shrink from search for the document seize it and then carry it into the senate and subsequently the assembly and read it the clause contain in it be of such a nature that he most lawless behavior bring upon he no reproach from the citizen the writer have asseverate the fact that caesarion be truly spring from caesar have give some enormous present to he child by the egyptian queen who be be rear by he and have order that he body be bury in alexandrium and by she side -lrb- -4 - -rrb- this make the roman in they indignation believe that the other report circulate be also true -- viz that if antony should prevail he would bestow they city upon cleopatra and transfer the seat of power to egypt and thereat they become so angry that all not only such as disliked he or be indifferent to the two man censure he but even he most intimate friend do so severely for in consternation at what be read and eager to relieve themselves of the suspicion feel toward they by caesar they say the same as the rest they deprive he of the consulship to which he have be previously elect and of all he remain authority they do not declare he a enemy in so many word because they fear its effect on he adherent since it would be necessary that they also be hold in the position of enemy in case they should not abandon he but by action they show they attitude as plainly as possible for they vote to the man array on he side pardon and praise if they would abandon he and declare war outright upon cleopatra put on they military cloak as though he be close at hand and go to the temple of bellona where they perform through caesar as _ fetiali _ all the rite preliminary to war in the customary fashion these be state to refer to cleopatra but they real bearing be on antony -lrb- -5 - -rrb- she have enslave he so absolutely that she persuade he to act as gymnasiarch -lrb- 58 -rrb- to the alexandrian and she be salute by he as queen and mistress have roman soldier in she body-guard and all of these inscribe she name upon they shield she use to frequent the market-place with he join he in the management of festival in the hearing of lawsuit and in ride and in the city she be actually carry in a chair while antony accompany she on foot along with the eunuch he also term he head-quarter the palace sometimes wear a oriental dagger at he belt dress in a manner not in accordance with the custom of he native land and let himself be see even in public upon a gilded couch and a chair of similar appearance he join she in sit for painting and statue he represent osiri and dionysus and she selene and isis this more than all make he seem to have become craze by she through some enchantment she so charm and enthral not only he but all the rest who have any influence with he that she conceive the hope of rule the roman and make she greatest vow whenever she take any oath that of dispense justice on the capitol -lrb- -6 - -rrb- this be the reason that they vote for war against cleopatra but they make no such declaration against antony know well that he would be make hostile in any case for he be certainly not go to betray she and espouse caesar 's cause and they wish to have this additional reproach to heap upon he that he have voluntarily take up war in behalf of the egyptian woman against he native country though no ill treatment have be accord he personally at home now the man of fight age be be rapidly assemble on both side money be be collect from all quarter and all warlike equipment be be gather with speed the entire armament distinctly surpass in size anything previous all the follow nation coperated with one side or the other in this war caesar have italy -- he attach to he cause even all those who have be place in colony by antony partly by frightening they on account of they small number and partly by confer benefit among other thing that he do be to settle again as a act of he own the man who inhabit bononia so that they might seem to be he colonist he ally then be italy gaul spain illyricum the libyan -- both those who have long since accept roman sway -lrb- except those about cyrene -rrb- and those that have belong to bogud and bocchus -- sardinium sicily and the rest of the island adjacent to the aforementioned division of the mainland on antony 's side be the region obey rome in continental asia the region of thrace greece macedonium the egyptian the cyrenaean together with the surrounding country the islander dwelling near they and practically all the prince and potentate who be neighbor to that part of the roman empire then under he control -- some take the field themselves and other be represent by troops and so enthusiastic be the outside contingent on both side that they confirm by oath they alliance with each man -lrb- -7 - -rrb- such be the strength of the contestant antony take a oath to he own soldier that he would fight without quarter and further promise that within two month after he victory he would give up he entire power and commit it to the senate and the people : some of they with difficulty persuade he to do so only when six month have elapse so that he might be able to settle matter leisurely and he however far he be from seriously contemplate such a act yet make the offer to strengthen the belief that he be certainly and without fail go to conquer he see that he own force be much superior in number and hope to weaken that of he opponent by bribe he send gold in every direction most of all into italy and especially to rome and he tempt he opponent individually try to win follower as a result caesar keep the more vigilant watch and give money to he soldier -lrb- -8 - -rrb- such be the vigor and the equipment of the two and meantime all sort of story be circulate by man and from the god also there be many plain indication a ape enter the temple of cere during a certain service and tumble about everything in the build a owl fly first upon the temple of concord and then upon practically all the other holiest building and finally after be drive away from every other spot settle upon the temple of the genius populus and be not catch and do not depart until late in the day the chariot of jupiter be demolish in the roman hippodrome and for many day a flash would rise over the sea toward greece and dart up into the firmament many unfortunate accident also be cause by storm : a trophy standing upon the aventine fall a statue of victory be dislodge from the back wall of the theater and the wooden bridge be break down completely many object be destroy by fire and moreover there be a fierce volcanic discharge from aetna which damage city and field on see and hear these thing the roman remember also about the serpent because he too have doubtless indicate something about the situation confront they a little before this a great two-headed serpent eighty-five foot long have suddenly appear in etrurium and after do much damage have be kill by lightning this have a bearing upon all of they the chief force engage on both side alike be make up of roman and many be destine at that juncture to perish in each army and then all of the survivor to become the property of the victor antony be give omen of defeat beforehand by the child in rome without any one 's have suggest it they form two party of which one call itself the antonian and the other the caesarian and they fight with each other for two day when those that bear antony 's name be defeat he death be portend by what happen to one of he image set up as a offering in the temple of jupiter at albanum although it be stone it send forth stream of blood -lrb- -9 - -rrb- all alike be excite over these event yet in that year nothing further take place caesar be busy settle matter in italy especially when he discover the presence of money send by antony and so could not go to the front before winter he rival start out with the intention of carry the war into italy before they suspect he movement but when he come to corcyra and ascertain that the advance guard of ship send to reconnoitre he position be hide in the vicinity of the mountain of ceraunium he conceive the idea that caesar himself with all he fleet have arrive hence he would proceed no farther instead he sail back to the peloponnesus the season be already late autumn and pass the winter at patrae distribute the soldier in every direction to the end that they might keep guard over the various district and secure more easily a abundance of provision meanwhile volunteer from each party go over to both side senator as well as other and lucius messius be catch as a spy by caesar he release the man in spite of he be one of those previously capture at perusium but first show he all he power to antony caesar send a letter bid he either withdraw from the sea a day 's journey on horseback and grant he the free privilege of come to he by boat on condition that they should meet within five day or else to cross over to italy himself on the same term antony make a great deal of fun of he and say : who will be we arbitrator if the compact be transgress in any way and caesar do not expect that he demand would receive compliance but hope to inspire he own soldier with courage and he opponent with terror by this act -lrb- bc 31 -lrb- _ a u _ 723 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -10 - -rrb- as consul for the next year after this caesar and antony have be appoint at the time when they settle the office for eight year at once -lrb- 59 -rrb- and this be the last year of the period : and as antony have be depose -- a fact which i state -lrb- 60 -rrb- -- valerius messalum who have once be proscribe by they -lrb- 61 -rrb- become consul with caesar about this time a madman rush into the theater at one of the festival seize the crown of the former caesar and put it on whereupon he be tear to piece by the bystander a wolf that dart into the temple of fortune be catch and kill and at the hippodrome during the very contest of the horse a dog overpower and devour another dog fire also consume a considerable portion of the hippodrome the temple of cere another shrine dedicate to spe besides a large number of other structure the freedman be think to have cause this all of they who be in italy and possess property worth five myriad -lrb- 62 -rrb- or more have be order to contribute a eighth of it the result be numerous riot murder and firing of building on they part and they be not bring to order until they be subdue by armed force after this the freedman who hold any land in italy grow frightened and keep quiet : they have be order too to give a quarter of they annual income and though they be on the point of rebel against this extortion they be not bold enough after the demonstration mention to show further insubordination but reluctantly make they contribution without dispute the matter therefore it be believe that the fire be due to a plot originate by the freedman : yet this do not prevent it from be record among the great portent because of the number of building burn -lrb- -11 - -rrb- disregard such omen as have appear to they they neither feel fear nor display less hostility but spend the winter in employ spy and annoying each other caesar have set sail from brundusium and proceed as far as corcyra intend to attack the ship near actium while off they guard but he encounter rough weather and receive damage which cause he to withdraw when spring come antony make no move at any point : the crew that man the trireme be make up of all kind of nation and as they have be winter at a distance from he they have secure no practice and have be diminish in number by disease and desertion agrippa also have seize methone by storm have kill bogud there be watch for merchant vessel to come to land and be make descent from time to time on various part of greece which cause antony extreme disturbance caesar in turn be encourage by this and wish to employ as soon as possible the energy of the army which be train to a fine point and to carry on the war in greece near he rival 's supporter rather than in italy near rome therefore he collect all he soldier who be of any value and all of the man of influence both senator and knight at brundusium he wish to have the first to coperate with he and to keep the second from be alone and act in any revolutionary way but chiefly he wish to show mankind that the largest and strongest element among the roman be in accord with he therefore he order all to bring with they a state number of servant and that except the soldier they should also carry food for themselves after this with the entire array he cross the ionian gulf -lrb- -12 - -rrb- he be lead they not to the peloponnesus or against antony but to actium where the greater part of he rival 's fleet be at anchor to see if he could gain possession of it willing or unwilling in advance consequently he disembark the cavalry under the shadow of the ceraunian mountain and send they to the point mention while he himself with he ship seize corcyra desert by the garrison within it and come to a stop in the so-called sweet harbor : it be so name because it be make sweet by the river empty into it there he establish a naval station and from there he set out to sail to actium no one come out to meet he or would hold parley with he though he urge they to do one of two thing -- come to a agreement or come into battle but the first alternative they would not accept through distrust nor the second through fear he then occupy the site where nicopoli now stand and take up a position on a high piece of ground there from which there be a view over all the outer sea near paxa over the inner ambracian gulf and the intermediary water -lrb- on which be the harbor near nicopoli -rrb- alike this spot he strengthen and construct wall from it down to comarus the outer harbor so that he command actium with he camp and he fleet by land and sea i have hear the report that he transfer trireme from the outer sea to the gulf through the fortification use newly flay hide smear with olive oil instead of hauling-engine however i can find no exploit record of these ship in the gulf and therefore i be unable to trust the tradition for it be certainly no small task to draw trireme on hide over a long and uneven tract of land still it be say to have be perform actium be a place sacred to apollo and be located in front of the mouth of the narrow lead into the ambracian gulf opposite the harbor at nicopolis these narrow be of uniform breadth though closely confine for a long distance and both they and all the water outside the entrance be fit for ship to come to anchor in and lie in wait this space the adherent of antony have occupy in advance have build tower on each side of the mouth and have take up the intervene space with ship so that they could both sail out and retreat with security the man be bivouac on the farther side of the narrow along by the sanctuary on a extensive level area quite suitable for either battle or encampment the nature of the place make they far more subject to disease both in winter and in summer -lrb- -13 - -rrb- as soon as antony ascertain caesar 's arrival he do not delay but hasten to actium with he follower he reach there in a short time but do not at once risk a encounter though caesar be constantly marshal he infantry in front of the camp often make dash at they with he ship and beach they transport for he object be to join battle with only such as be present before antony 's entire command assemble for this very reason the latter be unwilling to risk he all and he have recourse for several day to trial and skirmish until he have gather he legion with these especially since caesar no longer display a equal readiness to assail they he cross the narrow and encamp not far from he after which he send cavalry around the gulf and besiege he on both side caesar himself remain quiet and do not take any risk which he could avoid but send a detachment into greece and macedonium with the intention of draw antony off in that direction while they be so engage agrippa sail suddenly to leuca and capture the vessel there take patra by conquer quintus nasidius in a fight at sea and later also reduce corinth follow upon these event marcus titius and statilius taurus make a sudden charge upon antony 's cavalry which they defeat and win over philadelphus king of paphlagonium meantime also gnaeus domitius have some grievance against cleopatra transfer he allegiance and prove indeed of no service to caesar -lrb- for he fall sick and die not long after -rrb- but still create the impression that he desertion be due to despair of the success of the party on whose side he be range many other follow he example so that antony be no longer equally imbue with courage but be suspicious of everybody it be after this that he tortured and put to death iamblichus king of some of the arabian and other and deliver quintus postumius a senator to he servant to be place on the rack finally he become afraid that quintus deillius and amyntas the gaul who happen to have be send into macedonium and thrace after mercenary would espouse caesar 's cause and he start to overtake they pretend that he wish to render they assistance in case any hostile force should attack and meantime a battle at sea occur -lrb- -14 - -rrb- lucius tarius -lrb- 63 -rrb- with a few ship be anchor opposite sosius and the latter hope to achieve a notable success by attack he before agrippa to whom the whole fleet have be entrust should arrive accordingly after wait for a thick mist so that tarius should not become aware of they number beforehand and flee he set sail suddenly just before dawn and immediately at the first assault route he opponent and pursue he but fail to capture he for agrippa by chance meet sosius on the way so that he not only gain nothing from the victory but perish -lrb- 64 -rrb- together with tarcondimotus and many other antony because of he conflict and because he himself on he return have be defeat in a cavalry battle by caesar 's advance guard no longer think it well to encamp in two different place but during the night leave the redoubt which be near he opponent and retire to the other side of the narrow where the larger part of he army have bivouac when provision also begin to fail he because he be cut off from forage he hold a council to deliberate whether they should remain in position and hazard a encounter or transfer they post somewhere else and make the war a long one -lrb- -15 - -rrb- after several have give opinion the advice of cleopatra prevail -- that the choicest site be give in possession of garrison and that the rest of the force weigh anchor with they for egypt she hold this view as a result of be disturb by omen swallow have build they nest about she tent and on the flagship on which she sail and milk and blood together have drip from beeswax they image with the form of god which the athenian have place on they acropoli be hurl down by thunderbolt into the theater this and the consequent dejection and listlessness of the army begin to alarm cleopatra and she fill antony with fear they do not wish however to sail out either secretly or openly as fugitive for fear they should strike terror to the heart of they ally but rather with preparation make for a naval battle in order that they might equally well force they way through in case there should be any resistance therefore they choose out first the best of the vessel since the sailor have become fewer by death and desertion and burn the rest next they secretly put all they most prize valuable aboard of they by night when the boat be ready antony gather he soldier and speak as follow : -- -lrb- -16 - -rrb- all provision that i be require to make for the war have receive due attention fellow-soldier in advance first there be you immense throng all the choose flower of we dependent and ally and to such a degree be you master of every form of combat recognize among we that alone by yourselve you be formidable to adversary then again you yourselve can see how large and how fine a fleet we have and how many fine hoplite cavalry slinger peltast archer mount archer most of these class be not find at all on the other side and so far as they be find they be much fewer and weaker than ours the fund of the enemy be small though obtain by force contribution and can not last long while they have render the contributor better disposed toward we than toward the man who take they hence the population be in no way favorable to the oppressor and be moreover on the point of open revolt we treasury fill from abundant resource have harm no one and will aid all of we -lrb- -17 - -rrb- in addition to these consideration so numerous and of such great importance i be on general principle disincline to make any bombastic statement about myself yet since this too be one of the factor contribute to supremacy in war and be believe among all man to be of greatest importance -- i mean that man who be to fight well must secure a excellent general -- necessity itself have render quite indispensable some remark about myself they purpose be to enable you to realize still more the fact that not only be you such soldier that you could conquer even without a good leader but i be such a leader that i can win even with poor soldier i be at that age when person attain they greatest perfection both of body and intellect and suffer deterioration neither through the rashness of youth nor the feebleness of old age but be strongest because in a condition half-way between the two moreover i possess such a nature and such a training that i can with greatest ease discern what require to be do and make it known experience which cause even the ignorant and the uneducated to appear to be of some value i have be acquire through my whole political and whole military career from boyhood till now i have be continually exercise in similar pursuit i have be much rule and do much ruling from which i have learn on the one hand what kind of order and of what magnitude must be issue and on the other how far and in what way one must render obedience i have be subject to terror to confidence : as a result i have make it my custom neither to entertain any fear too readily nor to venture on any hazard too heedlessly i have meet with good fortune i have meet with failure : consequently i find it possible to avoid both despair and excess of pride -lrb- -18 - -rrb- i speak to you who know these fact and make you who hear they my witness not in the intention of utter idle boast about myself -- you consciousness of the truth be sufficient glory for I -- but to the end that you may in this way bring home to yourselve how much better we be equip than we opponent for while they be inferior to we in quantity both of soldier and of money and in diversity of equipment in no one respect be they so strikingly lack as in the age and inexperience of they general about he i need in general make no exact or detailed statement but to sum up i will say this which you all understand that he be a veritable weakling in body and have never himself be victor in any important battle either on land or on the sea indeed at phillipus and in the same conflict i win the day whereas he be defeat to this degree do we differ from each other and usually victory fall to the better equip and if they have any strength at all you would find it to exist in they heavy-armed force on land as for they ship they will not so much as be able to sail out against we you yourselve can of course see the size and stoutness of we vessel which be such that if the enemy 's be equivalent to they in number yet because of these advantage the foe could do no damage either by charge from the side or by charge from the front for first the thickness of the timber and second the very height of the ship would certainly check they even if there be no one on board to defend they where will any one find a chance to assail ship which carry so many archer and slinger striking assailant moreover from the tower up aloft if any one should approach how could he fail to get sink by the very number of the oar or how could he fail to be plunge under water when shoot at by all the warrior on the deck and in the tower -lrb- -19 - -rrb- do not think that they have any nautical ability because agrippa win a sea-fight off sicily : they contend not against sextus but against he slave not against a like equipment with ours but against one far inferior if again any one make much of they good fortune in that combat he be bind to take into equal consideration the defeat which caesar himself suffer at the hand of sextus by this comparison he will find that condition be not the same but that all we advantage be more numerous and greater than theirs and in general how large a part do sicily form of the whole empire and how large a fraction of we equipment do the troops of sextus possess that any one should properly fear caesar 's armament which be precisely the same as before and have grow neither larger nor better just on account of he good luck instead of take courage from the defeat that he endure reflect on this fact i have not care to risk we first engagement with the infantry where they appear to have strength in a way in order that no one of you should be liable to discouragement as a result of any failure in that department : instead i have choose to begin with the ship where we be strongest and have a vast superiority over we antagonist to the end that after a victory with these we may despise the infantry you know well that the whole outcome of the war depend on each side on we fleet if we come out victorious in this engagement we shall suffer no harm from any of the rest but cut they off on a kind of islet -- for all surround region be in we possession -- and without effort subdue they if in no other way by hunger -lrb- -20 - -rrb- now i do not think that further word be necessary to tell you that we shall be struggle not for small or unimportant interest but it will prove true that if you be zealous you will obtain the greatest reward but if careless will suffer the most frightful misfortune what would they not do to we if they should prevail when they kill practically all the follower of sextus that have be of any prominence and even destroy many follower of lepidus that coperated with caesar 's party but why should i mention this see that they have remove lepidus who be guilty of no wrong and be further they ally from all he power as general and keep he under guard as if he be some captive they have further hound for money all the freedman in italy and likewise other man who possess any land to such a extent as to force some of they to take up arm with the consequence that not a few perished be it possible that those who spare not they ally will spare we will those who seize for fund the property of they own adherent refrain from we wealth will they show humanity as victor who before victory have commit every conceivable outrage not to spend time in speaking of the concern of other people i will enumerate the audacity that they have display toward we who stand here who be ignorant that i be choose a partner and colleague of caesar and receive charge of the management of public affair equally with he receive similar honor and office and have be a great while now in possession of they yet of all of they so far as be in he power i have be deprive i have become a private citizen instead of a leader a outcast from the franchise instead of consul and this not by the action of the people or the senate but by he own act and that of he adherent who do not comprehend that they be prepare a sovereign for themselves first of all for how could one speak of enactment of people and senate when the consul and some other flee straightway from the city in order to escape cast any such vote how will that man spare either you or anybody else when he dare while i be alive in possession of such great power a victor over the armenian to seek for my will take it by violence from those who have receive it open it and read it publicly and how will he manifest any humanity to other with whom he have no connection when he have show himself such a man toward I -- he friend he table companion he relative -lrb- -21 - -rrb- now in case we be to draw any inference from he decree he threaten you openly have make the majority of you enemy outright but against I personally no such declaration have be make though he be at war with I and be already act in every way like one who have not only conquer I but murder I hence when he treat I in such a way whom he pretend not yet even at this day to regard as a enemy he will surely not keep he hand off you with whom he clearly admit that he be at odds what do it signify that he be threaten we all alike with arm but in he decree declare he be at war with some and not with other it be not by jupiter with the intention of make any distinction between we or treat one class in one way and another in another if he prevail but it be in order to set we at variance and in collision and thus render we weaker he be not unaware that while we be in accord and do everything as one body he can never in any way get the upper hand but if we quarrel and some choose one policy and the rest another he may perhaps prevail -lrb- -22 - -rrb- it be for this reason that he assume this kind of attitude toward we i and the roman that cleave to I foresee the danger although so far as the decree be concern we enjoy a kind of amnesty : we comprehend he plot and neither abandon you nor look personally to we own advantage in like manner you too whom he do not even himself deny that he regard as hostile yes most hostile ought to bear in mind all these fact and embrace common danger and common hope coperate in every way and show enthusiasm to a equal degree in we enterprise and set over against each other carefully first what we shall suffer -lrb- as i say -rrb- if defeat and what we shall gain if victorious for it be a great thing for we to escape be worst and so endure any form of insult or rapacity but greatest of all to conquer and effect whatever any one of we may wish on the other hand it be most disgraceful for we who be so many and so valiant who have weapon and money and ship and horse to choose the worse instead of the better course and when we might afford the other party liberty to prefer to join they in slavery we aim be so utterly oppose that whereas he desire to reign as sovereign over you i wish to free you and they together and this i have confirm by oath therefore as man who be to struggle for both side alike and to win blessing that shall be common to all let we labor fellow-soldier to prevail at the present juncture and to gain happiness for all time -lrb- -23 - -rrb- after deliver a speech of this sort antony put all he most prominent associate aboard the boat to prevent they from concert revolutionary measure when they get by themselves as deillius and some other deserter have do he also embark great number of archer slinger and hoplite and since the defeat of sextus have be largely due to the size of caesar 's ship and the number of he marine antony have equip he vessel to surpass greatly those of he opponent for he have have construct only a few trireme but the rest be ship with four bank and with ten bank and represent all the remain degree of capacity : upon these he have build lofty tower and he have put aboard a crowd of man who could fight from behind wall as it be caesar for he part be observe they equipment and make he preparation when he learn from deillius and other they intention he himself assemble the army and speak to this effect : -- -lrb- -24 - -rrb- have discover fellow-soldier both from what i have learn from hearsay and from what i have test by experience that the most and greatest military enterprise or indeed i might say human affair in general turn out in favor of those person who both think and act in a more just and pious manner i be keep this strictly in mind myself and i advise you to consider it no matter how numerous and mighty the force we possess no matter if it be such that even a man who choose the less just of two course might expect to win with its aid nevertheless i base my confidence far more upon the cause underlie the war than upon this factor for that we who be roman and lord of the greatest and best portion of the world should be despise and trodden under foot of a egyptian woman be unworthy of we father who overthrow pyrrhus philip perseus antiochus who uproot the numantinus and the carthaginian who cut down the cimbrus and the ambrone it be unworthy also of ourselves who have subjugate the gaul have subdue the pannonian have advance as far as the ister have cross the rhine have go over into britain how could all those who have have a hand in the exploit mention fail to grieve vehemently if they should learn that we have succumb to a accursed woman should we not be guilty of a gross deviation from right conduct if after surpass all man everywhere in valor we should then bear humbly the insult of this throng who o hercule be alexandrian and egyptian -lrb- what worse or what truer name could one apply to they -rrb- who serve reptile and other creature as god who embalm they body to secure a reputation for immortality who be most reckless in braggadocio but most deficient in bravery and worst of all be slave to a woman instead of a man yet these have dare to lay claim to we possession and to acquire they through we evidently expect that we will give up the prosperity which we possess for they -lrb- -25 - -rrb- who can help lament to see roman soldier act as body-guard of they queen who can help groan when he hear roman knight and senator flattering she like eunuch who can help weep when he both hear and see antony himself the man twice consul often imperator to whom be commit in common with I the superintendence of the public business who be entrust with so many city so many legion -- when he see that this man have now abandon all he ancestor ' habit of life have emulate all alien and barbaric custom that he pay no honor to we or to the law or to he father ' god but worship that wench as if she be some isis or selene call she child sun and moon and finally himself bear the title of osiri and dionysus in consequence of which he have bestow entire island and some of the continent as though he be master of the whole earth and the whole sea i be sure that this appear marvelous and incredible to you fellow-soldier : therefore you ought to be the more indignant for if that be actually so which you do not even believe on hear it and if that man in he voluptuary career commit act at which any one who learn of they must grieve would you not properly become exceedingly enraged -lrb- -26 - -rrb- yet at the start i be so devoted to he that i give he a share of my leadership marry my sister to he and grant he legion even after this i feel so kindly so affectionately toward he that i be unwilling to wage war on he because of he insulting my sister or because he neglect the child she have bear he or because he prefer the egyptian woman to she or because he bestow upon the former 's child practically all you possession or in fine for any other reason the cause be that first of all i do not think it proper to assume the same attitude toward antony as toward cleopatra i deem she by the very fact of she foreign birth to be at the outset hostile to he career but i believe that he as a citizen could be correct later i entertain the hope that if not voluntarily at least reluctantly he might change he mind as a result of the decree pass against she consequently i do not declare war upon he he however have look haughtily and disdainfully upon my effort and will neither be release though we would fain release he nor be pity though we try to pity he he be either unreasonable or mad -- and this which i have hear i do believe that he have be bewitch by that accursed female -- and therefore pay no heed to we kindness or humaneness but be in slavery to that woman he undertake in she behalf both war and needless danger which be both against we interest and against those of he country what else then be we duty except to fight he back together with cleopatra -lrb- -27 - -rrb- hence let no one call he a roman but rather a egyptian nor antony but rather serapio let no one think that he be ever consul or imperator but only gymnasiarch he have himself of he own free will choose the latter title instead of the former and cast away all the August term of he own land have become one of the cymbal player from canopus -lrb- 65 -rrb- again let no one fear that he can give any unfavorable turn to the war even previously he be of no ability as you know clearly who conquer he near mutina and even if once he do attain to some capacity through campaigning with we be well assure that he have now ruin all of it by he changed manner of life it be impossible for one who lead a existence of royal luxury and coddle himself like a woman to think any valorous thought or do valorous deed because it be quite inevitable that a person take the impress of the practice with which he come in contact a proof of this be that in the one war which he have wage in all this long time and the one campaign that he have make he lose great number of citizen in the battle return in thorough disgrace from praaspa and part with very many additional man in the flight if any one of we be oblige to perform a set dance or cordax -lrb- 66 -rrb- in a amusing way such a person would surely yield the honor to he he have practice this : but since it be a case of arm and battle what be there about he that any one should dread he physical condition he have pass he prime and become effeminate he strength of mind he play the woman and have surrender himself to unnatural lust he piety toward we god he be at war both with they and he country he faithfulness to he ally but be any one unaware how he deceive and imprison the armenian he liberal treatment of he friend but who have not see the man who have miserably perish at he hand he reputation with the soldier but who even of they have not condemn he evidence of they feeling be find in the fact that number daily come over to we side for my part i think that all we citizen will do this as on a former occasion when he be go from brundusium into gaul so long as they expect to get rich without danger some be very glad to cleave to he but they will not care to fight against we they own countryman in behalf of what do not belong to they at all especially when they be give the opportunity to win without hazard both preservation and prosperity by join we -lrb- -28 - -rrb- some one may say however that he have many ally and a store of wealth well how we have be accustom to conquer the dweller on asia the mainland be know to scipio asiaticus the renowned be know to sulla the fortunate to lucullus to pompey to my father caesar and to you own self who vanquish the supporter of brutus and cassius this be so if you think they wealth be so much more than other ' you must be all the more eager to make it you own it be but fair that for the greatest prize the greatest conflict should be undergo and i can tell you nothing else greater than that prize which lie within you grasp -- namely to preserve the renown of you forefather to guard you individual pride to take vengeance on those in revolt against we to repulse those who insult you to conquer and rule all mankind to allow no woman to make herself equal to a man against the tauriscus and iapude and dalmatian and pannonian you yourselve now before I battle most zealously and frequently for some few wall and desert land you subdue all of they though they be admittedly a most warlike race and by jupiter against sextus also for sicily merely and against this very antony for mutina merely you carry on a similar struggle so that you come out victorious over both and now will you show any less zeal against a woman whose plot concern all you possession and against she husband who have distribute to she child all you property and against they noble associate and table companion whom they themselves stigmatize as ` privy ' councillor why should you because of they number but no number of person can conquer valor because of they race but they have practice carry burden rather than warfare because of they experience but they know better how to row than how to fight at sea i for my part be really ashamed that we be go to contend with such creature by vanquish whom we shall gain no glory whereas if we be defeat we shall be disgrace -lrb- -29 - -rrb- and surely you must not think that the size of they vessel or the thickness of the timber of they ship be a match for we valor what ship ever by itself either wound or kill anybody will they not by they very height and staunchness be more difficult for they rower to move and less obedient to they pilot of what use can they possibly be to the fight man on board of they when these man can employ neither frontal assault nor flank attack maneuver which you know be essential in naval contest for surely they do not intend to employ infantry tactic against we on the sea nor on the other hand be they prepare to shut themselves up as it be in wooden wall and undergo a siege since that would be decidedly to we advantage -- i mean assault wooden barrier for if they ship remain in the same place as if fasten there it will be possible for we to rip they open with we beak it will be possible too to damage they with we engine from a distance and also possible to burn they to the water 's edge with incendiary missile and if they do venture to stir from they place they will not overtake anyone by pursue nor escape by flee since they be so heavy that they be entirely too inert to inflict any damage and so huge that they be exceptionally liable to suffer it -lrb- -30 - -rrb- indeed what need be there to spend time in speak further of they when we have already often make trial of they not only off leuca but also here just the other day and so far from prove inferior to they we have everywhere show ourselves superior hence you should be encourage not so much by my word as by you own deed and should desire to put a end forthwith to the whole war for be well assure that if we beat they to-day we shall have no further trouble for in general it be a natural characteristic of human nature everywhere that whenever a man fail in he first contest he become dishearten with respect to what be to come and as for we we be so indisputably superior to they on land that we could vanquish they even if they have never suffer any injury and they be themselves so conscious of this truth -- for i be not go to conceal from you what i have hear -- that they be discourage at what have already happen and despair of save they life if they stay where they be and they be therefore endeavor to make they escape to some place or other and be make this sally not with the desire to give battle but in expectation of flight in fact they have place in they ship the best and most valuable of the possession they have with they in order to escape with they if they can since then they admit that they be weaker than we and since they carry the prize of victory in they ship let we not allow they to sail anywhere else but let we conquer they here on the spot and take all these treasure away from they such be caesar 's word -lrb- -31 - -rrb- after this he form a plan to let they slip by intend to fall upon they from the rear : he himself by fast sailing expect to capture they directly and when the leader have plainly show that they be attempt to run away he think that the remainder would make no contest about surrender he be restrained however by agrippa who fear that they might not overtake the fugitive who would probably use sail and he also feel some confidence of conquer without much effort because meantime a squall of rain with large quantity of spray have drive in the face of antony 's fleet alone and have create disturbance all through it hence he abandon this plan and after put vast number of infantry aboard the ship himself and place all he associate into auxiliary boat for the purpose of sailing about quickly give notice of requisite action to the warrior and report to he what he ought to know he await the onset of the foe they weigh anchor to the sound of the trumpet and with ship in close array draw up they line a little outside the narrow not advance any farther : he in turn start out as if to come to close quarter or even make they retire when they neither make a corresponding advance nor turn about but remain in position and further make they array extremely dense he become doubtful what to do therefore he order the sailor to let they oar rest in the water and wait for a time : then suddenly at a give signal lead forward both the wing and bent around in the hope chiefly of surround the enemy or otherwise of at least break they formation antony be afraid of this movement of he to wheel about and surround they and hence adopt so far as he could correspond tactic which bring he though reluctantly into close combat -lrb- -32 - -rrb- so they attack and begin the conflict both side utter many exhortation in they own rank as to both artifice and zeal and hearing many from the man on shore that shout to they the struggle be not of a similar nature on the two side but caesar 's follower have smaller and swifter ship go with a rush and when they ram be fence about on all side to avoid be wound if they sink any boat well : if not they would back water before a close engagement could be begin and would either ram the same vessel suddenly again or would let some go and turn they attention to other and have damage they slightly to whatever degree the limited time would allow they would proceed against other and then still other in order that they assault upon any vessel might be so far as possible unexpected since they dread the defense of the enemy from a distance and likewise the battle at close quarter they delay neither in the approach nor in the encounter but run up suddenly with the object of arrive before the oppose archer could work they would inflict some wound and cause a disturbance merely so as to escape be hold and then retire out of range the enemy try to strike the approach ship with many stone and arrow fly thick and fast and to cast the grapnel upon the assailant and in case they could reach they they get the better of it but if they miss they boat would be pierce and they begin to sink or else in they endeavor to avoid this calamity they would waste time and lay themselves open to attack on the part of some other for when two or three at once fall upon the same ship part would do all the damage they could and the rest suffer the brunt of the injury on the one side the pilot and the rower endure the most annoyance and fatigue and on the other the marine : and the one side resemble cavalry now make a charge now withdraw on account of the maneuver on they part in assault and back water and the other be like heavy-armed man guard against the approach of foe and try as much as possible to hold they as a result they gain mutual advantage : the one party fall unobserved upon the line of oar project from the ship and shatter the blade whereas the other party with rock and engine from above try to sink they there be also certain disadvantage : the one party could not injure those approach it and the other party if it fail to sink some vessel by its ramming be hem in and find no longer a equal contest -lrb- -33 - -rrb- the battle be a even one for a long time and neither antagonist could get the upper hand but the outcome of it be finally like this cleopatra ride at anchor behind the warrior could not endure the long obscure uncertainty and delay but harass with worry -lrb- which be due to she be a woman and a egyptian -rrb- at the struggle which for so long continue doubtful and at the fearful expectancy on both side suddenly herself start to flee and raise the signal for the remainder of she subject so as they at once raise they sail and speed out to sea while a wind of some force have by chance arise antony thought they be flee not at the bidding of cleopatra but through fear because they feel themselves vanquish and follow they when this take place the rest of the soldier become both discourage and confuse and rather wish themselves to escape likewise keep raise they sail and the other keep throw the tower and the furnishings into the sea in order to lighten the vessel and make good they departure while they be occupy in this way they adversary fall upon they not pursue the fugitive because they themselves be without sail and prepare only for a naval battle and many contend with one ship both from afar and alongside then on the part of both alike the conflict become most diverse and fierce caesar 's man damage the lower part of the ship all around crush the oar knock off the rudder and climb on the deck where they take hold of some and pull they down push off other and fight with still other since they be now equal to they in number antony 's soldier push they back with boathook cut they down with axis throw down upon they rock and other mass of material make ready for just this purpose repulse those that try to climb up and join issue with such as come close enough and one view the business might have compare it liken small thing to great to wall or many thickset island be besiege by sea thus the one party strove to scale the boat like some land or fortress and eagerly bring to bear everything that contribute to this result the other try to repel they devise every means that be commonly use in such a case -lrb- -34 - -rrb- as the fight continue equal caesar at a loss what he should do send for fire from the camp previously he have wish to avoid use it in order to gain possession of the money now he see that it be impossible for he to win in any other way and have recourse to this as the only thing that would assist he thus another form of battle be bring about the assailant would approach they victim from many direction at once shoot blaze missile at they and hurl torch fasten to javelin from they hand and with the aid of engine throw pot full of charcoal and pitch upon some boat from a distance the defender try to ward these off individually and when any of they fly past and catch the timber and at once start a great flame as must be the case in a ship they use first the drinking-water which they carry on board and extinguish some conflagration : when that be go they dip up the sea-water and in case they could use great quantity of it at once they would stop the fire by main force : but they be unable to do this everywhere for they do not have many bucket or large one and in they confusion bring they up half full so that far from do any service they only quicken the flame for salt water pour on a fire in small quantity make it burn up brightly as they find themselves get the worst of it in this they heap on the blaze they thick mantle and the corpse for a time these check the fire and it seem to abate later especially as the wind come upon it in great gust it shoot up more brilliant than ever and be increase by the fuel while only a part of a ship be burn other stand by it and the man would leap into it and hew down some part and carry away other these detach part some throw into the sea and other upon they opponent in case they could do they any damage other be constantly go to the sound portion of the vessel and now more than ever they use the grappling iron and the long spear with the purpose of attach some hostile ship to theirs and transfer themselves to it or if that be out of the question they try to set it on fire likewise -lrb- -35 - -rrb- but the hostile fleet be guard against this very attempt and none of it come near enough and as the fire spread to the encircle wall and descend to the flooring the most terrible of fate confront they some and particularly the sailor perish by the smoke before the flame approach they while other be roasted in the midst of it as though in oven other be cook in they armor which become red-hot there be still other who before suffer such a death or when they be half burned throw off they armor and be wound by the man shoot from a distance or again be choke by leap into the sea or be strike by they opponent and drown or be mangled by sea-monster the only one to obtain a endurable death consider the suffering round about be such as kill one another or themselves before any calamity befall they these do not have to submit to torture and as corpse have the burning ship for they funeral pyre the caesarian who see this at first so long as any of the foe be still able to defend themselves would not come near but when the fire begin to consume the ship and the man so far from be able to do any harm to a enemy could not even help themselves they eagerly sail up to they to see if they could in any way gain possession of the money and they endeavor to extinguish the fire which they themselves have cause as a result many of they also perish in the course of they plunder in the flame dio 's roman history 51 the following be contain in the fifty-first of dio 's rome : how caesar after he victory at actium transact business require immediate attention -lrb- chapter 1-4 -rrb- about antony and cleopatra and they movement after the defeat -lrb- chapter 5-8 -rrb- how antony defeat in egypt

chapter 22 -rrb- how moesium be reduce -lrb- chapter 23-27 -rrb- duration of time the remainder of the consulship of caesar -lrb- 3rd -rrb- and m valerius corvinus messalum together with two additional year in which there be the follow magistrate here enumerate : caesar -lrb- iv -rrb- m licinius mf crassus -lrb- bc 30 = a u 724 -rrb- caesar -lrb- v -rrb- sextus apuleius sexti f -lrb- bc 29 = a u 725 -rrb- -lrb- _ book 51 boissevain _ -rrb- -lrb- bc 31 -lrb- _ a u _ 723 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -1 - -rrb- such be the naval battle which occur between they on the second of September i have not elsewhere use a like expression not be in the habit of give precise date but i do it here because then for the first time caesar alone hold the entire power consequently the enumeration of the year of he supremacy start from precisely that day and before it have go he set up as a offering to apollo of actium a trireme a four-banked ship and so on up to one of ten bank from the captive vessel and he build a larger temple he also institute a quinquennial musical and gymnastic contest involve horseracing -- a sacred festival as they call all which include distribution of food -- and entitle it actium further by gather some settler and oust other who dwell nearby from they home he found a city on the site of the camp and name it nicopoli -lrb- 67 -rrb- on the spot where he have have he tent he lay a foundation of square stone and put there a shrine of apollo open to the sky adorning it with the capture beak but this be do later at the time he despatch one division of the ship to pursue antony and cleopatra so these follow in they wake but as it seem impossible to overtake the fugitive they return with he remain vessel he take the enemy 's rampart where no one oppose he because of small number and then overtake and without a battle get possession of the other army which be retreat into macedonium various important contingent have already make they escape the roman to antony and the rest of the ally to they home the latter moreover evince no further hostility to caesar but both they and all the people who have formerly belong to rome remain quiet and some at once and other later make term caesar now proceed to teach the city a lesson by levy money and take away the remnant of authority over they citizen that they possess in they assembly from all the potentate and king save amynta and archelaus he take all the land that they have receive from antony philopator son of tarcondimotus lycomede ruler in a portion of cappadocian pontus and alexander the brother of iamblichus he even remove from they principality the last name because he have secure he appointment as a reward for accuse the conqueror he place in he triumphal procession and afterward kill the kingdom of lycomede he give to one medeus because the latter have previous to the naval engagement detach the mysian in asia from antony and with they have wage war upon such as follow antony 's fortune the people of cydonea and lampea he set free because they have render he some assistance and he help the lampean find anew they city from which they have be uproot as for the senator and knight and other prominent man who have be active in antony 's cause he impose fine upon many of they execute many of they and some he spare entirely among the last sosius be a distinguished example : for though he have often fight against caesar and now flee and hide himself but be subsequently discover he life be nevertheless preserved likewise one marcus scaurus a half-brother of sextus on the mother 's side have be condemn to death but be later release for the sake of he mother mucium of those who undergo the extreme punishment the aquilius florus and curio be the most note the latter meet death because he be a son of the former curio who have once be of great assistance to the former caesar and the florus both perish because octavius command that one of they should draw the lot to be slay they be father and son and when the latter before any draw take place voluntarily surrender himself to the executioner the former feel such great grief that he die also by he own hand -lrb- -3 - -rrb- this then be the end of these person the mass of antony 's soldier be include in the rank of caesar 's legion and later he send back to italy the citizen over age of both force without give any of they anything and the remainder he disband they have show a ugly temper toward he in sicily after the victory and he fear they might create a disturbance again hence he hasten before the least sign of a uprising be manifest to discharge some entirely from the service under arm and to scatter the great majority of the rest as he be even at this time suspicious of the freedman he remit they one-quarter contribution -lrb- 68 -rrb- which they be still owe of the money assess upon they and they no longer bear he any malice for deprivation they have endure but rejoice as if they have receive as a gift what they have not be oblige to contribute the man still leave in the rank and file show no disposition to rebel partly because they be hold in check by they commanding officer but mostly through hope of the wealth of egypt the man however who have help caesar to gain the victory and have be dismiss from the service be irritated at have obtain no meed of valor and not much later they begin a revolutionary movement caesar be suspicious of they and fear that they might despise maecena to whom at that time rome and the remainder of italy have be entrust because he be a knight he send agrippa to italy as if on some routine business he also give to agrippa and to maecena so great authority over everything that they might read beforehand the letter which he often write to the senate and to various official and then change whatever they wish in they therefore they receive also from he a ring so that they should have the means of seal the epistle he have have the seal which he use most at that time make double with a sphinx raise on both side alike subsequently he have he own image make in _ intaglio _ and seal everything with that later emperor likewise employ it except galba the latter give he sanction with a ancestral device which show a dog bend forward from the prow of a ship the way that octavius write both to these two magistrate and to the rest of he intimate friend whenever there be need of forwarding information to they secretly be to write in place of the proper letter in each word the second one follow -lrb- -4 - -rrb- octavius with the idea that there would be no more danger from the veteran administer affair in greece and take part in the mystery of the two goddess he then go over into asia and settle matter there all the time keep a sharp lookout for antony 's movement for he have not yet receive any definite information regard the course he rival have follow in he escape and so he keep make preparation to proceed against he if he should find out exactly meantime the ex-soldier make a open demonstration because he be so far separate from they and he begin to fear that if they get a leader they might do some damage -lrb- bc 30 -lrb- _ a u _ 724 -rrb- -rrb- consequently he assign to other the task of search for antony and hurry to italy himself in the middle of the winter of the year that he be hold office for the fourth time with marcus crassus the latter in spite of have be attach to the cause of sextus and of antony be then he fellow consul without have even pass through the praetorship caesar come then to brundusium but progress no farther the senate on ascertain that he boat be hear italy go there to meet he save the tribune and two praetor who by decree stay at home and the class of knight as well as the majority of the people and still other some represent by embassy and many as voluntary follower come together there so that there be no further sign of rebellion on the part of any one so brilliant be he arrival and so enthusiastic over he be the mass they too some through fear other through hope other obey a summons have come to brundusium to certain of they caesar give money but to the rest who have be the constant companion of he campaign he assign land also by turn the townspeople in italy who have side with antony out of they home he be able to grant to he soldier they city and they farm to most of the outcast from the settlement he grant permission in turn to dwell in dyrrachium philippus and elsewhere to the remainder he either distribute or promise money for they land though he have now acquire great sum by he victory he be spend still more for this reason he advertise in the public market he own possession and those of he companion in order that any one who desire to buy or claim any of they might do so nothing be sell however and nothing repay who pray would have dare to undertake to do either but he secure by this mean a reasonable excuse for a delay in carry out he offer and later he discharge the debt out of the spoil of the egyptian -lrb- -5 - -rrb- he settle this and the rest of the urgent business and give to such as have receive a kind of semi-amnesty the right to live in italy not before permit after this he forgive the populace leave behind in rome for not have come to he and on the thirtieth day after he arrival set sail again for greece in the midst of winter he drag he ship across the isthmus of the peloponnesus and get back to asia so quickly that antony and cleopatra receive each piece of news simultaneously -- that he have depart and that he have return they on flee from the naval battle have go as far as the peloponnesus together from there they send away some of they associate -- all in fact whom they suspect -- while many withdraw against they will and cleopatra hasten to egypt for fear that she subject might perhaps revolt if they hear of the disaster before she come in order to make she approach safe at any rate she crown she prow as a sign of conquest with garland and have some song of victory sing by flute-player when she reach safety she murder many of the foremost man who have ever be restless under she rule and be now in a state of excitement at she disaster from they estate and from various repository hallowed and sacred she gather a vast store of wealth spare not even the most revered of consecrated treasure she fit out she force and look about for possible alliance the armenian king she kill and send he head to the median who might be influence by this act she think to aid they as for antony he sail to pinarius scarpus in libya and to the army previously collect under he there for the protection of egypt this general however would -lrb- 69 -rrb- not receive he and also slew the first man that antony send besides destroy some of the soldier under he command who show displeasure at this act then antony too proceed to alexandrium have accomplish nothing -lrb- -6 - -rrb- now among the other preparation that they make for speedy warfare they enrol among the ephebi they son cleopatra caesarion and antony antyllus who be bear to he by fulvium and be then with he they purpose be to arouse interest among the egyptian who would feel that they already have a man for king and that the rest might recognize these child as they lord in case any untoward accident should happen to the parent and so continue the struggle this prove the lad ' undoing for caesar on the ground that they be man and hold a certain form of sovereignty spare neither of they but to return : the two be prepare to wage war in egypt with ship and infantry and to this end they call also upon the neighbor tribe and the king that be friendly to they nor do they relax they readiness also to sail to spain if there should be urgent need believe that they could alienate the inhabitant of that land by they money if nothing more and again they think of transfer the seat of the conflict to the red sea to the end that while engage in these plan they might escape observation for the longest possible time or deceive caesar in some way or slay he by treachery they despatch man who carry letter to he in regard to peace but money for he follower meantime also unknown to antony cleopatra send to he a golden scepter and a golden crown and the royal throne through which she signify that she deliver the government to he he might hate antony if he would only take pity on she caesar accept the gift as a good omen but make no answer to antony to cleopatra he forward publicly threatening message and a announcement that if she would renounce the use of arm and she sovereignty he would deliberate what ought to be do in she case secretly he send word that if she would kill antony he would grant she pardon and leave she empire unmolested -lrb- -7 - -rrb- while these negotiation be go on the arabian influence by quintus didius the governor of syrium burn the ship which have be build in the arabian gulf for the voyage to the red sea and all the people and the potentate refuse they assistance and it occur to I to wonder that many other also though they have receive many gift from antony and cleopatra now leave they in the lurch the man however of lowest rank who be be support for gladiatorial combat show the utmost zeal in they behalf and contend most bravely these be practice in cyzicus for the triumphal game which they be expect to hold in honor of caesar 's overthrow and as soon as they be make aware of what have take place they set out for egypt with the intention of aid they superior many be they contest with amynta in gaul and many with the child of tarcondimotus in cilicium who have be they strongest friend but now in view of the change circumstance have go over to the other side and many be they struggle against didius who hinder they while pass through they prove unable after all to make they way to egypt yet even when they have be encompass on all side not even then would they accept any term of surrender though didius make they many promise they send for antony feeling that they could fight with he better in syrium : then when he neither come himself nor send they any message they decide that he have perish and reluctantly make term with the condition that they should never take part in a gladiatorial show they receive from didius daphne the suburb of antioch to dwell in until the matter be call to caesar 's attention then they be trick -lrb- somewhat later -rrb- by messalum and be send in different direction under the pretext that they be to be enlist in different legion and be in some convenient way destroy -lrb- -8 - -rrb- when antony and cleopatra hear from the envoy the command which caesar issue regard they they send to he again the queen promise that she would give he large amount of money antony remind he of they friendship and kinship and also make a defense of he association with the egyptian woman he enumerate the occasion on which they have help each other gain the object of they love -lrb- 70 -rrb- and all the wanton prank in which they two have share as young man finally he surrender to he publius turullius a senator who have be a assassin of caesar but be then live with he as a friend he actually offer to commit suicide if in that way cleopatra might be save caesar put turullius to death it happen that this man have cut wood for the fleet from the forest of asclepius in cos and by he punishment in the same place he be think to have pay the penalty to the god but to antony caesar do not even then answer a word the latter consequently despatch a third embassy send he he son antyllus with considerable gold coin he rival accept the money but send the boy back empty-handed and give he no answer to cleopatra however as the first time so the second and the third time he send many threat and promise alike yet he be afraid even so that they might despair of in any way obtain pardon from he and so hold out and that they would survive by they own effort or set sail for spain and gaul or destroy the money the bulk of which he hear be immense cleopatra have gather it all in the monument she be construct in the palace and she threaten to burn all of it with she in case she should miss the smallest of she demand octavius send therefore thyrsus a freedman of he to speak to she kindly in every way and to tell she further that it so happen that he be in love with she he hope at least by this mean since she think she have the power to arouse passion in all mankind that he might remove antony from the scene and keep she and she money intact and so it prove -lrb- -9 - -rrb- before quite all this have occur antony learn that cornelius gallus have take charge of scarpus 's army and with the man have suddenly march upon paxaetonium and occupy it hence though he wish to set out and follow the summons of the gladiator he do not go into syrium he proceed against gallus believe that he could certainly win over he soldier without effort they have be with he on campaign and be well disposed at any rate he could subdue they by main strength since he be lead a large force both of ship and of infantry upon they however he find himself unable even to hold converse with they although he approach they wall and shout and halloo for gallus by order he trumpeter to sound they instrument all together give no one a chance to hear a word antony further fail in a sudden assault and subsequently meet a reverse with he ship gallus by night have chain stretch across the mouth of the harbor under water and take no open measure to guard against they but quite disdainfully allow they to sail freely in when however they be inside he draw up the chain by means of machine and encompass he opponent 's ship on all side -- on land from the house and on the sea -- he burn some and sink other the next event be that caesar take pelusium pretendedly by storm but really betray by cleopatra she see that no one come to she aid and perceive that caesar be not to be withstand most important of all she hear the message send to she by thyrsus and believe that she be really the object of affection she confidence be strengthen first of all by she wish that it be true and second by the fact that she have enslave he father and antony alike as a result she expect that she should gain not only forgiveness and sovereignty over the egyptian but empire over the roman as well at once she yield pelusium to he after this when he march against the city she secretly prevent the alexandrian from make a sortie though she pretend to urge they strongly to do so -lrb- -10 - -rrb- at the news about pelusium antony return from paraetonium and in front of alexandrium meet caesar who be exhaust from travel he join battle with he therefore with he cavalry and be victorious from this success antony gain courage as also from he be able to shoot arrow into he rival 's camp carry pamphlet which promise the man fifteen hundred denarius so he attack also with he infantry and be defeat caesar himself voluntarily read the pamphlet to he soldier reproach antony the while and lead they to feel ashamed of treachery and to acquire enthusiasm in he behalf they gain by this in zeal both through indignation at be tempt and through they attempt to show that they would not willingly gain a reputation for baseness antony after he unexpected setback take refuge in he fleet and prepare to have a combat on the water or in any case to sail to spain cleopatra see this cause the ship to desert and she herself rush suddenly into the mausoleum pretend that she fear caesar and desire by some means to destroy herself before capture but really as a invitation to antony to enter there also he have a inkling that he be be betray but he infatuation would not allow he to believe it and as one might say he pity she more than himself cleopatra be fully aware of this and hope that if he should be inform that she be dead he would not prolong he life but meet death at once accordingly she hasten into the monument with one eunuch and two female attendant and from there send a message to he to the effect that she have pass away when he hear it he do not delay but be seize with a desire to follow she in death then first he ask one of the bystander to slay he but the man draw a sword and despatch himself wish to imitate he courage antony give himself a wound and fall upon he face cause the bystander to think that he be dead a outcry be raise at he deed and cleopatra hearing it lean out over the top of the monument by a certain contrivance its door once close could not be open again but above near the ceiling it have not yet be complete that be where they see she lean out and some begin to utter shout that reach the ear of antony he learn that she survive stand up as if he have still the power to live but a great gush of blood from he wound make he despair of rescue and he beseech those present to carry he to the monument and to hoist he by the rope that be hang there to elevate stone block this be do and he die there on cleopatra 's bosom -lrb- -11 - -rrb- she now begin to feel confidence in caesar and immediately make he aware of what have take place but do not feel altogether confident that she would experience no harm hence she keep herself within the structure in order that if there should be no other motive for she preservation she might at least purchase pardon and she sovereignty through fear about she money even then in such depths of calamity she remember that she be queen and choose rather to die with the name and dignity of a sovereign than to live as a ordinary person it should be state that she keep fire on hand to use upon she money and asp and other reptile to use upon herself and that she have try the latter on human being to see in what way they kill in each case caesar be anxious to make himself master of she treasure to seize she alive and to take she back for he triumph however as he have give she a kind of pledge he do not wish to appear to have act personally as a impostor since this would prevent he from treat she as a captive and to a certain extent subdue against she will he therefore send to she gaius proculeius a knight and epaphroditus a freedman give they direction what they must say and do so they obtain a audience with cleopatra and after some accusation of a mild type suddenly lay hold of she before any decision be reach then they put out of she way everything by which she could bring death upon herself and allow she to spend some day where she be since the embalming of antony 's body claim she attention after that they take she to the palace but do not remove any of she accustomed retinue or attendant to the end that she should still more hope to accomplish she wish and do no harm to herself when she express a desire to appear before caesar and converse with he it be grant and to beguile she still more he promise that he would come to she himself -lrb- -12 - -rrb- she accordingly prepare a luxurious apartment and costly couch and adorn herself further in a kind of careless fashion -- for she mourning garb mightily become she -- and seat herself upon the couch beside she she have place many image of he father of all sort and in she bosom she have put all the letter that he father have send she when after this caesar enter she hastily arise blushing and say : hail master heaven have give joy to you and take it from I but you see with you own eye you father in the guise in which he often visit I and you may hear how he honor I in various way and make I queen of the egyptian that you may learn what be he own word about I take and read the missive which he send I with he own hand as she speak thus she read aloud many endearing expression of he and now she would lament and caress the letter and again fall before he image and do they reverence she keep turn she eye toward caesar and melodiously continue to bewail she fate she speak in melting tone say at one time of what avail caesar be these you letter and at another but in the man before I you also be alive for I then again would that i have die before you and still again but if i have he i have you some such diversity both of word and of gesture do she employ at the same time gaze at and murmur to he sweetly caesar comprehend she outbreak of passion and appeal for sympathy yet he do not pretend to do so but let he eye rest upon the ground he say only this : be of cheer woman and keep a good heart for no harm shall befall you she be distressed that he would neither look at she nor breathe a word about the kingdom or any sigh of love and fall at he knee wail : life for I caesar be neither desirable nor possible this favor i beseech of you in memory of you father -- that since heaven give I to antony after he i may also die with my lord would that i have perish on the very instant after caesar 's death but since this present fate be my destiny send I to antony : grudge I not burial with he that as i die because of he so in hade also i may dwell with he -lrb- -13 - -rrb- such word she utter expect to obtain commiseration : caesar however make no answer to it fear however that she might make away with herself he exhort she again to be of good cheer do not remove any of she attendant and keep a careful watch upon she that she might add brilliance to he triumph suspect this and regard it as worse than innumerable death she begin to desire really to die and beg caesar frequently that she might be allow to perish in some way and devise many plan by herself when she could accomplish nothing she feign to change she mind and to repose great hope in he as well as great hope in livium she say she would sail voluntarily and make ready many treasured adornment as gift in this way she hope to inspire confidence that she have no design upon herself and so be more free from scrutiny and bring about she destruction this also take place the other official and epaphroditus to whom she have be commit believe that she state of mind be really as it seem and neglect to keep a careful watch she meanwhile be make preparation to die as painlessly as possible first she give a seal paper in which she beg caesar to order that she be bury beside antony to epaphroditus himself to deliver pretend that it contain some other matter have by this excuse free herself of he presence she set to she task she put on she most beauteous apparel and after choose a most become pose assume all the royal robe and appurtenance and so die -lrb- -14 - -rrb- no one know clearly in what manner she perish for there be find merely slight indentation on she arm some say that she apply a asp which have be bring in to she in a water-jar or among some flower other declare that she have smear a needle with which she be wont to braid she hair with some poison possess of such property that it would not injure the surface of the body at all but if it touch the least drop of blood it cause death very quickly and painlessly the supposition be then that previously it have be she custom to wear it in she hair and on this occasion after first make a small scratch on she arm with some instrument she dip the needle in the blood in this or some very similar way she perish with she two handmaiden the eunuch at the moment she body be take up present himself voluntarily to the serpent and after be bite by they leap into a coffin which have be prepare by he caesar on hearing of she demise be shock and both view she body and apply drug to it and send for psyllus -lrb- 71 -rrb- in the hope that she might possibly revive these psyllus who be male for there be no woman bear in they tribe have the power of suck out before a person die all the poison of every reptile and be not harm themselves when bite by any such creature they be propagate from one another and they test they offspring the latter be throw among serpent at once or have serpent lay upon they swaddling-clothes in such case the poisonous creature do not harm the child and be benumb by its clothing this be the nature of they function but caesar when he could not in any way resuscitate cleopatra feel admiration and pity for she and be himself excessively grieve as much as if he have be deprive of all the glory of the victory -lrb- -15 - -rrb- so antony and cleopatra who have be the author of many evil to the egyptian and to the roman thus fight and thus meet death they be embalm in the same fashion and bury in the same tomb they spiritual quality and the fortune of they life deserve a word of comment antony have no superior in comprehend he duty yet he commit many act of folly he be distinguish for he bravery in some case yet he often fail through cowardice he be characterize equally by greatness of soul and a servile disposition of mind he would plunder the property of other and still relinquish he own he pity many without cause and chastise even a greater number unjustly consequently though he rise from weakness to great strength and from the depths of poverty to great riches he draw no profit from either circumstance but whereas he have hope to hold the roman power alone he actually kill himself cleopatra be of insatiable passion and insatiable avarice be ambitious for renown and most scornfully bold by the influence of love she win dominion over the egyptian and hope to attain a similar position over the roman but be disappoint of this she destroy herself also she captivate two of the man who be the greatest roman of she day and because of the third she commit suicide such be these two person and in this way do they pass from the scene of they child antyllus be slay immediately though he be betroth to the daughter of caesar and have take refuge in he father 's hero-shrine which cleopatra have build caesarion be flee to ethiopium but be overtake on the road and murder cleopatra be marry to juba the son of juba to this man who have be bring up in italy and have be with he on campaign caesar give the maid and she ancestral kingdom and he grant they the life of alexander and ptolemy to he niece child of antony by octavium and rear by she he assign money from they father 's estate he also order he freedman to give at once to iullus the child of antony and fulvium everything which by law they be oblige to bequeath he at they death -lrb- -16 - -rrb- as for the rest who have until then be connect with antony 's cause he punish some and release other either from personal motive or to oblige he friend and since there be find at the court many child of potentate and king who be be support some as hostage and other for the display of wanton power he send some back to they home join other in marriage with one another and keep possession of still other i shall omit most of these case and mention only two he freely restore iotape to the median king who have find a asylum with he after the defeat but refuse the request of artax that he brother be send he because this prince have put to death the roman leave behind in armenia this be the disposition he make of such captive the egyptian and alexandrian be all spare and caesar do not injure one of they the truth be that he do not see fit to visit any extreme vengeance upon so great a people who might prove very useful to the roman in many way he nevertheless offer the pretext that he wish to please they god serapi alexander they founder and third areus a citizen who be a philosopher and enjoy he society the speech in which he proclaim to they he pardon he speak in greek so that they might understand he after this he view the body of alexander and also touch it at which a piece of the nose it be say be crushed but he would not go to see the remains of the ptolemy though the alexandrian be extremely anxious to show they for he say : i want to see a king and not corpse for the same reason he would not enter the presence of apis declare that he be accustom to worship god and not cattle -lrb- -17 - -rrb- soon after he make egypt tributary and give it in charge of cornelius gallus in view of the populousness of both city and country and the facile fickle character of the inhabitant and the importance of grain supplies and revenue so far from daring to entrust the land to any senator he would not even grant one permission to live in it unless he make the concession to some one _ nominatim _ on the other hand he do not allow the egyptian to be senator in rome but after consider individual case on they merit he command the alexandrian to conduct they government without senator with such capacity for revolution do he credit they and of the system then impose upon they most detail be rigorously preserve to the present day but there be senator in alexandrium beginning first under the emperor severus and they also may serve in rome have first be enrol in the senate in the reign of he son antoninus thus be egypt enslave all of the inhabitant who resist be subdue after a time as indeed heaven very clearly indicate to they would occur for it rain not only water where previously no drop have ever fall but also blood at the same time that this be fall from the cloud glimpse be catch of armor elsewhere there be the clashing of drum and cymbal and the note of flute and trumpet a serpent of huge size be suddenly see and give a hiss incredibly loud meanwhile comet star come frequently into view and ghost of the dead take shape the statue frown : api bellow a lament and shed tear such be the status of thing in that respect in the palace quantity of money be find cleopatra have take practically all the offering from even the holiest shrine and so help to swell the spoil of the roman while the latter on they own part incur no defilement large sum be also obtain from every man under accusation more than that all the rest against whom no personal complaint could be bring have two-third of they property demand of they out of this all the soldier get what be still owe to they and those who be with caesar at that time secure in addition two hundred and fifty denarius apiece for not plunder the city all be make good to those who have previously loan anything and to both senator and knight who have take part in the war great sum be give in fine the roman empire be enriched and its temple adorn -lrb- -18 - -rrb- after attend to the matter before mention caesar found there also on the site of the battle a city and give to it likewise a name and dedicatory game as in the previous instance in regard to the canal he clear out some of they and dig other over again and he also settle important question then he go through syrium into the province of asia and pass the winter there attend to the business of the subject nation in detail and likewise to that of the parthian there have be dispute among they and a certain tiridate have rise against phraate as long as antony 's opposition last even after the naval battle caesar have not only not attach himself to either side though they seek he alliance but make no other answer than that he would think it over he excuse be that he be busy with egypt but in reality he want they meantime to exhaust themselves by fight against each other now that antony be dead and of the two combatant tiridate defeat have take refuge in syrium and phraate victorious have send envoy he negotiate with the latter in a friendly manner : and without promise to aid tiridate he allow he to live in syrium he receive a son of phraate as a mark of friendliness and take the youth to rome where he keep he as a hostage -lrb- -19 - -rrb- meanwhile and still earlier the roman at home have pass many resolution respect the victory at sea they grant caesar a triumph -lrb- over cleopatra -rrb- and grant he a arch bear a trophy at brundusium and another one in the roman forum moreover the lower part of the julian hero-shrine be to be adorn with the beak of the captive ship and a festival every five year to be celebrate in he honor there should be a thanksgiving on he birthday and on the anniversary of the announcement of the victory : when he enter the city the -lrb- vestal virgin -rrb- priestess the senate and the people with they wife and child be to meet he it be quite superfluous to mention the prayer the image the privilege of front seat and everything else of the sort at the very first they both vote he these honor and either tear down or erase the memorial that have lend antony distinction they declare the day on which the latter have be bear accursed and forbid the employment of the surname marcus by any one of he kin he death be announce during a part of the year when cicero the son of cicero be consul and on ascertain this some believe it have come to pass not without divine direction since the consul 's father have owe he death chiefly to antony then they vote to caesar additional crown and many thanksgiving and grant he among other rights authority to conduct a triumph over the egyptian also for neither previously nor at that time do they mention by name antony and the rest of the roman who have be vanquish with he and so imply that it be proper to hold a celebration over they the day on which alexandrium be capture they declare fortunate and direct that for the year to come it should be take as the starting-point of enumeration by the inhabitant of that town -lrb- 72 -rrb- also caesar be to hold the tribunician power for life to have the right to defend such as call upon he for help both within the pomerium and outside to the distance of eight half-stadium -lrb- a privilege possess by none of the tribune -rrb- as also to judge appeal case and a vote of he like the vote of athena -lrb- 73 -rrb- be to be cast in all the court in the prayer in behalf of the people and the senate petition should be offer for he alike by the priest and by the priestess they also order that at all banquet not only public but private also all should pour a libation to he these be the resolution pass at that time -lrb- bc 29 -lrb- _ a u _ 725 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -20 - -rrb- when he be consul for the fifth time with sextus apuleius they ratify all he act by oath on the very first day of January and when the letter come regard the parthian they decree that he should have a place in hymn along with the god that a tribe should be name julian after he that he should wear the triumphal crown during the progress of all the festival that the senator who have participate in he victory should take part in the procession wear purple-bordered toga and that the day on which he should enter the city should be glorified by sacrifice by the entire population and be hold ever sacred they further agree that he might choose priest beyond the specify number as many and as often as he should wish this custom be hand down from that decision and the number have increase till they be boundless : hence i need go into no particulars about the multitude of such official caesar accept most of the honor -lrb- save only a few -rrb- : but that all the population of the city should meet he he particularly request might not occur yet he be pleased most of all and more than at all the other decree by the fact that the senator close the gate of janus imply that all they war have cease -- and take the augury of health -lrb- 74 -rrb- which have all this period be omit for reason i have mention for there be still under arm the treverus who have bring the celt to help they the cantabrus vaccaeus and asture these last be subjugate by statilius taurus and those first mention by nonius gallus there be numerous other disturbance go on in the isolate district since however nothing of importance result from any of they the roman of that time do not consider that war be in progress and i have nothing notable to record about they caesar meanwhile be give he attention to various business and grant permission that precinct dedicate to rome and to caesar he father -- call he the julian hero -- should be set apart in ephesus and in nicaea these city have at that time attain chief place in asia and in bithynium respectively to these two divinity he order the roman who dwell near they to pay honor he allow the foreigner -lrb- under the name of hellene -rrb- to establish a precinct to himself -- the asian have theirs in pergamum and the bithynian theirs in nicomedea this custom begin with he have continue in the case of other emperor and imperial precinct have be hallowed not only among hellenic nation but in all the rest which yield obedience to the roman in the capital itself and in the rest of italy there be no one however no matter how great renown he have achieve that have dare to do this still even there after they death honor as to god be bestow upon those who have rule uprightly and hero-shrine be build -lrb- -21 - -rrb- all this take place in the winter during which the pergamenian also receive authority to celebrate the so-called sacred contest in honor of he temple in the course of the summer caesar cross over to greece and on to italy among the other who offer sacrifice as have be mention when he enter the city be the consul valerius potitus caesar be consul all the year as the two previous but potitus be the successor of sextus it be he who publicly and in person sacrifice ox in behalf of the senate and of the people at caesar 's arrival something that have never before be do in the case of any single man after this he newly return colleague praise and honor he lieutenant as have be the custom among the many mark of favor by which caesar distinguish agrippa be the dark blue symbol -lrb- 75 -rrb- of naval supremacy to he soldier also he make certain present : to the people he distribute a hundred denarius each first to those ranking as adult and afterward to the child as a mark of he affection for he nephew marcellus further let it be note that he would not accept from the city of italy the gold to be use for the crown moreover he pay everything which he himself owe to any one and as have be say he do not exact what the other be owe to he all this cause the roman to forget every unpleasantness and they view he triumph with pleasure quite as if the defeat party have all be foreigner so vast a amount of money circulate through all the city alike that the price of goods rise and loan which have previously be in demand at twelve per cent be now make at one-third that rate the celebration on the first day be in honor of the war against the pannonian and dalmatian iapudium and adjoining territory and a few celt and gaul graius carrina have subdue the morinus and some other who have rise against roman dominion and have repulse the suevus who have cross the rhine to wage war therefore he too hold a triumph in spite of the fact that he father have be put to death by sullum and he himself have once be prevent from hold office with the rest of he peer caesar also hold one since the credit of this victory properly pertain to he position as imperator these be the celebration on the first day on the second come the commemoration of the naval victory at actium on the third that of the subjugation of egypt all the procession prove notable by reason of the spoil from this land -- so many have be gather that they suffice for all the occasion -- but this egyptian celebration be especially costly and magnificent among other feature a representation of cleopatra upon the bed of death be carry by so that in a way she too be see with the other captive and with alexander otherwise helio and cleopatra otherwise selene she child and help to grace the triumph behind they all caesar come drive and do everything accord to custom except that he allow he fellow-consul and the other magistrate contrary to custom to follow he with the senator who have participate in the victory it have be usual for such dignitary to lead and for only the senator to follow -lrb- 76 -rrb- -lrb- -22 - -rrb- after complete this he dedicate the temple of minerva call also the chalcidicum and the julian senate-house which have be build in honor of he father -lrb- 77 -rrb- in it he set up the statue of victory which be still in existence probably signify that it be from she that he have receive he dominion it belong to the tarentinus and have be bring from there to rome where it be place in the senate-chamber and deck with the spoil of egypt the spoil be also employ at this time for adorn the julian hero-shrine when it be consecrate many of they be place as offering in it and other be dedicate to capitoline jupiter and juno and minerva while all the votive gift that be think to have previously repose there or be still repose be now by decree take down as defiled thus cleopatra although defeat and capture be nevertheless glorified because she adornment repose in we temple and she herself be see in gold in the shrine of venus at the consecration of the hero-shrine there be all sort of contest and the child of the noble perform the troy equestrian exercise man who be they peer also contend on charger and pair and three-horse team a certain quintus vitellius a senator fight as a gladiator all kind of wild beast and kine be slay by the wholesale among they a rhinoceros and a hippopotamus then see for the first time in rome many have describe the appearance of the hippo and it have be see by many more as for the rhinoceros it be in most respects like a elephant but have a project horn at the very tip of its nose and through this fact have receive its name besides the introduction of these beast dacian and suebus fight in throng with each other the latter be celt the former a species of scythian the suebus to be exact dwell across the rhine -lrb- though many city elsewhere claim they name -rrb- and the dacian on both side of the ister such of they however as live on this side of it and near the triballic country be reckon in with the district of moesium and be call moesus save among those who be in the very neighborhood such as be on the other side be call dacian and be either a branch of the geta or thracian belong to the dacian race that once inhabit rhodope now these dacian have before this time send envoy to caesar : but when they obtain none of they request they turn away to follow antony to he however they be of no great assistance owe to dispute among themselves some be consequently capture and later set to fight the suebus the whole spectacle last naturally a number of day there be no intermission in spite of a sickness of caesar 's but it be carry on in he absence under the direction of other during its course the senator on one day severally hold banquet in the entrance to they home of what move they to this i have no knowledge for it have not be record such be the progress of the event of those day -lrb- -23 - -rrb- while caesar be yet in he fourth consulship statilius taurus have both construct at he own expense and dedicate with armed combat a hunting-theatre of stone on the campus martius on this account he be permit by the people to choose one of the praetor year after year during this same period marcus crassus be send into macedonium and greece and carry on war with the dacian and bastarnae it have already be state who the former be and how they have be make hostile the bastarna be properly class as scythian and at this time have cross the ister and subdue the part of moesium opposite they then the triballus who live near it and the dardanus who inhabit the triballian country while they be so engage they have no trouble with the roman but when they cross the haemus and overrun the portion of thrace belong to the dentheletus who have a compact with rome then crassus partly to defend sita king of the dentheletus who be blind but chiefly because of fear for macedonium come out to meet they by he mere approach he throw they into a panic and drive they from the land without a conflict next he pursue they as they be retire homeward gain possession of the district call segetica and invade moesium damage that territory he make a assault upon a strong fortification also and though he advance line meet with a rebuff -- the moesian make a sally against it because they think these be all of the enemy -- still when he come to the rescue with he whole remain army he both cut he opponent down in open fight and annihilate they by a ambuscade -lrb- -24 - -rrb- while he be thus engage the bastarna cease they flight and remain near the cedrus -lrb- 78 -rrb- river to watch what would take place when after conquer the moesian the roman general start against they they send envoy forbid he to pursue they since they have do the roman no harm crassus detain they say he would give they they answer the follow day and besides treat they kindly he make they drunk so that he learn all they plan the whole scythian race be insatiable in the use of wine and quickly succumb to its influence crassus meanwhile during the night advance to a wood and after station scout in front of the forest make he army stop there thereupon the bastarna think the former be alone make a charge upon they follow they up also when the man retreat into the dense forest and many of the pursuer perish there as well as many other in the flight which follow be obstruct by they wagon which be behind they and owe they defeat further to they desire to save they wife and child they king deldo be slam by crassus himself the armor strip from the prince he would have dedicate as spolium opima to jupiter feretrius have he be a general act on he own authority such be the course of that engagement : of the remainder some take refuge in a grove which be set on fire all around and other leap into a fort where they be annihilate still other perish either by be drive into the ister or after be scatter through the country some survive even yet and occupy a strong post where crassus besiege they in vain for several day then with the aid of role king of some of the getae he destroy they role when he visit caesar be treat as a friend and ally for this assistance : the captive be distribute to the soldier -lrb- -25 - -rrb- after accomplish this crassus turn he attention to the moesian and partly by persuade some of they partly by scare they and partly by the application of force he subjugate all except a very few though with labor and danger temporarily owe to the winter he retire into friendly territory after suffer greatly from the cold and still more at the hand of the thracian through whose country as friendly he be return hence he decide to be satisfy with what he have effect for sacrifice and a triumph have be vote not only to caesar but to he also though accord at least to some account he do not secure the title of imperator but caesar alone might apply it to himself the bastarna however angry at they disaster on learn that he would make no further campaign against they turn again upon the dentheletus and sita whom they regard as have be the chief cause of they evil then crassus though reluctantly take the field and by force march fall upon they unexpectedly conquer and thereafter impose such term as he please now that he have once take up arm again he conceive a desire to recompense the thracian who have harass he during he retreat from moesium for news be bring at this time that they be fortify position and be spoil for a fight and he do subdue they though not without effort by conquer in battle the merdus and the serdus and cut off the hand of the captive he overrun the rest of the country except the land of the odrysae these he spare because they be attach to the service of dionysus and have come to meet he on this occasion without arm also he grant they the piece of land in which they magnify the god and take it away from the bessus who be occupy it -lrb- -26 - -rrb- while he be so occupied he receive a summons from role who have become embroil with dapyx himself also a king of the getae crassus go to help he and by hurl the horse of he opponent back upon the infantry he thoroughly terrify the latter so that he carry the battle no further but cause a great slaughter of the fugitive of both division next he cut off dapyx who have take refuge in a fort and besiege he during the investment some one from the wall salute he in greek and upon obtain a audience arrange to betray the place the barbarian catch in this way turn upon one another and dapyx be kill besides many other he brother however crassus take alive and not only do he no harm but release he at the close of this exploit he lead he army against the cave call keirus the native in great number have occupy this place which be extremely large and so very strong that the tradition obtain that the titan after the defeat administer to they by the god take refuge there here the people have bring together all they flock and they other principal valuable crassus after find all its entrance which be crooked and hard to search out wall they up and in this way subjugate the man by famine upon this success he do not keep he hand from the rest of the getae though they have nothing to do with dapyx he march upon genouclum the most strongly defend fortress of the kingdom of zurax because he hear that the standard which the bastarna have take from gaius antonius near the city of the istrianus be there he assault be make both with the infantry and upon the ister -- the city be near the water -- and in a short time though with much labor in spite of the absence of zurax he take the place the king as soon as he hear of the roman 's approach have set off with money to the scythian to seek a alliance and do not return in time this he do among the getae some of the moesian who have be subdue rise in revolt and they he win back by the energy of other : -lrb- -27 - -rrb- he himself lead a campaign against the artacius and a few other tribe who have never be capture and would not acknowledge he authority pride themselves greatly on this point and imbue the rest with both anger and a disposition to rebel he bring they to term partly by force as they do but little and partly by the fear which the capture of some inspire this take a long time i record the name as the fact accord to the tradition which have be hand down anciently moesian and geta occupy all the land between the haemus and the ister as time go on some of they change they name to something else since then there have be include under the name of moesia all the tribe which the savus by empty into the ister north of dalmatium macedonium and thrace
