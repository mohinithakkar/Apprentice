strange day the day that i be bear the wave be beat against the lighthouse and the wind be roar and rage against everything have not the lighthouse be build very firmly into the strong solid rock it and all within it must have be sweep into the deep wild sea it be a terrible storm my grandfather say he have never know such a storm since he come to live on the island more than forty year before many ship go down in the storm that day and many life be lose but in the very midst of it when the wind be highest and the wave be strongest and when the foam and the spray have completely cover the lighthouse window i alick fergusson be bear i be bear on a strange day and i be bear into a strange home the lighthouse stand on a island four mile distant from any land the island be not very large if you stand in the middle of it you could see the sea all round you -- that sea which be sometimes so blue and peaceful and at other time be as black as ink and roaring and thunder on the rocky shore of the little island at one side of the island on a steep rock overhang the sea stand the lighthouse night by night as soon as it begin to grow dark the lighthouse lamp be light i can remember how i use to admire those light as a child i would sit for hour watch they revolve and change in color first there be a white light then a blue one then a red one then a green one -- then a white one again and as the ship go by they always keep a look-out for we friendly light and avoid the rock of which they warn they my grandfather old sandy fergusson be one of the lighthouse man whose duty it be always to keep these lamp in order and to light they every night he be a clever active old man and do he work well and cheerfully he great desire be to be able to hold on at he post till i should be able to take he place at the time when my story begin i be nearly twelve year old and daily grow taller and stronger my grandfather be very proud of I and say i should soon be a young man and then he should get I appoint in he place to look after the lighthouse i be very fond of my strange home and would not have change it for any other many people would have think it dull for we seldom see a strange face and the lighthouse man be only allow to go on shore for a few hour once in every two month but i be very happy and think there be no place in the world like we little island close to the tower of the lighthouse be the house in which i and my grandfather live it be not a large house but it be a very pleasant one all the window look out over the sea and plenty of sharp sea air come in whenever they be open all the furniture in the house belong to the lighthouse and have be there long before my grandfather come to live there we cup and saucer and plate have the name of the lighthouse on they in large gilt letter and a little picture of the lighthouse with the wave dash round it i use to think they very pretty when i be a boy we have not many neighbor there be only one other house on the island and it be build on the other side of the lighthouse tower the house belong to mr millar who share the care of the lighthouse with my grandfather just outside the two house be a court with a pump in the middle from which we get we water there be a high wall all round this court to make a little shelter for we from the stormy wind beyond this court be two garden divide by a iron railing the millar ' garden be very untidy and forlorn and fill with nettle and thistle and groundsel and all kind of weed for mr millar do not care for gardening and mr millar have six little child and have no time to look after it but we garden be the admiration of every one who visit the island my grandfather and i be at work in it every fine day and take a pride in keep it as neat as possible although it be so near the sea we garden produce most beautiful vegetable and fruit and the border be fill with flower cabbage-rose and pansy and wall-flower and many other hardy plant which be not afraid of the sea air outside the garden be a good-sized field -- full of small hillock over which the wild rabbit and hare with which the island abound be continually scamper in this field be keep a cow and two goat to supply the two family with milk and butter beyond it be the rocky shore and a little pier build out into the sea -lrb- illustration : the landing stage -rrb- on this pier i use to stand every Monday morning to watch for the steamer which call at the island once a week it be a great event to we when the steamer come my grandfather and i and mr and mr millar and the child all come down to the shore to welcome it this steamer bring we provision for the week from a town some mile off and often bring a letter for mr millar or a newspaper for my grandfather my grandfather do not get many letter for there be not many people that he know he have live on that lonely island the greater part of he life and have be quite shut out from the world all he relation be dead now except my father and what have become of he we do not know i have never see he for he go away some time before i be bear my father be a sailor a fine tall strong young fellow my grandfather use to say he have bring my mother to the island and leave she in my grandfather 's care whilst he go on a voyage to australia he go from the island in that same little steamer which call every Monday morning my grandfather stand on the end of the pier as the steamer go out of sight and my mother wave she handkerchief to he as long as any smoke be see on the horizon grandfather have often tell I how young and pretty she look that summer morning my father have promise to write soon but no letter ever come mother go down to the pier every Monday morning for three long year to see if it have bring she any word from she sailor husband but after a time she step become slower and she face paler and at last she be too weak to go down the rock to the pier when the steamer arrive on Monday morning and soon after this i be leave motherless from that day the day on which my mother die my grandfather become both father and mother to I there be nothing he would not have do for I and wherever he go and whatever he do i be always by he side as i grow older he teach I to read and write for there be of course no school which i could attend i also learn to help he to trim the lamp and to work in the garden we life go on very evenly from day to day until i be about twelve year old i use to wish sometimes that something new would happen to make a little change on the island and at last a change come chapter ii the flare at sea my grandfather and i be sit at tea one dark November evening we have be digging in the garden the whole morning but in the afternoon it have become so wet and stormy that we have remain indoors we be sit quietly at we tea plan what we would do the next day when the door suddenly open and mr millar put he head in ` sandy quick ' he say ` look here ' my grandfather and i run to the door and look out over the sea there about three mile to the north of we we see a bright flare of light it blaze up for a moment or two light up the wild and stormy sky and then it go out and all be darkness again ` what be it grandfather ' i ask but he do not answer I ` there be no time to lose jem ' he say out with the boat my man ` it be a awful sea ' say millar look at the wave beat fiercely against the rock ` never mind jem ' say my grandfather ` we must do we best ' so the two man go down to the shore and i follow they ` what be it grandfather ' i ask again ` there be something wrong out there ' say he point to the place where we have see the light ` that be the flare they always make when they be in danger and want help at once ' ` be you go to they grandfather ' i say ` yes if we can get the boat out ' he say ` now jem be you ready ' ` let I go with you grandfather ' i say ' i might be able to help ' ` all right my lad ' he say ` we 'll try if we can get she off ' i can see that scene with my mind 's eye as though it be but yesterday my grandfather and mr millar strain every nerve to row the boat from land whilst i clung on to one of the seat and try in vain to steer she i can see poor mr millar standing on the pier with she shawl over she head watch we and two of she little girl cling to she dress i can see the wave which seem to be rise higher every moment and ready to beat we little boat to piece and i can see my grandfather 's disappointed face as after many a fruitless attempt he be oblige to give it up ` it be no use i be afraid jem ' he say at last ` we have not hand enough to manage she ' so we get to shore as best we could and pace up and down the little pier we could see nothing more it be a very dark night and all be perfect blackness over the sea the lighthouse lamp be burn brightly they have be light more than two hour before it be millar 's turn to watch so he go up to the tower and my grandfather and i remain on the pier ` can nothing be do grandfather ' ` i be afraid not my lad we can not make any way against such a sea as this if it go down a bit we 'll have another try at it ' but the sea do not go down we walk up and down the pier almost in silence presently a rocket shoot up into the sky evidently from the same place where we have see the flare ` there she be again alick poor thing i wonder how many of they there be ' ` can we do nothing at all ' i ask again ` no my lad ' he say ` the sea 's too much for we it be a terrible night it put I in mind of the day you be bear ' so the night wear away we never think of go to bed but walk up and down the pier with we eye fix on the place where we have see the light every now and then for some hour rocket be send up and then they cease and we see nothing ` they have get no more with they ' say my grandfather ` poor thing it be a terrible bad job ' ` what be wrong with they grandfather ' i ask ` be there rock over there ' ` yes there be the ainslie crag just there it be a nasty place that -- a very nasty place many a fine ship have be lose there ' at last the day begin to dawn a faint gray light spread over the sea we could distinguish now the mast of a ship in the far distance ` there she be poor thing ' say my grandfather point in the direction of the ship ` she be close on ainslie crag -- i think so ' ` the wind 's go down a bit now have not it ' i ask ` yes and the sea 's a bit stiller just now ' he say ` give jem a call alick ' jem millar hasten down to the pier with he arm full of rope ` all right jem my lad ' say my grandfather ` let 's be off i think we may manage it now ' so we jump into the boat and put off from the pier it be a fearful struggle with the wind and wave and for a long time we seem to make no way against they both the man be much exhaust and jem millar seem ready to give in ` cheer up jem my lad ' say my grandfather ` think of all the poor fellow out there let 's have one more try ' so they make a mighty effort and the pier be leave a little way behind slowly very slowly we make that distance greater slowly very slowly mr millar who be stand on the shore fade from we sight and the mast of the ship in distress seem to grow a little more near yet the wave be still fearfully strong and appear ready every moment to swallow up we little boat would my grandfather and millar ever be able to hold on till they reach the ship which be still more than two mile away ` what be that ' i cry as i catch sight of a dark object rise and fall with the wave ` it be a boat surely ' say my grandfather ` look jem chapter iii the bundle save it _ be _ a boat of which i have catch sight -- a boat bottom upward a minute afterwards it sweep close past we so near that we could almost touch it ` they have lose they boat pull away jem ' ` oh grandfather ' i say -- and the wind be so high i could only make he hear by shout -- ` grandfather do you think the boat be full ' ` no ' he say ' i think they have try to put she off and she be be sweep away keep up jem ' for jem millar who be not a strong man seem ready to give in we be now considerably more than half-way between the boat and the ship it seem as if those on board have catch sight of we for another rocket go up they have evidently keep one back as a last hope in case any one should pass by as we draw nearer we could see that it be a large ship and we could distinguish many form move about on deck ` poor fellow poor fellow ' say my grandfather ` pull away jem ' nearer and nearer we come to the ship till at length we could see she quite distinctly she have strike on ainslie crag and she stern be under water and the wave be beat wildly on she deck we could see man cling to the rigging which remain and hold on to the broken mast of the ship i shall _ never _ forget that sight to my die day my grandfather and jem millar see it and they pull on desperately and now we be so near to the vessel that have it not be for the storm which be rage we could have speak to those on board again and again we try to come alongside the shatter ship but be sweep away by the rush of the strong resistless wave several of the sailor come to the side of the ship and throw out a rope to we it be long before we could catch it but at last as we be be carry past it i clutch it and my grandfather immediately make it secure ` now ' he cry ` steady jem we shall save some of they yet ' and he pull the boat as near as possible to the ship oh how my heart beat that moment as i look at the man and woman all crowd towards the place where the rope be fasten ` we can not take they all ' say my grandfather anxiously ` we must cut the rope when we have get as many as the boat will carry ' i shudder as i thought of those who would be leave behind we have now come so close to the ship that the man on board would be able to watch they opportunity and jump into the boat whenever a great wave be past and there be a lull for a moment in the storm ` look out jem ' cry my grandfather ` here be the first ' a man be stand by the rope with what appear to be a bundle in he arm the moment we come near he seize he opportunity and throw it to we my grandfather catch it -lrb- illustration : ` it be a child alick ' he say ` put it down by you ' -rrb- ` it be a child alick ' he say ` put it down by you ' i put the bundle at my foot and my grandfather cry ` now another quick my lad ' but at this moment jem millar seize he arm ` sandy look out ' he almost shriek my grandfather turn round a mighty wave bigger than any i have see before be come towards we in another moment we should have be dash by its violence against the ship and all have perish my grandfather hastily let go the rope and we just get out of the way of the ship before the wave reach we and then come a noise loud as a terrible thunder-clap as the mighty wave dash against ainslie crag i could hardly breathe so dreadful be the moment ` now back again for some more ' cry my grandfather when the wave have pass we look round but the ship be go it have disappear like a dream when one awake as if it have never be that mighty wave have break its back and shatter it into a thousand fragment nothing be to be see of the ship or its crew but a few float piece of timber my grandfather and millar pull hastily to the spot but it be some time before we could reach it for we have be carry by the sea almost a mile away and the storm seem to be increase in violence when at last we reach that terrible ainslie crag we be too late to save a single life we could not find one of those on board the greater number no doubt have be carry down in the vortex make by the sink ship and the rest have rise and sink again long before we reach they for some time we battle with the wave unwilling to relinquish all hope of save some of they but we find at last that it be of no use and we be oblige to return all have perish except the child lie at my foot i stoop down to it and could hear that it be cry but it be so tightly tie up in a blanket that i could not see it nor release it we have to strain every nerve to reach the lighthouse it be not so hard return as go for the wind be in we favor but the sea be still strong and we be often in great danger i keep my eye fix on the lighthouse lamp and steer the boat as straight as i could oh how thankful we be to see those friendly light grow nearer and at last the pier come in sight and mr millar still stand there watch we ` have you get none of they ' she say as we come up the step ` nothing but a child ' say my grandfather sadly ` only one small child that be all well we do we very best jem my lad ' jem be follow my grandfather with the oar over he shoulder i come last with that little bundle in my arm the child have stop cry now and seem to be asleep it be so still mr millar want to take it from I and to undo the blanket but my grandfather say ` bide you time mary bring the child into the house my lass it be bitter cold out here ' so we all go up through the field and through we garden and the court the blanket be tightly fasten round the child except at the top where room have be leave for it to breathe and i could just see a little nose and two close eye as i peeped in at the open the bundle be a good weight and before i reach the house i be glad of mr millar 's help to carry it we come into we little kitchen and mr millar take the child on she knee and unfasten the blanket ` bless she ' she say as she tear fall fast ` it be a little girl ' ` ay ' say my grandfather ` so it be it be a bonnie wee lassie ' chapter iv little timpey i do not think i have ever see a prettier face than that child 's she have light brown hair and round rosy cheek and the bluest of blue eye she awake as we be look at she and see herself amongst stranger she cry bitterly ` poor little thing ' say mrs millar ` she want she mother ' ` mam -- ma ma -- ma ' cry the little girl as she catch the word mr millar fairly break down at this and sob and cry as much as the child ` come my lass ' say she husband ` cheer up thee 'll make she worse if thee take on so ' but mr millar could do nothing but cry ` just think if it be we polly ' be all that she could say ` oh jem just think if it be we polly that be call for I ' my grandfather take the child from she and put she on my knee ` now mary ' he say ` get we a bit of fire and something to eat there be a good woman the child 's cold and hunger and we be much about the same ourselves ' mr millar bustle about the house and soon light a blaze fire then she run in next door to see if she child whom she have leave with a little servant girl be all right and she bring back with she some cold meat for we breakfast i sit down on a stool before the fire with the child on my knee she seem to be about two year old a strong healthy little thing she have stop cry now and do not seem to be afraid of I but whenever any of the other come near she hide she face in my shoulder mr millar bring she a basin of bread and milk and she let I feed she she seem very weary and sleepy as if she could hardly keep she eye open ` poor wee lassie ' say my grandfather ' i expect they pull she out of she bed to bring she on deck will not you put she to bed ' ` yes ' say mrs millar ` i 'll put she in we polly 's bed she 'll sleep there quite nice she will ' but the child cling to I and cry so loudly when mr millar try to take she that my grandfather say -- ' i would not take she away poor motherless lamb she take kindly to alick let she bide here ' so we make up a little bed for she on the sofa and mr millar bring one of little polly 's nightgown and undressed and wash she and put she to bed the child be still very shy of all of they but I she seem to have take to I from the first and when she be put into she little bed she hold out she tiny hand to I and say ` handie timpey 's handie ' ` what do she say bless she ' say mrs millar for it be almost the first time that the child have speak ` she want I to hold she little hand ' i say ` timpey 's little hand timpey must be she name ' ' i never hear of such a name ' say mrs millar ` timpey do you say what do

villier _ write on it ` dear I ' say mrs millar ` yes that will be she name dear I dear I to think of she poor father and mother at the bottom of that dreadful sea just think if it be we polly ' and then mr millar cry so much again that she be oblige to go home and finish she cry with she little polly clasped tightly in she arm my grandfather be very worn out with all he have do during the night and go upstairs to bed i sit watch the little sleep child i feel as if i could not leave she she sleep very quietly and peacefully poor little pet how little she know what have happen i think and my tear come fast and fall on the little fat hand which be lie on the pillow but after a few minute i lean my head against the sofa and fall fast asleep i have have no sleep the night before and be quite worn out i be awaken some hour after by some one pull my hair and a little voice call in my ear ` up up boy up up ' i look up and see a little roguish face look at I -- the merriest brightest little face you can imagine ` up up boy please ' she say again in a coax voice so i lift up my head and she climb out of she little bed on the sofa on to my knee ` put shoe on boy ' she say hold out she little bare toe i put on she shoe and stocking and then mr millar come in and dress she it be a lovely afternoon the storm have cease whilst we have be asleep and the sun be shine brightly i get the dinner ready and the child watch I and run backwards and forwards up and down the kitchen she seem quite at home now and very happy my grandfather be still asleep so i do not wake he mrs millar bring in some broth she have make for the child and we dine together i want to feed she as i have do the night before but she say -- ` timpey have ` poon please ' and take the spoon from I and feed herself so prettily i could not help watch she ` god bless she poor little thing ' say mrs millar ` god bless ` ou ' say the child the word be evidently familiar to she ` she must have hear she mother say so ' say mrs millar in a choke voice when we have finish dinner the child slip down from she stool and run to the sofa here she find my grandfather 's hat which she put on she head and my scarf which she hang round she neck then she march to the door and say ` tatta tatta timpey go tatta ' ` take she out a bit alick ' say mrs millar ` stop a minute though i 'll fetch she polly 's hood ' so to she great delight we dress she in polly 's hood and put a warm shawl round she and i take she out oh how she run and jump and play in the garden i never see such a merry little thing now she be pick up stone now she be gather daisy -lrb- ` day day she call they -rrb- now she be run down the path and call to I to catch she she be never still a single instant -lrb- illustration : after the storm -rrb- but every now and then as i be play with she i look across the sea to ainslie crag the sea have not go down much though the wind have cease and i see the wave still dash wildly upon the rock and i think of what lay beneath they of the shatter ship and of the child 's mother oh if she only know i think as i listen to she merry laugh which make I more ready to cry than she tear have do chapter v the unclaimed sunbeam my grandfather and jem millar be sit over the fire in the little watchroom in the lighthouse tower and i sit beside they with the child on my knee i have find a old picture-book for she and she be turn over the leaf and make she funny little remark on the picture ` well sandy ' say millar ` what shall we do with she ' ' _ do _ with she ' say my grandfather stroke she little fair head ` we 'll keep she will not we little lassie ' ` yes ' say the child look up and nod she head as if she understand all about it ` we ought to look up some of she relation it seem to I ' say jem ` she be sure to have some somewhere ' ` and how be we to find they out ' ask my grandfather ` oh the captain can soon make out for we what ship be miss and we can send a line to the owner they 'll know who the passenger be ' ` well ' say my grandfather ` maybe you be right jem we 'll see what they say but for my part if they that care for the child be at the bottom of that sea i hope no one else will come and take she away from we ' ` if i have not so many of they at home -- ` begin millar ` oh yes my lad i know that ' say my grandfather interrupt he ` but thy house be full enough already let the wee lassie come to alick and I she 'll be a nice little bit of company for we and mary will see to she clothes and such like i know ' ` yes that she will ' say she husband ' i do declare she have be cry about that child the best part of the day she have indeed ' my grandfather follow jem 's advice and tell captain sayer when he come in the steamer the next Monday the whole story of the shipwreck and ask he to find out for he the name and address of the owner of the vessel oh how i hope that no one would come to claim my little darling she become dearer to I every day and i feel as if it would break my heart to part with she every night when mr millar have undress she she kneel beside I in she little white nightgown to ` talk to god ' as she call pray she have evidently learn a little prayer from she mother for the first night she begin of she own accord ` jesus eppy hear I ' i could not think at first what it be that she be say but mr millar say she have learn the hymn when she be a little girl and she write out the first verse for I and every night afterwards i let the child repeat it after I -- ` jesus tender shepherd hear I bless thy little lamb to-night through the darkness be thou near I keep I safe till morning light ' i think i should like she always to say the prayer she mother have teach she i never pray myself -- my grandfather have never teach I i wonder if my mother would have teach I if she have live i think she would i know very little in those day of the bible my grandfather do not care for it and never read it he have a large bible but it be always lay on the top of the chest of drawer as a kind of ornament and unless i take it down to look at the curious old picture inside it be never open Sunday on the island be just the same as any other day my grandfather work in the garden or read the newspaper just the same as usual and i ramble about the rock or do my lesson or work in the house as i do every other day in the week we have no church or chapel to go to and nothing happen to mark the day i often think now of that dreadful morning when we go across the stormy sea to that sink ship if we boat have capsize then if we have be lose what would have become of we soul it be a very solemn thought and i can not be too thankful to god for spare we both a little longer my grandfather be a kind-hearted good-tempered honest old man but i know now that that be not enough to open the door of heaven jesus be the only way there and my grandfather know little of and care nothing for _ he _ little timpey become my constant companion indoors and out of door she be rather shy of the little millar for they be noisy and rough in they play but she cling to I and never want to leave I day by day she learn new word and come out with such odd little remark of she own that she make we all laugh she great pleasure be to get hold of a book and pick out the different letter of the alphabet which although she could hardly talk she know quite perfectly dear little pet i can see she now sit at my foot on a large flat rock by the seashore and call I every minute to look at a or b or d or s and so by she pretty way she creep into all we heart and we quite dread the answer come to the letter my grandfather have write to the owner of the _ victory _ which we find be the name of the lose ship it be a very wet day the Monday that the answer come i have be wait some time on the pier and be wet through before the steamer arrive captain sayer hand I the letter before anything else and i run up with it to my grandfather at once i could not wait until we provision and supplies be bring on shore little timpey be sit on a stool at my grandfather 's foot wind a long piece of tape round and round she little finger she run to meet I as i come in and hold up she face to be kiss what if this letter should say she be to leave we and go back by the steamer i draw a long breath as my grandfather open it it be a very civil letter from the owner of the ship thank we for all we have do to save the unhappy crew and passenger but say they know nothing of the child or she belongings as no one of the name of villier have take a cabin and there be no sailor on board of that name but they say they would make further inquiry in calcutta from which port the vessel have sail meanwhile they beg my grandfather to take charge of the child and assure he he should be handsomely reward for he trouble ` that be right ' i say when he have finish read it ` then she have not to go yet ' ` no ' say my grandfather ` poor wee lassie we can not spare she yet i do not want any of they reward alick not i that be reward enough for I ' he say as he lift up the child to kiss he wrinkled forehead chapter vi the old gentleman 's question the next Monday morning timpey and i go down together to the pier to await the arrival of the steamer she have bring a doll with she which mr millar have give she and of which she be very proud captain sayer send for I as soon as the steamer come up to the pier to tell I that two gentleman have come to see my grandfather i hold the child 's hand very tightly in mine for i have feel sure they have come for she the gentleman come up the step a minute or two afterwards one of they be a middle-aged man with a very clever face i think he tell I he have come to see mr alexander fergusson and ask I if i could direct he which way to go to the house ` yes sir ' i say ` mr fergusson be my grandfather ' so we go up towards the lighthouse timpey and i walk first to lead the way and the gentleman follow the other gentleman be quite old and have white hair and gold spectacles and a pleasant kindly face timpey could not walk very fast and she keep run first to one side and then to another to gather flower or pick up stone to i take she in my arm and carry she ` be that you little sister ' ask the old gentleman ` no sir ' i say ` this be the little girl who be on board the _ victory _ ` dear I dear I ' say both gentleman at once ` let I look at she ' say the old man arrange he spectacles but timpey be frighten and cling to I and begin to cry ` never mind never mind ' say the old gentleman kindly ` we 'll make friend with one another by-and-by ' by this time we have reach the house and the middle-aged gentleman introduce himself as mr septimus forster one of the owner of the lose vessel and say that he and he father-in-law mr davi have come to hear all particulars that my grandfather could give they with regard to the shipwreck my grandfather beg they to sit down and tell I to prepare breakfast for they at once they be very pleasant gentleman both of they and be very kind to my grandfather mr forster want to make he a handsome present for what he have do but my grandfather would not take it they talk much of little timpey and i keep stop to listen as i be set out the cup and saucer they have hear nothing more of she relation and they say it be a very strange thing that no such name as villier be to be find on the list of passenger on board they offer to take she away with they till some relation be find but my grandfather beg to keep she the gentleman see how happy and well care for the child be gladly consent after breakfast mr forster say he should like to see the lighthouse so my grandfather go up to the top of the tower with he and show he with great pride all that be to be see there old mr davi be tired and stay behind with little timpey and I ` this be a strong house my lad ' he say when the other have go ` yes sir ' i say ` it ought to be strong the wind be fearful here sometimes ' ` what sort of a foundation have it ' say the old man tap the floor with he stick ` oh it be all rock sir ' i answer ` solid rock we house and the lighthouse tower be all build into the rock they would never stand if they be not ' ` and be _ you _ on the rock my lad ' say mr davis look at I through he spectacles ' i beg you pardon sir ' i say for i think i have not hear he rightly ` be _ you _ on the rock ' he repeat ` on the rock sir oh yes ' i say thinking he could not have understand what i say before ` all these building be build into the rock or the wind and sea would carry they away ' ` but _ you _ ' say the old gentleman again ` be _ you _ on the rock ' ' i do not quite understand you sir ' i say ` never mind ' he say ` i 'll ask you grandfather when he come down ' so i sit still wonder what he could mean and almost think he must have go out of he mind as soon as my grandfather return he put the same question to he and

the island when it be my grandfather 's turn i generally go with he and much enjoy get a little change but whichever of they go it be a great day with we on the island for they buy any little thing that we might be need for we house or garden and do any business that have to be do on shore we all go down to the pier to see jem millar start and as i be help he to get on board some empty sack and some other thing he have to take with he he say to I in a undertone -- ` alick my lad keep that bit of paper it be all true what that old gentleman say i have be think of it ever since and alick ' he whisper ' i believe i _ be _ on the rock now ' he say no more but arrange he oar and in a minute more he be off but as he row away i hear he singing softly to himself : ` on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground be sink sand ' we watch the boat out of sight and then go home wish that it be evening and that jem be back again with all the thing that we have ask he to get for we that be a very gloomy afternoon a thick fog come over the sea and gradually close we in so that we could hardly see a step before we on the beach little timpey begin to cough so i take she indoors and amuse she there with a picture-book it grow so dark that my grandfather light the lighthouse lamp soon after dinner there be a dull yellow light over everything i never remember a more gloomy afternoon and as evening come on the fog grow denser till at length we could see nothing outside the window it be no use look out for jem 's return for we could not see the sea much less any boat upon it so we stay indoors and my grandfather sit by the fire smoking he pipe ' i think jem would have be here before now ' he say at length as i be put out the cup and saucer for tea ` oh he 'll come before we have finish tea i think grandfather ' i answer ' i wonder what sort of a spade he 'll have get for we ' when tea be over the door open suddenly and we look up expect to see jem enter with we purchase but

the child in a shawl and carry she into the millar ' house and leave she under the care of mr millar 's little servant and then i run down through the thick smother fog to the pier my grandfather be stand there with mr millar when i come close to they he be say ` cheer up mary my lass he be all right he be only wait till this mist have clear away a bit you go home and i 'll tell you as soon as ever i hear he boat come why you be wet through woman you 'll get you death of cold ' she thin calico dress be soak with the damp in the air and she be shiver and look as white as a sheet at first she would not be persuade to leave the pier but as time go on and it grow darker and colder she consent to do as my grandfather tell she and he promise he would send I up to the lighthouse to tell she as soon as jem arrive when she be go my grandfather say ` alick there be something wrong with jem depend upon it i do not like to tell she so poor soul if we only have the boat i would go out a bit of way and see ' we walk up and down the pier and stop every now and then to listen if we could hear the sound of oar in the distance for we should not be able to see the boat till it be close upon we so dense have the fog become ` dear I ' my grandfather keep say anxiously ' i wish he would come ' my thought go back to the bright sunny morning when jem millar have start and we have hear he singing as he go those two line of the hymn -- ` on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground be sink sand ' the time pass on would he never come we grow more and more anxious mr millar 's servant-girl come

if she be not afraid and if jem 's all right why she 'll only be the better pleased ' the girl go back and we still wait on the pier ` grandfather ' i say at length ' i think i hear a boat ' it be a very still night we stand and listen at first my grandfather say he hear nothing but at length he distinguish as i do the regular plash -- plash -- plash -- of oar in the distance ` yes it _ be _ a boat ' say my grandfather i be hasten to leave the pier and run up to the house to tell mr millar but my grandfather lay he hand on my shoulder ` wait a bit alick my lad ' he say ` let we hear what it

long way off when we first hear it for it be many minute before the sound of the oar seem to become much more distinct but it come nearer and nearer and nearer yes the boat be evidently make for the island at last it come so near that my grandfather call out from the end of the pier -- ` hollo jem you be late my lad ' ` hollo ' say a voice from the boat but it be not jem 's voice ` whereabouts be you landing-place ' say the voice ` it be so thick i can not see ' ` why jem be not there grandfather ' i say catch hold of he arm ` no ' say my grandfather ' i know there be something wrong with the lad ' he call out to the man in the boat the direction in which he be to row and then he and i go down the step together and wait for the boat to come up there be four man in the boat they be sailor and stranger to I one of they the one whose voice we have hear get out to speak to my grandfather ` something 's wrong ' say my grandfather before he could begin ` something 's wrong with that poor lad ' ` yes ' say the man ` we have get he here and he point to the boat a cold shudder pass over I as he say this and i catch sight of something lie at the man 's foot at the bottom of the boat ` what be wrong with he have he have a accident be he much hurt ' ` he be dead ' say the man solemnly ` oh dear ' say my grandfather in a choke voice ` however shall we tell he wife however shall we tell poor mary ' -lrb- illustration : ` how do it happen ' i ask -rrb- ` how do it happen ' i ask at length as soon as i could speak ` he be get a sack of flour on board over yonder ' say one of the man in the boat ` and it be awful thick and foggy and he miss he footing on the plank and fall in that be how it happen ' ` yes ' say another man ` and it seem he could not swim and there be no boat nigh at hand to help he joe malcolmson be there and see he fall in but before he could call any of we it be all over with he we get he out at last but he be quite go we fetch a doctor and take he into a house near and rub he and do all we could but it be not of no good at all shall we bring he in ' ` wait a bit ' say my grandfather ` we must tell that poor girl first which of you will go and tell

we 'll wait here till you come back and then we can bring he in ' ` well ' say my grandfather with a groan ` i 'll go then come with I alick my lad ' say he turn to I ` but no perhaps i would better go by myself ' so he go very slowly up towards the lighthouse and i remain behind with the four man on the shore and that silent form lie at the bottom of the boat i be much frightened and feel as if it be all a very terrible dream and as if i should soon wake up to find it have all pass away chapter ix a change in the lighthouse it seem a long time before my grandfather come back and then he only say in a low voice ` you can bring he now my lad she know about it now ' and so the mournful little procession move on through the field and garden and court to the millar ' house my grandfather and i follow i shall never forget that night nor the strange solemn feeling i have then mr millar be very ill the shock have be too much for she the man go back in the boat to bring a doctor to the island to see she and the doctor send they back again to bring a nurse he say he be afraid she would have a attack of brain-fever and he think she very ill indeed my grandfather and i sit in the millar ' house all night for the nurse do not arrive until early in the morning the six child be fast asleep in they little bed i go to look at they once to see if my little timpey be all right she be lie in little polly 's bed they tiny hand fast clasp together as they sleep the tear come fast into my eye as i think that they both have lose a father and yet neither of they know anything of they loss when the nurse arrive my grandfather and i go home but we could not sleep we light the kitchen fire and sit over it in silence for a long time then my grandfather say : ` alick my lad it have give I such a turn as i have not have for many a day it might have be _ I _ alick it might just as well have be _ I _ ' i put my hand in he and grasp it very tightly as he say this ` yes ' he say again ` it might have be I and if it have i wonder where i should have be now ' i do not speak and he go on -- ' i wonder where jem be now poor fellow i have be think of that all night ever since i see he lie there at

time we be sit over there by mr millar but dear I i do not know how to get on the rock i do not indeed ' the whole of the next week poor mr millar lay between life and death at first the doctor give no hope whatever of she recovery but after a time she grow a little better and he begin to speak more encouragingly i spend my time with the poor child and hardly leave they a moment do all i could to keep they quietly happy that they might not disturb they mother one sorrowful day only my grandfather and i be absent for several hour from the lighthouse for we go ashore to follow poor jem millar to the grave he poor wife be unconscious and know nothing of what be go on when after some week the fever leave she she be still very weak and unfit for work but there be much to be do and she have no time to sit still for a new man have be appoint to take she husband 's place and he be to come into the house at the beginning of the month we feel very dull and sad the day that the millar go away we go down to the pier with they and see they on board the steamer -- mr millar the six little child and the servant-girl all dress in mourning and all of they cry they be go to mr millar 's home far away in the north of scotland where she old father and mother be still live the island seem very lonely and desolate when they be go if it have not be for we little sunbeam as my grandfather call she i do not know what we should have do every day we love she more and what we dread most be that a letter would arrive some Monday morning to tell we that she must go away from we ` dear I alick ' my grandfather would often say ` how little you and I think that stormy night what a little treasure we have get wrap up in that funny little bundle ' the child be grow fast the fresh sea do she great good and every day she become more intelligent and pretty we be very curious to know who be appoint in jem millar 's place but we be not able to find out even what he name be captain sayer say that he do not know anything about it and the gentleman who come over once or twice to see about the house be repair and put in order for the new-comer be very silent on the subject and seem to think we very inquisitive if we ask any question of course we comfort depend very much upon who we neighbor be for he and my grandfather would be constantly together and we should have no one else to speak to my grandfather be very anxious that we should give the man a welcome to the island and make he comfortable on he first arrival so we set to work as soon as the millar be go to dig up the untidy garden belong to the next house and make it as neat and pretty as we could for the new-comer ' i wonder how many of they there will be ' i say as we be at work in they garden ` maybe only just the man ' say my grandfather ` when i come here first i be a young unmarried man alick but we shall soon know all about he he 'll be here next Monday morning they say ' ` it be a wonder he have not be over before ' i say ` to see the house and the island i wonder what he 'll think of it ' ` he 'll be strange at first poor fellow say my grandfather ` but we 'll give he a bit of a welcome have a nice bit of breakfast ready for he alick my lad and for he wife and bairn too if he have any -- hot coffee and cake and a bit of meat and any thing else you like they 'll be glad of it after cross over here ' so we make we little preparation and wait very anxiously indeed for Monday 's steamer chapter x we new neighbor Monday morning come and find we stand on the pier as usual await the arrival of the steamer we be very anxious indeed to see we new neighbor a nice little breakfast for four or five people be set out in we little kitchen and i have gather a large bunch of dahlia from we garden to make the table look cheerful and bright all be ready and in due time the steamer come puff up towards the pier and we see a man standing on the deck talk to captain sayer who we feel sure must be the new lighthouse-man -lrb- illustration : ` puff puff ' say little timpey -rrb- ' i do not see a wife ' say my grandfather ` nor any child ' say i as i hold little timpey up that she might see the steamer ` puff puff puff ' she say as it come up and then turn round and laugh merrily the steamer come up to the landing-place and my grandfather and i go down the step to meet captain sayer and the stranger ` here 's you new neighbor sandy ' say the captain ` will you show he the way to he house whilst i see to you goods ' ` welcome to the island ' say my grandfather grasp he hand he be a tall

round suddenly upon he ` what be you name we have never hear it yet ' the man do not answer and my grandfather look at he in astonishment ` have you get no name ' he say ` or have you objection to folk know what you name be ' ` father ' say the man take hold of my grandfather 's hand ` do not you know you own lad ' ` why it be my david alick look alick that be you father it be indeed ' and then my grandfather fairly break down and sob like a child whilst my father grasp he tightly with one hand and put the other on my shoulder ' i would not let they tell you ' he say ' i make they promise not to tell you till i could do it myself i hear of jem millar 's death as soon as i arrive in england and i write off and apply for the place at once i tell they i be you son father and they give I it at once as soon as they hear where i have be all these year ' ` and where have you be david never to send we a line all the time ' ` well it be a long story ' say my father ` let 's come in and i 'll tell you all about it ' so we go in together and my father still look at I ` he be very like she father ' he say in a husky voice i know he mean my mother ` then you hear about poor alice ' say my grandfather ` yes ' he say ` it be a very curious thing a man from these part happen to be on board the vessel i come home in and he tell I all about it i feel as if i have no heart leave in I when i hear she be go i have just be think all the time how glad she would be to see I ' then my grandfather tell he all he could about my poor mother how she have long to hear from he and how as week after week and month after month go by and no news come she have gradually become weaker and weaker all this and much more he tell he and whenever he stop my father always want to hear more so that it be not until we be sit over the watchroom fire in the evening that my father begin to tell we he story he have be shipwreck on the coast of china the ship have go to piece not far from shore and he and three other man have escape safely to land as soon as they step on shore a crowd of chinese gather round they with anything but friendly face they be take prisoner and carry before some man who seem to be the governor of that part of the country he ask they a great many question but they do not understand a word of what he say and of course could not answer he for some day my father and the other man be very uncertain what they fate would be for the chinese at that time be exceedingly jealous of any foreigner landing on they shore however one day they be bring out of the wooden house in which they have be imprison and take a long journey of some two hundred mile into the interior of the country and here it be that my poor father have be all those year when we think he dead he be not unkindly treat and he teach the half-civilized people there many thing which they do not know and which they be very glad to learn but both by day and night he be carefully watch lest he should make he escape and he never find a single opportunity of get away from they of course there be no post and no railway in that remote place and he be quite shut out from the world of what be go on at home he know as little as if he have be live in the moon slowly and drearily eleven long year pass away and then one morning they be suddenly tell that they be to be send down to the coast and put on board a ship bind for england they tell my father that there have be a war and that one of the condition of peace be that they should give up all the foreigner in they country whom they be hold as prisoner ` well david my lad ' say my grandfather when he have finish he strange story ` it be almost like get thee back from the dead to have thee in the old home again ' chapter xi on the rock about a fortnight after my father arrive we be surprised one Monday morning by another visit from old mr davi he son-in-law have ask he to come to tell my grandfather that he have receive a letter with regard to the little girl who be save from the _ victory _ so he tell my father and I as we stand on the pier and all the way to the house i be wonder what the letter could be timpey be run by my side she little hand in mine and i could not bear to think how dull we should be when she be go ` why it be surely mr davi ' say my grandfather as he rise to meet the old gentleman ` yes ' say he ` it be mr davi and i suppose you can guess what i have come for ' ` not to take we little sunbeam sir ' say my grandfather take timpey in he arm ` you never mean to say you be go to take she away ' ` wait a bit ' say the old gentleman sit down and fumble in he pocket ` wait until you have hear this letter and then see what you think about she go ' and he begin to read as follow : my dear sir -- i be almost over power with joy by the news receive by telegram a hour ago we have hear of the loss of the _ victory _ and be mourn for we little darling as be amongst the number of those drown she mother have be

we shall sail by the next steamer for england to claim we little darling my wife be hardly strong enough to travel this week or we should come at once a thousand thanks to the brave man who save we little girl i shall hope soon to be able to thank they myself my heart be too full to write much to-day ` we child be travel home under the care of a friend as we wish she to leave indium before the hot weather set in and i be not able to leave for two month this account for the name villier not be on the list of passenger on board the _ victory _ ` thank you most sincerely for all you effort to let we know of we child 's safety ' i remain yours very truly ` edward villier ' ` now ' say the old gentleman look at I and laugh though i see a tear in he eye ` will not you let they have she ' ` well to be sure ' say my grandfather ` what can one say after that poor thing how pleased they be ` timpey ' i say take the little girl on my knee ` who do you think be come to see you you mother be come -- come to see little timpey ' the child look earnestly at I she evidently have not quite forget the name she open she blue eye wider than usual and look very thoughtful for a minute or two then she nod she head very wisely and say -- ` dear mother come to see timpey ' ` bless she ' say the old gentleman stroke she fair little head ` she seem to know all about it ' then we sit down to breakfast and whilst we be eat it old mr davi turn to I and ask if i have read the little piece of paper ` yes sir ' say my grandfather ` indeed we have read it ' and he tell he about jem millar and what he have say to I that last morning ` and now ' say my grandfather ' i wish if you would be so kind you would tell I _ how to get on the rock _ for i be on the sand now there be no doubt at all about it and i be afraid as you say the last time you be here that it will not stand the storm ' ` it would be a sad thing ' say old mr davi ` to be on the sand when the great storm come ' ` ay sir it would say my grandfather ' i often lie in bed at night and think of it when the wind and the wave be rage i call to mind that verse where it say about the sea and the wave roar and man 's heart fail they for fear deary I i should be terrible frightened that i should if that day be to come and i see the lord come in glory ' ` but you need not be afraid if you be on the rock ' say we old friend ` all who have come to christ and be rest on he will feel as safe in that day as you do when there be a storm rage and you be inside this house ' ` yes ' say my grandfather ' i see that sir but somehow i do not know what you mean by get on the rock i do not quite see it sir ' ` well ' say mr davis ` what would you do if this house be build on the sand down there by the shore and you know that the very first storm that come would sweep it away ` do sir ' say my grandfather ` why i should pull it down every stone of it and build it up on the rock instead ' ` exactly ' say mr davis ` you have be build you hope of heaven on the sand -- on you good deed on you good intention on all sort of sand-heap you know you have ` yes ' say grandfather ' i know i have ' ` well my friend ' say mr davis ` pull they all down say to yourself i be a lose man if i remain as i be my hope be all rest on the sand and then build you hope on something better something which _ will _ stand the storm build they on christ he be the only way to heaven he have die that you a poor sinner might go there build you hope on he my friend trust to what he have do for you as you only hope of heaven -- _ that _ be build on the rock ' ' i see sir i understand you now ' ` do that ' say mr davis ` and then you hope will be a sure and steadfast hope a good hope which can never be move and when the last great storm come it will not touch you you will be as certainly and as entirely safe in that day as you be in this lighthouse when the storm be rage outside because you will be build upon the immovable rock ' i can not recollect all the conversation which mr davis and my grandfather have that morning but i do remember that before he go away he kneel down with we and pray that we might every one of we be find on the rock in that last great storm and i remember also that that night when my grandfather say good-night to I he say ` alick my lad i do not mean to go to sleep to-night till i can say like poor jem millar ` on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground be sink sand ' and i believe that my grandfather keep he word chapter xii the sunbeam claim it be a cold cheerless morning the wind be blow and the rain be beat against the window it be far too wet and stormy for little timpey to be out so she and i have a game of ball together in the kitchen whilst my father and grandfather go down to the pier she look such a pretty little thing that morning she have on a little blue frock which my grandfather have buy for she and which mr millar have make before she leave the island and a clean white pinafore she be scream with delight as i throw the ball over she head and she run to catch it when the door open and my father run in ` alick be she here they have come ' ` who have come father ' i say ` little timpey 's father and mother they be come up the garden now with you grandfather he have hardly finish speaking before my grandfather come in with a lady and gentleman the lady run forward as soon as she see she child put she arm round she and hold she tightly in she bosom as if she could never part from she again then she sit down with she little darling on she knee stroke she tiny hand and talk to she and look oh so anxiously to see if the child remember she at first timpey look a little shy and hang down she head and would not look in she mother 's face but this be only for a minute as soon as she mother _ speak _ to she she evidently remember she voice and when mr villier ask she with tear in she eye -- ` do you know I little timpey my dear little timpey who be i ' the child look up and smile as she say ` dear mother -- timpey 's dear mother ' and she put up she little fat hand to stroke she mother 's face and then when i see that i could feel no longer sorry that the child be go away i can well remember what a happy morning that be mr and mr villier be so kind to we and so very grateful for all that my grandfather and i have do for they little girl they think she look so much better and stronger than when she leave indium and they be so pleased to find that she have not forget all the little lesson she have learn at home mr villier seem as if she could not take she eye off the child wherever little timpey go and whatever she be do she mother follow she and i shall never forget how happy and how glad both the father and the mother look but the most pleasant day will come to a end and in the evening a boat be to come from shore to take mr and mr villier and they child away ` dear I ' say my grandfather with a groan as he take the little girl on he knee ' i never feel so sorry to lose anybody _ never _ i be sure i do not why i call she my little sunbeam sir you 'll excuse I say so but i do not feel over and above kindly to you for take she
