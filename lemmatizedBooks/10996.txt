when he be only three year old he father take he and the rest of he family into the state of new-york to live he be a farmer and have buy a farm in southeast a town which border on the state of connecticut southeast be a wild rough and romantic place its hill be high and steep several cataract tumble over precipice and fall upon the ear with deafening noise two river call the croton and the mill river wind through the place several large pond enrich the scenery in this rude but yet delightful country enoch crosby live till he be sixteen year old he be a strong and active boy he could climb the highest hill without fatigue and walk on the brink of frightful precipice without fear he playmate admire he for he courage he always take the lead because they wish it -- they love he because he be generous and noble when enoch be sixteen year of age misfortune come upon he father the family have live comfortably they be prosperous farmer -- but _ now _ a blast come -- i know not the cause -- but it come and they be poor enoch 's father decide that he son must learn a trade it be no hardship for he to work -- this he have be accustom to in those time people labor harder than now-a-days industry be a virtue -- idleness a shame and it be hard labor and solid fare that make the man of those time so much stronger than those of the present generation enoch love labor and be willing to learn a trade but it be hard parting with friend when the day arrive that he be to go from home it be settle that he should be a _ shoemaker _ and should learn the trade of a man in a neighbouring town the morning at length come when he be to go he bundle of clothes be nicely put up by he mother and he father add a few shilling to he pocket -- and then come the blessing of he worthy parent with they good advice that he should behave well and attend to the duty of he place and say he tender mother -- a tear start from she eye which she wipe away with the corner of she lindsey-woolsey while she speak -- ` you _ bible _ enoch you will find in you bundle -- do not forget _ that _ -- and you must pray for we -- my son -- ' she could say no more -- and enoch could hear no more without even bid they ` farewell ' -- for he heart be too full for that -- he shoulder he little pack and take he way down the lane which lead to the road he be to take at a few rod distance he stop to take one more look of the old place so dear to he he mother be stand at the window she have feel the full tenderness of a mother for he before -- but he love of home -- he pause -- he gaze -- he tear -- now almost overwhelm she -lrb- illustration -rrb- enoch catch a glimpse of he mother and see she agony he could trust himself no longer -- and summon he energy hurry over the hill which soon hide the scene of he youth from he view in after year -- many year after -- even when he become a old man he would speak of this scene with deep feeling he could never forget it he say he feel for a time alone in the world -- cut off from all he hold dear i do not wonder say gen p that he feel much for well do _ i _ remember the pain i feel _ the first time leave home _ chapter ii gen p tell about the war and how enoch crosby enlist as a soldier for one campaign _ gen p _ before night enoch reach he new home he countenance have somewhat brighten yet he heart feel sad for some day on the follow morning he master introduce he into the shop he have a seat assign he provide with awl thread wax and the more solid but equally needful companion a _ lapstone _ enoch prove a good apprentice at first the confinement be irksome he have be use to the open air -- to the active exercise of the field -- to the free healthful breeze of the mountain it be tiresome to sit all day in a confine shop but he make himself contented and in a little time find he employment quite pleasant _ john _ do not he want to see he mother _ gen p _ doubtless he do he would not be likely to forget she and i hope he do not neglect she good advice and when permission be give he he go home to visit he friend and always with delight in 1771 the apprenticeship of enoch end he be now twenty-one year old -- a man grow -- industrious -- honest -- and ready to begin business for himself old mr crosby be a strong whig -- a man of reading and information -- one who take a deep interest in the welfare of he country about the time that enoch first leave home to learn he trade the trouble of america begin with england the king and he minister become jealous of the american they think they grow too fast -- ` they will soon ' say they ` become proud and wish to be free and independent -- we must tax they -- we must take away they money this will keep they poor and humble ' those thing use often to be talk over at old mr crosby 's the neighbor would sometimes happen in there of a winter 's evening to spend a hour or two -- the minister -- the schoolmaster -- and other -- and although southeast be a retired place the conduct of the ` mother country ' as england be call be pretty well understand there and justly censure old mr crosby especially condemn the conduct of england he say for one he do not wish to be trample on ` they have no right to tax we ' say he -- ` it be unjust -- it be cruel -- and for myself i be ready to say i will not submit to it and mark my word the time will come when the people will defend themselves and when that time come i hope ' say he -- look round upon he son especially upon enoch -- ' i hope my boy will not shame they father -- no not they ' enoch think much of he father he be a grave man -- one who sit steady in he chair when he talk -- and talk so slowly and so emphatic as always to be hear enoch though a boy listen -- he be _ then _ interested -- and as he grow older and be at home occasionally on a visit and these subject be discuss -- he take a still deeper interest and would sometimes even mingle in the animated talk round the fire side of he father and then there be time too when he be seat on he bench think over what he have hear or sit listen to some customer of he master who happen in on a rainy day -- and who have see the last paper which give a account of some new attempt to oppress the colony -- at such time he would almost wish himself a soldier and in the field fight for he country and then the hammer it be observe would come down upon he lapstone with double force as if he be splitting the head of one of the enemy open or he awl would go through the leather as if he be plunge a bayonet into the belt of a soldier -lrb- illustration -rrb- such be the workings of enoch crosby 's mind -- the work of preparation be go on there -- the steam be gradually rise -- and though he realize it not -- he be fitting to become a zealous and active soldier in he country 's service on the 5th of march 1770 nearly a year before enoch 's time be out the ` boston massacre ' happen _ henry _ the ` boston massacre ' father -- pray what be that _ gen p _ william you know the story i trust -- can you tell it to you brother _ william _ i have read about it but i do not know well how to tell it will you tell it father _ gen p _ tell it as well as you be able my son it be by practice that we learn to do thing well _ william _ one evening some british soldier be near a ropewalk in boston a man who work in the ropewalk say something to they which they do not like and they beat he three day after on the 5th of march while the soldier be under arm some of they be insult by the citizen and one it be say be strike this soldier be so angry that he fire then six other fire three citizen be kill and five be wound all boston be soon rouse the bell be ring many thousand people assemble and they say that they would tear the soldier to piece and i do not know but that they would have do so if gov hutchinson have not come out and tell the people that he would inquire into the matter and have the guilty punish this pacify they _ gen p _ well do -- quite well do master william you now know henry what be mean by the ` boston massacre ' _ henry _ it be a bloody affair i think _ gen p _ bloody indeed -- inhuman and highly provoke the news of it spread -- spread rapidly in every direction the country be fill with alarm war be see to be almost certain such a insult -- such a crime could not be forget even at phillipstown where crosby be at he trade the story be tell it rouse _ he _ spirit he think of what he father have say and he be even now desirous to enlist as a soldier to avenge the slaughter american the next year -- in January i think it be -- enoch 's time be out he leave he master and go to live at danbury connecticut where he work at he trade as a journeyman and here he continue for several year during this time the difficulty between england and america increase the king and he minister grow more haughty and oppressive the american wax more firm and confident several event tend to make the breach wider and wider the british parliament tax the american -- next the people of boston throw into the sea a large quantity of tea belong to people in england because a tax be lay upon it then by way of revenge for this the parliament order that no vessel should enter boston harbor or leave it and finally the king send a large body of english soldier to america to watch the people here and force they to submission thing now become quite unsettled the american feel injure -- they be provoke -- nothing be before they but war or slavery this latter they could not bear they scorn to be slave besides they see no reason why they should be slave they know war be a great evil but it be better than slavery and now they begin to talk about it and to act in view of it in almost every town -- especially in new england -- the young man be enrol that be be form into company and be daily exercise in order to make they good soldier these be call ' _ minute man _ ' _ henry _ why be they call ' _ minute man _ ' father _ gen p _ because they stand ready to march at a _ minute _ warn should occasion require _ john _ be enoch crosby a minute man _ gen p _ no he be not but he stand ready to enlist at any time when he service be need we will now pass on to the year 1775 in April of that year occur the famous battle of lexington a party of british troops have be send from boston to destroy some military store belong to the american at concord north of boston on they way thither they come to lexington and here they fire upon a small company of american and kill several it be a cruel act -- worthy only of savage but it rouse the american in that part of the country and they immediately send express -- that be man on horseback -- to carry the tiding abroad one of these express be direct to take he course for danbury and to speed he flight on he arrival he tell the story it produce alarm -- and well it might but it also produce resolution the bell be ring -- cannon be fire -- drum beat to arm within a few hour many people have assemble -- the young and the old -- all eager to do something for they country one hundred and fifty young man come forward and enter they name as soldier -- choose a captain benedict to lead they -- and beg that they might go forth to the war enoch crosby be _ the first man _ that enter he name on this occasion not long after the regiment to which crosby belong march to the city of new-york here they be join by other company and sail up hudson 's river to assist in take canada from the british a short time before this ticonderoga a fortress on lake champlain have be surprise by col ethan allen and he troops and to they it have surrender this be a important post great rejoicing take place among the american when it be know that this fort have fall into they hand the troop to which crosby be attach pass this fort and proceed to st john a british fort 115 mile north of ticonderoga this fort it be determine to attack the troops be therefore land and preparation be make they number be one thousand -- all young man -- brave -- ardent -- resolute be form in order of battle the intrepid officer lead they to the attack as they advance the gun of the fort pour in upon they a tremendous fire this they meet manfully and though some fall the other seem the more determine but just as they be begin the attack in good earnest a conceal body of indian rise upon they and the appalling war whoop break upon they ear -lrb- illustration -rrb- this savage yell they have never before hear -- such a sight they have never before witness for a moment alarm spread through the rank but courage -- action be now necessary death or victory be before they the officer call they to rally -- to stand they ground -- and they do so they open a well direct fire upon they savage foe and only a short time pass before the latter be glad to retreat the savage have retire the man be order to throw up a breast work near the place to shelter themselves from the gun of the fort this be do expeditiously tree be fell and draw to the spot by some while other be employ in throw up earth during these labor of the american the enemy continue to annoy they by throw shell from the fort _ william _ pray father what be shell i have read of they but i do not know more than that they be a kind of shot _ gen p _ shell be often call _ bomb _ a word which signify _ great noise _ because when they burst they make a great noise they consist of a large shell of cast iron which be round and hollow a hole be make through the shell to receive a _ fusee _ as it be call this be a small pipe or hollow piece of wood which be fill with some combustible matter when a bomb be about to be fire it be fill with powder after which the fusee be drive into the vent or hole of the shell _ william _ how be bomb fire father _ gen p _ they be throw from a kind of cannon call a _ mortar _ it have its name from its resemblance to a common mortar the lower part of the mortar be call the _ chamber _ which contain the powder when fire the powder in the chamber not only send the bomb but at the same time set fire to the fusee which continue to burn slowly as it pass through the air and the calculation always be to have the fire from the fusee reach the powder in the shell _ at the moment the latter reach the ground _ it then burst and the scattering fragment of iron often do horrible execution _ william _ do you say father that mortar be _ short _ gun _ gen p _ land mortar be quite short sea mortar or such as be use on board vessel be longer and heavier because they be usually fire at greater distance a land mortar which will throw a shell thirteen inch in diameter weigh thirteen hundred weight the weight of the shell be about one hundred and seventy-five pound it contain between nine and ten pound of powder and be fire by means of about the same quantity of powder _ william _ pray father who invent bomb _ gen p _ the inventor be not know they have be in use since the year 1634 some year after the above affair crosby himself relate the manner in which the soldier contrived to escape unhurt when a shell rise in the air every one would stop work and watch its course to ascertain whether it would fall near he if it appear to approach so near as to endanger any one he would dodge behind something till it have burst or pass by _ john _ father could a soldier dodge a cannon ball _ henry _ why john i should think you know enough not to ask so foolish a question _ gen p _ not so bad a question neither master henry under some circumstance a cannon ball might he avoid _ william _ not when it be first fire father _ gen p _ true but when it have nearly spend its force a person might easily get out of its way but even when a ball only roll along the ground apparently slow it would be dangerous to attempt to stop it : especially if large i recollect to have read of a soldier who see a ball roll towards he which he think to stop with he foot but poor fellow it break he leg in a instant some of the american soldier at st john be too intent upon they labor to pay much attention to the shell crosby be one all on a sudden a fellow-soldier near by call out in a tone of thunder ` crosby look out take care take care ' crosby look up and directly over he a shell be descend -lrb- illustration -rrb- he have but a minute to think -- he drop flat upon the ground and the shell just pass over he ' a miss ' think he ` be as good as a mile ' but he say after _ such a warn _ he keep one eye upon the enemy the rude fortification be soon complete and serve as a shelter till night when the american troops silently depart take to they boat the next day they reach the _ isle aux noix _ _ william _ be not that a french name _ gen p _ yes my son -- a name give to the island while the french have possession of it do you know where it lie _ william _ it be a small island near the northern extremity of lake champlain _ gen p _ right it be pronounced _ eel-o-nwar _ and signify the _ island of nut _ _ john _ do the people find walnut there father _ gen p _ some kind of nut doubtless my son but whether walnut or hazel nut or some other kind i be unable to say _ henry _ pray john do not ask so many foolish question i want to hear the story _ gen p _ but you would wish you brother to know the _ reason _ of thing would you not master henry it be quite a proper question and one it seem none of we can answer we must examine the point some time and let master john know the american troops have not be long a this island before many of they be take sick and send to the hospital crosby be of the number but he have no idea of confinement in a few day he resolve to join the army again to this the surgeon remonstrate it might be he death he say but the valiant soldier could not be persuade and again appear at camp ` what ' exclaim capt benedict when he see he ` have you get back crosby i never expect to see you again you look too ill to be here you would make a better _ scare-crow _ than soldier i fancy just now ' ` well captain say crosby ` if i be a scare-crow i can _ frighten _ the enemy if i can not _ fight _ they -- so i shall be of some service ' _ john _ well father do they hang up crosby for a scare-crow _ henry _ why you simpleton john do not you know better _ gen p _ crosby be quite ill but he resolution make he forget how feeble he be he be a scare-crow to the enemy in a different way from that which capt benedict mean a battle soon come on and before night enoch crosby be march into the enemy 's fort to the tune of yankee doodle to assist in take care of the prisoner _ john _ but i think he be too ill to fight _ gen p _ a soldier at such a time and such a soldier as crosby would be likely to forget he weakness he go bravely through the day and from that time rapidly regain he health success now follow the american troops and in November montreal be take the time for which crosby have enlist have now expire and he conclude to return home accordingly he embark with several other in a small schooner for crown point twelve mile north of ticonderoga thence they come by land to this latter place from which they proceed home ward for some distance by water and then by land they rout lay through a wilderness it be now winter and the cold be intense provision be scarce comfortable lodgings be not to be find they prospects be often gloomy and they distress indescribable at length however they reach they respective home after a short stay with he friend crosby once more return to danbury and again betook himself to the peaceful occupation of shoemake chapter iii gen p tell how crosby again enlist as a soldier and of he singular adventure _ gen p _ crosby be well contented for a time to pursue he occupation he have see hard service in the northern campaign and need rest during the follow summer however he patriotic feeling begin again to stir within he the war be go on with redoubled fury the british have in several instance gain the advantage the american need more soldier and it be think that unless the friend of liberty come forward -- promptly come the british arm might succeed it be not in such a man as enoch crosby to seek ease or shun danger in the hour of he country 's trial he see other make sacrifice -- woman as well as man -- youth as well age -- and he scorn to have it say that he could not make sacrifice as well as other he musket be therefore take down and fitting on he knapsack he take up he march towards the head quarter of the american army on the hudson in a few day he reach the _ neutral ground _ and -- _ william _ pray father may i interrupt you to inquire what be mean by the ` neutral ground _ gen p _ i will explain it to you at this time -lrb- sept 1776 -rrb- the head quarter of the british army be in the city of new york the american army lay up the hudson fifty or sixty mile either at or near west point between the two army therefore be the county of west chester the center of which be occupy by neither be call the ` neutral ground ' but in reality it be far from be a neutral spot _ william _ why not father if neither the british nor the american occupy it _ gen p _ because my son it be here that a great number of tory reside -- the worst enemy which the american have to contend with _ henry _ worse than the british father _ gen p _ in several respects worse the tory in general be quite as unfriendly to american liberty as the british themselves and besides live in the country and be acquaint with it they could do even more injury than stranger many of this description of person live on the ` neutral ground ' and what be worse they often pretend to be whig -- and pass for such -- but in _ secret _ do all in they power to injure they country crosby as i tell you have reach a part of this ground on he way to the american camp it be just at evening that he fall in with a stranger who appear to be pass in the same direction with himself ` good evening ' say the stranger -- ` which way be you travel -- below ' _ william _ which way be that _ gen p _ towards new-york the british be sometimes call the ' _ lower party _ ' -- the american the ' _ upper party _ ' because the latter lay north of the former the stranger mean to ascertain which party crosby be go to join _ henry _ and do crosby tell he _ gen p _ no : he reply that he be too much fatigue to go much farther that evening either above or below but he believe he should join himself to a bed could he find one ` well ' say the stranger ` listen to I it will soon be dark -- go with I -- i live but a short distance from this -- you shall be welcome ' crosby thank he and say he would gladly accept he kind invitation ` allow I to ask ' say the soldier ` you advice as to the part which a true friend of he country should take in these time ' ` do i understand you ' inquire the stranger -- he keen eye settle on the steady countenance of crosby -- ` do you wish to know which party a real patriot should join ' ' i do ' say crosby ` well you look like one to be trust -- ' ' i hope i be honest ' reply crosby ` why ' observe the stranger ` one mu 'n' t say much about _ oneself _ in these day but -- but -- some of my _ neighbor _ would advise you to join the _ lower _ party ' ` why so ' ask crosby ` why friend they read that we must submit to the power that be and besides they think king george be a good friend to america notwithstanding all that be say against he ' ` could you introduce I to some of you neighbor of this way of think ' ask crosby ` with all my heart ' reply the stranger ' i understand they be about form a company to go below and i presume they would be glad to have you join they ' ' i do not doubt it ' observe crosby ` well friend ' say the stranger ` say nothing -- rest yourself to night and in the morning i will put you in the way to join we -- _ the _ company ' by this time they have reach the stranger 's dwelling it be a farm house situate a short distance from the main road -- retired but quite neat and comfortable in its appearance here the soldier be make welcome by the host and he family after a refreshing supper crosby excuse himself -- be soon asleep -- and ` sleep well ' _ john _ be that man a tory father _ henry _ why john you know he be it be as clear as day _ gen p _ yes my son he _ be _ a tory -- in heart a firm tory -- but he intend to be cautious he intend to ascertain if possible which side crosby favor before he express he own view but when crosby ask to be introduce to some of he neighbor he conclude that if _ urge _ he would go below -- and after this be more unreserved _ william _ do crosby tell he that he would go below _ gen p _ no no he only ask to be introduce to some of the tory _ henry _ but do he not do wrong to conceal he opinion _ gen p _ certainly not a person be not under obligation to tell all about he opinion to every one when a man speak he should indeed tell that which be true but he be not bind unless under certain circumstance to tell the _ whole _ truth crosby i say sleep well in the morning a better breakfast than usual grace the farmer 's table and the keen appetite of the soldier after a good night 's rest do it honor when breakfast be over crosby remind he host of he last night 's promise to introduce he to some of he neighbor thereabout -- particularly to those who be about form a company ` true ' say the farmer ' i will accompany you they will welcome such a soldier-like look lad as yourself they like man of bone and muscle ' in a walk of a few mile they see quite a number of the friend of the royal cause crosby be introduce as one who be desirous of serve he country and as willing to hear what could be say in favor of join they standard they have much to say -- many argument to support they way of thinking and strongly do they urge crosby to go with they as he be introduce by the farmer who be know to be a true tory they talk without disguise -- tell they plan -- speak of the company which be form -- and particularly of a meeting which they be to hold a few night from that time and now say they ` come and join we ' crosby tell they that he should think of they proposition and rather think that he should contrive to pay they a visit at the appoint time little do they think what sort of a visit the soldier be plan in the course of a couple of day crosby have gain all the information he wish and now determine to depart he tell the farmer therefore on the morning of the third day that it be not worth while for he to wait longer -- he have a strong wish to join the army and believe that he should go along the farmer say some thing by way of persuade crosby to wait a day or two when the company would meet and then he could enlist and go with they to this crosby reply that unexpected delay might occur and he think it would be better for he to proceed -- ` but ' say he as he shake hand with the unsuspicious farmer and bid he farewell ' i shall doubtless have the pleasure of see the company ' and add ` it be my intention to _ join _ they at -- ' ` very well very well ' interrupt the farmer -- he eye brighten at he success in have as he think make crosby a convert to the royal cause ' i hope it will be well ' -- whisper crosby to himself as he walk down the lane which lead to the road -- ' i will try to join they but may be in a manner not so agreeable to they ' on reach the road to avoid the mischief which might come upon he if he go directly north -- he take the road lead to new-york but from this soldier like he soon file off and cross a thicket shape he course northerly towards the american camp he be soon beyond harm and now travel at he ease he have hear of a mr young who live at a distance in a direction somewhat different from that which he be take and as he be say to be a true whig -- he conclude to repair to he and to concert measure to take the company of tory at the time of they meeting with this resolution he again alter he course so as to strike the road lead to mr young 's unexpected difficulty however impede he course -- hill wood stream and before he reach the house it be near midnight it so happen fortunately that mr young be still up although he family have all retire a light be still burn and crosby make for the door which lead into the room where mr young sit he give a gentle rap at the door which be soon cautiously open -- _ cautiously _ because it be now late -- and in those time no one know when he be safe the light fall on crosby 's face and the search eye of mr young follow ` sir ' say crosby in haste to make he excuse ' i understand you be a true friend to you country and i have important -- ' ` come in come in ' say mr young -- the expression of crosby 's face carry more conviction of honesty than word could do -- ` come in -- you travel late -- ' ' i have reason for it ' reply the now animated soldier -- ' i be tell you be a friend to the upper party -- i have something to tell you which may be important ` what be it ' ask mr young ` sir ' say crosby -- ` do you know the character of the people who live around you ' ' i think i do ' say mr young ` they be traitor ' say crosby ` many be -- too many ' say mr young -- ` but they pass for friend and it be difficult to discriminate -- difficult to bring they to justice ' ` well ' say crosby ' i have the means of point they out i have be among they -- i know they -- i know they plan -- and -- ' ` can you give I they name ' eagerly inquire mr young -- at the same time rise from he seat ' i can do more ' rejoin crosby -- and then he go on to relate the interview which he have have -- and about the contemplated meeting of the company two night follow -- ` and ' say the soldier ` if you will assist I we will _ join _ they as i promise and make they march to the tune of good old ` yankee doodle ' instead of ` god save the king ' ` with all my heart ' exclaim mr young -- take down he hat -- ` no time be to be lose -- the committee of safety be at white plain -- they must know it to-night ' _ william _ ` the committee of safety ' father who be they _ gen p _ you inquiry be well suggest the committee of safety consist of man of distinction friendly to the liberty of they country they be appoint in almost every district throughout the land it be they business to watch over the interest of the country in they vicinity to obtain information and when necessary to seize upon suspect person _ william _ who be the committee at white plain _ gen p _ the principal man be john jay who afterwards go ambassador to england mr young and crosby be soon on they way to white plain which lay but a few mile distant crosby be not a little fatigued but he zeal be now all alive and make he quite forget he weariness it be near two o'clock before they reach the quarter of mr jay he be soon summon and listen with deep interest to the tale of crosby it be important intelligence -- precisely the information desire he say and he promise at early dawn to call the committee together and consult what should be do mr young and crosby now retire to a neighbouring inn but the door be fasten and the landlord be fast lock in sleep they rap at the door and call and as you say master henry when you speak monsieur tonson -- ` and loud indeed be they oblige to bawl ere they could rouse the torpid lump of clay ' the door however be at length open and after receive a growl from

over he -- he father he love he -- revere he -- but he could not explain -- it would not do -- he therefore only reply that god be he judge and the time might come when thing would appear otherwise than they do in the midst of this conversation -- painful and unsatisfactory to both the drum sound ` the roll ' and crosby have time only to press the hand of he old friend which he do with affection he be soon on he way -- sadly depress for a time lest he father should hear he story without the appropriate explanation but he comfort himself that he be do he duty to he country -- and perhaps think

advice to he be to run the hazard of a attempt by night in the best way he could contrive and should he be so fortunate as to escape he might find a safe retreat with a mr -- who live at some distance crosby at length thought of a plan near the north-west corner of the church be a window from which he contrived to draw the fastening so that he could open it near this window stand a large willow tree whose deep shade would conceal he till he could have opportunity to escape unobserved the night at length approach in which he determine to put he plan into execution but what if he should fail -- it might be the last of he earthly existence about dark the sentinel be station as usual round the house they be four in number before midnight all be still officer and soldier be asleep crosby

a sentinel be at no great distance for a moment he stop -- arrest by the noise -- he even turn -- listen -- look -- but all be now silent there -- and think himself mistaken he sing aloud ' _ all 's well _ ' and onward he march still farther from the place of crosby 's concealment now think he be the moment -- the only moment perhaps which i shall have creep on he hand and foot he reach the grave yard a stone 's throw from the church and here behind a tombstone succeed in loose he chain when this be do he watch the moment to make he escape a thick swamp he know be at no great distance but the darkness of the night make haste dangerous yet in rapidity lay he only hope he prepare therefore to run the hazard and seize the moment when the sentinel have turn in a opposite direction he bound forth and flee -- a ball pass he before he have reach many rod -- and now another -- and still another -- yet a merciful providence protect he and before the garrison could be rouse he be wallow deep in the mud of a swamp -- but he be safe -- quite safe from pursuer -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter vi gen p tell about crosby 's visit to a mountain cave -- how he be again take prisoner -- and the

bush and brier and quagmire impede he course and several time he be on the point of give up the effort and wait till day light by slow degree however he go forward -- sometimes indeed sink unexpectedly deep into the mud or when he think himself firm on a bog -- slide away and come down upon all fours at length it be he good fortune to emerge from the thicket in a hour or so from which he knock at the door of the gentleman to whom he have be refer by the committee of safety mr -- have be inform that he might be expect that night and be accordingly still up a good supper be in readiness for he and heartily do the gentleman congratulate he on he escape when he have finish he meal -- ` well ' say the gentleman ' i have a important message to deliver to you ' ` what be it '

direction and at a late breakfast hour the next morning come to a farm house the kind mistress of which give he a comfortable meal for several day from this time crosby wander round the country without any certain object he greatly wish for a interview with the committee of safety but the attempt he find would be hazardous until the troops in the immediate neighborhood of fishkill should be send on some expedition at a distance this be a gloomy period for crosby although conscious of toiling in a good cause and of promote the interest of he country -- somehow he feel alone -- not a friend have he to whom he could unbosom he care -- and often be he houseless and in want besides he begin to be know -- to be suspect and the double and treble caution which he find it necessary to exercise make he employment almost a burden while mature some plan by which he could effect a interview with the committee of safety he call just at evening at a farm house and request a night 's lodging this be readily grant he and he lay aside he pack thankful to find a rest place after the toil of the day it be not long before two very large man arm with musket enter the house one of they start on see crosby and whisper something to he companion to which the latter apparently assent then turn to crosby -- ' i have see you before i think sir ' say he ` probably ' reply crosby ` though i can not say that i recollect you ' ` perhaps not -- but i be sure you be not long since at fishkill ha ' -lrb- illustration -rrb- ` the very fellow ' exclaim the other -- ` you recollect how he escape -- seize he ' in a moment the strong hand of the first be lay upon he and he grasp be the grasp of a anakim -- and though crosby might have be a match for he alone -- prudence forbid resistance -- they be two -- he be but one -- they be arm with musket -- he have no weapon about he ` to-morrow ' say the principal ` you shall go to head quarter where my word for it you 'll swing without much ceremony the committee will never take the trouble to try you again and townsend declare that he wish only to come once more within gun shot of you ' ` be it so ' ask crosby ` even so ' -- reply the stranger -- ` you time be short ' crosby be seldom alarm -- but _ now _ he could perceive real danger could he be fairly try he might escape -- but to be deliver into townsend 's hand and perhaps the committee of safety at a distance -- he might indeed come to harm he have _ one _ resort -- he could show he _ pass _ and it might save he accordingly draw it forth he present it to he captor ` read that ' say he ` and then say whether i be worthy of death ' astonishment sit on the countenance of both while they read the pass when it be finish the principal observe ' i be satisfied -- we have be deceive -- other be deceive also -- you be at liberty to go where you please this be the hand-writing of mr jay -- i know it well ' crosby might perhaps have staid where he be through the night -- but he feeling be such that he prefer to seek other lodgings accordingly shoulder he pack he set forth in quest of a rest place which at the distance of a couple of mile he be so fortunate as to obtain but he be destine to other trouble scarcely have he lay aside he pack and take a seat near a comfortable fire before a man enter whom he be sure that he have see before at the same time the stranger cast upon he a eye of deep scrutiny and increase severity ' a cool evening abroad ' -- observe crosby the stranger make no reply -- but spring upon he foot dart upon he like a fiend ` now i know you ' -- exclaim he -- ' i think it be you you be the villain who betray we to the committee of safety clear out from the house quickly or i 'll call one of my neighbor who say that if he ever see you again he 'll suck you very heart 's blood ' ` ah ' say crosby quite calm and collect -- ` perhaps ' -- ` leave this house instantly ' -- vociferate the man now nearly choke with rage -- ` but before you go take one pound ' ' a pound ' exclaim crosby in contempt -- ` come then ' -- rise like a lion from he lair -- ` come ' -- say he at the same time roll up he sleeve and show a pair of fist which resemble a trip-hammer for hardness ` come on and i 'll try you a pull ' -- the muscle of he arm contracting and lie out like cart-rope the whole length -- from shoulder to wrist -- and he countenance at the same time look as terrific as a madman 's -- ` come on ' say he -lrb- illustration -rrb- ` why we-we-ll -- upon the whole ' -- say the man -- ` i -- i -- think i 'll let you off if you 'll
