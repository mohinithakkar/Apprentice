many time but the really great man i have omit i mean the really really great man without whom the war could not possibly go on and with whom i be often lead to suppose the decision remain as to what day peace shall be declare take the amlo at -- for example now charle be it understand that i be not say anything for or against the trade of assist military landing officer i have no feeling with regard to it one way or the other for all i know it may require a technical knowledge so profound that any man who can master it be already half-way on the road to greatness on the other hand it may require no technical knowledge at all and the whole of a military landing officer 's duty be limit to watch other people work the assistant military landing officer 's task may consist of nothing more complicated than watch the military landing officer watch the military land if this be so the work may be so simple that once a man have satisfy the very rigid social test to be pass by all aspirant to so distinguish a position he must simply be a silly ass if he do not automatically become a great man after a walk or two up and down the quay i repeat i know nothing whatever of the calling of amlo and i could not tell you without inquiry whether it be a ancient and honorable profession or a unscrupulous trade very jealously watch by the law i have some friend in it and i have many friend out of it and the former should not be inflate with conceit nor the latter unduly depress when i pronounce the deliberate opinion that the best know and greatest thing in the bef be without doubt the amlo at -- though it be month since i cast eye on he i can see he now stand self-confidently on he own private quay with the most chic of virginian cigarette smoulder between he aristocratic lip and the very latest and most elegant of bond street khaki neckwear distinguish he from the mixed crowd about he every one else be distraught even mature general use to the simple and irresponsible task of command troops in action be a little unnerved by the difficulty and intricacy of embark oneself militarily he on whom all the responsibility rest remain aloof a smile half cynical play across he proud face he know he have but to flick the ash from he cigarette and the army will spring to attention and the navy will get feverishly to work he have but to express consent by the inclination of he head and siren will blow turbine engine will operate as they would never operate for anybody else thousand of ton of shipping will rearrange itself and even the sea will become less obstreperous and more circumspect in its demeanor adjust if need be its tide to suit he wish i take it my condition be typical when i be proceeding -lrb- one will never come and go again in we time one will always proceed -rrb- -- when i be proceed to the uk the whole thing be too good to believe and i do not believe it till i have some write and omnipotent instruction in my pocket and be actually move towards the sea the youngest and keenest schoolboy return home for he holiday be a calm collect impassionate and even dismal man of the world compare to I i see little and be impress by nothing all thing and man be assume to be good and none of they be give the opportunity of prove itself to be the contrary as for the amlo at any other port but this one i remark nothing about he except he princely generosity in let I have a embarcation card he be just one more good fellow in the long series of good fellow who have authorise my move i be bear out to sea in a dream -- a dream of england and all that england mean to we be that a wife or a reasonable breakfast at a reasonable hour not until i be on my way back do it occur to I that landing and transport officer have identity and by that time i have lose all interest in transport and landing and officer and identity and everything else at the port of -- however it be very different i may arrive on the quay in a dream but i be at once out of it when i have catch sight of greatness sit in its little hut with the ticket window firmly close until the arrival of the hour before which he have dispose that it shall not open thought of home be go i can think of nothing but he when at last i have obtain he gracious if reluctant consent to my obey the instruction i have and have get on to the boat i deposit my goods hurriedly anywhere and fight for a position by the bulwark nearest the quay from which i may gaze at he August excellency for the few remain hour during which it be give we to linger in or near we well-beloved france how come it about i ask myself that the right man get to be in the right place it can not have be merely fortuitous that he be not thrust away into some such obscure job as the command of a expeditionary force or the control of the counsel of the imperial general staff it must have be the deliberate choice of a wise chooser major-general military landing himself the secretary of state for war on he own even he majesty in person or be a plebiscite take through the length and breadth of the british isle when i be elsewhere and do britain thrill to the core clamor for he unanimously i watch he keep a perturb and restless major from the line wait while he finish he light-hearted badinage with a subordinate it be altogether magnificent in its sheer _ sangfroid _ why be it that such a one be label merely amlo when he should obviously be the mlo he have he subordinate happily insignificant and obsequiously proud to serve let the subordinate be the amlo and let it itself be openly acknowledge to be it

little of the conversation of wicker-chair which usually turn upon the last person to be seat in they but other furniture be more self-centered on the night with which we be now concern the first remark be make by the clock who state with a clarity only equal by he brevity that it be one a hour later he would probably be twice as voluble it be normally the signal for a outburst of comment and confidence but let I first say that the house in which this sitting-room be situate belong to a elderly gentleman and he wife each conspicuous for peaceable kindliness neither would hurt a fly but since they have grandson fight for england honor and the world it chance that they be the incongruous possessor of quite a number of war relic which include a inkstand make of a steel shell-top copper shell-binding and cartridge-case a turkish dud from gallipolus to serve as a door-stop a pencil-case make of a austrian cartridge from the carso a cigarette-lighter make of english cartridge-case and several shell-case transform into vase for flower one of these at this moment contain some very beautiful late sweet pea and the old gentleman have make a pleasant little joke after dinner about sweet peace blossom in such a strange environment and would probably make it again the next time they have guest you may be sure that with the arrival of these souvenir from such exciting part the conversation of the room become more interesting although it may be that some of the stay-at-home begin after a while to feel a little out in the cold what be a ordinary table to say when in competition with a 75 shell-case from the battle of the marne or a mere jubilee wedding-present against a inkstand compose of article of destruction from vimy ridge which have a irritating way of make the most of both its existence -- reap in two field -- by remark after a thrilling story of bloodshed but that be all behind I now my new destiny be to prove the pen mightier than the sword even though the jubilee wedding-present come from bond street and have once be pick up and set down again by queen alexandra what avail that the souvenir hold the floor gradually the other occupant of the room have come to let the souvenir uninterruptedly exchange war impression and speculate as to how long it would last -- a problem as to which they be not more exactly inform than many a human wiseacre under cover of this kind of talk which be apt to become noisy the humdrum of the other the chair and the table and the mantelpiece and the pacific ornament and the mirror could chat in they own mild way the wicker-chair for example could wonder for the thousandth time how long it would be before the young captain sit in it once more and the mirror could remark that that would be a happy moment indeed when once again it hold the reflection of the lieutenant and he _ fiancée _ who be one of the prettiest girl in the world do you think so the knob of the brass fender would inquire to I she seem too fat and she mouth be very wide but that be a fault the tong would reply that you find with every one to return to the night of which i want particularly to speak no sooner have the clock make he monosyllabic utterance than i be probably unique the vimy ridge inkstand say how the cigarette-lighter sharply inquire uniqueness be one of he own chief claim to distinction strange say the
