bigger typeof man i reckon all these problem air jest ornery like the weed they grow in soil that oughta nourish only decent deed a ' they waste we time a ' fret we when if we be thinkin ' straight a ' livin ' right they would not be so terrible a ' great a good horse need no snaffle a ' a good man i opine do not need a law to check he or to force he into line if we ever start in teachin ' to we child year by year how to live with one another there 'll be less o ' trouble here if we would teach 'em how to neighbor a ' to walk in honor 's way we could settle every problem which the mind o ' man can raise what we be needin ' be not system or some regulatin ' plan but a bigger a ' a finer a ' a truer type o ' man a boy and he dad a boy and he dad on a fishing-trip -- there be a glorious fellowship father and son and the open sky and the white cloud lazily drift by and the laughing stream as it run along with the click reel like a martial song and the father teach the youngster gay how to land a fish in the sportsman 's way i fancy i hear they talk there in a open boat and the speech be fair and the boy be learn the way of man from the finest man in he youthful ken king to the youngster can not compare with the gentle father who be with he there and the greatest mind of the human race not for one minute could take he place which be happier man or boy the soul of the father be steep in joy for he be find out to he heart 's delight that he son be fit for the future fight he be learn the glorious depths of he and the thought he think and he every whim and he shall discover when night come on how close he have grow to he little son a boy and he dad on a fishing-trip -- oh i envy they as i see they there under the sky in the open air for out of the old old long-ago come the summer day that i use to know when i learn life 's truth from my father 's lip as i share the joy of he fishing-trip -- builder of life 's companionship if i have youth if i have youth i would bid the world to try I i would answer every challenge to my will and though the silent mountain should defy I i would try to make they subject to my skill i would keep my dream and follow where they lead I i would glory in the hazard which abound i would eat the simple fare privation feed I and gladly make my couch upon the ground if i have youth i would ask no odds of distance nor wish to tread the known and level way i would want to meet and master strong resistance and in a worth-while struggle spend my day i would seek the task which call for full endeavor i would feel the thrill of battle in my vein i would bear my burden gallantly and never desert the hill to walk on common plain if i have youth no thought of failure lurk beyond to-morrow 's dawn should fright my soul let failure strike -- it still should find I work with faith that i should some day reach my goal i would dice with danger -- aye -- and glory in it i would make high stake the purpose of my throw i would risk for much and should i fail to win it i would not ever whimper at the blow if i have youth no chain of fear should bind I i would brave the height which older man must shun i would leave the well-worn lane of life behind I and seek to do what man have never do rich prize wait for those who do not waver the world need man to battle for the truth it call each hour for stronger heart and braver this be the age for those who still have youth look back i might have be rich if i would want the gold instead of the friendship i have make i might have have fame if i would seek for renown in the hour when i purposely play now i be stand to-day on the far edge of life and i be just look backward to see what i have do with the year and the day that be mine and all that have happen to I i have not build much of a fortune to leave to those who shall carry my name and nothing i have do shall entitle I now to a place on the tablet of fame but i have love the great sky and its space of blue i have live with the bird and the tree i have turn from the splendor of silver and gold to share in such pleasure as these i have give my time to the child who come together we have romp and we have play and i would not exchange the glad hour spend with they for the money that i might have make i choose to be know and be love by the few and be deaf to the plaudit of man and i would make the same choice should the chance come to I to live my life over again i have live with my friend and i have share in they joy know sorrow with all of its tear i have harvest much from my acre of life though some say i have squander my year for much that be fine have be mine to enjoy and i think i have live to my best and i have no regret as i be near the end for the gold that i might have possess god make this day for I je ' the sort o ' weather and je ' the sort of sky which seem to suit my fancy with the white cloud driftin ' by on a sea o ' smooth blue water oh i be not a egotist with a i in all my thinkin ' but i be willin ' to insist that the lord who make we human a ' the bird in every tree know my special sort o ' weather a ' he make this day fer I this be je ' my style o ' weather -- sunshine floodin ' all the place a ' the breeze from the eastward blowin ' gently on my face a ' the wood chock full o ' singin ' till you would think bird never have a single care to fret 'em or a grief to make 'em sad oh i settle down contented in the shadow of a tree a ' tell myself right proudly that the day be make fer I it be my day my sky a ' sunshine a ' the temper o ' the breeze -- here be the weather i would fashion could i run thing as i please : beauty dancin ' all around I music ringin ' everywhere like a weddin ' celebration -- why i have plumb fergot my care a ' the task i should be doin ' fer the rainy day to be while i be huggin ' the delusion that god make this day fer I the grate fire i be sorry for a fellow if he can not look and see in a grate fire 's friendly flame all the joy which use to be if in quiet contemplation of a cheerful ruddy blaze he see nothing there recall all he happy yesterday then he mind be dead to fancy and he life be bleak and bare and he be doom to walk the highway that be always thick with care when the log be dry as tinder and they crackle with the heat and the spark like merry child come a-dancing round my foot in the cold long night of autumn i can sit before the blaze and watch a panorama bear of all my yesterday i can leave the present burden and the moment 's bit of woe and claim once more the gladness of the bygone long-ago no loved one ever vanish from the grate fire 's merry throng no hand in death be fold and no lip be still to song all the friend who be be live -- like the spark that fly about they come romp out to greet I with the same old merry shout till it seem to I i be play once again on boyhood 's stage where there be no such thing as sorrow and there be no such thing as age i can be the care-free schoolboy i can play the lover too i can walk through maytime orchard with the old sweetheart i know i can dream the glad dream over greet the old familiar friend in a land where there be no parting and the laughter never end all the gladness life have give from a grate fire i reclaim and i be sorry for the fellow-who see nothing there but flame the homely man look as though a cyclone hit he -- can not buy clothes that seem to fit he a ' he cheek be rough like leather make for standin ' any weather outwards he be fashion plainly loose o ' joint a ' blame ungainly but i would give a lot if i would be build half as fine inside best thing i can tell you of he be the way the child love he now a ' then i get to thinkin ' he be much like old abe lincoln homely like a gargoyle graven -- worse 'n that when he be unshaven but i would take he ugly phiz je ' to have a heart like he i be not over-sentimental but old blake be so blame gentle a ' so thoughtfull-like of other he remind we of we mother rough road he be always smooth a ' he way be oh so soothin ' that he take away the sting when you heart be sorrowing child gather round about he like they can not get on without he a ' the old depend upon he pilin ' all they burden on he like as though the thing that grieve 'em have be lift when he leave 'em homely that can not be deny but he be glorious inside the joy we miss there never come a lonely day but that we miss the laughing way of those who use to walk with we through all we happy yesterday we seldom miss the earthly great -- the famous man that life have know -- but as the year go race by we miss the friend we use to own the chair wherein he use to sit recall the kindly father true for oh so fill with fun he be and oh so very much he know and as we face the problem grave with which the year of life be fill we miss the hand which guide we and miss the voice forever still we little guess how much he do to smooth we pathway day by day how much of joy he bring to we how much of care he brush away but now that we must tread alone the thorough-fare of life we find how many burden we be spare by he who be so brave and kind death rob the living not the dead -- they sweetly sleep whose task be do but we be weaker than before who still must live and labor on for when come care and grief to we and heavy burden bring we woe we miss the smile helpful friend on whom we lean long year ago we miss the happy tender way of those who bring we mirth and cheer we never gather round the hearth but that we wish we friend be near for peace be bear of simple thing -- a kindly word a goodnight kiss the prattle of a babe and love -- these be the vanish joy we miss the fellowship of book i care not who the man may be nor how he task may fret he nor where he fare nor how he care and trouble may beset he if book have win the love of he whatever fortune hand he he 'll always own when he be alone a friend who understand he though other friend may come and go and some may stoop to treason he book remain through loss or gain and season after season the faithful friend for every mood he joy and sorrow sharing for old time 's sake they 'll lighter make the burden he be bear oh he have counsel at he side and wisdom for he duty and laughter gay for hour of play and tenderness and beauty and fellowship divinely rare true friend who never doubt he unchanging love and god above who keep good book about he when sorrow come when sorrow come as come it must in god a man must place he trust there be no power in mortal speech the anguish of he soul to reach no voice however sweet and low can comfort he or ease the blow he can not from he fellowman take strength that will sustain he then with all that kindly hand will do and all that love may offer too he must believe throughout the test that god have will it for the best we who would be he friend be dumb word from we lip but feebly come we feel as we extend we hand that one power only understand and truly know the reason why so beautiful a soul must die we realize how helpless then be all the gift of mortal man no word which we have power to say can take the sting of grief away -- that power which mark the sparrow 's fall must comfort and sustain we all when sorrow come as come it must in god a man must place he trust with all the wealth which he may own he can not meet the test alone and only he may stand serene who have a faith on which to lean golf luck as a golfer i be not one who cop the money i shall always be a member of the dub there be time my style be positively funny i be awkward in my handling of the club i be not a skillful golfer nor a plucky but this about myself i proudly say -- when i win a hole by freaky stroke or lucky i never claim i play the shot that way there be time despite my blundering behavior when fortune seem to follow at my heel now and then i play supremely in she favor and she let I pull the rankest sort of steal she 'll give to I the friendliest assistance i 'll jump a ditch at time when i should not i 'll top the ball and get a lot of distance -- but i do not claim that be how i play the shot i have hook a ball when just that hook i need and wonder how i ever turn the trick i have thank my luck for what a friendly tree do although my fortune make my rival sick sometimes my shot turn out just as i plan 'em the sort of shot i usually play but when up to the cup i chance to land 'em i never claim i play 'em just that way there be little in my game that will commend I i be not a shark who shoot the course in par i need good fortune often to befriend I i have my fault and know just what they be i play golf in a desperate do-or-die way and into trap and trouble oft i stray but when by chance the break be come my way i do not claim i play the shot that way contradictin ' joe hear of contradictin ' joe most contrary man i know always sayin ' that be not so nothing 's ever say but he step right up to disagree -- quarrelsome as he can be if you start in to recite all the detail of a fight he 'll butt in to set you right start a story that be true he 'll begin correctin ' you -- make you out a liar too mention time o ' year or day make no difference what you say nothing happen just that way bet you when he soul take flight a ' the angel talk at night he 'll butt in to set 'em right there where none should have complaint he will be with no ' and be n't contradictin ' all the saint the better job if i be run a factory i would stick up a sign for all to see i would print it large and i would nail it high on every wall that the man walk by and i would have it carry this sentence clear : the ` better job ' that you want be here it be the common trait of the human race to pack up and roam from place to place man have do it for age and do it now seek to better themselves somehow they quit they post and they tool they drop for a better job in another shop it may be i be wrong but i hold to this -- that something surely must be amiss when a man worth while must move away for the better job with the better pay and something be false in we own renown when man can think of a better town so if i be run a factory i would stick up this sign for all to see which never a eye in the place could miss : there be not a better town than this you need not go wander far or near -- the ` better job ' that you want be here my religion my religion 's lovin ' god who make we one and all who mark no matter where it be the humble sparrow 's fall a ' my religion 's servin ' he the very best i can by not despisin ' anything he make especially man it be lovin ' sky a ' earth a ' sun a ' bird a ' flower a ' tree but lovin ' human being more than any one of these i be not no hand at preachin ' a ' i can not expound the creed i fancy every fellow 's faith must satisfy he need or he would hunt for something else a ' i can not tell the why a ' wherefore of the doctrine deep -- and what be more i do not try i reckon when this life be do and we can know he plan god will not be hard on anyone who be try to be a man my religion do not hinge on some one rite or word i hold that any honest prayer a mortal make be hear to love a church be well enough but some get cold with pride a ' quite forget they fellowman for whom the savior die i fancy he best worship god when all be say a ' do who try to be from day to day a friend to everyone if god can mark the sparrow 's fall i do not believe he 'll fail to notice we a ' how we act when doubt a ' fear assail i think he 'll hold what be in we heart above what be in we creed a ' judge all we religion here by we record deed a ' since man be god 's greatest work since life on earth begin he 'll get to heaven i believe who help he fellowman what i call live the miser think he be live when he be hoard up he gold the soldier call it live when he be do something bold the sailor think it live to be toss upon the sea and upon this vital subject no two of we agree but i hold to the opinion as i walk my way along that living 's make of laughter and good-fellowship and song i would not call it live always to be seek gold to bank all the present gladness for the day when i 'll be old i would not call it live to spend all my strength for fame and forego the many pleasure which to-day be mine to claim i would not for the splendor of the world set out to roam and forsake my laughing child and the peace i know at home oh the thing that i call living be not gold or fame at all it be good-fellowship and sunshine and it be rose by the wall it be evening glad with music and a hearth fire that be ablaze and the joy which come to mortal in a thousand different way it be laughter and contentment and the struggle for a goal it be everything that be needful in the shaping of a soul if this be all if this be all of life we 'll know if this brief space of breath be all there be to human toil if death be really death and never should the soul arise a finer world to see how foolish would we struggle seem how grim the earth would be if living be the whole of life to end in seventy year how pitiful its joy would seem how idle all its tear there would be no faith to keep we true no hope to keep we strong and only fool would cherish dream -- no smile would last for long how purposeless the strife would be if there be nothing more if there be not a plan to serve a end to struggle for no reason for a mortal 's birth except to have he die -- how silly all the goal would seem for which man bravely try there must be something after death behind the toil of man there must exist a god divine who be work out a plan and this brief journey that we know as life must really be the gateway to a finer world that some day we shall see a christmas carol god bless you all this christmas day and drive the care and grief away oh may the shine bethlehem star which lead the wise man from afar upon you head good sir still glow to light the path that ye should go as god once bless the stable grim and make it radiant for he as it be fit to shield he son may thy roof be a holy one may all who come this house to share rest sweetly in he gracious care within thy wall may peace abide the peace for which the savior die though humble be the rafter here above they may the star shine clear and in this home thou lovest well may excellence of spirit dwell god bless you all this christmas day may bethlehem 's star still light thy way and guide thee to the perfect peace when every fear and doubt shall cease and may thy home such glory know as do the stable long ago forget boyhood he wear a long and solemn face and drive the child from he place he do not like to hear they shout or race and run and romp about and if they chance to climb he tree he be as ugly as can be if in he yard they drive a ball which near he pretty flower should fall he hide the leather sphere away thus hope to prevent they play the youngster worry he a lot this sorry man who have forget that once upon a time he too the self-same mischief use to do the boyhood he have leave behind have strangely vanish from he mind and he be old and gray and cross for have suffer such a loss he think he never have the joy that be the birthright of a boy he have forget how he run or to a dog 's tail tie a can break window pane and love to swipe some neighbor 's apple red and ripe -- he think that always day or night he conduct be exactly right in boy to-day he can not see the youngster that he use to be forget be that by-gone day when he be mischievous as they poor man i be sorry for you lot the best of life you have forget could you remember what you be unharnessed and untouched by spur these youngster that you drive away would be you comrade here to-day among they you could gayly walk and share they laughter and they talk you could be young and blithe as they could you recall you yesterday the peak of valor these be the peak of valor keep clean you father 's name too brave for petty profit to risk the brand of shame adventuring for the future yet mindful of the past for god for country and for home still valorous to the last these be the peak of valor : a speech that know no lie a standard of what be right and wrong which no man 's wealth can buy all unafraid of failure to venture forth to fight yet never for the victory 's sake to turn away from right ten thousand time the victor be he who fail to win who could have wear the conqueror 's crown by stoop low in sin ten thousand time the braver be he who turn away and scorn to crush a weaker man that he may rule the day these be the peak of valor : stand firm and standing true to the best you father teach you and the best you have learn anew helpful to all who need you win what joy you can write in triumph to the end you record as a man when the minister call my paw say that it use to be whenever the minister come for tea ` at they sit up straight in they chair at night a ' put all they common thing out o ' sight a ' nobody crack a joke or grin but they talk o ' the way that people sin a ' the burnin ' fire that would cook you sure when you come to die if you be not pure -- such a gloomy affair it use to be whenever the minister come for tea but now when the minister come to call i get he out for a game of ball and you would never know if you would see he bat without any coat or vest or hat that he be a minister no siree he look like a regular man to I a ' he know just how to go down to the dirt for the grounder hot without gettin ' hurt -- a ' when they call we both he a ' I have to git wash up again for tea we minister say if you 'll just play fair you 'll be fit for heaven or anywhere a ' fun 's all right if you hand be clean a ' you never cheat a ' you do not get mean he say that he never have understand why a feller can not play a ' still be good a ' my paw say that he be just the kind of a minister that he like to find -- so i be always tickle as i can be whenever we minister come for tea the age of ink swiftly the change come each day see some lose beauty blow away and some new touch of lovely grace come into life to take its place the little babe that once we have one morning wake a roguish lad the babe that we have put to bed out of we arm and life have flee frock vanish from we castle then ne'er to be worn or see again and in he knickerbocker pride he boast pocket at each side and store they deep with various thing -- stone top and jack and-colored string then for a time we claim the joy of call he we little boy brief be the reign of such a spell one morning sound out a bell with tear i see she brown eye swim and know that it be call he time the harsh master of we all be bid he to heed he call this shadow fall across life 's pool -- we boy be on he way to school we little boy and still we dream for such a little boy he seem and yesterday with eye aglow like one who have just come to know some great and unexpected bliss he bound in announce this : oh dad oh ma say what d'you think this year we be go to write with ink here be a change i would not foresee another step from what have be i pause a little while to think about this older age of ink -- what follow this great step think i what next shall come as the time go by and something say : he pathway lead unto the day he 'll write with deed no use sighin ' no use frettin ' when the rain come down no use grievin ' when the gray cloud frown no use sighin ' when the wind blow strong no use wailin ' when the world 's all wrong only thing that a man can do be work a ' wait till the sky get blue no use mopin ' when you lose the game no use sobbin ' if you be free from shame no use cryin ' when the harm be do just keep on tryin ' a ' workin ' on only thing for a man to do be take the loss a ' begin anew no use weepin ' when the milk be spill no use growlin ' when you hope be kill no use kickin ' when the lightnin ' strike or the flood come along a ' wreck you dyke only thing for a man right then be to grit he tooth a ' start again for it be how life be a ' the way thing be that you have get to face if you travel far a ' the storm will come a ' the failure too a ' plan go wrong spite of all you do a ' the only thing that will help you win be the grit of a man and a stern set chin no child no child in the house to play -- it must be hard to live that way i wonder what the people do when night come on and the work be through with no glad little folk to shout no eager foot to race about no youthful tongue to chatter on about the joy that be be and go the house might be a castle fine but what a lonely place to dine no child in the house at all no fingermark upon the wall no corner where the toy be pile -- sure indication of a child no little lip to breathe the prayer that god shall keep you in he care no glad caress and welcome sweet when night return you to you street no little lip a kiss to give -- oh what a lonely way to live no child in the house i fear we could not stand it half a year what would we talk about at night plan for and work with all we might hold common dream about and find true union of heart and mind if we two have no greater care than what we both should eat and wear we never know love 's brightest flame until the day the baby come and now we could not get along without they laughter and they song joy be not bottle on a shelf it can not feed upon itself and even love if it shall wear must find its happiness in care dull we would become of mind and speech have we no little one to teach no child in the house to play oh we could never live that way the loss be not so great it be better as it be : i have fail but i can sleep though the pit i now be in be very dark and deep i can walk to-morrow 's street and can meet to-morrow 's man unashamed to face they gaze as i go to work again i have lose the hope i have in the dust be all my dream but my loss be not so great or so dreadful as it seem i make my fight and though i fail i need not slink away for i do not have to fear what another man may say they may call I over-bold they may say that i be frail they may tell i dare too much and be doom at last to fail they may talk my battle o'er and discuss it as they choose but i do no brother wrong -- i be the only one to lose it be better as it be : i have keep my self-respect i can walk to-morrow 's street meet all man head

want my boy to be oft be the question ask of I and oft i ask it of myself -- what corner niche or post or shelf in the great hall of life would i select for he to occupy statesman or writer poet sage

shall use brush pen or chisel lathe or wrench the desk of commerce or the bench and pray that when he make he choice in each day 's task he shall rejoice i know somewhere there be a need for he to

for many a day and that boy have a comrade who think and who feel who walk down the road with a dog at he heel he may go where he will and he dog will be there may revel in mud and he dog will not care faithful he 'll stay for the slightest command and bark with delight at the touch of he hand oh he own a treasure which nobody steal who walk down the road with a dog at he heel no other can lure

practice time 'cause i hate it so the christmas gift for mother in the christmas time of the long ago there be one event we use to know that be better than any other it be not the toy that we hope to get but the talk we have -- and i hear they yet -- of the gift we would buy for mother if ever love fashion a christmas gift or save its money and practice thrift 'twa do in those day my brother -- those golden time of long go by of we happiest year when you and i talk over the gift for mother we have not go forth on we different way nor coin we life into yesterday in the fire that smell and smother and we whisper and plan in we youthful glee of that marvelous something which be to be the gift of we heart to mother it have to be all that we purse could give something she have treasure while she could live and better than any other we give it the best of we love and thought and oh the joy when at last we would buy that marvelous gift for mother now i think as we go on we different way of the joy of those vanish yesterday how good it would be my brother if this christmas-time we could only know that same sweet thrill of the long ago when we share in the gift for mother bedtime it be bedtime and we lock the door put out the light -- the day be o'er all that can come of good or ill the record of this day to fill be write down the worry cease and old and young may rest in peace we know not when we start out what danger hedge we all about what little pleasure we should gain what should be ours to bear of pain but now the fire be burn low and this day 's history we know no harm have come the laughter here have be unbroken by a tear we have meet no hurt too great to bear we have not have to bow to care the child all be safe in bed there be nothing now for we to dread when bedtime come and we can say that we have safely live the day how sweet the calm that settle down and shut away the noisy town there be no danger now to fear until to-morrow shall appear when the long bedtime come and i in sleep eternal come to lie -- when life have nothing more in store and silently i close the door god grant my weary soul may claim security from hurt and shame the willing horse i would rather be the willing horse that people ride to death than be the proud and haughty steed that child dare not touch i would rather haul a merry pack and finish out of breath than never leave the barn to toil because i be worth too much so boast you noble pedigree and talk of manners if you please -- the weary horse enjoy he ease when all he work be do the willing horse day in and out can hear the merry child shout and every time they be about he share in all they fun i want no guard beside my door to pick and choose my friend for I i would not be shut off from man as be the fancy steed i do not care when i go by that no one turn he eye to see the dash manner of my gait which mark my noble breed i be content to trudge the road and willingly to draw my load -- sometimes to know the spur and goad when i begin to lag i would rather feel the collar jerk and tug at I the while i work than all the task of life to shirk as do the stylish nag so let I be the willing horse that now and then be overtasked let I be one the child love and freely dare to ride -- i would rather be the gentle steed of which too much be sometimes ask than be the one that never know the youngster at he side so drive I wheresoe'er you will on level road or up the hill pile on my back the burden still and run I out of breath -- in love and friendship day by day and kindly word i 'll take my pay a willing horse that be the way i choose to meet my death where child play on every street there be a certain place where the child gather to romp and race there be a certain house where they meet in throng to play they game and to sing they song and they trample the lawn with they busy foot and they scatter they plaything about the street but though some folk order they off i say let the house be mine where the child play army gather about the door and fill the air with they battle roar cowboy swing they lariat loop dash round the house with the wildest whoop and old folk have to look out when they be hold a indian tribe at bay for danger may find they on fly foot who pass by the house where the child meet there be lawn too lovely to bear the weight of a troop of boy when they roller skate there be porch fine that must never know the stamp of footstep that come and go but on every street there be a favorite place where the child gather to romp and race and i be glad in my heart that it be mine to say ours be the house where the child play how do you buy you money how do you buy you money for money be buy and sell and each man barter himself on earth for he silver and shine gold and by the bargain he make with man the sum of he life be tell some buy they coin in a manly way some buy they with honest toil some pay for they currency here on earth by till a patch of soil some buy it with copper and iron and steel and some with barrel of oil the good man buy it from day to day by give the best he can he coin he strength for he child 's need and live to a simple plan and he keep some time for the home he make and some for he fellowman but some man buy it with woman 's tear and some with a blast name and some will barter the joy of life for the fortune they hope to claim and some be so mad for the clink of gold that they buy it with deed of shame how do you buy you money for money demand its price and some man think when they purchase coin that they must not be over-nice -- but beware of the man who would sell you gold at a shameful sacrifice mother 's day let every day be mother 's day make rose grow along she way and beauty everywhere oh never let she eye be wet with tear of sorrow or regret and never cease to care come grow up child and rejoice that you can hear you mother 's voice a day for she for you she give long year of love and service brave for you she youth be spend there be no weight of hurt or care too heavy for she strength to bear she follow where you go she courage and she love sublime you could depend on all the time no day or night she set apart on which to open wide she heart and welcome you within there be no hour you would not be first in she thought and memory though you be black as sin though sky be gray or sky be blue not once have she forget you let every day be mother 's day with love and rose strew she way and smile of joy and pride come grow up child to the knee where long ago you use to be and never turn aside oh never let she eye grow wet with tear because she babe forget when we play the fool last night i stand in a tawdry place and watch the way of the human race i look at a party of shriek girl pile on a table that whirl and whirl and see they throw in a tangled heap sprawl and squirm and several deep and unto the wife who be stand by these be all angel to be say i i follow the way of the merry throng and hear the laughter and mirth and song into a barrel which turn and sway man and woman a journey make and tumble together they seem to be like so many porpoise out at sea -- man and woman who have work all day eagerly seek a chance to play what do you make of it all she say i answer : the dead be a long time dead and care be bitter and duty stern and each must weep when it come he turn and all grow weary and long for play so here be laughter to end the day foolish oh yes it be that say i but better the laugh than the dreary sigh now look at we here for we be like they too and many the foolish thing we do we often grow silly and seek a smile in a thousand way that be not worth while yet after the mirth and the jest be through we shall all be judge by the deed we do and god shall forget on the judgment day the fool we be in we hour of play what make a artist we get to talk art one day discuss in a general way how some can match with brush and paint the glory of a tree and some in stone can catch the thing of which the dreamy poet sing while other seem to have no way to tell the joy they see old blake have sit in silence there and let each one of we declare we notion of what be know as art until he would hear we through and then say he : it seem to I that any man whoe'er he be become a artist by the good he daily try to do he need not write the book man read to be a artist no indeed he need not work with paint and brush to show he love of art who do a kindly deed to-day and help another on he way have paint beauty on a face and play the poet 's part though some of we can not express we inmost thought of loveliness we prove we love the beautiful by how we act and live the poet singing of a tree no greater poet be than he who find it in he heart some care unto a tree to give though he who work in marble stone the name of artist here may own no less a artist be the man who guard he child well ` tis art to love the fine and true by what we be and what we do how much we love life 's nobler thing to all the world we tell she powder she nose a woman be queer there be no doubt about that she hate to be thin and she hate to be fat one minute it be laughter the next it be a cry -- you can not understand she however you try but there be one thing about she which everyone know -- a woman 's not dress till she powder she nose you never can tell what a woman will say she be a law to herself every hour of the day it keep a man guess to know what to do and mostly he be wrong when he guess be through but this you can bet on wherever she go she 'll find some occasion to powder she nose i have study the sex for a number of year i have watch she in laughter and see she in tear on she way and she whim i have ponder a lot to find what will please she and just what will not but all that i have learn from the start to the close be that sooner or later she 'll powder she nose at church or a ball game a dance or a show there be one thing about she i know that i know -- at wedding or funeral dinner of taste you can bet that she hand will dive into she waist and every few minute she 'll strike up a pose and the whole world must wait till she powder she nose the chip

when time life 's adviser have make you much wiser you will not be so quick with the blow you will not be so willing to fight for a shilling and change a good friend to a foe you will not be a sticker for trifle and bicker and quarrel for nothing at all you 'll grow to be kinder more thoughtful and blinder to fault which be petty and small you will not take the trouble you two fist to double when someone you pride may offend when with rage now you bristle you 'll smile or you 'll whistle and keep the good will of a friend you 'll learn when you be older that chip on you shoulder which proudly you battle to guard have frequently shame you and often defame you and leave you a record that be mar when you have grow calm and steady you will not be so ready to fight for a difference that be small for you 'll know when you be older that chip on you shoulder be only a chip after all all for the best thing mostly happen for the best however hard it seem to-day when some fond plan have go astray or what you have wish for most be lose a ' you sit countin ' up the cost with eye half-blind by tear o ' grief while doubt be chokin ' out belief you 'll find when all be understand that what seem bad be really good life can not be count in a day the present rain that will not stop next autumn mean a bumper crop we wonder why some thing must be -- care 's purpose we can seldom see -- a ' yet long afterwards we turn to view the past a ' then we learn that what once fill we mind with doubt be good for we as it work out i have never know a hour of care but that i have later come to see that it have bring some joy to I even the sorrow i have bear leavin ' I lonely a ' forlorn a ' hurt a ' bruise a ' sick at heart in life 's great plan have have a part a ' though i could not

stun by every hurt a ' blow which come to-day to strike we low a ' yet some day we turn a ' find that what seem cruel once be kind most thing i hold be wisely plan if we could only understand the kick under the table after a man have be marry awhile and he wife have grow use to he manner and style when she know from the twinkle that light up he eye the thought he be think the wherefore and why and

there a ' talkin ' with my easy slipper on a ' my shirt band throw wide open a ' my foot upon the rail oh it be then i be at my richest with a wealth that can not fail for the scent of early rose seem to flood the evening air a ' a throne of downright gladness be my wicker rock chair the dog asleep beside I a ' the child rompin ' ` round with they shriek of merry laughter oh there be no gladder

i think o ' many thing a ' balance up my riches with the lonesomeness o ' king a ' i come to this conclusion a ' i 'll wager that i be right -- that i be happier than they be sittin ' on my porch at night with dog and gun out in the wood with a dog a ' gun be my idea of a real day 's fun ` tai not the bird that i be out to kill that furnish I with the finest thrill 'cause i never worry or fret a lot or curse my luck if i miss a shot there be many a time a ' i do not know why that i shoot too low or i aim too high a ' all i can see be the distant whirr of a bird that be gittin ' back home to she -- yep gittin ' back home at the end o ' day a ' i be just as glad that he get away there be a whole lot more in the wood o ' fall than the bird you bag -- if you think at all there be color o ' gold a ' red a ' brown as never be know in the busy town there be room to breathe in the purest air a ' something worth look at everywhere there be the dog who be leadin ' you on a ' on to a patch o ' cover where bird have go a ' standin ' there without move or change till you give the sign that you have get the range that be thrill enough for my blood i say so why should i care if they get away fact be there be time that i would ruther miss than to bring 'em down 'cause i feel like this : there be a heap more joy in a living thing than a breast crush in or a broken wing a ' i can not feel right a ' i never will when i look at a bird that i have dare to kill oh i be jus ' plumb happy to tramp about a ' follow my dog as he hunt 'em out jus ' watchin ' he point in he silent way where the bob whites be a ' the partridge stay for the joy o ' the great outdoors i have have so why should i care if my aim be bad old mister laughter old mister laughter come a-grinnin ' down the way singin ' : never mind you trouble for they 'll surely pass away singin ' : now the sun be shinin ' a ' there be rose everywhere to-morrow will be soon enough to fret about you care old mister laughter come a-grinnin ' at my door singin ' : do not go after money when you have get enough and more singin ' : laugh with I this mornin ' a ' be happy while you may what be the use of riches if they never let you play old mister laughter come a-grinnin ' all the time singin ' happy song o ' gladness in a good old-fashioned rhyme singin ' : keep the smile a-goin ' till they write you epitaph and do not let fame or fortune ever steal away you laugh a family row i freely confess there be good friend of mine with whom we be often invite to dine who get on my nerve so that i can not eat or stay with my usual ease in my seat for i know that if something should chance to occur which he may not like or which do not please she that we 'll have to try to be pleasant somehow while they stage a fine little family row now a family row be a private affair and guest i be certain should never be there i have freely maintain that a man and he wife can not always agree on they journey through life but they ought not to bicker and wrangle and shout and show off they rage when they friend be about it take all the joy from a party i vow when some couple start up a family row it be a difficult job to stay cool and polite when you host and you hostess be stage a fight : it be hard to talk sweet to a dame with a frown or smile at a man that you want to knock down you sit like a dummy and look far away but you just can not help hear the harsh thing they say it ruin the dinner i be tell you now when you host and you hostess get mix in a row the lucky man luck have a favor to bestow and wonder where to let it go no lazy man on earth say she shall get this happy gift from I i will not pass it to the man who will not do the best he can i will not make this splendid gift to one who have not practice thrift it shall not benefit deceit nor help the man who be play the cheat he that have fail to fight with pluck shall never know the goddess luck i 'll look around a bit to see what man have earn some help from I she find a man whose hand be soil because from day to day he have toil he would dream by night and work by day to make life 's contest go he way he have keep he post and daily slave and something of he wage he have save he would clutch at every circumstance which might have be he golden chance the goddess smile and then kerslap she drop she favor in he lap lonely they be all away and the house be still and the dust lie thick on the window sill and the stairway creak in a solemn tone this taunt phrase : you be all alone they have go away and the room be bare i miss he cap from a parlor chair and i miss the toy in the lonely hall but most of any i miss he call i miss the shout and the laughter gay which greet I at the close of day and there be not a thing in the house we own but sobbingly say : you be all alone it be only a house that be mine to know a empty house that be cold with woe like a prison grim with its bar of black and it will not be home till they all come back the cookie jar you can rig up a house with all manner of thing the prayer rug of sultan and prince and king you can hang on its wall the old tapestry rare which some dead egyptian once treasured with care but though costly and gorgeous its furnishings be it must have to be homelike a old cookie jar there be just a few thing that a home must possess besides all you money and all you success -- a few good old book which some love one have read some trinket of those whose sweet spirit have flee and then in the pantry not shove back too far for the hungry to get to that old cookie jar let the house be a mansion i care not at all let the finest of picture be hang on each wall let the carpet be make of the richest velour and the chair only those which great wealth can procure i would still want to keep for the joy of my flock that homey old-fashioned well-filled cookie crock like the love of the mother it shine through we year it have soothe all we hurt and have dry away tear it have pay we for toiling in sorrow or joy it have always show kindness to each girl and boy and i be sorry for people whoever they be who live in a house where there be no cookie jar little wrangle lord we have have we little wrangle a ' we have have we little bout there be many a time i reckon that we have be on the out my tongue 's a trifle hasty a ' my temper 's apt to fly a ' mother let I tell you have a sting in she reply but i could not live without she a ' it be plain as plain can be that in fair or sunny weather mother need a man like I i have bang the door a ' mutter angry word beneath my breath for at time when she be scoldin ' mother 's plague I most to death but we have always laugh it over when we have both cool down a bit a ' we never have a difference but a smile would settle it a ' if such a thing could happen we could share life 's joy a ' tear a ' live right on together for another thousand year some man give up too easy in the game o ' married life they have not get the courage to be worthy of a wife a ' i have see a lot o ' woman that have make they life a mess 'cause they could not bear the burden that be mix with happiness so long as folk be human they 'll have many fault that jar a ' the way to live with people be to take they as they be we have be forty year together good a ' bad a ' rain a ' shine i have forget mother 's fault now a ' she never mention mine in the day when sorrow strike we a ' we share a common woe we just lean upon each other a ' we weakness do not show a ' i learn how much i need she a ' how tender she can be a ' through it maybe mother see the better side o ' I the wide outdoors the rich may pay for orchid rare but oh the apple tree fling out its blossom to the world for every eye to see and all who sigh for loveliness may walk beneath the sky and claim a richer beauty than man 's gold can ever buy the bloom cherry tree be free for all to look upon the dogwood bud for all of we and not some favorite one the wide outdoors be no man 's own the stranger on the street can cast he eye on many a rose and claim its fragrance sweet small garden be shut in by wall but none can wall the sky and none can hide the friendly tree from all who travel by and none can hold the apple bough and claim they for he own for all the beauty of the earth belong to god alone so let I walk the world just now and wander far and near earth 's loveliness be mine to see its music mine to hear there be not a single apple bough that spill its bloom about but i can claim the joy of it and none can shut I out where 's mamma come in fly from the street where 's mamma friend or stranger thus he 'll greet : where 's mamma do not want to say hello home from school or play he 'll go straight to what he want to know : where 's mamma many time a day he 'll shout where 's mamma seem afraid that she be go out where 's mamma be he first thought at the door -- she be the one he be look for and he question o'er and o'er where 's mamma can not be happy till he know : where 's mamma so he beg we to disclose where 's mamma and it often seem to I as i hear he anxious plea that no sweeter phrase can be : where 's mamma like to hear it day by day where 's mamma loveliest phrase that lip can say : where 's mamma and i pray as time shall flow and the long year come and go that he 'll always want to know where 's mamma summer dream

be long but hammer be tool for man and granite endure and steel be strong outlive both brush and pen and age after my voice be still man shall know i live by the thing i build old year and new old year and new year all blended into one the best of what there be to be the best of what be go -- let 's bury all the failure in the dim and dusty past and keep the smile of friendship and laughter to the last old year and new year life 's in the make still we have not come to glory yet but there be the hope we will the dead old year be twelve month long but now from it we be free and what be one year of good or bad to all the year to be old year and new year we need they one and all to reach the dome of character and build its shelter wall past failure try the soul of we but if they test we stand the sum of what we be to be may yet be count good old year and new year with all they pain and strife be but the brick and steel and stone with which we fashion life so put the sin and shame away and keep the fine and true and on the glory of the past let 's build the better new when we be all alike i have trudge life 's highway up and down i have watch the line of man march by i have see they in the busy town and see they under country sky i have talk with toiler in the rank and walk with man whose hand be white and learn when close be store and bank we be nearly all alike at night just find the wise professor when he be not lose in ancient lore and he like many other man romp with he child on the floor he put he gravity aside to share in innocent delight strip of position 's pomp and pride we be nearly all the same at night serve a common cause we go unto we separate task by day and rich or poor or great or low regardless of they place or pay cherish the common dream of man -- a home where love and peace unite we serve the self-same end and plan we be all alike when it be night each for he loved one want to do he utmost brother be we all when we have run the work-day through in romp with we child small rich man and poor delight in play when care and caste have take flight at home in all we think and say we be very much the same at night the thing you can not forget they be not much see from day to day -- the big elm tree across the way the church spire a ' the meetin ' place light up by many a friendly face you pass 'em by a dozen time a ' never think o ' they in rhyme or fit for poet 's singin ' yet they be all the thing you can not forget a ' they be the thing you 'll miss some day if ever you should go away the people here be not much to see -- je ' common folk like you a ' I doin ' the ordinary task which life of everybody ask : old dr green still farin ' ` round to where he patient can be find a ' parson hill serene o ' face carryin ' god 's message every place a ' jim who keep the grocery store -- yet they be folk you would hunger for they seem so plain when close to view -- bill barker a ' he brother too the jackson man of higher rank because they chance to run the bank yet friend to every one round here quiet a ' kindly a ' sincere not much to sing about or praise livin ' they life in modest way -- yet in you memory they would stay if ever you should go away these be thing a ' these the man some day you 'll long to see again now it be so near you scarcely see the beauty o ' that big elm tree but some day later on you will a ' wonder if it be standin ' still a ' if the bird return to sing a ' make they nest there every spring mebbe you scorn they now but they will bring you back again some day the making of friend if nobody smile and nobody cheer and nobody help we along if each every minute look after himself and good thing all go to the strong if nobody care just a little for you and nobody think about I and we stand all alone to the battle of life what a dreary old world it would be if there be no such a thing as a flag in the sky as a symbol of comradeship here if we live as the animal live in the wood with nothing hold sacred or dear and selfishness rule we from birth to the end and never a neighbor have we and never we give to another in need what a dreary old world it would be oh if we be rich as the richest on earth and strong as the strongest that live yet never we know the delight and the charm of the smile which the other man give if kindness be never a part of ourselves though we own all the land we could see and friendship mean nothing at all to we here what a dreary old world it would be life be sweet just because of the friend we have make and the thing which in common we share we want to live on not because of ourselves but because of the people who care it be give and do for somebody else -- on that all life 's splendor depend and the joy of this world when you have sum it all up be find in the making of friend the deed of anger i use to lose my temper a ' git mad a ' tear around a ' raise my voice so wimmin folk would tremble at the sound i would do thing i be ashamed of when the fit of rage have pass a ' wish i have not do 'em a ' regret 'em to the last but i have learn from sad experience how useless be regret for the mean thing do in anger be the thing you can not forget ` tai not no use to kiss the youngster once you hand have make he cry you 'll recall the time you strike he till the very day you die he 'll forget it a ' forgive you a ' to-morrow seem the same but you 'll keep the hateful picture of you sorrow a ' you shame a ' it be bind to rise to taunt you though you long have square the debt for the thing you have do in meanness be the thing you can not forget lord i sometimes sit a ' shudder when some scene come back to I which show I big a ' brutal in some act o ' tyranny when some triflin ' thing upset I a ' i let my temper fly a ' be sorry for it after -- but it be vain to sit a ' sigh so i would be a whole sight happier now my sun begin to set if it be not for the meanness which i have do a ' can not forget now i think i have learn my lesson a ' i be treadin ' gentler way a ' i try to build my morning into happy yesterday i do not let my temper spoil 'em in the way i use to do a ' let some splash of anger smear the record when it be through i want my memory pleasant free from shame or vain regret without any deed of anger which i never can forget i would rather be a failure i would rather be a failure than the man who be never try i would rather seek the mountain-top than always stand aside oh let I hold some lofty dream and make my desperate fight and though i fail i still shall know i try to serve the right the idler line the way of life and they be quick to sneer they note the fail strength of man and greet it with a jeer but there be something deep inside which scoffer fail to view -- they never see the glorious deed the failure try to do some man there be who never leave the city 's well-worn street they never know the danger grim the bold adventurer meet they never seek a better way nor serve a nobler plan they never risk with failure to advance the cause of man oh better ` tis to fail and fall in sorrow and despair than stand where all be safe and sure and never face a care yes stamp I with the failure 's brand and let man sneer at I for though i have fail the lord shall know the man i try to be could not live without you you be just a little fellow with a lot of funny way just three-foot-six of mischief set with eye that fairly blaze you be always up to something with those busy hand o ' yours and you leave a trail o ' ruin on the wall a ' on the door a ' i wonder as i watch you a ' you curious trick i see whatever be the reason that you mean so much to I you be just a chubby rascal with a grin upon you face just seven year o ' gladness a ' a hard and try case you think the world 's you playground a ' in all you say a ' do you fancy everybody ought to bow a ' scrape to you dull care 's a thing you laugh at just as though ` twill never be so i wonder little fellow why you mean so much to I now you face be smear with candy or perhaps it be only dirt a ' it be really most alarming how you tear you little shirt but i have to smile upon you a ' with all you

old-fashioned way singin ' all the latest song gather from the newest play or they start the phonograph a ' shove the chair back to the wall a ' hold a little party dance i be happiest of all then i sorter settle back plumb contented to the core a ' i tell myself most proudly that be what home 's intend for when the laughter 's gaily ringin ' a ' the room be fill with song i like to sit a ' watch 'em all that glad a ' merry throng for the ragtime they be playin ' on the old piano there beat any high-toned music where the bright light shine a ' glare a ' the racket they be makin ' stir my pulse more and more so i whisper in my gladness : that be what home 's intend for then i smile a ' say to mother let 'em move the chair about let 'em frolic in the parlor let 'em shove the table out jus ' so long as they be near we jus ' so long as they will stay by the fireplace we be keepin ' harm will never come they way a ' you 'll never hear I grumble at the bill that keep I poor it be the finest part o ' livin ' -- that be what home 's intend for safe at home let the old fire blaze a ' the youngster shout a ' the dog on the rug sprawl full length out a ' mother a ' i sort o ' settle down -- a ' it be little we care for the noisy town oh it be little we care that the wind may blow a ' the street grow white with the drift snow we 'll face the storm with the break o ' day but to-night we 'll dream a ' we 'll sing a ' play we 'll sit by the fire where it be snug a ' warm a ' pay no heed to the winter storm with a shelter roof let the blizzard roar we be safe at home -- can a king say more that be all that count when the day be do : the smile of love and the youngster ' fun the care put down with the evening gloam -- here be the joy of all : to be safe at home when friend drop in it may be i be old-fashioned but the time i like the best be not the splendid party with the woman gaily dress and the music tune for dancing and the laughter of the throng with a pay comedian 's antic or a hire musician 's song but the quiet time of friendship with the chuckle and the grin and the circle at the fireside when a few good friend drop in there be something ` round the fireplace that no club can imitate and no throng can ever equal just a few folk near the grate though i sometimes like a opera there be no music quite so sweet as the singing of the neighbor that you be always glad to meet oh i know when they come call that the fun will soon begin and i be happiest those evening when a few good friend drop in there be no pomp of preparation there be no style or sham or fuss we be glad to welcome caller who be glad to be with we and we sit around and visit or we start a merry game and we show they by we manner that we be mighty pleased they come for there be something real about it and the yarn we love to spin and the time fly oh so swiftly when a few good friend drop in let I live my life among they cheerful kindly folk and true and i 'll ask no greater glory till my time of life be through let I share the love and favor of the few who know I best and i 'll spend my time contented till my sun sink in the west i will take what fortune send I and the little i may win and be happy on those evening when a few good friend drop in the book of memory turn I loose and let I be young once more and fancy free let I wander where i will down the lane and up the hill trudge barefoot in the dust in a age that know no must and no voice insistently speak of duty unto I let I tread the happy way of those by-gone yesterday fame have never whisper then make slave of eager man greed have never call I down to the gray wall of the town offering frankincense and myrrh if i would be its prisoner i be free to come and go where the cherry blossom blow free to wander where i would find life supremely good but i turn as all must do from the happiness i know to the land of care and strife seek for a fuller life hear the lure of fame and seek that renown so dearly buy listen to the voice of greed say : these the thing you need now the gray town hold I fast prisoner to the very last age have stamp I as its own youth to younger heart have fly still the cherry blossom blow in the land louse to know still the fragrant clover spill perfume over dale and hill but i be not allow to stray where the young be free to play all the year will grant to I be the book of memory pretend not to see sometimes at the table when he get misbehavin ' then mother call across to I : look at he now do not you see what he be doin ' sprawlin ' there make he sit up in he chair do not you see the messy way that he be eat a ' i say : no he seem all right just now what be he do anyhow mother place he there by I a ' she think i ought to see every time he break the law a ' correct he just because there will come a time some day when he must not act that way but i can not be all along scoldin ' he for doin ' wrong so if something go astray i jus ' look the other way mother tell I now a ' then i be the easiest o ' man a ' in dealin ' with the lad i will never see the bad that he do a ' i suppose mother 's right for mother know but i would hate to feel that i be here to scold he all the time little fault might spoil the day so i look the other way look the other way a ' try not to let he catch my eye knowin ' all the time that he do not mean so bad to be knowin ' too that now a ' then i be not the best o ' man hopin ' too the time i fall that the father of we all lovin ' watchin ' over I will pretend he do not see the joy of home curl smoke from a chimney low and only a few more step to go face press at a window pane watch for someone to come again and i be the someone they wait to see -- these be the joy life give to I what have my neighbor excel this : a good wife 's love and a baby 's kiss what if he chimney tower higher peace be find at we humble fire what if he silver and gold be more rest be ours when the day be o'er strive for fortune and slave for fame you find that joy always stay the same : rich man and poor man dream and pray for a home where laughter shall ever stay and the wheel go round and man spend they might for the few glad hour they may claim at night home where the kettle shall gaily sing be all that matter with serf or king gold and silver and laurell fame be only sweet when the hearth 's aflame with a cheerful fire and the loved one there be unafraid of the wolf of care so let I come home at night to rest with those who know i have do my best let the wife rejoice and my child smile and i 'll know by they love that i be worthwhile for this be conquest and world success -- a home where abideth happiness we be dreamer all oh man must dream of gladness wherever he pathway lead and a hint of something better be write in every creed and nobody wake at morning but hope ere the day be o'er to have come to a richer pleasure than ever he be know before for man be a dreamer ever he glimpse the hill afar and plan for the joy off yonder where all he to-morrow be when trial and care beset he in the distance he still can see a hint of a future splendid and the glory that be to be there be never a man among we but cherish dream of rest we toil for that something better than that which be now we best oh what if the cup be bitter and what if we be rack with pain there be wonderful day to follow when never we 'll grieve again back of the sound of the hammer and back of the hissing steam and back of the hand at the throttle be ever a lofty dream all of we great or humble look over the present need to the dawn of the glad to-morrow which be promise in every creed what be success success be be friendly when another need a friend it be in the cheery word you speak and in the coin you lend success be not alone in skill and deed of daring great it be in the rose that you plant beside you garden gate success be in the way you walk the path of life each day it be in the little thing you do and in the thing you say success be in the glad hello you give you fellow man it be in the laughter of you home and all the joy you plan success be not in get rich or rise high to fame it be not alone in win goal which all man hope to claim it be in the man you be each day through happiness or care it be in the cheery word you speak and in the smile you wear success be be big of heart and clean and broad of mind it be be faithful to you friend and to the stranger kind it be in the child whom you love and all they learn from you -- success depend on character and everything you do the three I 's i would like to steal a day and be all alone with little I little I that use to run everywhere in search of fun little I of long ago who be glad and do not know life be freight down with care for the back of man to bear little I who think a smile ought to linger all the while -- on he mother 's pretty face and a tear should never trace line of sorrow hurt or care on those cheek so wondrous fair i should like once more to be all alone with youthful I youthful I who see the hill where the sun its splendor spill and be certain that in time to the topmost height he would climb youthful I serene of soul who behold a shine goal and imagine he could gain glory without grief or pain confident and quick with life madly eager for the strife know not that bitter care wait for he come there i should like to sit alone with the I now older grow like to lead the little I and the youth that use to be once again along the way of we glorious yesterday we could chuckle soft and low at the thing we do not know and could laugh to think how bold we have be in day of old and how blind we be to care with its heartache and despair we could smile away the tear and the pain of later year brother all under the toiler 's grimy shirt under the sweat and the grease and dirt under the rough outside you view be a man who think and feel as you go talk with he go walk with he sit down with he by a run stream away from the thing that be hiss steam away from he bench he hammer and wrench and the grind of need and the sordid deed and this you 'll find as he bare he mind : in the thing which count when this life be through he be as tender and big and as good as you be fair with he and share with he a hour of time in a restful place brother to brother and face to face and he 'll whisper low of the long ago of a loved one dead and the tear he shed and you 'll come to see that in suffer he with you be hurt by the self-same rod and turn for help to the self-same god you hope as he you dream of splendor and so do he he child must be as you would have yours be he share you love for the flag above he laugh and sing for the self-same thing when he be understand he be mostly good thoughtful of other and kind and true brave devoted -- and much like you under the toiler 's grimy shirt under the sweat and the grease and dirt under the rough outside you view be a man who think and feel as you when we understand the plan i reckon when the world we leave and cease to smile and cease to grieve when each of we shall quit the strife and drop the working tool of life somewhere somehow we 'll come to find just what we maker have in mind perhaps through clearer eye than these we 'll read life 's hidden mystery and learn the reason for we tear -- why sometimes come unhappy year and why we dearest joy be brief and bind so closely unto grief there be so much beyond we scope as blindly on through life we grope so much we can not understand however wisely we have plan that all who walk this earth about be constantly beset by doubt no one of we can truly say why loved one must be call away why heart be hurt or e ` en explain why some must suffer year of pain yet some day all of we shall know the reason why these thing be so i reckon in the year to come when these poor lip of clay be dumb and these poor hand have cease to toil somewhere upon a fairer soil god shall to all of we make clear the purpose of we trial here the spoiler with a twinkle in he eye he have come gayly walkin ' by a ' he would whistle to the child a ' he would beckon 'em to come then he would chuckle low a ' say come along i be on my way a ' it be i that need you company to buy a little gum when he merry call they would hear all the child far a ' near would come flyin ' from the garden like the chicken after wheat when we would shake we head a ' say : no you must not go to-day he would beg to let he have 'em in a pack about he foot oh he spoil 'em one a ' all there be not a youngster small but be over-fed on candy a ' be stuff with lollypop a ' i think he greatest joy be to get some girl or boy a ' bring 'em to they parent all besmear by chocolate drop now the child 's heart be sore for he come to they no more and no more to they he whistle and no more for they he stop but in paradise i think with he chuckle and he wink he be lead little angel to the heavenly candy shop a vanish joy when i be but a little lad of six and seven and eight one joy i know that have be lose in custom up-to-date then Saturday be bake day and mother use to make the while i stand about and watch the Sunday pie and cake and i be there to have fulfil a small boy 's fondest wish the glorious privilege of youth -- to scrape the frosting dish on saturday i never leave to wander far away -- i hover near the kitchen door on mother 's bake day the fragrant smell of cooking seem to hold I in its grip and naught care i for other sport while there be sweet to sip i little care that all my chum have seek the brook to fish i choose to wait that moment glad when i could scrape the dish full many a slice of apple i have lift from a pie before the upper crust go on escape mother 's eye full many a time my finger small in artfulness have stray into some sweet temptation rare which mother 's hand have make but eager-eyed and watery-mouthed i crave the greater boon when mother let I clean the dish and lick the frosting spoon the baking day of old be go we child can not know the glorious joy that childhood own and love so long ago new custom change the life of all and in they heartless way they have rob we of the glad event once know as baking day the store provide we every need yet many a time i wish we kid could know that bygone thrill and scrape the frosting dish carry on they speak it bravely grimly in they darkest hour of doubt they speak it when they hope be low and when they strength give out we hear it from the die in those troubled day now go and they breathe it as they slogan for the living : carry on now the day of strife be over and the sky be fair again but those two brave word of courage on we lip should still remain in the trial which beset we and the care we look upon to we dead we should be faithful -- we have still to carry on carry on through storm and danger carry on through dark despair carry on through hurt and failure carry on through grief and care 'twa the slogan they bequeath we as they fall beside the way and for they and for we child let we carry on to-day life 's single standard there be a thousand way to cheat and a thousand way to sin there be way uncounted to lose the game but there be only one way to win and whether you live by the sweat of you brow or in luxury 's garb you be dress you shall stand at last when you race be run to be judge by the single test some man lie by the thing they make some lie in the deed they do and some play false for a woman 's love and some for a cheer or two some rise to fame by the force of skill grow great by the might of power then wreck the temple they toil to build in a single shameful hour the folly outnumber the virtue good sin lure in a thousand way but slow be the growth of man 's character and patience must mark he day for only those victory shall count when the work of life be do which bear the stamp of a honest man and by courage and faith be win there be a thousand way to fail but only one way to win sham can not cover the wrong you do nor wash out a single sin and never shall victory come to you whatever of skill you do save you have do you best in the work of life and unto you best be true learn to smile the good lord understand we when he teach we how to smile he know we could not stand it to be solemn all the while he know he would have to shape we so that when we heart be gay we could let we neighbor know it in a quick and easy way so he touch the lip of adam and he touch the lip of eve and he say : let these be solemn when you sorrow make you grieve but when all be well in eden and you life seem worth the while let you face wear the glory and the sunshine of a smile teach the symbol to you child pass it down through all the year though they know they share of sadness and shall weep they share of tear through the age man and woman shall prove they faith in I by the smile upon they face when they heart be trouble-free the good lord understand we when he send we down to earth he know we need for laughter and for happy sign of mirth he know we could not stand it to be solemn all the while but must share we joy with other -- so he teach we how to smile the true man this be the sort of a man be he : true when it hurt he a lot to be tight in a corner a ' knowin ' a lie would have help he out but he would not buy he freedom there in so cheap a way -- he tell the truth though he have to pay honest not in the easy sense when he need not worry about expense -- we 'll all play square when it do not count and the sum at stake 's not a large amount -- but he be square when the time be bad a ' keepin ' he word take all he have honor be something we all profess but most of we cheat -- some more some less -- a ' the real test be not the way we do when there be not a pinch in either shoe it be whether we be true to we best or not when the right thing 's certain to hurt a lot that be the sort of a man be he : straight when it hurt he a lot to be time when a lie would have pay he well no matter the cost the truth he would tell a ' he would rather go down to a drab defeat than save himself if he have to cheat clean the furnace last night pa say to ma : my dear it be gettin ' on to fall it be time i do a little job i do not like at all i wisht ` at i be rich enough to hire a man to do the dirty work around this house a ' clean up when he be through but since i be not i be truly glad
