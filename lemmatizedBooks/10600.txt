with the warmest sentiment of respectful esteem and sincere regard dear sir you affectionate friend and gratefully devoted servant robert kerr edinburgh 1st march 1811 preface in this enlighten age when every department of science and literature be make rapid progress and knowledge of every kind excite uncommon interest and be widely diffuse this attempt to call the attention of the public to a systematic arrangement of voyage and travels from the earliest period of authentic history to the present time ought scarcely to require any apology yet on appear before the tribunal of public opinion every author who have not cherish a unreasonable estimate of he own qualification must necessarily be impress with considerable anxiety respect the probable reception of he work and may be expect to offer some account of the plan and motive of what he propose to lay before the public the present work be the first of the kind that have ever be attempt in scotland : and though as already avow in the prospectus the editor have no wish to detract from the merit of similar publication it might appear a overstrained instance of false delicacy to decline a statement of the circumstance which he presume to hope will give some prospect of the work be receive with attention and indulgence perhaps with favor it certainly be the _ only _ general history and collection of voyage and travels that have be hitherto attempt in the english language upon any arrangement that merit the appellation of a _ systematic plan _ and hence should the plan adopt be find only comparatively good in so far the system of arrangement must be pronounce the best that have be as yet devise if this be concede and the fact be too obvious to require extended proof or minute elucidation the editor shall not feel mortified even if he arrangement may be considerably improve hereafter the only work on the subject that have the smallest pretension to system and that be fanciful involve irregular abrupt and obscure be purcha he pilgrim even admit the plan of that work to be in itself excellent although it may be a _ general history _ so far as it extend it certainly be in no respect a _ complete collection _ of voyage and travels in a very large proportion of that curious work it be the _ author _ who speak to the reader and not the _ traveller _ in the present work wherever that could possibly be accomplish it have uniformly be the anxious desire of the editor that the voyager and traveller should tell they own story : in that department of he labor he only object have be to assume the character of _ interpreter _ between they and the reader by translate foreign or antiquated language into modern english sometimes indeed where no record remain of particular voyage and travels as write by the person who perform they the editor have necessarily have recourse to they historian but on every such occasion the most ancient and most authentic accessible source have be anxiously seek after and employ in every extensive work it be of the utmost consequence that its various part should be arrange upon a comprehensive and perspicuously systematic plan this have be accordingly aim at with the utmost solicitude in the present undertaking and the order of its arrangement be adopt after much deliberation and from a very attentive consideration of every general work of the same nature that could be procure if therefore the systematic order on which it be conduct shall appear well adapt to the subject after a attentive perusal and candid investigation the editor confidently hope that he labor may bear a fair comparison with any similar publication that have yet be bring forward in the short prospectus of this work formerly submit to the public a very general enunciation only of the head of the intended plan be attempt as that be then deem sufficient to convey a distinct idea of the nature arrangement and distribution of the propose work unavoidable circumstance still necessarily preclude the possibility or the propriety rather of attempt to give a more full and complete developement of the division and subdivision of the systematic arrangement which be to be pursue and which circumstance may require some elucidation a extensive and minutely arrange plan be carefully devise and extend by the editor before one word of the work be write or compile after a attentive examination of every accessible former collection that plan have be since anxiously reconsider correct altered and extend in the progress of the work as additional material occur : yet the editor consider that the final and public adoption of he plan in a positively fix and pledge systematic form any farther than have be already convey in the prospectus would have the effect to preclude the availment of those new view of the subject which be continually afford by additional material in every progressive step of preparation for the press the number of book of voyage and travels as well general as particular be extremely great and even if the whole be at once before the editor it would too much distract he attention from the division or department in which he be engage for the time to attempt study and abstract every subdivision at once the grand division however which have be already indicate in the prospectus and the general principle of the plan which be there explain be intend to be adhere to as no reason have be discover after the most attentive consideration for any deviation from that carefully adopt arrangement the head of which be here repeat general plan of the work part i _ voyage and travels of discovery in the middle age from the era of alfred king of england in the ninth century to that of don henry of portugal at the commencement of the fourteenth century _ part ii _ general voyage and travels chiefly of discovery from the era of don henry in _ 1412 _ to that of george iii in _ 1760 part iii _ particular voyage and travels arrange in systematic order geographical and chronological note -- this part will be divide into five book comprehend i europe -- ii asia -- iii africa -- iv america -- v australium and polynesium or the prodigious multitude of island in the great : pacific ocean and all these will be further subdivide into particular chapter or section correspondent to the geographical arrangement of these several portion of the globe _ part iv _ general voyage and travels of discovery during the era of george iii which be conduct upon scientific principle and by which the geography of the globe have be nearly perfect _ part v _ historical deduction of the progress of navigation discovery and commerce by sea and land from the earliest time to the present period _ in the deliberate construction of this systematic plan it have be a lead object of anxious consideration to reduce the extensive and interesting material of which the work be compose under a clear intelligible and comprehensive arrangement so combine in a geographical and chronological series that each successive division and subdivision throughout the whole work may prepare the mind of the reader for that which be to follow and may assist the memory in the recollection of what have go before by these means a attentive perusal of this work must necessarily be of material usefulness in fix distinct and just idea of geography history and chronology in the mind of its reader besides the important information and rational amusement which it will afford by the frequent description of manners custom law government and many other circumstance of all the country and nation of the world in determine upon a era for the commencement of this work the editor be naturally lead from a consideration of the accidental discovery of iceland by the norwegian in the _ ninth _ century as coincident with the reign of the great alfred who ascend the throne of england in 872 to adopt that period as the beginning of the series both because the commencement of modern maritime discovery take place during the reign of a british sovereign and because we derive the earliest write account of any of these discovery from the pen of that excellent prince it be true that the first accidental discovery of iceland appear to have be make in 861 eleven year before the accession of alfr to the throne yet as the actual colonization of that island do not take place till the year 878 the seventh of he glorious reign we have be induce to distinguish the actual commencement of maritime discovery by the modern european nation as coincide with he era from that time till the year 1412 when don henry prince of portugal first begin to prosecute a consecutive series of maritime discovery along the western coast of africa during which a long inactive period of 551 year have elapse the only maritime incident connect with we subject be the accidental re-discovery of the canary or fortunate island by a nameless frenchman about the year 1330 though they be not attempt to be take possession of till 1400 this long interval between the era of king alfr and don henry constitute the _ first _ part or grand division of we work in the course of which a considerable number of adventurous traveller penetrate into the almost unknown region of tartary and the east and considerable notice of the empire of china and even of japan and of the coast and island of indium and north-eastern africa be communicate to the european by the polo and other in separate part iv from part ii the general voyage and travels of discovery which have be undertake during the long and busy reign of we present venerable sovereign from those of a similar nature which succeed the discovery of the new world and of the route by sea to india the editor only pay a just tribute to the enlighten spirit of the age under the munificent and enlighten patronage of the beloved monarch of a free and happy people those former voyage of part ii be mostly undertake from mere interested view of direct or expected commercial benefit while these of the era of george iii originate in the grand principle of endeavor to extend the bound of science and human happiness perhaps it may occur to some reader that part v the last in order of the general head of we plan ought to have form part i as partaking of the nature of a introduction to the subject and form a summary of the whole work upon even a very slight consideration however it must be obvious that it be impossible to compose that propose deduction in any adequate manner until the whole mass of select material be possess by the editor and definitively arrange it may likewise be know to many that introduction and preface though usually place at the beginning of book be uniformly and necessarily last compose and usually last print except in new edition a great variety of collection of voyage and travels have be publish at different period many of which be inaccessible from they scarcity or from be in foreign language : and such great number of voyage and travels to particular region and country have be print as to be altogether unattainable by the generality of reader every thing however which could contribute to the perfection of this work have be collect or will be carefully procure during its progress and no pain or expense shall be withhold which can contribute to render it as complete and comprehensive as possible in the employment of the vast variety and extent of excellent material great care shall be take to insert every useful and curious information reduce where necessary to modern language and nothing shall be omit which be conducive to valuable information and rational amusement in we approach towards the present time the multitude of particular voyage and travels increase prodigiously and in employ these it become peculiarly necessary to make a selection of the best in every period and especially of those best adapt for convey just idea of each geographical division and subdivision of the world while those of less merit but which contain useful notice of the region and country of which they treat shall be carefully epitomize in illustration of the different subject without the employment of discriminate selection and occasional abridgement this work must have extend to a inconvenient and consequently expensive size or must have be leave unfinished and abrupt in some of its part : _ but abridgement shall be very seldom employ and never without acknowledgment _ indeed the grand object of the present work be to bring together a more complete and entire collection of voyage and travels than have hitherto appear in any language from the nature of the plan it be utterly impossible to ascertain with any precision the exact length to which it may extend but so far as can be judge of at present it be not expect to exceed eighteen or twenty volume throughout the whole work a series of map and chart will be insert in they proper place carefully select and construct for the purpose of illustrate the various voyage and travels at the close of the whole a complete index will be give to the entire series of volume so arrange as to form a regular _ gazetteer _ of the whole world in every article which have be adopt into this work the original and accessory source of all the material shall be distinctly indicate note of explanation will be give wherever necessary and as many of these be draw from various source the name of the author from whom they be adopt shall always be acknowledge : such note as be mark by the letter e be by the editor of the work owe to the indispensable nature of this work it make no positive claim to the character of a original composition in the strict acceptation of that term and he therefore who have undertake the care of its collection and arrangement assume no higher title than that of _ editor _ in the discharge of that duty however the labor which he have necessarily bestow though always please have often be considerable and sometimes arduous and he trust that the plan of the work which be altogether original will be find appropriately adapt to the end in view and that the execution may appear not inadequate to the high importance of the subject without imputation of arrogance he may be permit to assert that he have exert the most unremitting attention and industry in the collection selection and preparation of the several portion of the whole work and in the arrangement and distribution of its part he have the satisfaction to add that all he effort have be second with the utmost readiness and liberality by the _ proprietor _ of the work who have spare no trouble and withhold no expense in procure and supply the necessary material it be with much grateful satisfaction that the editor have to acknowledge he high obligation to the curator and librarian of the edinburgh public library belong to the faculty of advocate the university and the writer to he majesty 's signet for the communication of many valuable and scarce material nor ought he to withhold he tribute of gratitude on this occasion from the liberal spirit of a private individual the reverend henry white of lichfield who have most obligingly offer the use of he valuable collection of voyage and travels and other curious and scarce work connect with the subject for assist towards the perfection of this publication have thus briefly announce the nature plan and object of the present work of which this _ first _ volume be now before the public it only remain to say that the editor and proprietor each in he particular department be resolve to exert they utmost endeavor that nothing may be omit which can contribute to render the work deserving of public approbation and extensive patronage contents

band of freebooter who during a voyage to the faro island be throw by a storm upon the eastern coast of a unknown country considerably beyond the ordinary course of navigation to which he give the significant name of snio-land or snow-land from the immense quantity of snow which every where cover its numerous lofty mountain even in the height of summer and fill its many valley during a long and dreary winter as naddod give a rather favourable account of he discovery on he return to norway one gardar suafarson of swedish origin who be settle in norway determine upon make a expedition to snow-land in 864 and have circumnavigate the whole extent of this new discovery he name it from himself gardars-holm or gardars-island gardar employ so long a time in this expedition that not deem it safe to navigate the northern ocean during the storm of winter he remain on the island until the ensue spring when he sail for norway he there report that though the island be entirely cover with wood it be in other respects a fine country from the favourable nature of this report one flocke the son of vigvardar who have acquire great reputation among the nordman or norman as a experienced and intrepid vikingr or pirate resolve to visit the newly-discovered island flocke likewise winter in the northern part of the island where he meet with immense quantity of drift ice from which circumstance he choose to give it the name of iceland which it still bear he be by no means please with the country influence no doubt by the unfavourable impression he have imbibe by spend a long protracted winter on the dreary northern shore amid almost ever-during arctic ice and surround by the most unpromising sterility and though some of he companion represent the land as pleasing and fertile the desire of visit iceland seem for some time to have lie dormant among the adventurous norwegian navigator probably because neither fame nor riches could be acquire either by traffic or depredation in a country which be utterly destitute of inhabitant at length in 874 two friend ingolf and lief repair to iceland and be so much satisfied with its appearance that they form a resolution of attempt to make a settlement in the country induce doubtless by a desire to withdraw from the continual war and revolution which then harass the north of europe and to escape from the thraldom which the incipient monarchy of norway denmark and sweden be then impose upon the independent chief or vikingr of the norman in pursuance of this determination ingolf transport some people to iceland about the year 878 with several cattle and all kind of implement to enable he to commence a colony at this period he friend lief be absent in the english war but go soon afterwards into iceland to which he carry the booty which he have acquire in england the first discoverer of iceland be say to have find some irish book bell and crozier on the coast whence it have be imagine that some people from ireland have reside there previous to its discovery and settlement by the norman but it seem a more probable supposition to account for these article have be see that a party of norman pirate or vikingr who have previously land in ireland or perhaps on icolmkil and have carry away the plunder of some abbey or monastery have be drive to iceland by a storm and wreck upon the coast where these article might have be wash on shore : or they may have attribute the storm by which they be drive so far beyond they knowledge to the anger of the god of the christian for they sacrilegious robbery of a holy institution and may have leave these article behind in hope of propitiate a more favourable termination to they voyage the first settler find extensive forest in the valley of iceland and we know from authentic document that corn be formerly cultivate with decent success in that northern region whereas in the present day not a tree be to be find in the whole island except some stunt birch and very low bush or underwood in the most sheltered situation and no corn will now ripen even in the most favourable year but the root and stump of large fir be still to be see in various part and the injurious alteration of its climate be know to have be occasion by the strait between _ old _ greenland and iceland have be many year choke up with ice which the short summer of that high latitude be not sufficiently powerful to dissolve about the present period harold harfagr or the fair-haired one of the petty sovereign or vikingr of norway begin to subjugate the other chieftain of the

have make himself famous by he voyage to unknown part of the north and who be invite to court by alfr to give a account of the discovery and observation he have make during he unusual expedition this person have be a chief of some note in he own country and dwelt at a place which he call halgoland suppose by some to have be in numadalen while other say in nordland the most northerly p province of norway proper in the succeed paragraph he be say to have dwell opposite to the _ west sea _ and as alfr only use the word sea to denote a confine expanse or narrow channel while he call the ocean garsecg it seem highly probable that by the west sea the _ west ford _ be intend -- a channel or strait which divide the luffoden island from the coast of nordland which would clearly place the residence of ohthere in this northern province the account which he give of he voyage to he royal patron be as follow ohthere tell he lord king alfr that lie live to the north of all the nordman or norwegian and that he dwell in that land to the northward opposite to the west sea and that all the land to the north of that sea be waste and uninhabited except in a few place to which the finan -lrb- 2 -rrb- or fin repair in winter for hunting and fowling and for fishing in the summer be desirous to ascertain how far this country extend towards the north and whether there be any inhabitant beyond these waste he proceed by sea due north from he own habitation leave the desert land all the way on the starboard or right-hand and the wide sea on the larboard or left-hand of he course after three day sail he be as far north as the whale-hunter ever go -lrb- 3 -rrb- and then proceed in he course due north for other three day when he find the land instead of stretch due north as hitherto -lrb- 4 -rrb- to trend from thence towards the east whether the sea there lie within the land he know not -lrb- 5 -rrb- as he only wait for a west wind and then sail near that land eastward as far as he could in four day as he find the direction of the coast then to change to due south he wait for a north wind and then sail due south as far as be could in five day in this land he find a large river at the mouth of which he lay to as he could not proceed much farther on account of the inhabitant be hostile all the land on one side of this river be inhabit and tolerably well cultivate but he have not meet with any inhabitant till now since he leave he own country the whole land on he right be a desert and without inhabitant except the fisher fowler and hunter before-mentioned who be all fin and the open sea lay on he left hand during he whole voyage the beorma -lrb- 6 -rrb- indeed have well peopled they country for which reason he do not venture to enter upon it and the land of the terfenna -lrb- 7 -rrb- which he have pass hitherto be all a desert with the exception of the hunter and fisher already mention the beorma tell he many particulars about they land and of the neighbouring country but he could not rely on they account as he have no opportunity of see with he own eye but it seem to he that the beorma and fin speak the same language -lrb- 8 -rrb- ohthere state that he motive for this expedition besides some little curiosity to explore these country which be unknown to he countryman be principally in pursuit of horse-whale -lrb- 9 -rrb- which be valuable because they tusk be excellent ivory some of which he bring to the king and because they hide serve for make into rope for ship this species of the whale be much smaller than the other kind be seldom more than seven ell in length while the other species be often forty-eight ell long and sometimes even fifty in this country be the best whale-fishing that ohthere have ever see the whale be so numerous that he be one of six who kill threescore in three day -lrb- 10 -rrb- ohthere be a very rich man in those thing which be consider as valuable in he country and possess at the time when he come to the king six hundred tame deer none of which he have buy besides which he have six decoy deer which be much in request among the fin as by means of they they be enable to catch wild deer yet though one of the richest man in these part he have only twenty head of cattle twenty sheep and twenty swine and what little land he have in tillage be plough by horse the principal wealth of the norman chief in that country consist in tribute exact from the fin be pay in skin of wild beast feather whalebone cable and rope for ship make from the hide of whale or seal every one pay in proportion to he substance : the wealthiest pay the skin of fifteen martin five rein-deer skin and one bear-skin a coat or cloak make of bear-skin or otter skin and two cable or ship rope of sixty ell long each one of which be make of whale hide and the other from the skin of seal accord to the description give to the king by ohthere northmanna-land or norway be very long and narrow all the land which be fit for pasture or tillage be on the seacoast which be very rocky in some place to the east of this and parallel to the cultivate land there be wild and huge mountain and moor which be inhabit by the fin the cultivate land be broadest in the south -lrb- 11 -rrb- where it be sixty mile broad and in some place more about the middle of the country it be perhaps thirty mile broad or somewhat more and where it be narrowest in the north it be hardly more than three mile from the sea to the moor in some place the moor be so extensive that a man can hardly travel across they in a fortnight and in other place perhaps in six day opposite to the south part of this country be sueoland -lrb- 12 -rrb- or sweden on the other side of the moor and opposite to its northern part be

very large _ mere _ or lake of fresh water and the cwena -lrb- 13 -rrb- sometimes carry they small light ship over land into these lake and employ they to facilitate they depredation on the nordmen ohthere say that the shire or district which he inhabit be call halgoland and that there be no inhabitant beyond he to the north there be likewise a port in the southern land which be call sciringes-heal -lrb- 14 -rrb- which no one could reach in a month 's sailing even with a fair wind at least if he lay to at night during this voyage the navigator must sail near the land or make a coast voyage along the coast of norway towards the south have _ iraland _ -lrb- 15 -rrb- and the island which be between that country and norway on he right hand for this country continue all the way on the left hand of the navigator from halgoland to sciringes-heal as he proceed again to the northward a great sea to the south of sciringes-heal run up into this land and that sea be so wide that a person can not see across it gotland -lrb- 16 -rrb- be opposite on the other side or right-hand and afterwards the sea of sillende -lrb- 17 -rrb- lie many mile up in that country ohthere farther say that he sail in five day from sciringes-heal to that port which be call haethum -lrb- 18 -rrb- which lie between winedum seaxun and anglen and make part of dene when he sail to this place from sciringes-heal dene or denmark be on he left and on he right be a wide sea for three day as be also on he right two day before he come to haethum gotland sillende and many other island which be inhabit by the angle before they come to britain and during these two day the island belong to denmark be on he left hand -lrb- 1 -rrb- anglo-saxon version of orosius by alfr the great translate by daine barrington p 9 -- langebeck script dan ii 106-118 -- forster voy and disc in the north p 53 -lrb- 2 -rrb- ohthere here call the inhabitant of the desert fin and it would appear that the laplander be actually fin or finlander the name of lap or laplander be of modern origin and the dane and norwegian still call this country finmark -- forst -lrb- 3 -rrb- in former translation of alfr this passage be render as follow : he be within three day sail of be as far north as the whale-hunter ever go this expression be vague and ambiguous and rather mean that the residence from whence he set out be within three day sail & c whereas the next member of the same sentence distinctly indicate a precede three day sail as in the adopt translation -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- this be not quite accurate as the coast of norway in the course of ohthere stretch nne he be now arrive at the north cape whence the coast towards the white sea trend e and by n -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- this doubt of whether the sea lie within the land or not probably refer to the numerous inlet or fiord along the whole coast of norway and finmark and may mean that he do not examine whether the land might not be parcel out into innumerable island -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- the beorma be the biarmian or permian of the northern writer and perm or permium be still mention among the numerous title of the emperor of russium -- forat -lrb- 7 -rrb- the terfenna be mention as different from the scrite-fennas these be distinguish by guido the geographer of ravenna in the seventh century into rerefinnus and scritifinnus the latter live entirely by hunting and wear snow-shoe in winter call schrit the former subsist on they herd of rein-deer and perhaps ought to have be therefore call rene-finnus the name in the text ought perhaps to have be rhane-fenna as he tell we they have rein-deer and employ decoy deer to catch the wild perhaps fer-fenna from they travel in sledge from farra to travel in a carriage -- forst -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be highly probable from this remark in which ohthere could not be mistake as it will appear in the sequel that he must have be perfectly well acquaint with the fin that the biarmian be a branch of the great finnish stock the principal difference seem to have be that the fin continue to be wander hunter and herdsman while the beorma or biarmian have advance to the state of fix cultivator of the soil they have likewise a idol call jomalum which be still the name of one of the deity of the finlander -- forst -lrb- 9 -rrb- the morse be here name horse-whale by king alfr with infinitely greater propriety than the appellation of sea-horse which long prevail in we language the tusk of this animal be still consider as excellent ivory and be peculiarly valuable for the construction of false tooth and leather make from the hide be still use in russium for coach-harness but stretch more when wet than any other leather -- forst -lrb- 10 -rrb- it would appear from the vast number kill that this successful fishing must refer to the morse or horse-whale not to the ordinary large whale -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- in the original the broad and comparatively fertile part of norway be say to be in the _ east _ : the correction adopt in the text be obvious and necessary -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- in former translation this passage be : opposite to this land _ to _ the south be sueoland the alteration in the text remove the ambiguity -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- cwenland and the cwena appear to refer to lapmark and its inhabitant the finlander -- forst -lrb- 14 -rrb- see sect iii p 12 in which this place be suppose by mr j r forster to have be where stockholm now be -lrb- 15 -rrb- iraland obviously here mean scotland with the faro shetland and orkney island -- e -lrb- 16 -rrb- this be plainly the isle of gothland -- e -lrb- 17 -rrb- apparently the baltic proper be here call the sea of sillende and may have be name from the isle of zeeland yet in this passage it seem to refer to the gulf of bothnium as run far up into the country -- e -lrb- 18 -rrb- see sect iii p 14 in which forster endeavor to fix this place at aarhuus in jutland section iii _ remark by j m forster respect the situation of sciringes-heal and haethum _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- the name of this place sciringes-heal have give a great deal of trouble to former commentator on alfred viz sir john spelman bussaeus somner john philip murray and langebeck who have all choose spot totally different in which to place sciringes-heal spelman and other look for this place near dantzic where in they opinion the scyre formerly reside but first the spot where the scyre live be by no means satisfactorily determine and next it be evident that ohthere go continually along the coast from halgoland to sciringes-heal and that this coast be on he left-hand during the whole course of he navigation the late mr murray place sciringes-heal at skanor in the southern extremity of sweden but i can not think that this place could be five day sail from haethum in jutland as it be expressly declare to have be by ohthere langebeck be for carry sciringes-heal to konga-hellum on the guatelf near marstrand and insist that the name in alfred 's account of the voyage ought to have be write cyninges-heal instead of sciringes-heal if the word have only once occur i might have allow langebeck to be right but we meet with it five time in the space of a few line and always without the slightest variation in orthography 2dly the voyage from halgoland to konga-hellum be not of sufficient extent to have employ a month in the passage 3dly konga-hellum be too near jutland to have require five day for the voyage between it and haethum have demonstrate the insufficiency of these conjecture we shall now endeavor to point out where sciringes-heal be really situate paul warenfry in he historium longobardorum lib i cap 7 and 10 make mention of a district name scorunga in which the winilus or lombard reside for some time before they remove to mairinga and from thence farther on to gotland anthabet bethaib and purgendaid this scorunga be not far from gotland and consequently in sweden and seem to have be the district in which sciringes-heal be situate add to this that ohthere after have describe sueoland or sweden as be to the southward of he habitation immediately say there be a port in this southern land which be call sciringes-heal by this he seem plainly to indicate that this place certainly be in sweden and all this will appear still more evidently if we carefully follow the course of the voyage which he describe first of all he have scotland call iraland evidently by mistake and the orkney and shetland island which lie between scotland and halgoland on he right hand and the continent be continually on he left hand all the way until he arrive at sciringe - heal but farther a large bay stretch to the northward deep into the country along the coast of which he have be continually sailing and this bay commence quite to the southward of sciringes-heal and be so broad that a man can not see across and gotland be directly opposite to this bay -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the sea which extend from zeeland to this spot go many hundred mile up into the country to the eastward from sciringes-heal ohthere could sail in five day to haethum which lie between the wend saxon and angle now by this voyage we be enable to determine with still greater exactness the situation of this place which we be search for in order to get to haethum he leave gotland on the right -lrb- 3 -rrb- and soon afterwards zeeland likewise together with the other island which have be the habitation of the angle before they go to england while those which belong to denmark be on he left for two day sciringes-heal therefore be consequently in sweden at the entrance of the gulf of bothnium which run up into the land northwards just on that spot where the baltic after have pass zeeland spread into a wide gulf extend several hundred mile into the land just in this place i find the svia-sciaeren or swedish scare a cluster of little island surround by rock heal in the northern language signify a port as in such place a ship might be keep in safety sciringes-heal therefore be the harbor of the scare and be probably at the entrance of the gulf of bothnium and consequently where stockholm now be and the tract of land where these scare lay towards the sea be the scarunga of paul warenfry the port of hasthum have occasion much difficulty to the commentator as well as that of sciringes-heal but all have agree that it must be sleswic as this latter be call haitha by ethelwerd the anglo-saxon a norwegian poet give it the name of heythabae other call it heydaboe and adam of breman heidaba and this in they opinion be precisely the same with haethum it appear to I however that the difference between the word haethaby and hasthum be by no means so inconsiderable and i think the situation of sleswic do not at all accord with the description which be give of haethum by ohthere and wulfstan indeed if sleswic be haethum i must confess that i can not in the least comprehend the course of the voyage of these ancient navigator ohthere tell we that in sailing from sciringes-heal to haethum he have denmark to the left and the open sea for the space of three day to the right but that for two day before he reach haethum he have gotland and zeeland to the right and the island which belong to denmark to the leave if he have go to sleswic he must have find all the danish island on he right hand and not one besides femeren on he left this be consider i ask how it be possible consistent with he own description of the voyage that the situation of sleswic can be make to correspond with haethum as in the district of aarhuus in jutland there be a extensive track of land call alheide which be in fact a heath i shall take the liberty to suppose that the town in the ninth century lay higher up towards al-heide or all-heath for the town of aar-huus be new and its name signify in english oar-house the old town therefore may have be call al-haethum or haethum so that if ohthere set out from stockholm for this place gotland be on he right hand -lrb- 4 -rrb- and so be zealand and as he sail between zealand and funen or fyen all the danish island be on he left hand and he have the wide sea that be the schager-rack and cattegat to the right farther when wulfsten go from haethum or aarhuus to truso he have weonothland that be funen fionium or fyen to he right and to the leave be langeland laeland falster and sconeg together with bornholm bleking moehre oeland and gotland but wendenland remain on he right all the way to the mouth of the vistulum -lrb- 1 -rrb- forst voy and disc 67 -lrb- 2 -rrb- it appear to I that the description give by ohthere imply that gotland be directly opposite to sciringes-heal or to the east -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- not surely on go southwards but after he have again turn to the northwards after double the southern point of sweden -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- this be certainly true during the latter part of he voyage after turn round the south end of sweden and standing again to the northward between zealand and fyen but in coast down the shore of sweden to the south he must have leave gotland to the leave -- e section iv _ voyage of wulfstan in the baltic as related to alfred _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- wulfstan say that he sail from haethum to truso -lrb- 2 -rrb- in seven day and night the ship be under sail all the time weonothland -lrb- 3 -rrb- be on he right but langaland laeland falster and sconeg be on the leave all of which belong to dene-mearkan -lrb- 4 -rrb- burgendaland -lrb- 5 -rrb- also which have a king of its own be on the leave after leave burgendaland the island of becinga-eg meore eowland and gotland be on the leave all of which belong to sueon -lrb- 6 -rrb- and weonodland -lrb- 7 -rrb- be all the way on the right to the mouth of the wisle -lrb- 8 -rrb- this be a very large river and near it witland -lrb- 9 -rrb- and weonodland be situate the former of which belong to estum and the wisle do not run through weonodland but through estmere -lrb- 10 -rrb- which lake be fifteen mile broad then run the ilfing -lrb- 11 -rrb- from the eastward into est-mere on the bank of which be truso the ilfing flow from est-land into the est-mere from the east and the wisle through weonodland from the south the ilfing have join the wisle take its name and run to the west of estmere and northward into the sea where it be call wisle-mouth -lrb- 12 -rrb- est-land be a large track of country have many town in each of which there be a king it produce a great quantity of honey and have abundance of fish the king and other rich man drink mare milk while the poor people and slave use only mead -lrb- 13 -rrb- they have many contest among themselves and the people of estum brew no ale as they have mead in profusion -lrb- 14 -rrb- there be also a particular custom observe by this nation that when any one die the body remain unburnt with the relation and friend for a month or two and the body of king and noble remain longer accord to they respective wealth sometimes for half a year during all which time it be keep in the house and drinking and sport continue until the body be consume -lrb- 15 -rrb- when the body be carry to the funeral pile the substance of the deceased which yet remain after the sport and drinking bout be divide into five or six heap or more accord to its value these heap be place at the distance of a mile from each other the largest heap at the greatest distance from the town and the lesser heap gradually diminish so that the smallest heap be nearest to the town where the dead body lie then all be summon who have fleet horse within the distance of five or six mile around and they all strive for the substance of the dead person he who have the swiftest horse gain the most distant and largest heap and the other in just proportion till the whole be win then every one take away he share as he own property : and owe to this custom swift horse be in great request and extremely dear when the wealth of the decease have be thus exhaust the body be take from the house and burn together with the dead man 's weapon and clothes and generally they expend the whole wealth of the decease by keep the body so long in the house before it be burnt and by these heap which be carry off by stranger it be the custom with the estum to burn the body of all the inhabitant and if any one can find a single bone unconsumed it be a cause of great offence these people also have the means of produce a very severe cold by which the dead body continue so long above ground without putrefy and by means of which if any one set a vessel of ale or water in the place they contrive that the liquor shall be freeze either in winter or summer -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- alfr 's orosius by barrington p 16 langebeck scrip dan ii 118 - 123 wulfstan appear to have be a dane who have probably become acquaint with ohthere during he maritime expedition and have go with he to reside in england -- forst -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be a lake still call truso or drausen between elbing and prussian holland from which probably the town here mention which stand on the frisch-haf take its name -- forst -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be necessary to distinguish accurately between weonothland which be probably fuehnen funen or fionio now call fyen and weonodland or winodland afterwards wendenland -- forst -lrb- 4 -rrb- denmark obviously call simply dene in the voyage of ohthere -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- probably bornholm -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- call sueoland in the voyage of ohthere be assuredly sweden to which all these island belong becinga-eg be certainly bleke the _ l _ be omit in transcription call a island by mistake meore be indisputably the upper and lower moehre in smoland eowland be oeland and gotland be doubtless the modern isle of that name -- forst -lrb- 7 -rrb- weonodland or winodland extend to the mouth of the vistulum and be obviously a peculiar and independent country totally different from weonothland belong to denmark -- forst -lrb- 8 -rrb- wisle or wislum be the sclavonian orthography for the vistulum call weichsel by the german and weissel by the prussian -- forst -lrb- 9 -rrb- witland be a district of samland in prussium it have this name of witland at the time of the crusade of the german against prussium the word wit-land be a translation of the native term baltikka or the white land now apply to the baltic sea -- forst -lrb- 10 -rrb- est-mere a lake of fresh water into which the elbing and vistulum empty themselves now call frisch-haf or the fresh water sea -- forst -lrb- 11 -rrb- this be undoubtedly the elbing which flow from lake drausen or truso and join by one of its branch that arm of the vistulum which be call neugat or nogat -- forst -lrb- 12 -rrb- the ilfing or elbing come out of esthonium yet not from the east as here say by alfred but from the south except indeed he mean that arm of the elbing which run into the nogat or eastern arm of the vistulum but the vistulum come out of wendenland call weonodland in the text from the south and the two river discharge themselves into the frisch-haf which stretch from west to north or in a north-east direction and at pilau go northwards into the sea it be certainly possible that this entrance may have be formerly call wisle-mund or the mouth of the vistulum as well as the western mouth of that river -- forst this concession be not necessary to the truth of wulfstan and alfr there be a cross branch from elb which join the nogat and vistulum proper and which be probably mean in the text where the ilfing and wisle unite be say to run to the west of est-mere or the haf and then north into the sea at wisle-mund -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- this circumstance be singular yet may be explain from the custom of the tartar the mare milk drink by the king and rich man be certainly prepare into cosmos or kumyss the favorite beverage of the great while mead a much inferior liquor in they estimation be leave to the lower order -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- mead be call medo in anglo-saxon in lithuanian middus in polish miod in russian md in german meth in old english metheglin : perhaps all these be from the greek verb -lrb- greek : methuo -rrb- to intoxicate alfred naturally observe that these drinking-bout produce many fray and notice the reason of the estum or esthonian brew no ale because they have abundance of mead -- forst -lrb- 15 -rrb- in a treaty between the teutonic knight and the newly convert prussian the latter engage never to burn they dead nor to bury they with they horse arm clothes and valuable -- forst -lrb- 16 -rrb- this power of produce cold in summer so much admire by wulfstan and alfr be probably the effect of a good ice-cellar which every prussian of condition have in or near he house

of which be yet to be see in the monument of he church in the foregoing account of the voyage of sighelm from the first notice in the saxon chronicle through the addition of malmsbury and the amplify

conception to the plain historical fact thus a motely rhetorical tissue of real incident and downright fable be impose upon the world which each successive author continually improve into deeper falsehood we have here likewise a instance of the way in which ancient manuscript first illustrate by commentary become interpolate by successive transcriber adopt those illustration into the text and how many fabricator of story first mislead by these additament and afterwards mislead the public through a vain desire of produce a morsel of eloquence although continually quote original and contemporary authority have acquire the undeserved fame of excellent historian while a multitude of the incident which they relate have no foundation whatever in the truth of record he only who have diligently and faithfully labor through original record and contemporary writer honestly endeavor to compose the authentic history of a interesting period and have carefully compare in he progress the flippant worse than inaccuracy of writer he have be teach to consider as masterly historian can form a adequate estimate of the enormity and frequency of this tendency to romance the immediate subject

end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century and who publish a kind of history of the world down to a d 416 which remain in good repute among the learn till about a hundred year ago but be now much neglect near a thousand year ago the work of orosius be translate into anglo-saxon by alfred king of england but with great freedom and much licence often use he author merely as a foundation for a paraphrase omit most of the introductory chapter to each book sometimes leave out considerable passage and often insert new matter this be peculiarly the case with the first chapter of the first book contain the whole of the geography and which be all that have any reference to the nature of we work the honorable daine barrington who publish the anglo-saxon version with a english translation inform we that the original m be in the cotton library _ tiberius _ i and be suppose to have be write in the ninth or tenth century but that in make he translation he use a transcript make by mr elstob occasionally collate with the cotton m and with some other transcript but before publish a work of such curiosity and interest he ought to have make sure of possess a perfect copy by the most scrupulous comparison of he transcript with the original m in the follow republication of the geographical chapter much care have be take to correct error chiefly in regard to direction as east west north and south be often use interchangeably in the translation by mr barrington most of the note be from that edition or from jr forster who reprint so much of this chapter as refer to northern geography and who appear to have study that part of the subject with great care as a specimen of the anglo-saxon or the language of england near a thousand year ago we have give the first sentence of

the world not indeed that it contain so much land as the other because the mediterranean cut it as it be in two break in more upon the south part than on the north -lrb- 74 -rrb- and because the heat be more intense in the south than the cold in the north and because every _ wight _ thrive better in cold than in heat therefore be africa inferior to europe both in the number of its people and in

in the plural -- barr -lrb- 3 -rrb- call wenadel sea in the anglo-saxon original probably because it have be cross by the vandal or wend in go from spain to the conquest of africa -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- in the translation by barrington this sentence be quite unintelligible all to the northward be asia and to the southward europe and asia be separate by the tanai then south of this same river -lrb- along the mediterranean and west of alexandrium -rrb- europe and asia join -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- riff in the anglo-saxon -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- sermondisc in the anglo-saxon sarmaticus in orosius -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- rochouasco in anglo-saxon roxolanus in orosius -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- certainly here put for ireland -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- taprobana serendib or ceylon -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- by the red sea must be here mean that which extend between the peninsula of indium and africa call the erithrean sea in the periplus of nearchus -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- the persian gulf be here assume as a part of the red sea -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- he be here obviously enumerate the division of the latter persian empire orocassium be certainly the arachosium of the ancient asilium and pasitha may be assyrium and proper persium -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- the saxon word be _ beorhta _ or bright which i have venture to translate _ parch by the sun _ as this signification agree well with the context -- barr -lrb- 14 -rrb- the true niger run from the westward till it lose itself in the sand of wangara seem here allude to and the bahr el abiad or western nile be suppose to be its continuation rise again out of the sand -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- this ought certainly to be _ after _ and seem to allude to the bahr el abiad -- e -lrb- 16 -rrb- literally _ a great sea _ -- barr -lrb- 17 -rrb- this be a mistake as it only take a wide turn to the west in dongolum around what have be falsely call the isle of meroe the cliff of the red sea seem to imply the mountain of nubium and the wide sea may be the lake of dembea -- e -lrb- 18 -rrb- a strange attempt to account for the regular overflow of the nile -- e -lrb- 19 -rrb- this account of the boundary of old scythium be extremely vague it seem to imply a eastern boundary by a imaginary river bear that the caspian be the western the northern ocean on the north and mount caucasus on the south -- e -lrb- 20 -rrb- in the translation by barrington this portion of scythium be strangely say to extend south to the mediterranean the interpolation surely of some ignorant transcriber who perhaps change the euxine or caspian sea into the mediterranean -- e -lrb- 21 -rrb- call by mistake or erroneous transcription wendel sea or mediterranean in the text and translation -- e -lrb- 22 -rrb- the cwen sea be the white sea or sea of archangel the kwen or cwen nation be that now call finlander from whom that sea receive this ancient appellation -- forst -lrb- 23 -rrb- east francan in the original the eastern frank dwell in that part of germany between the rhine and the salum in the north reach to the ruhre and cassel and in the south almost to the necker accord to eginhard inhabit from saxony to the danube they be call east frank to distinguish they from that other part of the nation which inhabit ancient gaul and franconium continue to preserve they name -- forst -lrb- 24 -rrb- swaepa or sueva who form part of the allemanic confederacy and afterwards give they name of swabe to a extensive nation in whose bound modern swabium be still situate -- forst -lrb- 25 -rrb- the bavarian who be the remnant of the boius or baeghten who escape from the exterminate sword of the suevus -- forst -lrb- 26 -rrb- this may have be the province in which regens-bergh or ratisbon be still situate -- forst -lrb- 27 -rrb- these be undoubtedly the bohemian call afterwards behemas by we royal geographer they have they appellation from boier-heim or the dwelling place of the boius who be exterminate by the suevus -- forst -lrb- 28 -rrb- the thuringian at one time so powerful that they king be able to engage in war against the king of the frank thuringium be still a well know district in germany -- forst -lrb- 29 -rrb- the old saxon inhabit the country still call old sassen or old saxony halsatium in latin which have degenerate into holstein -- forst -lrb- 30 -rrb- these frysa be afterwards confine by charlemain to the country between the weser and elbe to which they give the name of friesland -- forst -lrb- 31 -rrb- that be to the north-east of old saxony where the angle confederate of the saxon conqueror of britain and who give they name to the english nation and england or angle-land formerly reside but they likewise appear to have occupy some of the island in the baltic sillend be certainly the danish island of zeeland dene be denmark in its most limited sense -- forst -lrb- 32 -rrb- these be the obotrite a venedic nation settle in mecklenburgh who be call a little farther on the _ afdrede _ they be not however to the north-east of old saxony but rather to the eastward perhaps the copyist insert north instead of east or rather we ought to read thus : to the north-east be apdrede and to the north the wold -- forst -lrb- 33 -rrb- the word here translate _ wold _ on the authority of daine barrington be in the original _ wylte _ but whether it refer to the _ wild _ or barren state of the country or the name of a people it be difficult to say there be a people name wilzus in those part but j r forster be dispose to believe that alfred refer here to the wend or vandal who live on the havel and be call hevellus but if they be mean we must correct the text from north-east to south-east for such be the situation of havel-land with respect to old saxony -- forst -lrb- 34 -rrb- aefeldan be as king alfr call they wold or wild as there still be in the middle of jutland large high moor cover only with heath -- forst -lrb- 35 -rrb- wineda-land the land of the wend vandal or wendian scalvus in mecklenburg and pomeranium so call from _ wanda _ or _ woda _ signify the sea or water they be likewise call pomeranian for the same reason from _ po moriu _ or the people by the sea side -- forst -lrb- 36 -rrb- in this alfred seem to have commit a mistake or to have make too great a leap there be a syssel however in the country of the wend on the baltic which connect they with the moravian or rather with the delamensan of whom mention be make afterwards -- forst -lrb- 57 -rrb- the moravian so call from the river morava at that time a powerful kingdom govern by swatopluk and of much greater extent than modern moravium -- forst -lrb- 38 -rrb- carendre must be carinthium or the country of the carender or centanus which then include austrium and styrium -- forst -lrb- 39 -rrb- barrington have erroneously translate this to the eastward

europe and africa but the sense be extremely perplexed and even unintelligible -- e -lrb- 75 -rrb- it must be notice that alfred be unacquainted with any more of africa than its northern coast along the mediterranean which explain this erroneous idea of its size be inferior to europe -- e -lrb- 76 -rrb- syrenaica -- e -lrb- 77 -rrb- the red sea or ethiopic gulf in this part of the geography of

specimen some of which be considerably interesting and curious in some measure these section do not strictly belong to the present chapter as limit to the reign of alfred and the ninth century but as they contain isolate circumstance which do not otherwise properly arrange themselves into the order of we plan they may be consider as form a kind of appendix to the era of alfr the number of these

year he represent he new discovery in the fairest light bestow lavish praise on the rich meadow fine wood and plentiful fishery of the country which he call greenland that he might induce a

credit of the great northern historian snorro sturleson judge of iceland who write in the year 1215 yet other assert that greenland have be know long before and grind they assertion on letters-patent

greenlander halsingalander icelander and scridevind even allow both charter and bull to be genuine it be probable that the copy which have come down to we time be interpolate and that for gronlandon and islandon we ought to read quenlandon and hitlandon mean the finlander and hitlander : quenland be the old name of finland and hitland or hialtaland the norwegian name of the shetland island it be even not improbable that all the name in these ancient deed after the sueone dane and sclavonian have be interpolate in a later period as st rembert the immediate successor of ansgar and who write he life only mention the sueone dane and sclavonian together with other nation in the north and even adam of breman only mention these three and other neighbouring and surround nation -lrb- 2 -rrb- hence the authority of st rembert and snorro sturleson remain firm and unshaken in spite of these falsified copy of the papal bull and imperial patent and we may rest assure that iceland be not discover

report be give of the travels of another mahomedan into china the m employ by renaudot belong to the library of the count de seignelay and appear to have be write in the year 619 of the hegira or ad 1173 the great value of this work be that it contain the very earliest account of china pen above four hundred year earlier than the travels of marco polo who be esteem the first author on the subject before this publication appear there be many curious and remarkable passage in these travels which convey information respect custom and event that be nowhere else to be find and though some of these carry a fabulous appearance the greatest part of they have be confirm and justify by the best writer in succeed age the first portion or the actual narrative begin abruptly on account of some portion of the original manuscript be lose which would probably have give the name and country of the author and the date and occasion of he voyage in the accompany commentary by abu zeid we be inform that the date of the narrative be of the hegira 237 ad 851 which circumstance be probably contain in the miss part of the manuscript but though write then it be probable that the first journey of the author be undertake at least twenty year before that date or in 831 as he observe that he make a second journey into the same country sixteen year afterwards and we may allow four year for the time spend in the two journy and the intervene space besides the delay of composition after he last return though not mention it be probable he travels be undertake for the purpose of trade as we can hardly suppose he to have twice visit those distant country merely for the satisfaction of curiosity with regard to the second treatise or commentary it seem probable that when the affair of china become better know some prince or person of distinction have desire abu zeid to examine the former relation and to inform he how far the fact of the original work be confirm by succeed account the date of the commentary be not certainly ascertainable yet it appear that eben wahab travel into china ah 285 ad 898 and that abu zeid have converse with this man after he return and have receive from he the fact which be insert in he discourse which therefore be probably only sixty or seventy year posterior to the actual treatise of the nameless traveller -lrb- 1 -rrb- translation from renaudot 8vo lond 1733 see likewise harris i 522 section i _ original account of indium and china by a mahomedan traveller of the ninth century _ the _ third _ of the sea we have to mention be that of herkend

full the workman in these island be exceedingly expert and make shirt and vest or tunic all of one piece of the fiber of the cocoa nut of the same tree they build ship and house and they be skilful in all other workmanship they shell they have from the sea at certain time when they rise up to the surface and the inhabitant throw branch of the cocoa nut tree into the water to which the shell stick these shell they call kaptaje beyond these island and in the sea of herkend be serendib -lrb- 4 -rrb- or ceylon the chief of all these island which be call dobijat it be entirely surround by the sea and on its coast they fish for pearl in this country there be a mountain call rahun to the top of which adam be say to have ascend where he leave the print of he foot seventy cubit long on a rock and

in length and they go quite naked they have no sort of bark or other vessel or they would seize and devour all the passenger they could lay they hand upon when ship have be keep back by contrary wind and be oblige to anchor on this barbarous coast for procure water they commonly lose some of they man beyond this there be a inhabit mountainous island which be say to contain mine of silver but as it do not lie in the usual track of ship many have search for it in vain though remarkable for a very lofty mountain call kashenai a ship sailing in its latitude once get sight of this mountain and steer for the coast where some people be send on shore to cut wood : the man kindle a fire from which there run out some melt silver on which they conclude that there must have be a silver mine in the place and they ship a considerable quantity of the earth or ore but they encounter a terrible storm on they voyage back and be force to throw all they ore overboard to lighten the vessel since that time the mountain have be several time carefully seek for but no one have ever be able to find it again there be many such island in those sea more in number than can be reckon some inaccessible by seaman and some unknown to they it often happen in these sea that a whitish cloud suddenly appear over-head which let down a long thin tongue or spout quite to the surface of the water which be then turn swiftly round as if by a whirlwind and if a vessel happen to be in the way she be immediately swallow up in the vortex at length this cloud mount up again and discharge itself in prodigious rain but it be not know whether this water be suck up by the cloud or how this phenomenon come to pass all these sea be subject to prodigious storm which make they boil up like water over a fire at which time the wave dash the ship against the island with unspeakable violence to they utter destruction and even fish of all size be throw dead on shore against the rock by the extreme agitation of the sea the wind which commonly blow upon the sea of herkend be from a different quarter or from the nw but this sea be likewise subject to as violent agitation as those just mention and there ambergri be tear up from the bottom particularly where it be very deep and the deeper the sea so much the more valuable be the ambergris which it produce it be likewise observe that when this sea be toss by tempestuous wind it sparkle like fire and it be infested with a certain kind of fish call lockham which frequently prey upon man -lrb- 5 -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* among other circumstance the fire which frequently happen

commodity or thirty per cent as duty and return the rest to the merchant besides which if the emperor have a mind for any particular article he officer have a right of take it in preference to any other person pay for it however to the utmost value and they dispatch this business with great expedition and without the least injustice they commonly take the whole importation of camphor on the account of the emperor and pay for it at the rate of fifty _ fakuge _ per _ man _ each fakuge be worth a thousand _ falus _ or piece of copper coin when it happen that the emperor do not take the camphor it sell for half as much again the chinese do not bury they dead till the day twelve month after they decease but keep they all this time in coffin in some part of they house have previously

all this time they cease not from bewail they loss insomuch that they expence upon these occasion in pay the last duty to they deceased relation be exorbitant and often consume they wealth and estate to the utter ruin of the living in former time they bury very rich apparel and those expensive girdle already mention with the body of they king and other of the blood royal but this custom be now

those of the greater city such as canfu be stile _ difu _ and the eunuch or lieutenant be stile _ tukam _ these lieutenant be select from among the inhabitant of the city there be also a supreme judge call _ lakshima-makvan _ and they have other name for other officer which we do not know how properly to express a person be never raise to the dignity of a prince or governor of a city until he have attain to he fortieth year for then they say he have acquire experience when one of these prince or viceroy hold he court in the city of he residence he be seat on a tribunal in great state and receive the petition or complaint of the people have a officer call _ lieu _ who stand behind the tribunal and indorse a answer upon the petition accord to the order of the viceroy for they null no

by such a man the son of such a man : and if the clerk be guilty of any error or mistake he be punish with the bamboo the viceroy never seat himself on he tribunal until he have eat and drink lest he should be mistake in some thing and he receive he subsistence from the public treasury of the city over which he preside the emperor who be above all these prince or petty king never appear in public but once in ten month under the idea that the people would lose they veneration for he if he shew himself oftener for they hold it as a maxim that government can only subsist by means of force as the people be ignorant of the principle of justice and that constraint and violence be necessary to maintain among they the majesty of empire there be no tax impose upon the land but all the man of the country be subject to a poll-tax in proportion to they substance when any failure of crop make necessaries dear the king open he store-house to the people and soil all sort of necessaries at much cheaper rate than they can be have in the market by which mean famine be prevent and no dearth be of any long continuance the sum that be gather by this capitation tax be lay up in the public treasury and i believe that from this tax fifty thousand dinar be pay every day into the null of canfu alone although that city be not one of the largest the emperor reserve to himself the revenue which arise from the salt mine and those which be derive from imposition upon a certain herb call _ tcha _ which they drink with hot water and of which vast quantity be sell in all the city in china this be produce from a shrub more bushy than the pomegranate tree and of a more pleasant smell but have a kind of a bitterish taste the way of use this herb be to pour boiling water upon the leaf and the infusion cure all disease whatever sum come into the public treasury arise from the capitation tax the duty upon salt and the tax upon this leaf in every city there be a small bell hang to the wall immediately over the head of the viceroy or governor which may be ring by a string which reach about three mile and cross the high way on purpose that all the people may have access to it und whenever the string be pull and the bell strike the person who thus demand justice be immediately command to be bring into the presence where he set forth he case in person if any person incline to travel from one part of the country to another he must have two pass along with he one from the governor and the other from the lieutenant the governor 's pass permit he to set out on he journey and specify the name of the traveller and of all that be in he company with they name and age for every person in china whether native arab or other foreigner be oblige to make a full declaration of every thing he know about himself the lieutenant 's pass specify the exact quantity of goods and money which the traveller and he company take along with they and this be do for the information of the frontier place where both pass be regularly examine for whenever a person arrive at any of these place it be enter in the register that such a one the son of such a one of such a family pass through the place in such a month day and year and in such company by this mean they prevent any one from carry off the money or effect of other or the loss of they own goods in case of accident so that if any thing have be take away unjustly or if the traveller should die on the road it may be immediately know where the thing be to be find that they may be restore to the claimant or to the heir of the decease the chinese administer justice with great strictness in all they tribunal when any person commence a suit against another he set down he claim in write and the defendant write down he defense which he sign and hold between he finger these two writings be deliver in at the same time and be examine sentence be pronounce in write each of the party have he papers return to he the defendant have he

_ fakuge _ which amount to about two hundred dinar and the punishment of the bamboo be so severe that the criminal can hardly survive and no person in all china be permit to inflict it upon another by he own authority on pain of death and confiscation of he goods so that no one be ever so hardy as to expose himself to such certain danger by which mean justice be well administer to all no witness be require neither do they put the party upon oath when any person become bankrupt he be immediately commit to prison in the governor 's palace and be call upon for a declaration of he effect after he have remain a month in prison he be liberate by the governor 's order and a proclamation be make that such a person the son of such a one have consume the goods of such a one and that if any person

satisfaction of the magistrate that he have nothing in the world the creditor be call in and receive a part of they claim from the treasury of the bagbun this be the ordinary title of the emperor of china and signify the son of heaven which we ordinarily pronounce magbun after this it be publickly forbid to buy of or sell to the bankrupt that he may not again have a opportunity of defraud he creditor by conceal they money or effect if it be discover that the bankrupt have any money or effect in the hand of another and that person make no disclosure within the time limit the person guilty of this concealment be bamboo to death and the value discover be divide among the creditor but the debtor or bankrupt must never more concern himself with trade upon a stone ten cubit high erect in

than that of any other nation in the world and the chinese woman wear it curl in the indy when one man accuse another of a capital crime it be usual to ask the accuse if he be willing to undergo the trial by fire and if he consent the ceremony be conduct in the follow manner : a piece of iron be heated red hot and the accuse be desire to stretch out he hand on which they put seven leaf of a certain tree and above these the red hot iron be place in this condition he walk backwards and forwards for some time and then throw off the iron immediately after this he hand be cover with a leathern bag which be seal with the prince 's signet and if at the end of three day he appear and declare that he have suffer no hurt they order he to take out he hand and if no sign of fire be visible he be declare innocent of the crime lay to he charge and the accuser be condemn to pay a fine of a _ man _ of gold to the prince sometimes they boil water in a caldron till it be so hot that no one can touch it they then throw in a iron ring and the accuse be command to thrust down he hand to bring up the ring i see one who do this and receive no manner of harm in this case likewise if the accuse remain unhurt the accuser pay a fine of a _ man _ of gold when a king die in the island of serendib which be the last of the island of the indy he body be lay in a open chariot in such a posture that he head hang backward almost touch the ground with he hair trail on the earth and the chariot be follow by a woman who sweep the dust on the face of the decease while she proclaim with a loud voice : o man behold you king he be yesterday you master but now the dominion which he exercise over you be at a end he be reduce to the state you now see have leave the world and the arbiter of life and death have withdraw he soul count not therefore o man upon the uncertain hope of this life this or a similar proclamation be continue for three day after which the body be embalm with sandal wood camphor and saffron and be then burn and the ash be scatter to the wind when they burn the body of a king it be usual for he wife to jump into the fire and burn along with he but this they be not constrain to do the same custom of burn the body of the dead prevail over all the indy in the indy there be man who devote themselves to live in the wood and mountain profess to despise what other man most value abstain from every thing but such wild herb and fruit as be to be find in the wood and they affix a iron buckle to they genitals in such a manner as to interdict all commerce with woman some of these go quite naked or have only the skin of a leopard throw over they and keep perpetually stand with they face to the sun i formerly see one in that posture and on my return to the indy sixteen year afterwards i find he in the very same attitude it be astonishing that he have not lose he sight by the heat and glare of the sun in all these kingdom the sovereign power reside in the royal family without ever depart from it and the heir of the family follow each other in regular succession in like manner there be family of learn man of physician and of all the artificer concern in the various art and none of these be ever mix with the family of a different profession the several state of the indy be not subject to one king but each province have its own though the balhara be consider in the indy as king of king the chinese be fond of gaming and all manner of diversion but the indian condemn they and have no pleasure in such employment they drink no wine neither do they use vinegar because it be make from wine although this abstinence do not proceed from any religious duty : but they allege that a king give to wine be not worthy of be a king for how should a drunkard be able to manage the affair of a kingdom especially as war be so frequent between the neighbouring state they war be not usually undertake to possess themselves of the dominion of other and i never hear of any except the people border on the pepper country that seize the dominion of they neighbor after victory when a prince master the dominion of a neighbor he confer the sovereignty upon some person of the royal family of the conquer country and thus retain it in dependence upon himself under the conviction that the native would never submit to be otherwise govern when any one of the prince or governor of city in china be guilty of a crime he be put to death and eat and in general it may be say that the chinese eat all those who be put to death when the indian and chinese be about to marry and the party be agree present be interchange and the marriage ceremony be solemnize amidst the noise of drum and various sort of instrument the present consist in money and all the relative and friend contribute as much as they can afford if any man in the indy run away with a woman and abuse she both be put to death unless it be prove that force have be use against the woman in which case the man only be punish theft be always punish capitally both in indium and china whether the theft be considerable or trifling but more particularly so in the indy where if a thief have steal even the value of a small piece of money he be impale alive the chinese be much addict to the abominable vice of pederasty which they even number among the strange act they perform in honor of they idol the chinese building be of wood with stone and plaster or brick and mortar the chinese and indian be not satisfy with one wife but both nation marry as many as they please or can maintain rice be the common food of the indian who eat no wheat but the chinese use both indifferently circumcision be not practice either by the chinese or indian the chinese worship idol before whom they fall down and make prayer and they have book which explain the article of they religion the indian suffer they beard to grow but have no whisker and i have see one with a beard three cubit long but the chinese for the most part wear no beard upon the death of a relation the indian shave both head and face when any man in the indy be throw into prison he be allow neither victuals nor drink for seven day together and this with they answer the end of other torture for extort from the criminal a confession of he guilt the chinese and indian have judge besides the governor who decide in cause between the subject both in indium and china there be leopard and wolf but no lion highway robber be punish with death both the indian and chinese imagine that the idol which they worship speak to they and give they answer neither of they kill they meat by cut the throat as be do by the mahomedan but by beat they on the head till they die they wash not with well water and the chinese wipe themselves with paper whereas the indian wash every day before eat the indian wash not only the mouth but the whole body before they eat but this be not do by the chinese the indy be larger in extent by a half than china and have a great many more kingdom but china be more populous it be not usual to see palm tree either in the indy or in china but they have many other sort of tree and fruit which we have not the indian have no grape and the chinese have not many but both abound in other fruit though the pomegranate thrive better in indium than in china the chinese have no science and they religion and most of they law be derive from the indian they even believe that the indian teach they they worship of idol both nation believe the metempsycosis though they differ in many of the precept and ceremony of they religion physic and philosophy be cultivate among the indian and the chinese have some skill in medicine but that almost entirely consist in the art of apply hot iron or cautery they have some smattering of astronomy but in this likewise the indian surpass the chinese i know not that even so much as one man of either nation have embrace mahomedism or have learn to speak the arabic language the indian have few horse and there be more in china but the chinese have no elephant and can not endure to have they in they country the indian dominion furnish a great number of soldier who be not pay by they king but when call out to war have to take the field and serve entirely at they own expense but the chinese allow they soldier much the same pay as be do by the arab china be a pleasant and fruitful country have numerous extensive and well fortify city with a more wholesome climate and less fenny country than indium in which most of the province have no city the air in china likewise be much better than in indium and there be scarcely any blind person or who be subject to disease of the eye and similar advantage be enjoy by several of the province of indium the river of both country be large and surpass we greatest river and much rain fall in both country in the lady there be many desert track but china be inhabit and cultivate through its whole extent the chinese be handsomer than the indian and come nearer to the arab in countenance and dress in they manners in the way of ride and in they ceremony wear long garment and girdle in the manner of belt while the indian wear two short vest and both man and woman wear golden bracelet adorn with precious stone beyond the kingdom of china there be a country call _ tagazgaz _ take its name from a nation of turk by which it be inhabit and also the country of kakhan which border on the turk the island of silum be inhabit by white people who send present to the emperor of china and who be persuade that if they be to neglect this the rain of heaven would not fall upon they country in that country there be white falcon but none of we people have be there to give we any particular information concern they -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be probably the sea about the maldive which accord to the eastern geographer divide that part of the indian ocean from the sea of delarowus or the magnus sinus of the ancient the eastern writer often speak of the seven sea which seem rather a proverbial phrase than a geographical definition these be the sea of china indium persium kolzoum or the red sea of rum or greece which be the mediterranean alehozar or the caspian pont or the euxine the sea of indium be often call the green sea and the persian gulf the sea of bassora the ocean be call bahr mahit -- harri -lrb- 2 -rrb- male-dive signify in the malabar language a thousand isle -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- the subsequent account of these island do not justify this particular sentence if the author mean that they be always govern by a queen it might be so in this time by accident and one queen might have succeed another as queen elizabeth do queen mary -- harri -lrb- 4 -rrb- this be the taprobana of the ancient and have receive many name in cosma indicopleuste it be call sielendiba which be merely a grecian corruption of sielea-dive or sielen island whence the modern name of ceylon -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- this be probably the shark which be common on all the coast of indium there be a portion of the m want at this place wherein the author treat of the trade to china as it be carry on in he time and of the cause which have bring it into a decline condition -- renaud -lrb- 6 -rrb- perhaps some account of this soliman might be contain in the lose page : but the circumstance of a mahomedan judge or consul at canfu be a circumstance worthy of notice and shew that the mahomedan have carry on a regular and settle trade with china for a considerable time and be in high estimation in that country -- renaud -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be difficult at this distance of time to ascertain the rout lay down by this author on account of the change of name this mart of siraff be not to be meet with in any of we map but it be say by the arabian geographer to have be in the gulf of persium about sixty league from shiraz and that on its decay the trade be transfer to ormuz -- renaud -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be probable or rather certain that canton be here mean -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- mean the parsee or guebre the fire-worshipper of persium -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- it be probable that this balhara or king of the people with bored ear which plainly mean the indian be the zamorin or emperor of calicut who accord to the report of the most ancient portuguese writer concern indium be acknowledge as a kind of emperor in the indy six hundred year before they discover the route to indium by the cape of good hope -- harri the original editor of this voyage in english harri be certainly mistake in this point the balhara be the sovereign of southern seindetic indium of which dominion guzerat be the principal province -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- this be a very early notice of the construction and use of clock or machinery to indicate division of time by means of weight -- e section ii _ commentary upon the foregoing account by abu zeid al hasan of siraff _ have very carefully examine the book i be desire to peruse that i might confirm what the author relate so far as he agree with what i have learn concern the affair of navigation the kingdom on the coast and the state of the country of which he treat and that i might add what i have elsewhere collect concern these matter : i find that this book be compose in the year of the hegira 237 and that the account give by the author be conformable with what i have hear from merchant who have sail from _ irak _ or persium through these sea i find also all that the author have write to be agreeable to truth except some few passage in which he have be misinform speaking of the custom of the chinese in set meat before they dead and believe that the dead have eat we have be tell the same thing and once believe it but have since learn from a person of undoubted credit that this notion be entirely groundless as well as that the idolater believe they idol speak to they from that creditable person we have likewise be inform that the affair of china wear quite a different aspect since those day : and since much have be relate to explain why we voyage to china have be interrupted and how the country have be ruin many custom abolish and the empire divide i shall here declare what i know of that revolution the great trouble which have embroil the affair of this empire put a stop to the justice and righteousness there formerly practice and interrupt the ordinary navigation from siraff to china be occasion by the revolt of a officer name baichu in high employment though not of the royal family he begin by gather together a number of vagabond and disorderly people whom he win to he party by he liberality and form into a considerable body of troops with these he commit hostility in many part of the country to the great loss of the inhabitant and have greatly increase he army and put himself into a condition to attempt greater thing he begin to entertain a design of subdue the whole empire and march direct for canfu one of the most note city in china and at that time the great port for we arabian commerce this city stand upon a great river some day sail from the sea so that the water there be fresh the citizen shut they gate against he and he be oblige to besiege it a great while but at length he become master of the city and put all the inhabitant to the sword there be person fully acquaint with the affair of china who assure we that besides the chinese who be massacre upon this occasion there perish one hundred and twenty thousand mahomedan jew christian and parsee who be there on account of traffic and as the chinese be exceedingly nice in the register they keep of foreigner dwelling among they this number may be consider as authentic this take place in the year of the hegira 264 or of christ 877 he also cut down the mulberry tree which be carefully cultivate by the chinese for they leaf on which the silk worm be feed and owe to this the trade of silk have tail and that manufacture which use to be much prosecute in all the country under the arabian government be quite at a stand have sack and destroy canfu he possess himself of many other city which he demolish have first slay most of the inhabitant in the hope that he might involve all the member of the royal family in this general massacre that no one might remain to dispute with he for the empire he then advance to cumdan -lrb- 1 -rrb- the capital city whence the emperor be oblige to make a precipitate retreat to the city of hamdu on the frontier towards thibet puff up with these great success baichu make himself master of almost the whole country there be no one able to dispute he authority at length the emperor write to the king of the tagazgaz in turkestan with whom he be in some degree ally by marriage implore he assistance to subdue the rebellion the king of the tagazgaz dispatch he son at the head of a very numerous army into china and after a long and arduous contest and many battle baichu be utterly defeat and it be never know afterwards what become of he some believe that he fall in the last battle while other suppose that he end he day in a different manner the emperor of china now return to he capital much weaken and dispirit in consequence of the embezzlement of he treasure and the loss of the best of he officer and troops and the horrible devastation calamity and loss which he empire have sustain yet he make himself master of all the province which have revolt from he authority he would not however lay he hand upon the goods of he subject notwithstanding the exhaust state of he finances but satisfied himself with what be still leave in he coffer and the small remains of the public money that be to be find require nothing from he subject but what they be willing to give and only demand obedience to the law and to he authority consider that they have be already severely oppress in consequence of the rebellion thus china become like the empire of alexander after the defeat and death of darius when he divide the province among he chief who become so many king for now each of the chinese prince or viceroy join themselves into petty alliance make war among themselves without the authority of the emperor and when the stronger have subdue the weaker and acquire possession of he province the subject of the vanquish prince be unmercifully waste and plunder and even barbarously devour : a cruel practice allow by the law of they religion which even permit human flesh to be expose to public sale in the market there arise from all these confusion many unjust dealings with the merchant and there be no grievance so intolerable or treatment so bad but what be exercise upon the arab merchant and captain of ship extort from they what be altogether uncustomary seize upon they effect and behave towards they quite contrary to all the ancient usage so that we merchant be force to return in crowd to siraff and oman -lrb- 2 -rrb- the punishment of married person convict of adultery as well as for the crime of homicide and theft be as follow : the hand be bind fast together and force backwards over the head till they rest on the neck the right foot be then fasten to the right hand and the left foot to the left hand and all draw tight together behind the back so that the criminal be incapable to stir and by this torture the neck be dislocate the joint of the arm start from they socket and the thigh bone be disjointed -- in short the tortured wretch would soon expire without any farther process yet in that state he be beat by bamboo till at the last gasp and be then abandon to the people who devour the body there be woman in china who refuse to marry and prefer to live a dissolute life of perpetual debauchery a woman who have make this election present herself in full audience before the commanding officer of a city declare she aversion to marriage and desire to be enrol among the public woman she name be then insert in the register with the name of she family the place of she abode the number and description of she jewel and the particulars of she dress she have then a string put round she neck to which be append a copper ring mark with the king 's signet and she receive a write certify that she be receive into the list of prostitute and by which she be entitle to a pension from the public treasury of so many _ falus _ yearly and in which the punishment of death be denounce against any man who should take she to wife every year regulation be publish respect these woman and such as have grow old in the service be strike off the list in the evening these woman walk abroad in dress of different color unveil and prostitute themselves to all stranger who love debauchery but the chinese themselves send for they to they house whence they do not depart till next morning the chinese coin no money except the small piece of copper like those we _ falus _ nor will they allow gold and silver to be coin into specie like we dinar and dram for they allege that a thief may carry off ten thousand piece of gold from the house of a arab and almost as many of silver without be much burthen and so ruin the man who suffer the loss but in the house of a chinese he can only carry off ten thousand _ falus _ at the most which do not make above ten metical or gold dinar in value these piece of copper be alloy with some other metal and be about the size of a dram or the piece of silver call _ baglus _ have a large hole in the middle to string they by a thousand of they be worth a metical or gold dinar and they string they by thousand with a knot distinguish the hundred all they payment whether for land furniture merchandize or any thing else be make in this money of which there be some piece at siraff inscribe with chinese character the city of canfu be build of wood and cane interwoven just like we lattice-work of split cane the whole wash over with a kind of varnish make of hempseed which become as white as milk have a wonderfully fine gloss there be no stair in they house which be all of one storey and all they valuable be place in chest upon wheel which in case of fire can easily be draw from place to place without any hinderance from stair the inferior officer of the city and those commonly who have the direction of the custom and of the treasury be almost all eunuch some of whom have be capture on the frontier and make so while other be so treat by they father and send as present to the emperor these officer be at the head of the principal affair of state and have the management of the emperor 's private affair and of the treasury and those particularly who be send to canfu be select from this class it be customary for they and for the viceroy or governor of the city to appear abroad from time to time in solemn procession on these occasion they be precede by man who carry great piece of wood like those use in the levant instead of bell by the christian on which they make a noise which be hear at a great distance upon which every person get out of the way of the prince or eunuch even if a man be at he door he go in and keep he door shut till the great personage have go by thus not a soul be in the way and this be enjoin that they may strike a dread into the people and be hold in veneration and the people be not allow to see they often lest they should grow so familiar as to speak to they all these officer wear very magnificent dress of silk so fine that none such be bring into the country of the arab as the chinese hold it at a very high price one of we chief merchant a man of perfect credibility wait upon a eunuch who have be send to canfu to purchase some goods from the country of the arab the eunuch have upon he breast a short and beautiful silk vest which be under another silk vest and seem to have two other vest over that again and perceive that the arab eye he very steadfastly he ask he the cause and be tell that he admire the beauty of the little vest under he other garment the eunuch laugh and hold out he sleeve to he desire he to count how many vest he have above that which he so much admire he do so and find five one over the other and the little rich vest undermost these garment be all wove of raw silk which have never be wash or full and those worn by the prince or governor be still richer and more exquisitely work the chinese surpass all nation in all art and particularly in painting and they perform such perfect work as other can but faintly imitate when a artificer have finish a piece he carry it to the prince 's palace to demand the reward which he think he deserve for the beauty of he performance and the custom be for the prince to order the work to be leave at the gate of the palace for a whole year and if in that time no person find a just fault in the piece the artificer be reward and admit into the body of artist but if any fault be discover the piece be reject and the workman send off without reward it happen once that one of these artist paint a ear of corn with a bird perch upon it and he performance be very much admire this piece stand expose to public view as usual and one day a crooked fellow go past find fault with the picture and be immediately conduct to the prince or governor who send for the painter that he might hear he piece criticize be ask what fault he have to find he answer that every one know that a bird never settle on a ear of corn but it must bend under the weight whereas this painter have represent the ear of corn bolt upright though load with a bird the objection be hold just and the painter be dismiss without reward by such means they excite they workman to aim at perfection and to be exceedingly nice and circumspect in what they undertake and to apply they whole genius to any thing that have to go through they hand there dwell at basra one ebn wahab of the tribe of koreish descend from hebar the son of al asud who quit basra when it be sack and come to siraff where he see a ship prepare to sail for china -lrb- 3 -rrb- the humor take he to embark in this ship for china and he have the curiosity to visit the emperor 's court leave canfu he go to cumdan after a journey of two month and remain a long while at the court where he present several petition to the emperor setting forth that he be of the family of the prophet of the arab after a considerable interval the emperor order he to be lodge in a house appoint for the purpose and to be supply with every thing he might need the emperor then write to the governor of canfu to inquire carefully among the arabian merchant respect this man 's pretension and receive a full confirmation of he extraction receive he to a audience and make he rich present with which he return to irak when we see he this man be much advance in year but have he sens perfectly he tell we that the emperor ask he many question respect the arab and particularly how they have destroy the kingdom of the persian ebn wahab answer that they have do it by the assistance of god and because the persian be immerse in idolatry adore the sun moon and star instead of the almighty the emperor say that they have conquer the most illustrious kingdom of the earth the best cultivate the most populous the most pregnant of fine wit and of the highest fame the emperor then ask ebn wahab what account the arab make of the other king of the earth to which he answer that he know they not then the emperor cause the interpreter to say we admit but five great king he who be master of irak have the kingdom of widest extent which be surround by the territory of other king and we find he call king of king after he be the emperor of china who be style king of mankind for no king have more absolute authority over he subject and no people can be more dutiful and submissive than he subject next be the king of the turk whose kingdom border on china and who be style the king of lion next be the king of the elephant who be king of the indy whom we call king of wisdom last of all be the king of greece whom we call king of man as there be no man of better manners or comlier appearance on the face of the earth than he subject ebn wahab be then ask if he know he lord and master the prophet mohamm and if he have see he how could that be say wahab see that he be with god be then ask what manner of person he be he answer that he be very handsome then a great box be bring out of which another box be take and the interpreter be desire to shew he he lord and master ebn wahab upon look in saw the image of the prophet and the emperor observe he to move he lip desire he to be ask the reason on which he say he be pray inwardly in honor of the prophet be ask how he know they he say by the representation of they history as for instance one be noah and he ark who be save from the flood with those who be with they the emperor laugh and say he be right in regard to noah but deny the universal deluge which though it have cover part of the earth do not reach china or the indy on wahab observe that the next be mose with he rod and the child of israel the emperor agree that they country be of small extent and that mose have extirpate the ancient inhabitant wahab then point out jesus upon the ass accompany by he apostle to this the emperor say that he have be a short time upon earth all he transaction have very little exceed the space of thirty month on see the image of mohammed ride on a camel and he companion about he with arabian shoe and leathern girdle wahab weep and be ask the reason he answer it be on see he prophet and lord who be he cousin also the emperor then ask concern the age of the world and wahab answer that opinion vary on the subject as some reckon it to be six thousand year old while some would not allow so many and other extend it to a greater antiquity be ask why he have desert he own king to whom he be so near in blood he give information of the revolution which have happen at basra which have force he to fly to siraff where hearing of the glory of the emperor of china and the abundance of every thing in he empire he have be impel by curiosity to visit it but that he intend soon to return to the kingdom of he cousin where he should make a faithful report of the magnificence of china the vast extent of its province and of the kind usage he have meet with this seem to please the emperor who make he rich present and order he to be conduct to canfu on post horse -lrb- 4 -rrb- he write also to the governor of that city command he to be treat with honor and to the governor of the province through which he have to pass to shew he every civility he be treat handsomely during the remainder of he stay in china plentifully supply with all necessaries and honor with many present -lrb- 5 -rrb- from the information of ebn wahab we learn that cumdan where the emperor of china keep he court be a very large and extremely populous city divide into two part by a very long and broad street that the emperor he chief minister the supreme judge the eunuch the soldiery and all belong to the imperial household dwelt in that part of the city which be on the right hand eastward and that the people be not admit into that part of the city which be water by canal from different river the border of which be plant with tree and adorn by magnificent palace that portion of the city on the left hand westwards from the great street be inhabit by the ordinary kind of people and the merchant where also be great square and market for all the necessaries of life at day-break every morning the officer of the royal household with the inferior servant purveyor and the domestic of the grandee of the court come into that division of the city some on horseback and other on foot to the public market and the shop of those who deal in all sort of goods where they buy whatever they want and do not return again till they occasion call they back next morning the city be very pleasantly situate in the midst of a most fertile soil water by several river and hardly deficient in any thing except palm tree which grow not there in we time a discovery have be make of a circumstance quite new and unknown to we ancestor no one ever imagine that the great sea which extend from the indy to china have any communication with the sea of syrium yet we have hear that in the sea of rum or the mediterranean there be find the wreck of a arabian ship which have be shatter by a tempest in which all she man have perish she remains be drive by the wind and weather into the sea of the chozar and thence by the canal of the mediterranean sea and be at last throw upon the coast of syrium hence it be evident that the sea surround all the country of china and silum or cilum the uttermost part of turkestan and the country of the chozar and that it communicate by the strait with that which wash the coast of syrium this be prove by the structure of the wreck of which the plank be not nail or bolt like all those build in the mediterranean or on the coast of syrium but join together in a extraordinary manner as if sew and none but the ship of siraff be so fasten we have also hear it report that ambergris have be find on the coast of syrium which seem hard to believe and be unknown to former time if this be true it be impossible that amber should have be throw up on the sea of syrium but by the sea of aden and kolsum which have communication with the sea where amber be find and as god have put a separation between these sea it must have necessarily be that this amber be drive from the indian sea into the other in the same direction with the vessel of siraff -lrb- 6 -rrb- the province of zapage be opposite to china and distant from thence a month 's sail or less if the wind be fair the king of this country be style mehrage and he dominion be say to be 900 league in circumference besides which he command over many island which lie around so that altogether this kingdom be above 1000 league in extent one of these island be call _ serbeza _ which be say to be 400 league in compass another be call _ rhami _ which be 800 league round and produce red-wood camphor and many other commodity in the same kingdom be the island of _ calum _ which be the mid passage between china and the country of the arab this island be 80 league in circumference and to it they bring all sort of merchandize as aloe wood of several kind camphor sandal wood ivory the wood call _ cabahi _ ebony red-wood all sort of spice and many other and at present the trade be carry on between this island and that of oman the mehrage be sovereign over all these island and that of zapage in which he reside be extremely fertile and so populous that the town almost touch each other no part of the land be uncultivated the palace of the king or mehrage stand on a river as broad as the tigri at bagdat or bassora but the sea intercept its course and drive its water back with the tide yet during the ebb the fresh water flow out a good way into the sea the river water be let into a small pond close to the king 's palace and every morning the master of the household bring a ingot of gold work in a particular manner and throw it into the pond in presence of the king when the king die he successor cause all these ingot which have be accumulate during the reign of he predecessor to be take out and the sum arise from this great quantity of gold be distribute among the royal household in certain proportion accord to they respective rank and the surplus be give to the poor komar be the country whence the aloe wood which we call hud al komari be bring and it be a very populous kingdom of which the inhabitant be very courageous in this country the boundless commerce with woman be forbid and indeed it have no wine the kingdom of zapage and komar be about ten or twenty day easy sail from each other and the kingdom be in peace with other when the follow event be say in they ancient history to have occur the young and high-spirited king of komar be one day in he palace which look upon a river much like the euphrate at the entrance and be only a day 's journey from the sea one day in a discourse with he prime minister the conversation turn upon the glory and population of the kingdom of the mehrage and the multitude of its dependent island when the king of komar express a wish to see the head of the mehrage of zapage on a dish before he the minister endeavor to dissuade he from so unjust and rash a attempt but the king afterwards propose the same exploit to the other officer of he court intelligence of this project be convey to the mehrage who be a wise and active prince of consummate experience and in the flower of he age and who immediately order a thousand small ship to be fit out with all necessary arm and provision and man with as many of he best troops as they be able to transport carefully conceal the purpose of this armament but give out that he mean to visit the different island under he authority and even cause letter to be write to the tributary king of these island to prepare for he reception when every thing be in readiness he sail over to the kingdom of komar the king of which and all he courtier be a set of effeminate creature who do nothing all day long but view they face in mirror and pick they tooth the mehrage land he troops without delay and immediately invest the palace in which the king be make prisoner all he attendant have flee without fight then the mehrage cause proclamation to be make grant entire security of life and property to all the inhabitant of the country and seat himself on the throne cause the captive king and the prime minister to be bring into he presence address himself to the fall monarch he demand he reason for entertain a project so unjust and beyond he power to execute and what be he ultimate intention if he have succeed to this the king of komar make no answer and the mehrage order he head to be strike off to the minister the mehrage make many compliment for the good advice he have give he master and order he to place the person who best deserve to succeed upon the vacant throne and then depart to he own dominion without do the smallest violence or injury to the kingdom of komar the news of this action be report to the king of china and the indy add greatly to they respect for the mehrage and from that time it have be the custom for the king of komar to prostrate themselves every morning towards the country of zapage in honor of the mehrage -lrb- 7 -rrb- all the king of china and the indy believe in the metempsychosis or transmigration of soul as a article of they religion of which the follow story relate by a person of credibility be a singular instance one of these prince have view himself in a mirror after recover from the small-pox and notice how dreadfully he face be disfigured observe that no person have ever remain in he body after such a change and as the soul pass instantly into another body he be determine to separate ha soul from its present frightful body that he might pass into another wherefore he command he nephew to mount the throne and call for a sharp and keen scymitar order he own head to be cut off that he soul might be set free to inhabit a new body he order be comply with and he body be burnt accord to the custom of the country until the late revolution have reduce they to they present state of anarchy the chinese be wonderfully regular and exact in every thing relative to government of which the follow incident afford a striking example a merchant of chorassan who have deal largely in irak and who embark from thence for china with a quantity of goods have a dispute at canfu with a eunuch who be send to purchase some ivory and other goods for the emperor and at length the dispute run so high that the merchant refuse to sell he he goods this eunuch be keeper of the imperial treasury and presume so much on the favor and confidence which he enjoy with he master that he take he choice of all the goods he want from the merchant by force regardless of every thing that the merchant could say the merchant go privately from canfu to cumdan the residence of the emperor which be two month journey and immediately go to the string of the bell mention in the former section which he pull accord to the custom of the country he be convey to a place at the distance of ten day journey where he be commit to prison for two month after which he be bring before the viceroy of the province who represent to he that he have involve himself in a situation which would tend to he utter ruin and even the loss of he life if he do not speak out the real truth : because there be minister and governor appoint to distribute justice to all stranger who be ready to see he right and if the nature of the wrong which he have to represent do not appear such as to entitle he to this application to the emperor he would assuredly be put to death as a warn to other not to follow he example the viceroy therefore advise he to withdraw he appeal and to return immediately to canfu the rule on such occasion be that if the party should endeavor to recede after this exhortation he would have receive fifty blow of a bamboo and have be immediately send out of the country : but if he persist in he appeal he be immediately admit to a audience of the emperor the merchant strenuously persist in he demand for justice and be at length admit to the presence of the emperor to whom he relate the injustice of the eunuch in take away he goods by force upon this the merchant be throw into prison and the emperor order he prime minister to write to the governor of canfu to make strict inquiry into the complaint which he have exhibit against the eunuch and to make a faithful report of all the circumstance and he at the same time give similar order to three other principal officer to make the same inquiry all separate and unknown to each other these officer who be call of the right of the left and of the center accord to they rank have the command of the imperial force under the prime minister they be entrust with the guard of the emperor person : and when he take the field on any military enterprise or on any other account these officer be station near he each accord to he rank all of these make accordingly the strictest inquiry into the allegation of the merchant and all separately give in they report assure the emperor that these complaint be just and well-founded : and these be follow and confirm by many other information the eunuch be in consequence deprive of he office of treasurer find all he effect be confiscate on which occasion the emperor address he as follow death ought to have be you doom for give occasion of complaint against I to this man who have come from chorassan which be on the border of my empire he have be in the country of the arab whence he come into the kingdom of the indy and thence into my empire seek he advantage by trade and you would have occasion he to return across all these region say to all the people in he way that he have be abused and strip of he substance in china in consideration of you former service and the rank you have hold in my household i grant you life but as you have not discharge you duty in regard to the living i will confer upon you the charge of the dead the eunuch be accordingly send to take the custody of the imperial tomb and to remain there for the remainder of he life before the late commotion the good order observe in the administration of justice and the majesty of they tribunal be very admirable to fill these the chinese choose man who be perfectly versant in the law man of sincerity and zealous in the cause of justice who be not to be biass by the interference of the great and who always administer the law with impartiality neither oppress the poor nor accept bribe from the rich when any one be to be promote to the office of principal judge he be previously send to all the chief city of the empire to remain a month or two in each inquire minutely into the various custom and affair of the people and inform himself of all such person as be worthy of be credit in they testimony that he judgment might be regulate in the future discharge of he high office by this preliminary knowledge after go through all the city in this manner and make some stay in those which be most considerable he repair to the imperial court and be invest with the dignity of supreme judge to he the nomination of all the other judge be confide after acquaint the emperor with the name of all who in he estimation be most worthy of exercise jurisdiction in the various city and province every day the supreme judge cause proclamation to be make that of any man have be wrong by the viceroy or governor or by any of he relation or officer or any other person he shall receive ample justice a viceroy or governor be never degrade except by letter issue from the council or divan of king and this be do only for some flagrant malversation or for the refusal or delay of justice the post of judicature be confer upon none but man of probity and justice good order be efectually maintain the province of chorassan be almost on the border of china from china to sogd be about two month journey through impracticable desert of sand where there be no water for which reason the chorassanian can make no irruption into china the most westerly province of china be _ medu _ which border on thibet and the two nation be often at war a person who have be in china inform we that he have see a man at canfu who have travel from _ samare _ all the way on foot through all the city in china with a vessel of musk on he back for sale which he might easily do as the part of thibet which produce musk be contiguous to china the chinese carry off as many of the animal which produce musk as they can procure but the musk of thibet be far better than that of china because the animal feed on aromatic plant in the mountain of thibet while in china it have to subsist upon the ordinary pasture and because the inhabitant of thibet preserve they cod of musk in its natural state of purity while the chinese adulterate all that get into they hand for which reason the musk of thibet be in great request among the arab the most exquisite of all the sort of musk be that which the musk animal leave behind they in rub themselves on the rock of they native mountain the humor whence the musk be generate fall down towards the navel of the animal where it gather into tumor like grumous blood and when this tumor be ripe it produce a painful itch on which the animal rub himself against rock or stone till he burst the tumor and the contents run out and coagulate on the stone after which the wound heal and the humor gather again as before there be man in thibet who make it they business to collect this species of musk which they preserve in bladder and which have ripen naturally surpass all other in goodness just as ripe fruit exceed in flavor that which be pull green there be another way of procure musk either by ensnare the animal or shoot they with arrow but the hunter often cut out the bag before the musk be ripe or fully elaborate in which case the musk at first have a bad scent till the humor thicken after which it turn to good musk though this sometimes take a long while the musk animal be like we roebuck he skin and color the same with slender leg and smooth slightly bent horn have on each side two small white tooth about half a finger-length which rise about he muzzle not much unlike the form of the tooth of the elephant and by which he be distinguish from other roebuck the letter from the emperor of china to the viceroy governor eunuch and lieutenant be convey on post-horse which be distinguish by cut tail and these be disposed at regular station all over the empire almost like the post among the arab in china every man from the emperor to the meanest of the people make water standing -lrb- 8 -rrb- and for this purpose person of dignity have gilded hollow cane a cubit long to convey they water to a distance they be of opinion that pain in the kidney strangury and even the stone be occasion by urining in a sit posture as the rein can not free themselves absolutely from evil humor except by evacuate in a erect position they do not mould the head of new bear infant into a round form as we do as they allege that this practice injure the brain and impair the sens they suffer they hair to grow which be carefully comb the nation be divide into tribe like those of the arab and some other and no man ever marry in he own tribe : just as the child of thummim among the arab never take a wife from that tribe or for example a man of the tribe of robayat marry a daughter of the tribe modzar and a modzar marry a robayat and they be of opinion that such alliance add to the dignity and power of they child in the kingdom of the balhara and all the other kingdom of the indy there be man who burn themselves in consequence of they belief in the doctrine of transmigration when a man have come to this resolution he ask leave of the king which be obtain he go in procession round all the public square of the city and proceed to the place appoint where a pile of dry wood be ready for the purpose have many person all round to feed the fire which blaze prodigiously at last the person come forward precede by a number of instrument and move round the pile in the midst of he friend and relation during this ceremony some person place on he head a garland of straw or dry herb fill with burn coal on which they pour _ sandrach _ which take fire as strongly as naphtha notwithstanding of which he continue he progress without betray any sense of pain or change of countenance though the crown of he head be all on fire and the stench of he burn flesh be feel all round at length he come up to the pile and throw himself in where he be soon reduce to ash a credible person say he once see a indian burn himself and when he come near the pile he draw out a cangiar or sharp knife with which he rip himself open and pull out the lap of he liver with he left hand cut off a piece of it with he cangiar and give it to one of he brother talk all the time with the most invincible contempt of death and torture and at length leap into the fire in he passage to hell at the accession of some king of the indy the following ceremony be observe : a large quantity of rice be dress and spread out upon leaf of mousa in presence of the king then three or four hundred person come of they own accord without any constraint whatever and after the king have eat of the rice he give some of it to all that come forwards in succession which they eat in he presence and by this ceremony they engage to burn themselves on the day when this king die or be slay and they punctually fulfil they promise in the mountainous part of indium there be tribe who differ little from those we call _ kanisians _ and _ jelidians _ and who be addict to all manner of superstition and vice between whom and the inhabitant of the people on the coast there subsist great emulation each daring the other to imitate they in the performance of strange superstitious torture there once come a man from the mountain on this errand who gather a multitude of the inhabitant of the coast to the follow strange exhibition daring they to imitate he or otherwise to acknowledge themselves overcome he sit down in a place plant with cane and cause a strong one to be forcibly bent down to which he strongly fasten the hair of he head now say he i be go to cut off my own head with this cangiar and as soon as it be sever from my body let go the cane and when my head fly up into the air i will laugh and you shall hear I but the people of the coast have not courage to imitate he -lrb- 9 -rrb- the person who relate this do it without emotion or wonder and in we time these fact be generally know as this part of the indy be in the neighborhood of the country of the arab and we hear from thence every day in the indy they burn they dead and it be customary for man and woman to desire they family to throw they into the fire or to drown they when they be grow old or perceive themselves to sink under the pressure of disease firmly believe that they be to return into other body it have often happen in the isle of serendib where there be a mine of precious stone in a mountain a pearl-fishery and other extraordinary thing that a indian would come into the bazar or market-place arm with a _ kri _ and seize upon the most wealthy merchant there present lead he out of the market through a throng of people hold the kris to he throat while no one dare to attempt he rescue as the indian be sure in such a case to kill the merchant and make away with himself and when he have get the merchant out of the city the indian obliged he to redeem he life with a sum of money to put a end to such outrage a order be issue to seize such trespasser but on attempt to execute this order several merchant be kill both arab and indian and the order be oblige to be repeal in the mountain of serendib precious stone be find of various color red green and yellow -lrb- 10 -rrb- most of which be wash from cavern or crevice by rain and torrent in these place the king have officer to watch over the people who gather the precious stone in some place these be dig out of mine like the ore of metal and the rock have often to be break to come at the precious stone which it contain the king of serendib make law concern the religion and government of the country and there be assembly hold of doctor and learn man like those of _ hadithi _ among the arab to which the indian repair and write down what they hear of the life of they prophet and the exposition of they law in this island there be temple in which great sum of money be expend on incense and in one of these temple there be a great idol all of pure gold but concern the weight of which traveller be not agree in the same island there be great number of jew and person of many other sect even _ tanoui _ and manichee the king permit the free exercise of every religion at the end of the island be vally of great extent extend quite to the sea call _ gab serendib _ of extreme beauty and chequer with grove and plain water and mead and bless with a wholesome air a sheep may be there buy for half a dram and for the same as much of they drink make of palm-honey boil and prepare with _ tarus _ or toddi as will suffice for many person the inhabitant be much addict to gaming particularly draught they other principal diversion be cock-fight they cock be very large and better provide with spur than ordinary and besides this the indian arm they with blade of iron in the form of cangiar or dagger on these combat they bet gold and silver land or farm and they game with such fury that debauchee and desperate people often stake the end of they finger when they other property be exhaust while at play for this extraordinary stake they have a fire by they on which a small pot of walnut oil or oil of sesamum be keep boil and when one have win a game he chop off the end of the loser 's finger who immediately dip the stump into the boiling oil to stem the blood and some will persist so obstinately as to have all they finger thus mutilate some even will take a burning wick and apply it to some member till the scent of the burnt flesh be feel all around while the stoic continue to play without betray the least sense of pain both man and woman be so exceedingly addict to debauchery that a foreign merchant have be know to send even for a king 's daughter to attend he at the fishing grounds in quality of mistress wherefore the mahomedan doctor at siraff strictly warn young people not to go there in the indy there be heavy rain call _ jasara _ which last incessantly day and night for three month every year the indian prepare against these to the best of they power as they shut themselves up in they house during the whole time all work be then perform within door and during this time they be subject to ulcer in the sole of they foot occasion by the damp yet these rain be of indispensable necessity as when they fail the indian be reduce to the utmost want as they rice field be water only by the rain it never rain during summer the indian have doctor or devout man name bramin they have poet also who compose poem fill with the grossest flattery to they king and great man they have also astrologer philosopher soothsayer man who observe the flight of bird and other who pretend to the calculation of nativity particularly at kaduge a great city in the kingdom of gozar -lrb- 11 -rrb- there be certain man call _ bicar _ who go all they life naked and suffer they hair to grow till it hide they hinder part they also allow they nail to grow till they become pointed and sharp like sword each have a string round he neck to which hang a earthen dish and when hungry they go to any house whence the inhabitant cheerfully supply they with boil rice they have many law and religious precept by which they imagine that they please god part of they devotion consist in build _ kan _ or inn on the highway for the accommodation of traveller where also certain pedlar or small dealer be establish from whom the passenger may purchase what they stand in need of there be also public woman who expose themselves to traveller some of these be call _ woman of the idol _ the origin of which institution be this : when a woman have lay herself under a vow that she may have child if she happen to produce a handsome daughter she carry she child to the _ bod _ -lrb- 12 -rrb- so the idol be call when this girl have attain the proper age she take a apartment in the temple and wait the arrival of stranger to whom she prostitute herself for a certain hire and deliver she gain to the priest for the support of the temple all these thing they reckon among they meritorious deed praise be god who have free we from the sin which defile the people involve in unbelief not very far from almansur there be a famous idol call multan to which the indian resort in pilgrimage from the remotest part some of the pilgrim bring the odoriferous wood call hud ul camrunus so call from camrun where there be excellent aloes-wood some of this be worth 200 _ dinar _ the mawn and be commonly mark with a seal to distinguish it from another kind of less value this the devotee give to the priest that it may be burn before the idol but merchant often buy it from these priest there be some indian make profession of piety who go in search of unknown island or those newly discover on purpose to plant cocoa nut tree and to sink well for the use of ship there be people at oman who cross to these island that produce the cocoa nut tree of plank make from which they build ship sew the plank with yarn make from the bark of the tree the mast be make of the same wood the sail be form from the leaf and the bark be work up into cordage : and have thus complete they vessel they load she with cocoa nut which they bring to oman for sale the country of the zinge or negro be of vast extent -lrb- 13 -rrb- these people commonly sow millet which be the chief food of the negro they have also sugar-canes and other tree but they sugar be very black the negro be divide among a great number of king who be eternally at war with each other they king be attend by certain man call moharamin each of whom have a ring in he nose and a chain round he neck when about to join battle with the enemy each of the moharamin take the end of he neighbor 's chain and pass it through the ring in he own nose by which the whole be chained together so that no one can possibly run away deputy be then send to endeavor to make peace and if that be do the chain be unfastened and they retire without fight but otherwise when once the sword be unsheathed every one of these man must conquer or die on the spot -lrb- 14 -rrb- these people have a profound veneration for the arab and when they meet any one they fall down before he say this man come from the land of date of which they be very fond they have preacher among they who harangue with wonderful ability and perseverance some of these profess a religious life and be cover with the skin of leopard or ape one of these man will gather a multitude of people to whom he will preach all day long concern god or about the action of they ancestor from this country they bring the leopard skin call zingiet which be very large and broad and ornamented with red and black spot in this sea be the island of socotra whence come the best aloe this island be near the land of the zinge or negro and be likewise near arabium and most of its inhabitant be christian which be thus account for : when alexander have subdue the empire of persium he preceptor aristotle desire he to search out the island of socotra which afford aloe and without which the famous medicine hiera -lrb- 15 -rrb- could not be compound desire he likewise to remove the native and to plant there a colony of greek who might supply syrium greece and egypt with aloe this be do accordingly and when god send jesus christ into the world the greek of this isle embrace the christian faith like the rest of they nation and have persevere in it to this day like all the other inhabitant of the island -lrb- 16 -rrb- in the first book no mention be make of the sea which stretch away to the right as ship depart from oman and the coast of arabium to launch out into the great sea : and the author describe only the sea on the left hand in which be comprehend the sea of indium and china in this sea to the right as you leave oman be the country of sihar or shihr where frankincense grow and other country possess by the nation of ad hamyar jorham and thabatcha who have the sonna in arabic of very ancient date but differ in many thing from what be in the hand of the arab and contain many tradition unknown to we they have no village and live a very hard and miserably wander life but they country extend almost as far as aden and judda on the coast of yaman or arabia the happy from judda it stretch up into the continent as far as the coast of syrium and end at kolzum the sea at this place be divide by a slip of land which god have fix as a line of separation between the two sea -lrb- 17 -rrb- from kolzum the sea stretch along the coast of the barbarian to the west coast which be opposite to yaman and then along the coast of ethiopium from whence we have the leopard skin of barbary -lrb- 18 -rrb- which be the best of all and the most skilfully dress and lastly along the coast of zeilah whence come excellent amber and tortoiseshell when the siraff ship arrive in the red sea they go no farther than judda whence they cargo be transport to cairo or _ kahira _ by ship of kolsum the pilot of which be acquaint with the navigation of the upper end of this sea which be full of rock up to the water 's edge because also along the coast there be no king -lrb- 19 -rrb- and scarcely any inhabitant and because every night ship be oblige to put into some place for safety for fear of striking on the rock or must ride all night at anchor sailing only in the day-time this sea be likewise subject to very thick fog and to violent gale of wind and be therefore of very dangerous navigation and devoid of any safe or pleasant anchorage it be not like the sea of indium and china whose bottom be rich with pearl and ambergris whose mountain be store with gold precious stone and ivory whose coast produce ebony redwood aloe camphor nutmeg clove sandal and all other spice and aromatic where parrot and peacock be bird of the forest and in which musk and civet be collect in abundance : so productive in short be these shore of article of infinite variety and inestimable value that it be vain to endeavor to make any enumeration ambergris be throw upon this coast by the flux of the sea but its origin be unknown it be find on the coast of the indy but the best which be of a bluish white and in round lump be get upon the barbarian coast : or on the confines of the land of the negro towards sihar and that neighborhood the inhabitant of that country have camel train for the purpose on which they ride along the shore in moonshine night and when the camel perceive a piece of amber he bend he knee on which the rider dismount and secure he prize there be another kind which swim on the surface of the sea in great lump sometimes as big as the body of a ox or somewhat less when a certain fish name _ tal _ of the whale tribe see these float lump he swallow they and be thereby kill and when the people who be accustom to this fishery see a whale float on the surface they know that this whale have swallow ambergris and go out in they boat they dart they harpoon into its body and tow it on shore and split the animal down the back to get out the ambergris what be find about the belly of the whale be commonly spoil by the wet and have a unpleasant scent but the ambergris which be not contaminate by the ordure in the belly of the whale be perfectly good -lrb- 20 -rrb- it be not unusual to employ the vertebra of this species of whale as stool and it be say there be many house in the village of tain ten league from siraff in which the lintel of the door be make of whale rib a eye-witness tell I that he go to see a whale which have be cast ashore near siraff and find the people mount on its back by means of ladder that they dig pit in different part of he body and when the sun have melt the grease into oil they collect this and sell it to the master of ship who mix it up with some other matter use by seaman for the purpose of serve the bottom of they vessel and secure the seam of the plank to prevent or to stop leak this whale-oil sell for a great deal of money and the bone of the whale be sell by the druggist of bagdat and bassora the pearl oyster be at first a small thin tender substance resemble the leaf of the plant call _ anjedana _ and swim on the surface of the sea where it stick to the side of ship under water it there harden grow larger and become cover by a shell after which it become heavy and fall to the bottom of the sea where it subsist and grow in a way of which we be ignorant the include animal resemble a piece of red flesh or like the tongue of a animal towards the root have no bone vein or sinew one opinion of the production of pearl in this shell-fish be that the oyster rise to the surface when it rain and by gaping catch the drop of rain which harden into pearl the more likely opinion be that the pearl be generate within the body of the oyster for most of they be fix and not moveable such as be loose be call _ seed _ pearl a arab come once to bassora with a pearl of great value which he shew to a merchant and be astonish when he get so large a sum for it as a hundred dram of silver with which he purchase corn to carry back to he own country but the merchant carry he acquisition to bagdad where he sell it for a large sum of money by which he be afterwards enable to extend he dealings to a great amount the arab give the follow account of the way in which he have find this large pearl : go one day along the shore near saman in the district of bahrein -lrb- 21 -rrb- he see a fox lie dead with something hang at he muzzle which hold he fast which he discover to be a white lucid shell in which he find this pearl he conclude that the oyster have be throw ashore by a tempest and lay with its shell open on the beach when the fox attract by the smell have thrust in he muzzle to get at the meat on which the oyster close its shell and hold he fast till he die : for it be a property of the oyster never to let go its hold except forcibly open by thrust in a iron instrument between the shell carefully guard its include pearl as a mother preserve she child the king of the indy wear ear-ring of gold set with precious stone and they wear collar of great value adorn with gem of various color chiefly green and red yet pearl be most esteemed and they value surpass that of all other jewel and these they hoard up in they treasury with they most precious thing the grandee of they court they great officer and the military commander wear similar jewel in they collar they dress be a kind of half vest and they carry parasol make of peacock feather to shade they from the sun and be surround by great train of servant among the indian there be certain people who never eat two out of the same dish or even at the same table on account of some religious opinion when these come to siraf and be invite by we considerable merchant be there a hundred of they more or less they must each have a separate dish without the least communication with the rest they king and principal person have fresh table make for they every day with little dish and plate weave of the cocoa nut leaf out of which they eat they victuals and when they meal be over the table dish and plate be all throw into the water together with the fragment of they food so that they must have a fresh service for every meal to the indy the merchant use formerly to carry the dinar call sindiat or gold coin of the _ sind _ which pass there for three of we dinar or even more thither also be carry emerald from egypt which be much use for set in ring -lrb- 1 -rrb- from the description of this place afterwards in the travels of ebn wahab in this article it appear to have be nankin -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the chronology of the chinese history be attend with extreme difficulty accord to du halde : in the reign of the emperor _ hi tseng _ the 18th of the _ tsong _ dynasty the empire fall into great confusion in consequence of heavy taxation and a great famine occasion by the inundation of the river and the ravages of locust these thing cause many insurrection and a rebel name _ hoan tsium _ put himself at the head of the malcontent and drive the emperor from the imperial city but he be afterwards defeat and the emperor restore it must be own that there be about twenty year difference between the time of the rebellion mention in the text and the date of the great revolt as assign by du halde but whether the mistake lie in the arabian manuscript or in the difficulty of chinese chronology i can not take upon I to determine yet both story probably relate to the same event -- harri -lrb- 3 -rrb- accord to abulpharagius one abu say revolt against the khaliff al mohated in the year of the hegira 285 ad 893 and lay waste bassora this date agree with the story of ebn wahab in the text -- harri -lrb- 4 -rrb- from this circumstance it appear probable that the great canal of china be not then construct -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- some circumstance in this very interesting detail have be a little curtail if abu zaid have be a man of talent he might surely have acquire and transmit more useful information from this traveller who indeed seem to have be a poor drivelling zelot -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- there be a vast deal of error in this long paragraph it certainly be impossible to ascertain the route or voyage of the wreck which be _ say _ to have be cast away on the coast of syrium if it could have be ascertain to have come from the sea of the chozar or the euxine by the canal of constantinople and the egean into the gulf of syrium and actually be utterly different from the build of the mediterranean it may or must have be russian if it certainly be build at siraff some adventurous arabian crew must have double the south of africa from the east and perish when they have well nigh immortalize they fame by open up the passage by sea from europe to indium : and as the arabian moslem very soon navigate to zanguebar hinzuan and madagascar where they colony still remain this list be not impossible though very unlikely the ambergris may have proceed from a sick cachalot that have wander into the mediterranean the north-east passage around the north of asia and europe which be adduce by the commentator in harri 's collection be now thoroughly know to be impracticable -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be difficult to say anything certain of the country to which this story relate which may have be some of the island now call philipine or perhaps some of the island in the strait of sunda -- harri such be the opinion of the editor of harri 's collection but i be disposed especially from the river mention to consider zapage as pegu and that malacca sumatra and java be the dependent island and particularly that malacca as the great mart of early trade though actually no island be the calum of abu zeid siam or cambodium may have be the kingdom of komar -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- this allude to the custom of the arab and other oriental to squat upon this occasion -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be presumable that this be a mere bravado in the full confidence that no one would be find sufficiently foolhardy to engage to follow the example it be needless to say that the promise of laugh aloud could not have be perform so that any one might have safely accept the challenge conditioning for the full performance of the vaunt -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- ruby emerald and topaze -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- obviously canoge in bengal -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- buddah the principal god of a extensive sect now chiefly confine to ceylon and india beyond the gange -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- the author make here a abrupt transition to the eastern coast of africa and call it the country of the zinge congeneric with the country of zanguebar and include azanium ajen and adel on the north and inhambane sabium sofala mocaranga mozambique and querimba to the south all know to and frequent by the arab -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- this incredible story may have originate

belong to the party and that he have work up along with this the whole of the narrative which have be separately publish by carpinus of he journey which indeed form by far the larger and more interesting portion of the work publish by vincentius this latter edition therefore have be consider as sufficient for the present collection because to have give both would have be a unnecessary repetition and it be here translate from the latin of hakluyt i 42 the object of this mission or embassy seem to have be as follow : a prodigious alarm be excite in europe by the victorious and destructive progress of the mongal or tartar who under the command of tuschi-khan and of batu-khan the son of tuschi advance through kipzhak russium poland and hungary all of which they have most horribly ravage and lay waste have penetrate even into silesium while by the eastern side or the caspian penetrate through transoxiana and persium under the command of zagatai-khan likewise a son of zingus and holagu-khan a nephew of zagataus they have make they appearance on the bank of the euphrate and tigri in this alarming conjuncture it be think advisable by pope innocent iv in a convocation of the clergy at lyon in 1245 to send ambassador to these formidable conqueror to endeavor to pacify they and induce they to turn the destructive tide of they conquest in some other direction and

it be water with river which be very rare hence there be no town or city except one name cracurim -lrb- 2 -rrb- which be say to be tolerably good we do not see that place although within half a day 's journey when we be at the horde of syra the court of they great emperor although otherwise infertile this land be well adapt for the pasture of cattle in some place there be wood of small extent but the land be mostly destitute of tree insomuch that even the emperor and prince and all other warm themselves and cook they victuals with fire of horse and cow dung the climate be very intemperate as in the middle of summer there be terrible storm of thunder and lightning by which many people be kill and even then there be great fall of snow and there blow such tempest of cold wind that sometimes people can hardly sit on horseback in one of these when near the syra horde by which name they signify the station of the emperor or of any of they prince we have to throw ourselves prostrate on the ground and could not see by reason of the prodigious dust it never rain in winter but frequently in summer yet so gently as scarcely to lay the dust or to moisten the root of the grass but there be often prodigious shower of hail insomuch that by the sudden melting of one of these at the time when the emperor elect be about to be place on he throne at which time we be at the imperial court above a hundred and sixty person be drown and many habitation and much valuable thing be sweep away in summer there be often sudden and intolerable heat quickly follow by extreme cold -lrb- 1 -rrb- this strange personification of the east and north as if they be stationary geographical term not merely relative only mean that mongalium lay in the most north-easterly part of the then known world -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- call likewise karakum or caracorum and say to signify the _ black sand _ -- e section iv _ of the appearance dress and manner of living of the tartar _ the appearance of the mongol or tartar be quite different from all other nation be much wider between the eye and cheek and they cheek be very prominent with small flat nose and small eye have the upper lid open up to the eyebrow

garment of the man and woman be alike use neither cloak hat nor cap but they wear strange tunic make of bucram purple or baldequin they gown be make of skin dress in the hair and open behind they

and be carry on sumpter-cattle while other be not capable of be take to piece and be carry on cart wherever they go whether to war or only travel to fresh pasture these be carry with they they have vast number of camel oxen sheep and goat and such prodigious multitude of horse and mare as be not to be find in all the rest of the world but they have no swine they emperor duke and other noble be extremely rich in gold and silver silk and gem they eat of every thing that be eatable and we have even see they eat vermin they drink milk in great quantity and particularly prefer that of mare but as in winter none but the rich can have mare milk they make a drink of millet boil in water every one drinking one or two cup in the morning and sometimes have no other food all day but in the evening every one have a small quantity of flesh and they drink the broth in which it be boil in summer when they have abundance of mare milk they eat little flesh unless it be give they or when they catch venison or bird section v _ of they good and bad custom _ -lrb- illustration : map of the western part of tartary & adjacent country -rrb- some of they custom be commendable and other execrable they be more obedient to they lord than any other people give they vast reverence and never deceive they in word or action they seldom quarrel and brawl wound or manslaughter hardly ever occur thief and robber be nowhere find so that they house and cart in which all they treasure be keep be never lock or bar if any animal go astray the finder either leave it or drive it to those who be appoint to seek for stray and the owner get it back without difficulty they be very courteous and though victuals be scarce among they they communicate freely to each other they be very patient under privation and though they may have fast for a day or two will sing and make merry as if they be well satisfy in journey they bear cold or heat with great fortitude they never fall out and though often drunk never quarrel in they cup no one despise another but every one assist he neighbor to the utmost they woman be chaste yet they conversation be frequently immodest towards other people they be exceedingly proud and overbearing look upon all other man with contempt however noble for we see in the emperor 's court the great duke of russium the son of the king of georgium and many sultan and other great man who receive no honor or respect so that even the tartar appoint to attend they however low they condition always go before they and take the upper place and even often oblige they to sit behind they back they be irritable and disdainful to other man and beyond belief deceitful speaking always fair at first but afterwards sting like scorpion they be crafty and fraudulent and cheat all man if they can whatever mischief they intend they carefully conceal that no one may provide or find a remedy for they wickedness they be filthy in they meat and drink and in all they action drunkenness be honorable among they so that when one have drink to excess and throw up he begin again to drink they be most importunate beggar and covetous possessor and most niggardly giver and they consider the slaughter of other people as nothing section vi _ of the law and custom of the tartar _ man and woman guilty of adultery or even of fornication be punish with death those detect in robbery or theft be likewise slay if any one divulge they council especially with regard to a intended war he receive a hundred blow on he buttock with a great cudgel as hard as a strong man can lay

for they will even marry they sister from other mother and they father wife after he death the younger brother also or some other of the kindred be bind to marry the wife of a deceased brother while i remain in the country a russian duke name andrew -lrb- 1 -rrb- be accuse before duke baatu of convey tartar horse out of the country and sell they to other nation be put to death although the fact be not prove against he after this the widow and younger brother of andrew come to baatu supplicate that they might not be deprive of the dukedom upon which baatu command they to be marry accord to the tartar custom and though both refuse as contrary to the religion and law of russium they be compel to this incestuous union after the death of they husband the tartar widow seldom marry unless when a man choose to wed he brother 's wife or he stepmother they make no difference between the son of a wife or of a concubine of which the follow be a memorable example the late king of georgium leave two son melich and david of whom the former be lawful and the other bear in adultery but he leave part of he dominion to he bastard melich appeal to the tartar emperor for justice and david go likewise to the court carry large gift and the emperor confirm the will of they father even appoint david to have the superior authority because eldest bear when a tartar have more than one wife each have she own house and establishment and the husband eat drink and sleep sometimes with one and sometimes with another one be consider as principal wife and with she he reside oftener than with the other and though they be sometimes numerous they very seldom quarrel among themselves -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the previous account of the travels of carpinus hakl i 27 this andrew be say to have be duke of sarvogle or seirvogle perhaps mean yeroslave -- e section vii _ of they superstitious tradition _ in consequence of certain tradition they consider many indifferent action as criminal one be to thrust a knife into the fire or any way to touch a fire with a knife to take meat from the pot with a knife or even to hew any thing with a axe near a fire as they consider all these thing as take away the force of the fire another be to lean upon a whip for they use no spur or to touch arrow with they whip to strike they horse with they bridle to take or kill young bird or to break one bone upon another likewise to spill milk or any drink or food on the ground or to make water in a house for the last offence if intentional a man be slay or he must pay a heavy fine to the soothsayer to be purify in which case the house and all that it contain have to pass between two fire before which ceremony no person must enter the house nor must any thing be remove from it if any one take a bit of meat that he can not swallow and spit it out a hole be make in the floor of the house through which he be drag and put to death if any one tread on the threshold of a house belong to one of they duke he be put to death many such thing they account high offence but to slay man to invade the territory of other to take away the goods of other people and to act contrary to the command of god be no crime among they and they know nothing of the life to come or of eternal damnation but they believe in a future life in which they shall tend flock eat and drink and do those very thing which they do in this life at new moon or when the moon be full they begin any new enterprise they call the moon the great emperor and they worship that luminary on they knee all who dwell in they house must undergo purification by fire which be perform in this manner have kindle two fire at a convenient distance they fix two spear in the earth one near each fire stretch a cord between the top of these spear and about the cord they hang some rag of buckram under which cord and between which fire all the man and beast and house must pass and all the while a woman stand on each side sprinkling water on the passenger and recite certain verse if any one be kill by lightning all that dwell in the same house with the dead person must be thus purify otherwise the house bed cart felt garment and every thing else would be abandon as unclean when any messenger prince or other person arrive they and they gift must pass between two fire for purification lest they should bring witchcraft poison or any other mischief section viii _ of the beginning of they empire _ the land of mongolium be formerly divide among four different tribe or nation one of these be the yeka-mongal or the great mongol the second su-mongal or the water mongol who call themselves tartar from a river of that name in they territory the third be name merkat and the fourth metrit all these tribe resemble each other in form and complexion and speak the same language though they be divide into distinct province under separate prince in the land of the yeka-mongal live one name zingi a great hunter who use to rob and take much prey go into the neighbouring district where he seize all that come in he way and associate many under he command till at length the people of he nation attach themselves to he and follow he as they leader to do evil after some time zingi go to war with the su-mongal or tartars slew they duke and subjugate the nation and he successively reduce the merkat and metrite to he grow dominion the naymanus to whom all the surround tribe then pay tribute be much indignant at the elevation of zingi but they great emperor have lately die leave the authority divide among he son who be young and foolish and know not how to rule the people yet they invade the territory of the mongal slaying the inhabitant and carry off much prey on this zingi collect the whole strength of he subject and the naymani unite with the cara-cathayan gather a mighty army in a certain narrow valley to oppose he in which a great battle be fight and the mongal obtain the victory the confederate be mostly slay and those who escape be reduce to subjection zingi establish he son occoday ug daus or octai-khan in the land of the kara-kitayan where he build a town call omyl or chamyl -lrb- 1 -rrb- near which and to the south there be a vast desert in which there be say to be certain wild man who do not speak and have no joint in they leg yet have sufficient art to make feel of camel wool for garment to protect they from the weather -lrb- 1 -rrb- call chamil or hamus in the map in lat 43  n and long 92  e it stand in a province of the same name on the north side of the great desert of cobus and to the ne of the land of the kalmuk or little bucharium -- e section ix _ of the mutual victory of the mongal and cathayan _ after they return from conquer the naymanus and cara-cathayan the mongal prepare to go to war with the kythao or cathayan -lrb- 1 -rrb- but the mongal be defeat in a great battle and all they noble be slay except seven zingi and the rest who have escape from this defeat soon afterwards attack and conquer the people call huyrus -lrb- 2 -rrb- who be nestorian christian from whom they learn the art of write after this they conquer the land of sarugur and the country of the karanite and the land of hudirat and return into they own country take a short respite from war again assemble a great army they invade cathay and after a long struggle they conquer the greater part of that country and besiege the emperor in he greatest city the siege last so long that the army of the mongal come to be in want of provision and zingi be say to have command that every tenth man of he own army should be slay as food for the rest at length by great exertion the mongal dig a mine underneath the wall of the city through which a party enter and open the gate for the rest of the army so that the city be carry and the emperor and many of the citizen put to the sword have appoint deputy to rule over he conquest zingi return into mongalium with immense quantity of gold and silver and other precious spoil but the southern part of this empire as it lie within the sea have not be conquer by the mongal to this day -lrb- 3 -rrb- the people of cathay be pagan have a peculiar kind of writing of they own in which they be report to possess the scripture of the old and new testament they have also life of the father and house in which they pray at stated time build like church they be even say to have saint to worship one god to venerate the lord jesus christ and to believe eternal life but they be not baptise -lrb- 4 -rrb- they have no beard and they partly resemble the mongal in they feature they country be exceed fruitful in corn and abound in gold and silver wine and silk and all manner of rich commodity and the whole world have not more expert artificer in all kind of work and manufacture -lrb- 1 -rrb- the inhabitant of northern china then a separate kingdom from mangus or southern china -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the huir or uigur -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this probably allude to the difficulty experience by the mongal in force a passage across the great river hoang-ho and kian-ku -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- these absurd notion must have be pick up by the credulous papal messenger from ignorant or design nestorian in mongolium -- e section x _ of the war of the mongal against the greater and lesser indium _ when zingi and he people have rest some time after they conquest of cathay he divide he army and send one of he son name thosut - khan -lrb- 1 -rrb- against the comaniam whom he vanquish in many battle and then return into he own country another of he son be send with a army against the indian who subdue the lesser indium these indian be the black saracen who be also name ethiopian from thence the mongal army march to fight against the christian dwelling in the greater indium and the king of that country know by the name of prester john come forth with he army against they this prince cause a number of hollow copper figure to be make resemble man which be stuff with combustible and set upon horse each have a man behind on the horse with a pair of bellows to stir up the fire when approach to give battle these mount image be first send forwards against the enemy and the man who ride behind set fire by some means to the combustible and blow strongly with they bellows and the mongal man and horse be burn with wildfire and the air be darken with smoke then the indian charge the mongal many of whom be wound and slay and they be expel from the country in great confusion and we have not hear that they ever venture to return -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- probably tuschi-khan -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be needless to remark upon the confused and ignorant geography and the idle tale of a christian empire in indium in this section the strangely ill-told story of the copper image by which the mongal be scorch with wild-fire may refer to the actual employment either of cannon or rocket against the mongal in this invasion -- e section xi _ of monstrous man like dog and of the conquest of burithabeth _ in return through the desert we be tell by some russian priest at the emperor 's court that the mongal find certain woman who be ask where they man be say that all the woman of that country have human shape but that the male have the shape of great dog after some time they meet the dog on the other side of a river it be in winter the dog plunge into the water and then roll themselves in the dust on the land till the dust and water be freeze on they back and have do this repeatedly till the ice be thick and strong they attack the mongal with great fury but when the mongal throw they dart or shoot they arrow at they they rebound as if they have fall on stone neither could they weapon in any way hurt they but the dog kill some of the tartar and wound many with they tooth and finally drive they out of the country -lrb- 1 -rrb- on they return home the mongal come into the country of burithabeth of which the inhabitant be pagan and conquer the people in battle these people have a strange custom of eat they kindred when they die they have no beard for we see some of they go about with certain iron instrument in they hand with which they pluck out any hair they find on they face -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be surely unnecessary to remark on this ridiculous story of the canine man which no commentary could reduce to sense -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- these people may possibly have be the burat the same practice of eradicate the beard be still follow by the native tribe of america -- e section xii _ how the mongal be repulse at the caspian mountain by man dwelling in cave _ when zingi send the before-mentioned army into the east he march personally into the land of the kergi -lrb- 1 -rrb- which however he do not now conquer in this expedition the mongal be say to have penetrate to the caspian mountain which be of adamant attract they arrow and other weapon of iron -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the kirgus inhabit western turkestan between lake balkash and the caspian -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the remainder of this short section be so ridiculously fabulous as not to merit translation and be therefore omit -- e section xiii _ of the death of zingi and concern he son and the tartar duke or prince _ zingi be say to have be kill by lightning he have four son the first be call occoday or oktaus the second thosut tuzus or tuschus the third thiaday or zagathaus and the name of the fourth i could not learn from these four all the duke of the mongal be descend -lrb- 1 -rrb- cuyne or kajuk the eldest son of occoday or oktaus be now

be the superior of all the duke the son of thiaday be hurin and cadan the son of the son of zingi whose name i could not learn be mengu bithat and several other the mother of mengu be seroctan the

ouygat who be all in hungary cyrpodan who remain beyond the sea -lrb- 2 -rrb- make war against certain soldan of the saracen and other transmarine nation mengu chyrinen hubilaus sinocur cara gay sybedey bora berca and corensa all remain in tartary but there be many other duke whose name i could not learn -lrb- 1 -rrb- other author give a different account of the family of zingi accord to harri i 556 zuzus or tuschus be he eldest son who die six month before he father and he son baatu get a great part of tartary for he share zagathaus a son of zingi get transoxiana or the country of the kirgus tulus another son have chorassan persium and western indium octaus have mongalium and cathay or northern china carpinus or rather vincentius have sadly confound all authentic history by he rambling colloquial collection from ignorant relator and have miserably corrupt the orthography of name of nation place and person -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- probably mean in persium beyond the caspian sea -- e section xiv _ of the power of the emperor and of he duke _ the tartar emperor enjoy incontrollable power over all he subject insomuch that no man dare abide in any other place than he have assign and he even appoint the residence of all the duke the duke appoint the residence of the millenary or commander of a thousand man the millenary do the same with the centurion or captain of hundred and the centurion direct in what place the decurion or commander of ten be to dwell whatsoever order any of these officer receive from they immediate superior must be instantly and implicitly obey if the emperor demand the virgin daughter or sister of any one she be instantly deliver up nay he often collect the virgin from all the tartar dominion and retain such as he please for himself give away other among he follower all he messenger must be everywhere provide with horse and necessaries without delay : and all messenger come to he with tribute or otherwise must be provide on they way with horse carriage and all necessaries yet messenger from strange country suffer great distress and much want of provision and clothing especially when send to any of the prince and when they have to make any stay as they often allot for ten man what would hardly suffice for two and if they suffer any injury it be even dangerous to complain many gift be demand of they both by the prince and other and if these be refuse they be contemn owe to this we be constrain to expend in present a large portion of what have be bestow upon we by well disposed person to defray we expence in fine every thing whatever belong to the emperor so that no one dare to say that any thing be he own and the duke and prince exercise a equally incontrollable dominion upon all below they section xv _ of the election of the emperor occoday and of the expedition of duke bathy _ on the death of zingis-chan the duke assemble and elect he son occoday ugadaus or oktai-khan emperor in he place who immediately in a council of the noble divide the army and send bathy or baatu-khan who be next in authority against the land of altissodan and the country of the bisserminus -lrb- 1 -rrb- who be saracen though they speak the language of the comanian bathy defeat these people in battle but the city of barchin which be surround with strong wall resist for a long while until the tartar fill up the ditch and win the place which they destroy sargat surrender without resistance for which the city be not destroy but many of the citizen be slay and make captive and much spoil be take and the city be fill with new inhabitant the tartar march next against the rich and populous city of orna in which be many christian gassarian russian and alanian and many saracen the lord of the city being of that nation this town stand on a large river and be a kind of port exercise great trade be unable to reduce this place by force the tartar dam up the river and drown the whole city with the inhabitant and they goods hence they invade russium and besiege kiow a long while which they at length take and massacre the inhabitant this be a large and populous city but be now reduce to nothing and scarcely have two hundred house : and when we pass through russium we find immense number of human skull and bone scatter about from russium and comanium they proceed against the hungarian and polonian where many of they be slay : and have the hungarian withstand they manfully the tartar have be utterly defeat in they return from thence they invade and defeat the pagan morduan : whence they march against the bylerus of greater bulgarium which they almost entirely destroy thence they proceed to the north against the bastarcus of greater hungary whom they conquer and go farther north they come to the parossita and thence to the samogetae reach even to the ocean and from thence return into comanium -lrb- 1 -rrb- the busurman musurman or mahometan inhabitant of turkestan -- e section xvi _ of the expedition of duke cyrpodan _ at the same time occoday-khan send duke cyrpodan with a army to the south against the pagan kergi who have no beard whom he subdue after which he march against the armenian whom he conquer and likewise subdue a part of georgium the other part of that country be likewise under subjection and pay a yearly tribute of 20000 yperpera he thence march into the dominion of the great and powerful soldan of the deurus whom he defeat and proceed to the country of the soldan of aleppo which he subdue and afterwards reduce the caliph of baldach or bagdat to subjection who be force to pay a daily tribute of 400 byzant besides baldekin -lrb- 1 -rrb- and other gift every year the tartar emperor send messenger to require the presence of the caliph who send back great gift besides the regular tribute to prevail on the emperor to excuse he absence duke cyrpodan and he army still propose to invade more distant country and have not yet return into tartary -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be probably a manufacture of bagdat or baldach from whence its name and may have be flower silk or cloth of gold -- e section xvii _ of the military conduct of the tartar _ zingis-khan divide the tartar into company or division of ten of a hundred and of a thousand each every one of which have its appropriate officer over every ten millenary he place one general and over a army of several body of ten thousand man two or three duke one of whom have the superior command when they join battle against they enemy unless the whole army retreat by common consent all who fly be put to death if one two or more of a decury proceed bravely to battle and the rest do not follow the coward be slay if one two or more of the decury be make prisoner and the rest do not rescue they they be put to death every man must have two bow or at least one good bow three quiver full of arrow a axe and certain rope to draw the military machine the rich or officer have sharp-pointed sword somewhat curved and sharp on one edge they wear helmet coat of mail and cuiss and they horse even be arm some have they own armor and that of they horse make of leather ingeniously double and even triple the upper part of they helmet be of iron or steel but the hood which protect they neck and throat be of leather some have all they defensive armor compose of many small plate of iron a hand-breadth long and a inch broad perforated with eight small hole by which they be tie with small leather thong to strong thong of leather underneath so that the plate overlap each other in regular series and be firmly knit together the armor both of man and horse be often make in this fashion and be keep finely burnish some carry lance have hook to pull they enemy from horseback they arrow-head be exceedingly sharp on both edge and every man carry a file to sharpen they they target be make of wicker but they be hardly ever carry except by the night guard especially those in attendance upon the emperor and the prince the tartar be exceedingly crafty in war in which they have be continually engage for the last forty-two year against all the surround nation when they have to pass river the principal people secure they garment in bag of thin leather draw together like purse and closely tie they fix these to they saddle along with they other baggage and tie the whole to they horse 's tail sit upon the whole bundle as a kind of boat or float and the man who guide the horse be make to swim in a similar manner sometimes have two oar to assist in rowing as it be across the river the horse be then force into the river and all the other horse follow and in this manner they pass across deep and rapid river -lrb- 1 -rrb- the poorer people have each a purse or bag of leather well sew into which they pack up all they thing well tie up at the mouth which they hang to the tail of they horse and thus swim across -lrb- 1 -rrb- this mode of pass over river though carefully translate be by no means obviously describe i be apt to suppose that the leathern bag besides hold the apparel and other valuable be large enough to be blow up with air so as to serve as float like those use by the ancient macedonian a practice which they may have learn from the scythian the latin of vincentius beluacensis appear to have be translate from the french original of carpinus from the follow circumstance : what be here translate they _ other baggage _ be in the latin _ alias re duriore _ almost with certainty mistakenly render from the french _ leur autre harde _ -- e section xviii _ how the tartar ought to be resist _ no single kingdom or province can resist the tartar as they gather man for war from every land that be subject to they dominion and if any neighbouring province refuse to join they they invade and lay it waste slaughter the inhabitant or carry they into captivity and then proceed against another nation they place they captive in the front of battle and if they do not fight courageously they be put to the sword wherefore if the prince and ruler of christendom mean to resist they progress it be requisite that they should make common cause and oppose they with unite council they ought likewise to have many soldier arm with strong bow and plenty of cross-bow -lrb- 1 -rrb- of which the tartar be much afraid besides these there ought to be man arm with good iron mace or with axis have long handle the steel arrow-head should be temper in the tartar manner by be plunge while hot into water mixed with salt that they may the better be able to penetrate the armor of the tartar we man ought likewise to have good sword and lance with hook to drag they from they saddle which be a easy matter and ought to have good helmet and armor of proof for themselves and horse : and those who be not so armed ought to keep in the rear of those who be to discharge they arrow and quarrel over the head of they companion we army ought to be marshal after the order of the tartar already describe and under the same rigorous law of war whoever betake himself to plunder before victory be perfectly ascertain should suffer death the field of battle ought to be choose if possible in a plain where every thing may be see around the army should by no means be draw up in one body but in many division not too distant one band ought to be dispatch against those who first advance while another remain prepared to assist in time of need scout ought to be send out on every side to give notice of the approach of the enemy that band may always be send to meet band as they come on as the tartar be always anxious to surround they enemy each band ought however to be cautious not to pursue too far when they enemy fly lest they fall into a snare or ambush as the tartar fight more by stratagem than by main force and this the rather that we people may not fatigue they horse in which we do not abound while the tartar always have such number that they seldom remount one horse till after three or four day rest should even the tartar retire towards they own country we army ought by no means to retreat or separate as they often practice this stratagem to delude they enemy and induce they to divide and then return suddenly to destroy the country at they pleasure we general ought to keep they troops day and night on the alert and always armed ready for battle as the tartar be always vigilant like the devil and be ever devise how to commit mischief finally when a tartar fall from he horse in battle he ought immediately to be take or slay as when on foot even they be excellent archer and destructive to man and horse -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the word here use in the latin _ balistai _ be probably corrupt in transcription for _ balistarii _ and may either mean cross-bow-men or man for work balistae the ancient artillery if the expression be allowable arcubalistarius be the appropriate middle age latin for man arm with cross-bow -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- we good minorite seem in this chapter to have study the old proverb _ fa est ab hoste docerus _ but except in the lead political advice of the section he might have be better employ in follow the adage of _ ne sutor ultra crepidam _ -- e section xix _ of the journey of friar john de plano carpinus to the first guard of the tartar _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- set out by command from the apostolic see upon we journey to the tartar lest there might arise danger from they proximity to the church of god we come first to the king of bohemia with whom we be acquaint and who advise we to travel through poland and russium because he have kinsman in poland through whose assistance we might be enable to travel in russium and he supply we with recommendatory letter and passport give we free passage as he charge through he dominion whence we proceed to the court of boleslaus duke of silesium he nephew who be likewise know and friendly to we he treat we in the same hospitable manner and transmit we free of expense to conrad duke of lautiscium or masovium where by god 's grace wasilico -lrb- 2 -rrb- duke of russium then be from whom we fully learn the art of the tartar as he have send messenger to they who be already return learn that it be necessary for we to make present we cause some skin of beaver and other animal to be purchase with part of the money which have be give we in charity to defray we expence and we receive more of the same skin from duke conrad from grimislava duchess of cracow from the bishop and from certain noble of that place and at the request of the duke bishop and noble of cracow wasilico conduct we into he country and entertain we there for some day at he expense likewise he convene he bishop at we request to whom we read the pope 's letter admonish they to return into the unity of the church add we own exhortation to the same purpose but because duke daniel the brother of wasilico be absent at the court of baatu they could not then give a satisfactory answer after this wasilico send we forward to kiow the chief city of russium under the conduct of one of he servant in which journey we be in great danger of we life from the lithuanian who often invade the border of russium in the very place through which we have to pass but by means of this servant we be secure against any injury from the russian of whom indeed the greater part have be slay or carry into captivity by the tartar in this journey we have almost perish of cold at danilou -lrb- 3 -rrb- through the prodigious depth of the snow although we travel in a wagon on we arrival at kiow and consulting with the millenary -lrb- 4 -rrb- and other noble respect we farther journey we be advise not to carry the horse we then have into tartary as they would all certainly die by the way as they be not use to dig under the snow in search of grass like the tartar horse and no food could be procure for they as the tartar make no provision of hay or straw or any other provender against winter we determine therefore to leave they behind under the care of two servant till we return and by means of present we prevail on the millenary to allow we post-horse and a guide we begin we journey on the second day after the purification -lrb- 5 -rrb- and arrive at canow which be under the immediate dominion of the tartar the governor allow we horse and a guide to another town of which one michea a most malicious person be governor who gain by we present conduct we to the first station of the tartar -lrb- 1 -rrb- the journal of carpinus begin here that of asceline never appear -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- at this period jeroslaw or jeroslaus be grand duke of wolodimir or wladimire then consider as the sovereign of russium who be succeed by alexander -- _ playf syst of chronol _ wasilico

section xx _ of he first reception by the tartar _ on the first Saturday after ash-wednesday while we be take up we quarter for the night near sunset a number of armed tartar come suddenly upon we in a threatening manner demand who we be have tell they that we be messenger from the pope and give they some victuals they immediately go away when we proceed on we journey next morning the chief of this guard meet we and demand to know the purpose of we journey we answer that we be messenger from we lord the pope the father and lord of the christian go to they emperor and prince and the whole tartar nation to desire peace and friendship between the tartar and the christian : and as the pope wish the tartar to become great and to acquire the favor of god he admonish they by we and by he letter to embrace the faith of christ without which they could not be save : that the pope be astonish to hear of they monstrous slaughter of mankind more especially of the hungarian mountaineer and polander who be he subject and who have neither injure or attempt to injure the tartar and as god be sore offend by such proceedings the pope admonish they to refrain in future and to repent of what they have do and request a answer as to they future intention on which they promise we horse and a guide to corrensa but for which favor they demand present some of they ride swiftly on before to inform corrensa of we message and we follow this corrensa be general or duke of all the tartar who be place as a guard against the people of the west lest some enemy might suddenly invade they and be say to have 60000 man under he command section xxi _ he reception at the court of corrensa _ on we arrival at the residence of corrensa we tent be order to be pitch at a considerable distance and he agent come to demand what gift we would offer in pay we obeisance to he we answer that we lord the pope have send no gift as he be uncertain if we should ever arrive at they country consider the dangerous place we have to pass through but that we should honor he with part of those thing which have be give we to defray the charge of we journey have receive we gift we be conduct to the orda or tent of the duke corrensa and instruct to bow we left knee thrice before he door take great care not to set we foot on the threshold and when enter we be to repeat on we knee the word which we have say before this do we present the letter of the pope but the interpreter whom we have hire at kiow be not able to explain they sufficiently nor could any one be find equal to the task from this place post-horse be appoint to conduct we with all speed to duke baatu under the guidance of three tartar this baatu be the most powerful prince among they next to they emperor we begin we journey to he court on the first Tuesday in lend and ride as fast as we could trot though we change we horse twice or thrice every day and often travel in the night it be maunday Thursday before we accomplish we journey the whole of this journey be through the land of comanium which be all a uniform plain water by four large river the first of these be the dnieper or boristhene on the russian side of which the duke corrensa and montij march up and down the latter who march on the other side of the plain be the more powerful of the two -lrb- 1 -rrb- the second river be the don or tanai of the ancient on the bank of which a certain prince name tirbon sojourn who be marry to the daughter of baatu the third and largest be the volga or rha on which baatu reside the fourth be the jaik or rhymnus on each bank of which a millenary command all these descend southwards in winter to the sea and travel in summer up these river towards the northern mountain all these river especially the volga abound in fish and run into the great sea from which the arm of st george extend past constantinople -lrb- 2 -rrb- while on the dnieper we travel many day upon the ice and on the shore of the sea we find the ice three league broad before we arrival at the residence of baatu two of we tartar ride on before to give he a account of what we have say to corrensa -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be difficult to understand the ambiguity here use unless we suppose that the station of montij be on the right bank of the dnieper while certainly that of corrensa be on the left or north-east bank -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the euxine and caspian be here confound as one sea it be scarcely necessary to observe that the dnieper and don run into the euxine while the volga and jaik or ural be discharge into the caspian -- e section xxii _ the reception of carpinus at the court of baatu _ when we arrive at the residence of baatu in the land of comanium we be order to pitch we tent a full league from he station and when we be to be introduce at he court we be inform that it be previously necessary for we to pass between two fire we refuse this at first but be tell there be no danger and that it be only precautionary in case we intend any mischief to they lord or should have bring poison along with we as the fire would remove all evil on which we comply that we might remove all suspicion of any such sinister intention after this when we come to the orda we be question by eldegay the agent of the prince respect the gift we mean to offer and make the same reply we have give at the court of corrensa we gift be offer and accept and have declare the object of we journey we be introduce into the presence make we obeisance and be admonish respect the threshold as formerly mention we then rehearse we former oration on we knee and produce we letter and request the aid of interpreter to translate they these be send we on good Friday and with they assistance we letter be carefully translate into the russian tartarian and saracen language and present to baatu who read they with attention we be then conduct back to we lodging but no food be give we except a little millet in a dish on the first evening of we arrival baatu carry himself with great magnificence have porter and all other officer after the manner of the emperor and sit in a elevated place like a throne along with one of he wife some of he brother and son and noble sit below he on bench and all other on the ground behind the rest the man be on he right and the woman on he left he use some beautiful and large linen tent which formerly belong to the king of hungary and no person however great presume to enter he tent without leave except he own family at this interview we be seat on he left hand but on we return from the emperor we be place on the right a table stand near the door of the tent or house on which there be abundance of drink in golden and silver vessel neither baatu nor any of the tartar prince drink in public without have singer and harper play before they when he ride there be a small tent canopy or umbrella carry over he head on the point of a spear and the same be do to all the tartar prince and they wife baatu be extremely courteous to he people yet be hold in great awe he be exceedingly sagacious crafty in war and inexorably cruel in battle and have be long experience in the conduct of warlike enterprise section xxiii _ the journey through the land of comanium and of the kangittae _ on easter eve we be again call to the court and eldegay whom we have mention before as the agent of baatu come out to we from the tent say that we must go forwards to the court of they emperor : but they detain a part of we company under pretence of send they back to the pope we accordingly give letter to these person recite all that have hitherto occur but they get no farther than the residence of duke montij where we join they on we return homewards next day be easter after prayer and a slight breakfast we depart from the court of baatu in much dejection of spirit accompany by two guide we be so feeble that we could hardly support the fatigue of ride we only food during lend have be millet boil with water and we only drink melt snow pass eastward through comanium we travel continually with great expedition change we horse five time a day and sometimes oftener except when we have to pass through desert on which occasion we have stronger horse allow that be able to undergo the whole labor in this manner we travel almost without cease from the beginning of lend until eight day after easter include we journey to the court of baatu on the north of comanium immediately beyond russium lie the people call morduyni-byleri -lrb- 1 -rrb- in great bulgarium and the bastarcus in great hungary beyond the bastarcus be the parosita and samogeta and beyond these on the desert shore of the ocean a people who be say to have dog face on the south comania have the alani circassian gazarian greece and constantinople the land of the iberian the catte the brutach who be say to be jew who shave the whole of they head and the land of the scythian georgian armenian and turk on the west be hungary and russium comanium be a country of great length and breadth the inhabitant of which be mostly extirpate by the tartar though many of they be reduce to bondage and some flee but the fugitive have in general return and now serve the tartar we next enter the land of the kangittae which have few inhabitant owe to a great scarcity of water from this circumstance several of the servant of jeroslaus duke of russium perish in the desert when travel to join he in the land of the tartar both here and in comanium we find many human bone and skull in large heap -lrb- 2 -rrb- the comanian and kangitta be pagan who dwell in tent and live entirely on the produce of they flock and herd without practise any tillage whatever on they conquest a great part of the kangittae be root out by the tartar and the remnant reduce to bondage -lrb- 1 -rrb- the morduynus mordua or merda be probably the same people with those now call tscheremiss who call themselves mari-murt or the people of marus -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- probably tartar trophy of victory even timor the great mongol conqueror after zingi so much vaunted by many writer for he virtue and humanity use to order the erection of immense pyramid of recent human head in memory of victory -- e section xxiv _ the arrival of carpinus at the first station of the new emperor _ from the land of the kangittae we enter the country of the biserminus who speak the comanian language and observe the law of mahomet in this country we see innumerable ruin city and castle and many town leave desolate the former sovereign of this country which be full of high mountain be call alti soldan who with all he lineage be destroy by the tartar on the south side lie jerusalem and baldach or bagdat and on its nearest border dwell two tartar duke burin and cadan son of thiaday the son of zingis-chan to the north be the land of the black kitayan and the ocean -lrb- 1 -rrb- syban the brother of baatu dwells in the land of the biserminus we travel in this country from ascension-day until eight day before the feast of st john the baptist 16th June when we enter the land of the black kitayan in which the emperor have build a house where we be invite to drink and the resident there for the emperor cause the principal people of the city and even he own two son to dance before we -lrb- 2 -rrb- go from thence we come to a certain sea have a small mountain on its bank in which there be say to be a hole whence such vehement tempest of wind issue in winter that traveller can hardly pass without imminent danger in summer the noise of the wind be hear proceed from this hole but it be then quite gentle we travel along the shore of this sea for several day leave it upon we left and though this sea be not of very large dimension it contain a considerable number of island -lrb- 3 -rrb- ordu whom we have already mention as the senior of all the tartar duke dwell in this country in the orda or court of he father where one of he wife bear rule for accord to the tartar custom the court of prince and noble be never dissolve at they death but be keep up under the government of one of he wife to whom the gift be continue which use to be give to they lord in this place therefore we arrive at the first court under the immediate jurisdiction of the emperor in which one of he wife dwell but as we have not yet be present to the emperor we be not invite or even permit to enter the station but be exceedingly well entertain in we tent after the tartar fashion and be allow to remain there one day for rest and refreshment -lrb- 1 -rrb- the confused geographical notice of this traveller be so uninstructive as not to merit any commentary a good account of the present state of these immense region will be find in pinkerton 's modern geography article independent tartary chinese tartary and asiatic russium the ancient and perpetually change distribution of nation in scythium or tartary in its most extended sense almost elude research and would require lengthen dissertation instead of illustrative note -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- from the subsequent travels of rubruqui it will appear that this ceremony be in honor of the tartar messenger go from baatu to the emperor not from respect to the papal envoy -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this sea be obviously the lake balkash or palkati-nor at the south end of which we map represent a group of island -- e section xxv _ the arrival of carpinus at the court of the emperor elect _ leave this place on the eve of st peter and paul 28th June we enter the country of the pagan naymanus -lrb- 1 -rrb- and next day be excessively cold attend by a great fall of snow indeed this country be very mountainous and excessively cold and have very little plain ground wherefore these nation have no tillage but dwelt in tent which be destroy by the tartar we travel through this country for many day and at length enter the land of the mongal whom we call tartar through this latter country we continue we journey for about three week continually ride with great expedition and at length arrive at the residence of the emperor elect on the feast of mary magdalen 22d July in the whole of this journey we use extraordinary exertion as we tartar guide be order to bring we with all expedition to attend the solemn court which have be long appoint for the election of the emperor : on which account we always travel from early morning till night without stop to take food and we often come to we quarter so late as not to get any food that night but be force to eat in the morning what we ought to have have for supper we change horse frequently every day and travel constantly as hard as we horse could trot -lrb- 1 -rrb- the soongarium of modern geography -- e section xxvi _ of the reception of the papal nuncio at the court of kujak or cuyne-khan _ on we arrival at the court of cuyne he order we to be provide with a tent and all necessary expence after the tartar custom and he people treat we with more attention and respect than they shew to any other messenger we be not admit into he presence as he have not be formally elect and invest in the empire but the translation of the pope 's letter and of we speech have be transmit to he by baatu after remain in this place for five or six day we be send to he mother who keep a solemn court in this place we behold a immense tent so vast in we opinion that it could have contain two thousand man around which there be a enclosure of plank paint with various figure all the tartar duke be assemble in this neighborhood with they attendant and amuse themselves in ride about the hill and vally the first day these be all clothe in white robe the second day on which cuyne come to the great tent they be dress in scarlet the third day they be dress in blue and on the fourth in rich robe of baldakin -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the wall of board encircle the great tent there be two gate through one of which the emperor alone be allow to enter and though it stand continually open there be no guard as no one dare to enter or come out by that way all who be admit enter by the other gate at which there be guard arm with bow arrow and sword if any one presume to approach the tent beyond the assign limit he be severely beat if catch or if he attempt to run away he be shoot at with arrow many of the people whom we see here have upon they saddle bridle and other trappings of they horse to the value of twenty mark in pure gold accord to we estimation -lrb- 2 -rrb- the duke assemble in the great tent and consult together as we think about the election of the emperor the rest of the people be collect all round the wooden wall and at a considerable distance and in this manner they continue till almost noon then they begin to drink mare milk or cosmos and continue to drink amazing quantity till evening we be invite among they and they treat we with ale as we do not drink cosmos they intend this as a great honor but they make we drink so much in comparison with we ordinary diet as we be not able to endure but on make they understand that it be hurtful to we they desist from insist on we compliance on the outside of the door stand jeroslaus duke of susdal in russium a great many duke of the kithayan and solangus the two son of the king of georgium the envoy of the caliph of bagdat himself a sultan and more than ten other

the exaltation of cuyne as emperor _ we remain in this place call syra orda about four week in we opinion the election be make here though it be not publish because always when cuyne come out of the tent he be greet with a noise of music and be salute with beautiful rod tipt with scarlet wool which be not do to any of the other duke leave this place we all ride three or four mile to a fine plain near a river among the mountain where we find another tent erect call the golden orda in which cuyne be to have be install in the imperial seat on the festival of the assumption 15th August but on account of a vast fall of hail formerly mention the ceremony be defer this tent be erect upon pillar cover over with plate of gold and other beam be fix to the pillar by gold nail the whole be

certain person at about a stone 's throw distance from the rest be continually employ in make prayer and genuflexion always proceed slowly to the south we do not know whether they be make incantation or whether they bow they knee to god or otherwise and we therefore make no genuflexion when this ceremony have continue a long while the whole company return to the tent and cuyne be place upon the imperial throne on which all the duke kneel before he and the same be do by all the people except by we who be not he subject section xxviii _ of the age and demeanor of cuyne and of he seal _ when exalt to the imperial dignity cuyne seem to be about forty or forty-five year old he be of middle stature exceedingly prudent politic serious and grave in he demeanor and be hardly ever see to laugh or to behave lightly in any respect as be report to we by certain christian who be continually about he these christian of he family assure we likewise that he would certainly become a christian because he always keep some christian priest about he person and have at all time a chapel of christian establish near he great tent in which the clergy sing they devotions publickly and openly and strike the regular hour on bell accord to the custom of the greek church whatever number of tartar or other might be in the presence while no other of the tartar duke do any thing like this it be the custom of this emperor never to converse himself with any stranger however high he rank but always to hear as it be and to answer through a intermediate person : whoever propose any matter to he consideration or listen to he reply however great he quality must remain on he knee the whole time and no one must presume to speak on any subject after the determination of the emperor be express for the dispatch of affair both public and private he have agent secretary scribe and officer of all kind except pleader as every thing be conclude accord to he will and pleasure without strife or judicial noise : and the other prince of the tartar act exactly in the same manner while we remain at he court the emperor and all he prince erect a standard of defiance against the church of god the roman empire and all the christian kingdom and nation of the west unless they should become obedient to he command they avowed intention be to subdue the whole earth under they authority as they be command by zingis-khan and they have only abstain from this intention of late on account of the death of occaday-khan the emperor 's father who be poison of all the nation under heaven they be in some fear of the christian only and on this account they be now prepare to make war on we in all he letter they emperor style himself the power of god and the emperor of mankind and the seal of the present emperor be thus inscribe : god in heaven and cuyne-khan on earth the power of god : the seal of the emperor of all man section xxix _ of the admission of the papal and other envoy to the emperor _ we be call into the presence of the emperor in the same place where he have be inaugurate and chingay he chief secretary have write down we name and the name of those who send we and the name of the duke of solangus and other he read over all these name in a loud voice to the emperor and the assemble duke then everyone of we bow the knee four time before he and have warn we to beware of touch the threshold we be carefully search lest we might have any conceal weapon after which we enter within the precinct of the imperial tent at the east gate not even the tartar duke dare presume to enter at the west gate which be reserve for the emperor alone yet the lower people do not pay much regard to this ceremonious injunction at this time likewise all the other envoy now at the imperial residence be present but very few of they be admit within the tent on this occasion infinite quantity of rich gift of all kind be present to the emperor by the various envoy and messenger in samite purple robe baldakin silken girdle work with gold rich fur and other thing innumerable among these there be a splendid umbrella or small canopy to be carry over the head of the emperor all cover over with gem the

horse and mule likewise be present to he richly caparison and arm some with leather and some with iron we be likewise question as to what gift we have to offer but we be unable to present any thing as almost we whole substance be already consume at a considerable distance from the court there stand in sight on a hill above five hundred cart all fill with gold and silver and silken garment all these thing be divide between the emperor and he duke and the duke divide they portion among they follower each accord to he pleasure section xxx _ of the separation between the emperor and he mother and of the death of jeroslaus duke of russium _ leave this place we come to another where a wonderfully grand tent all of red cloth be pitch the gift of the cathayan at this place likewise we be introduce into the presence and always on these occasion we be offer beer and wine to drink and boil flesh to eat when we be incline in this tent there be a lofty gallery make of board on which the imperial throne be place most exquisitely carve in ivory and richly decorate with gold and precious stone and if we rightly remember there be several step by which to ascend the throne this throne be round above there be bench all around where the lady sit on the left hand upon stool and no one sit aloft on the right hand but the duke sit below on bench in the middle of the tent other sit behind they and every day there come great number of lady to the court these three tent which we have mention be of wonderful magnitude and the wife of the emperor have other tent sufficiently large and beautiful make of white feel at this place the emperor take leave of he mother who go to one part of the land and he to another to distribute justice about this time a concubine belong to the emperor be detect who have poison he father at the time when the tartar army be in hungary and owe to which incident they have be order to return she and a considerable number of she accomplice be try and put to death soon afterwards jeroslaus the great duke of soldal -lrb- 1 -rrb- in russium be invite as if to do he honor by the emperor 's mother to receive meat and drink from she hand grow sick immediately after return to he lodging and die in seven day illness he whole body become strangely of a blue color and it be currently report that he have be poison that the tartar might freely and totally possess he land -lrb- 1 -rrb- call susdal in a former passage -- e section xxxi _ how the friar in the presence of the emperor interchange letter _ soon afterwards the emperor send we to he mother as he intend to set up a flag of defiance against all the nation of the west as have be mention before and he be desirous to keep this circumstance from we knowledge have remain some day with he mother we return to he court where we continue a whole month in such extreme distress for victuals and drink that we could hardly keep ourselves alive for the provision allow we for four day be scarcely sufficient to serve we for one day neither could we go to purchase at the public market as it be too far from we but god send to we aid a russian goldsmith name cosma who be considerably favor by the emperor and who procure we some food this man shew we the imperial throne and seal both of which he have be employ to make after some time the emperor send for we and intimate by chingay he secretary that we should write down we message and affair and deliver they to he which we do accordingly many day afterwards we be again call to the presence and be ask if there be any person about the pope who understand the russian arabic or tartarian language to this we answer that we be ignorant of these language and though there be saracen in we land they inhabit at a great distance from we lord the pope and we propose that when they have write in the tartar language they might explain the meaning to we which we would carefully write down in we language and would then deliver both the original and the translation to he holiness on this they go from we to the emperor we be again call upon at martinma when kadac the chief minister of the empire with chingay and balum and several scribe come to we and explain the emperor 's letter word for word and when we have write it in latin they make we interpret every sentence to they to see if we have any way err and when both letter be write they make we read they over twice more lest any thing be mistake : say take heed that every thing be well understand as great inconvenience might arise from wrong conception they give we likewise a copy of the emperor 's letter in arabic in case any one might be find who could explain they in we country section xxxii _ the papal envoy receive a licence to depart _ these tartar minister inform we that the emperor propose to send envoy along with we and it seem to we that they wish we should ask this from the emperor and one of the principal among they advise we to make that request but this do not appear at all convenient and we answer that it do not become we to make any such petition but if it be the pleasure of the emperor to send envoy we should use we utmost endeavor with god 's assistance to conduct they in safety we be averse from this measure for the follow reason : lest see the war and dissension which subsist among the christian they should be the more encouraged to make war upon we : we be afraid that the messenger be mean to act as spy to examine the approach to we land : we dread that they might be slay by the way : for when the servant which attend we by desire of the cardinal legate of germany be on they return to he they be well nigh stone to death by the german and force to put off that hateful dress : and it be the custom of the tartar never to make peace with those who have slay they messenger till they have take a severe revenge fourthly we fear they messenger might be take from we by main force and lastly because no good could arise from they as they be to have no other commission or authority except merely to deliver the letter of the emperor to the pope and prince of christendom which letter we already have the third day after this be the feast of

in a manner divide about its middle into two part by means of two province which project into it one on the north and the other on the south that which be on the south be call synope and contain the castle and port of the sultan of the turk the northern province be call gasarium by the latin -lrb- 2 -rrb- and cassarium by the greek inhabitant of its coast which be the same with caesarium and from thence certain headland extend southwards into the sea towards synope from the nearest part of which they be 300 mile distant so that the distance from these point to constantinople be 700 mile in length and breadth and 700 mile to hiberia in the east which be a province of georgium we arrive in the province of gasarium or casarium which be of a triangular form have a city name kersova on its western extremity in which st clement suffer martyrdom while sail past that city we see a island contain a church which be say to have be build by the angel in the middle of this province and on a

have hear in the holy land that you lord sartach -lrb- 6 -rrb- have become a christian which have greatly rejoice all the christian and especially the most christian king of the french who be there in

in one on horseback i have bring with I from constantinople fruit of various kind muscadel wine and delicate biscuit to present to the captain that i might obtain free passage have be advise by the

bank and when the water of these spring reach the lake it coagulate into hard salt like ice from these salt spring sartach and baatu draw large revenue as people come from all part of russium to

which they carry away on the third day after leave soldaium we fall in with the tartar on join whom i think myself enter into a new world wherefore i shall use my best endeavor to describe they

journey distant each of which supply he daily with the caracosmo from the milk of a hundred mare so that he receive the daily produce of three thousand mare besides white cosmos which the rest of he subject contribute : for as the inhabitant of syrium pay the third part of they production to they lord so the tartar pay they mare milk every third day from the milk of they cow they make butter which they do not salt for preservation but boil and clarify it after which it be pour into bag make of sheep-skin and preserve for winter use the residue of the milk be keep till it become quite sour after which it be boil and the coagulum or curd which form be dry in the sun till quite hard and be preserve in bag for winter provision this sour curd which they call _ gryut _ when want for use in winter when they have no milk be put into a bag with hot water and by dilligent beating and agitation be dissolve into a sour white liquor which they drink instead of milk for they have a great aversion to drink water by itself section vii _ of the beast they eat of they garment and of they hunting party _ the great lord have farm in the southern part of they dominion from whence millet and

from meal and water do not appear -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- we falconer use the left hand for carry they hawk i leave the inexplicable use of the thong to be understand by professional falconer -- hakluyt ad loc -lrb- 4 -rrb- probably this conclude sentence mean that as the king of france have see some tartar in syrium the author do not deem it necessary to describe they form and fashion -- e section viii

tartar after have make we wait for they a long time under the shade of certain black cart a considerable number of they on horseback surround we they first question be whether we have ever before be among they and be answer in the negative they begin impudently to beg some of we victuals and we give they some of the biscuit and wine which we have bring with we from constantinople have drink one flaggon of we wine they demand more say that a man do not enter a house with one foot only but we excuse ourselves as not be well provide they next inquire whence we come and whither we be go to this i answer that hearing sartach be become a christian we wish to go to he that we might present you majesty letter to he they then ask if we come of we own accord or be send upon this errand to this i say that no one have compel I and that i have come voluntarily and by the desire of my superior be cautious not to say that i be the ambassador from you majesty they then require to know if we cart contain gold and silver or precious vestment as present for sartach to which i answer that sartach should see what we carry when we come to he presence and that they have nothing to do with such question but ought to conduct I to they captain that he if he think proper might direct I to be carry to sartach otherwise i should return there then be in this province one scacataus or zagathaus related to baatu to whom the emperor of constantinople have write requisitorial letter that i might be permit to proceed on my journey on be inform of this they supply we with horse and ox and appoint two man to conduct we on we journey and those which we have bring with we from soldaium return yet they make we wait a long while continually beg we bread to give to they child and they admire and covet every thing they see about we servant as they knife glove purse and point but when we excuse ourselves from they importunity allege that we have a long journey before we and must not give away those thing which be necessary for ourselves they revile I as a niggard and though they take nothing by force they be exceedingly impudent and importunate in beg to have every thing they see if a man give they any thing it may be consider as throw away for they have no gratitude and as they look upon themselves as the lord of the world they think that nothing should be refuse to they by any one yet if one give they nothing and afterwards stand in need of they assistance they will not help he they give we some of they butter milk call _ apram _ which be extremely sour after this we leave they think that we have escape out of the hand of the demon and the next day we arrive at the quarter of they captain from the tune when we leave soldaium till we get to sartach which take we two month we never lay under a house or a tent but always in the open air or under we cart neither do we see any town or the vestige of any building where a village have be though we see vast number of the tomb of the comanian on the same evening we conductor give we some cosmos which be very pleasant to drink but not have be accustom to that liquor it occasion I to sweat most profusely section xii _ of the court of zagathaus and how the christian drink no cosmos _ next morning we meet the cart of zagathaus laden with house and i think that a great city be travel towards we i be astonish at the prodigious drove of ox and horse and the immense flock of sheep though i see very few man to guide they which make I inquire how many man he have under he command and i be tell he have not above 500 in all half of whom we have already pass at another station then the servant who conduct we inform I that it be requisite for we to make a present to zagathaus and desire we to stop while he go forwards to announce we arrival it be then past three o'clock and the tartar unlade they house near a certain water after this the interpreter of zagathaus come to we and learn that we have not be before among they he demand some of we victuals which we give he he also require to have some garment as a reward for he trouble in interpret for we to he master but we excuse ourselves on account of we poverty he then ask we what we intend to present to he lord when we shew he a flaggon of wine and fill a basket with biscuit and a platter with apple and other fruit but he be not satisfy as we have not buy he some rich stuff however we enter into the presence of zagathaus with fear and bashfulness he be sit on a bed have a small citern or lute in he hand and he wife sit beside he who i really believe have amputate she nose between the eye that it might be the flatter for she have no nose in that part of she face which be smear over with black ointment as be also she eyebrow which seem very filthy in we eye i then repeat to he the exact same word which i have use before respect the object of we journey as we have be admonish by some who have be among they formerly never to vary in we word i request that he would deign to accept we small gift for be monk it be contrary to the rule of we order to possess gold or silver or rich garment on which account we have no such thing to offer and hope he would accept some portion of we victuals as a blessing he receive those thing and immediately distribute they among he man who be meet in he house to drink i likewise present to he the letter from the emperor of constantinople he then send these to soldaium to be translate because be in greek there be no person about he who understand that language he ask if we would drink cosmos for the russian greek and alanian christian who happen to be among the tartar and conform strictly to they own law do not drink that liquor and even think they be not christian who do so and they priest after such conduct formally reconcile they again to the church as if they have thereby renounce the christian faith i answer that we have still a sufficiency of we own drink but when that be do we should be under the necessity of use what might be give we he next ask we what the letter contain which we carry to sartach i answer that these be seal and contain only the word of friendship and good will he ask what i mean to say to sartach to this i answer that i should speak to he the word of the christian faith he ask what these be as he would willingly hear they i then expound to he the apostle creed as well as i be able by means of we interpreter who be by no means clever or eloquent on hear this he shake he head but make no reply he then appoint oxen and horse for we use and two man to attend upon we but he desire we to abide with he until the messenger should return with the translation of the emperor letter from soldaium we arrive at the horde of zagathaus in the ascension week and we remain with he until the day after pentecost or whitsun Tuesday be ten day in all section xiii _ how some alanian visit they on the eve of pentecost _ on the eve of pentecost or whitsunday there come to we certain alanian call there acia or aka who be christian after the greek form use greek book and have grecian priest but they be not schismatic like the greek as they honor all christian without exception these man bring we some sodden flesh which they offer we to eat and request we to pray for one of they company who have die but i explain to they the solemnity of the festival and that we could eat no flesh at this time they be much pleased with we exposition as they be ignorant of every thing relative to the christian rite the name of christ alone except they and many other christian both russian and hungarian demand of we if they might be save have be constrain to drink cosmos and to eat the flesh of animal that have be slay by the saracen and other infidel which the greek and russian priest consider as thing strangle or offer to idol they be likewise ignorant of the time of fasting neither could they have observe these in this region even if they have know they time and season i then instruct they as well as i could and strengthen they in the faith we reserve the flesh which they have bring we until the feast day for there be nothing to be buy among the tartar for gold and silver but only for cloth and garment which we have not to dispose of when we servant offer any of the coin which they call yperpera -lrb- 1 -rrb- they rub it with they finger and smell it to see whether it be copper all the food they supply we with be sour and filthy cow milk and the water be so foul and muddy by reason of they numerous horse that we could not drink it if it have not be for the grace of god and the biscuit we bring with we we have surely perish -lrb- 1 -rrb- or hyperpyron a coin say to be of the value of two german dollar or six and eightpence sterling -- e section xiv _ of a saracen who desire to be baptize and of man who seem leper _ upon the day of pentecost a saracen come to visit we to whom we explain the article of the christian faith particularly the salvation of sinner through the incarnation of jesus the resurrection of the dead and judgment to come and how through baptism all sin be wash out he seem much affect with these doctrine and even express a desire to be baptize but when we be prepare for that ceremony he suddenly mount on horseback say that he must first consult he wife and he return next day decline to receive baptism because he would not then be allow to drink cosmos without which he could not live in that country from this opinion i could not move he by any argument so that these people be much estrange from become christian by the assertion of that opinion by the russian and other christian who come among they in great number on the same day which be the morrow of the feast of pentecost zagathaus give we one man to conduct we to sartach and two other to guide we to the next station which be at the distance of five day journey for we ox we be present also with a goat to serve we as food and a great many skin bag of cow milk but they give we very little cosmos as that liquor be in great estimation among themselves from the station of zagathaus we travel directly north and we attendant begin to pilfer largely from we because we take too little heed of we property but experience at length teach we wisdom at length we reach the bound of this province which be fortify by a deep ditch from sea to sea -lrb- 1 -rrb- immediately beyond this ditch we come to the station to which we conductor belong where all the inhabitant seem to be infect with leprosy and certain base people be place here to receive the tribute from all who come for salt from the salt pit formerly mention we be tell that we should have to travel fifteen day farther before meet with any other inhabitant with these people we drink cosmos and we present they in return with a basket of fruit and biscuit and they give we eight ox and a goat and a vast number of bladder full of milk to serve as provision during we long journey but by change we ox we be enable in ten day to attain the next station and through the whole way we only find water in some ditch dig on purpose in the vally and in two small river from leave the province of casarium we travel directly eastward have the sea of azoph on we right hand and a vast desert on the north which in some place be twenty day journey in breadth without mountain tree or even stone but it be all excellent pasture in this waste the comani call capchat -lrb- 2 -rrb- use to feed they cattle the german call these people valanus and the province valanium but isidore term the whole country from the tanai along the paulus maeoti alanium this great extent would require a journey of two month from one end to the other even if a man be to travel post as fast as the tartar usually ride and be entirely inhabit by the capchat comanian who likewise possess the country between the tanai which divide europe from asia and the river edil or volga which be a long ten day journey to the north of this province of comanium russium be situate which be all over full of wood and reach from the north of poland and hungary all the way to the tanai or don this country have be all waste by the tartar and be even yet often plunder by they the tartar prefer the saracen to the russian because the latter be christian : and when the russian be unable to satisfy they demand for gold and silver they drive they and they child in multitude into the desert where they constrain they to tend they flock and herd beyond russium be the country of prussium which the teutonic knight have lately subdue and they might easily win russium likewise if they so inclined for if the tartar be to learn that the sovereign pontiff have proclaim a crusade against they they would all flee into they solitude -lrb- 1 -rrb- from this circumstance it be obvious that the journey have be hitherto confine to casarium or the crimea and that he have now reach the line or isthmus of precop -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the english translation of hakluyt this word be change to capthak and in the collection of harri to capthai it be probably the kiptschak of the russian -- e section xv _ of we distress and of the comanian funeral _ in we journey eastward we see nothing but the earth and sky have sometimes the sea of tanai within sight on we right hand and sometimes we see the sepulchre in which the comanian use to bury they dead at the distance of a league or two from the line of we journey so long as we travel in the desert matter be tolerably well with we but i can not sufficiently express the irksome and tedious plague and trouble we have to encounter in the dwelling of the tartar for we guide insist upon we make present to every one of the tartar captain which we be utterly unable to afford and we be eight person in all continually use we provision as the three tartar who accompany we insist that we should feed they and the flesh which have be give we be by no means sufficient and we could not get any to buy while we sit under the shadow of we cart to shelter we from the extreme heat of the sun they would intrude into we company and even tread upon we that they might see what we have and when they have to ease nature would hardly withdraw a few yard distance shamelessly talk to we the whole lime what distressed I most of all be when i wish to address they upon religious subject my foolish interpreter use to say you shall not make I a preacher and i neither will nor can rehearse these word nay after i begin to acquire some little knowledge of they language i find when i speak one thing he would say quite differently whatever chance to come uppermost in he senseless mind thus see the danger i might incur in speaking by so faithless a interpreter i resolve rather to be silent we thus journey on from station to station till at length a few day before the festival of mary magdalen 22d July we arrive on the bank of the mighty river tanai or don which divide europe from asia at this place baatu and sartach have establish a station of russian on the eastern bank of the river on purpose to transport merchant and messenger across they ferry we over in the first place and then we cart and they boat be so small that they be oblige to use two boat tie together for one cart put a wheel into each in this place we guide act most foolishly for believe that the russian would provide we with horse and ox they send back those we have from the western side of the river to they master but when relay be demand from the russian they allege that they have a privilege from baatu exempt they from all service except those belong to the ferry and for which they be even accustom to receive considerable reward from such merchant as pass that way we be therefore constrain to remain three day in this place the first day they give we a large fresh fish -lrb- 1 -rrb- the second day the magistrate of the village gather from every house for we and present we with rye-bread and some flesh and the third day they give we dry fish of which they have great abundance the river tanai at this place be as broad as the seine at paris and before arrive on its bank we have pass many goodly water full of fish : but the rude tartar know not now to catch they neither do they hold fish in any estimation unless large enough to feed a company this river be the eastern limit of russium and arise from certain marsh which extend to the northern ocean and it discharge itself in the south into a large sea of 700 mile extent before fall into the euxine and all the river we have pass run with a full stream in the same direction beyond this place the tartar advance no farther to the north and they be now about the first of August begin to return into the south and they have another village somewhat lower down the river where passenger be ferry over in winter at this time the people be reap they rye wheat do not succeed in they soil but they have abundance of millet the russian woman attire they head like those in we country and they ornament they gown with fur of different kind from about the knee downward the man wear a dress like the german have high crown conical hat make of feel like sugar loave with sharp point at length after represent that we journey be intend for the common benefit of all christian they provide we with ox and man to proceed upon we journey but as we get no horse we be ourselves under the necessity of travel on foot in this manner we journy for three day without meet any people and when both we ox and ourselves be weary and faint with fatigue two horse come run towards we to we great joy : we guide and interpreter mount upon these and set out to see if they could fall in with any inhabitant at length on the fourth day have find some people we rejoice like seafaring man who have escape from a tempest into a safe harbor then get fresh horse and ox we pass on from station to station till we at length reach the habitation of duke sartach on the second of the kalends of August -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the latin this fish be name barbatus which both hakluyt and harri have translate turbot a fish never find in river it be more probably a barbel in latin call barbus or it might be of the sturgeon tribe which likewise have beard-like appendage and be find in the don -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this accord to the roman method of reckon ought to be the last day of July yet rubruquis have previously mention the 1st of August a considerable time before -- e section xvi _ of the dominion and subject of sartach _ the region beyond the tanai be very beautiful especially towards the north where there be fine river and extensive forest in these dwell two different nation one of these name the moxel be ignorant pagan without any law who dwell in cottage among the wood and have no city they lord and the greater part of the nation be carry to the confines of germany by the tartar and be there slay by the german who be hold in great estimation by the nation who be subject to the tartar as they hope through they means to be free from the tartar yoke when a merchant come among these people the first person with whom he stop be oblige to provide he with all necessaries during he stay in the district and they be so little jealous of they wife that husband pay little regard to they infidelity unless directly under they eye these people have abundance of swine honey and wax precious fur and falcon beyond these dwell the merda -lrb- 1 -rrb- or merduus who be saracen or mahometan beyond they be the etilium or volga the largest river i ever behold which come out of the north from the country of the greater bulgarium and run southwards into a vast lake of four month journey in circuit of which i shall speak afterwards in the northern region by which we travel the tanai and volga be not above ten day journey asunder but towards the south they be at a much farther distance the tanai fall into the euxine and the volga into the before mention sea or lake which likewise receive many river from persium in the course of we journey we leave to the south certain great mountain on whose side towards the desert dwell the cergi and the alanus or aca who be christian and still carry on war with the tartar beyond these near the sea or lake of etilia or the caspian be certain mahometan name lesgi who be subject to the tartar beyond these again be the _ irongate _ which be construct by alexander to exclude the barbarian from persium of which i shall speak hereafter as i pass that way in my return in the country through which we travel between these great river the comanian dwell before it be occupy by the tarter -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the english of hakluyt and harri these people be call merda and marduus -- e section xvii _ of the magnificence of the court of sartach _ we find sartach encamp within three day journey of the river volga or etilium and he court or horda appear to we very large and magnificent as he have six wife and he eldest son three and each of these lady have a great house like those already describe besides that each have several smaller house and 200 of the chest-cart already mention we guide go immediately to a certain nestorian name coiat who have great influence at the court of sartach and this man carry we in the evening a considerable distance to a officer call in the tartar language the lord gate to whom belong the duty of receive messenger or ambassador we guide inquire what we have ready to present to this person and seem much offend when he find we have nothing to offer when we come into he presence he sit majestically have music and dancing perform before he i then speak to he the word formerly mention give a account of the cause of we mission and request that he would bring we and we letter into the presence of he lord i excused myself also that as i be a monk neither give receive or use any gold silver or other costly thing except we book and the vestment in which we serve god that i could bring no present to he or he lord and have abandon my own goods i could not transport such thing for other man he courteously answer that be a monk i act well in observe my vow : and that he stand in no need of any of we thing but on the contrary be ready to give we what we might need he then cause we to sit down and drink of he milk and afterwards desire that we should recite a benediction for he which we do he inquire who be the greatest sovereign among the franc to which i answer the emperor if he could enjoy he dominion in peace not so say he but the king of france for he have hear of you majesty from the lord baldwin of hainault i find also at this court one of the knight templar who have be at cyprus and have make a report of all that he have see there concern you majesty we then return to we lodgings whence we send a flaggon of we muscadel wine which have keep well during the journey and a box of we biscuit to this officer who receive the present very graciously and retain we servant all night in he dwelling in the morning he order we to come to court and to bring the king letter and we book and vestment along with we as he lord desire to see these thing this we do accordingly lade one cart with we book and vestment and another with wine biscuit and fruit then he cause all we book and vestment to be spread out and ask if we mean to bestow all these thing upon he lord a multitude of tartar christian and mahometan be around we on horseback at this time and i be sore grieve and afraid at this question but dissemble as well as i could i say that we humbly request he lord and master to accept we bread wine and fruit not as a present for it be too mean but as a benevolence lest we should appear to come empty handed that he lord would see the letter of the king my master which would explain the reason of we journey after which we and all we have would remain at he command : but that we vestment be holy and be unlawful to be touch or use by any except priest we be then command to array ourselves in we sacred vestment that we might appear in they before he lord then put on we most precious ornament i take a rich cushion in my arm together with the bible i have from you majesty and the beautiful psalter ornament with fine painting which the queen bestow upon I my companion carry the missal and a crucifix and the clerk clothe in he surplice carry a censer in he hand in this order we present ourselves and the feel hanging before the lord door be withdraw we appear in he presence then the clerk and interpreter be order to make three genuflexion from which humiliation we be exempt and they admonish we to be exceedingly careful in go in and out of the lord dwelling not to touch the threshold of he door and we be desire to sing a benediction or prayer for they lord and we accordingly enter in sing the salve regina immediately within the door there stand a bench plant with cosmos and drinking cup all sartach wife be assemble in the house and the moal or rich tartar press in along with we incommode we exceedingly then coiat carry the censer with incense to sartach who take it in he hand examine it narrowly he next carry he the psalter which he and the wife who sit next he minutely inspect after which the bible be carry to he on which he ask if it contain we gospel to which i answer that it contain that and all we other holy scripture i next deliver to he you majesty letter with its translation into the arabian and syriac language which i have procure to be do at acon -lrb- 1 -rrb- and there happen to be present certain armenian priest who be skilful in the turkish and arabian language and likewise the before mention templar have knowledge of both these and the syriac we then go out of the house and put off we vestment and we be follow by coiat accompany by certain scribe by whom we letter be interpret and when sartach have hear these read he graciously accept we bread wine and fruit and permit we to carry we book and vestment to we own lodgings all this happen on the festival of st peter ad vinculum -lrb- 1 -rrb- now call st jean d'acre -- e section xviii _ they be order to proceed to baatu the father of sartach _ next morning early a certain priest who be the brother of coiat come to we lodging and desire to have we box of chrism to carry as he say to sartach about evening coat send for we and say that the king we master have write acceptably to he lord and master sartach but there be certain difficult matter respect which he do not dare to determine without the order and advice of he father and that it be therefore necessary that we should go to he father leave the two cart behind we in which we bring the book and vestment because he lord be desirous to examine these thing more carefully suspect the evil that might arise from this man 's covetousness i immediately say that we would not only leave these cart but the other two also under he custody you shall not say he leave these two cart behind but as for the other two we will satisfy you desire but i insist upon leave they all he then desire to know whether we intend to remain in the country to which i answer that if he have thoroughly understand the letter of my lord and master he would have see that we be so inclined and he then exhort we to demean ourselves with patience and humility after which we part for that evening next day coiat send a nestorian priest for the cart to whom we cause all the four to be deliver after whom the brother of coiat come to we lodging and take possession of all the book and vestment which we have shew the day before at the court although we remonstrate against this procedure say that coiat have order we to carry those thing along with we that we might appear in they before baatu but he take they from we by violence say you bring all these thing to sartach and would you carry they to baatu and when i would have reason with he against this conduct he desire I not to be too talkative but to go my way there be no remedy but patience as we could not have access to sartach and we could not expect to procure justice from any other person i be even afraid to employ we interpreter on this occasion lest he might have represent matter in a quite different sense from what i should direct as he seem much incline for we to give away all we have my only comfort be that i have secretly remove the bible and some other book on which i set a great store when i first discover they covetous intention but i do not venture to abstract the psalter because it be so particularly distinguish by its beautifully gilded illuminations when the person come who be appoint to be we guide to the court of baatu i represent to he the necessity of leave we other cart behind as we be to travel post and on this be report to coiat he consent to take charge of these and of we servant before leave the residence of sartach coiat and other scribe desire that we should by no means represent they lord to baatu as a christian but as a moal : for though they believe some thing concern christ they be very unwilling to be call christian which they consider as a national appellation and they look upon they own name of moal as worthy to be exalt above all other neither do they allow themselves to be call tartar : as that be the name of another nation accord to the information i receive at this place leave the station of sartach we travel directly eastward for three day on the last of which we come to the etilium or volga and i wonder much from what region of the north such mighty stream should descend section xix _ of the reverence shewn by sartach mangu-khan and ken-chan to the christian _ at the time when the franc take antioch from the saracen -lrb- 1 -rrb- a prince name con-can or khen-khan hold dominion over all the northern region of tartary con be a proper name and can or khan be a title

con-khan this nestorian prince exalt himself to the kingdom and be call king john or prester john of whom ten time more be report than be true accord to the usual custom of the nestorian for they be apt to raise great story on no foundation thus they give out that sartach be a christian and they propagate similar story of mangu-khan and even of con-khan merely because these prince shew great respect to the christian the story of king john have no better foundation for when i travel through he territory no one there know any thing at all about he except only a few nestorian in these region likewise dwell con-khan formerly mention at whose court friar andrew once be and i pass through that region in my return this john have a brother a powerful prince and a shepherd like himself who be

they be another poor nation call tartar on the death of john the khan of the cara - kitayan without male issue he brother vut succeed to all he great riches and get himself to be proclaimed khan the flock and herd of this vut-khan pastured to the border of the moal among whom be one zingi a blacksmith who use to steal as many cattle as he possibly could from the flock of vut-khan at length the herd complain to they lord of the reiterate robbery which be commit by zingi and vut-khan go with a army to seize he but zingi flee and hide himself among the tartar and the troops of vut-khan return to they own country after have make considerable spoil both from the moal and the tartar then zingi remonstrate with the moal and tartar upon they want of a supreme ruler to defend they from the oppression of they neighbor and they be induce by he suggestion to appoint he to be they khan or ruler immediately after he elevation zingi gather a army secretly together and make a sudden invasion of the territory belong to vut whom he defeat in battle and force to fly for refuge into katay during this invasion one of the daughter of vut be make prisoner whom zingi give in marriage to one of he

mean they name come to be spread abroad in the world as wherever they make they appearance the astonished people be in use to run away cry out the tartar the tartar in consequence of almost continual war this nation of the tartar be now almost utterly extirpate yet the name remain although the moal use every effort to abolish that name and to exalt they own the country where these tartar formerly inhabit and where the court of zingi still remain be now call mancherule and as this be the center of all they conquest they still esteem it as they royal residence and there the great khan be for the most part elect -lrb- 1 -rrb- about the year 1097 section xx _ of the russian hungarian alanian and of the caspian _ i know not whether sartach really believe in christ but be certain that he refuse to be call a christian and i rather think that he scoff at christianity he residence lie in the way through which the russian walachian bulgarian of the lesser bulgarium the soldaian or christian of casarium the kerki alanian and other christian have to pass in they way with gift or tribute to the court of he father baatu-khan and by this mean sartach be more connect with the christian than any of the rest yet when the saracen or mahometan bring they gift they be sooner dispatch sartach have always about he some nestorian priest who count they bead and sing they devotions there be another commander under baatu-khan call berta or berca who pasture he flock towards the iron-gate or derbent through which lie the passage of all the saracen or mahometan who come from persium and turkey to pay they gift and tribute to baatu and who make present to berta in they way this person profess himself to be of the mahometan faith and will not permit swine flesh to be eat in he dominion but it appear to baatu that he affair suffer detriment by this intercourse with the mahometan we learn on we return that he have command berta to remove from the iron-gate to the east side of the volga for the space of four day which we spend in the court of sartach we have no victuals allow we except once a little cosmos and during we journey to the residence of he father baatu we travel in great fear on account of certain russian hungarian and alanian servant of the tartar who often assemble secretly in the night in troops of twenty or thirty together and be arm with bow and arrow murder and rob whoever they meet with hide themselves during the day these man be always on horseback and when they horse tire they steal other from the ordinary pasture of the tartar and each man have generally one or two spare horse to serve as food in case of need we guide therefore be in great fear lest we might fall in with some of these straggler besides this danger we must have perish during this journey if we have not fortunately carry some of we biscuit along with we we at length reach the great river etilium or volga which be four time the size of the seine and of great depth this river rise in the north of greater bulgarium and discharge itself into the hircanian sea call the caspian by isidore have the caspian mountain and the land of persium on the south the mountain of musihet or of the assassin on the east which join the caspian mountain and on the north be the great desert now occupy by the tartar where formerly there dwell certain people call canglae or cangitae and on that side it receive the etilium or volga which overflow in summer like the nile in egypt on the west side of this sea be the mountain of the alanus and lesgi the iron-gate or derbent and the mountain of georgium this sea therefore be environ on three side by mountain but by plain ground on the north friar andrew in he journey travel along its south and east side and i pass its north side both in go and return between baatu and mangu-khan and along its western side in my way from baatu into syrium one may travel entirely round it in four month and it be by no means true as report by isidore that it be a bay of the ocean with which it nowhere join but be environ on all side by the land at the region from the west shore of the caspian where the iron-gate of alexander be situate now call derbent and from the mountain of the alanus and along the palus moeoti or sea of azoph into which the tanai fall to the northern ocean be anciently call albanium in which isidore say that there be dog of such strength and fierceness as to fight with bull and even to overcome lion which i have be assure by several person to be true and even that towards the northern ocean they have dog of such size and strength that the inhabitant make they draw cart like ox -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be astonishing how easily a small exaggeration convert truth to fable here the ill-told story of the light sledge of the tshutkus draw by dog of a very ordinary size be innocently magnify into cart drag by gigantic mastiff -- e section xxi _ of the court of baatu and we entertainment there _ on that part of the volga where we arrive they have lately build a new village in which there be a mixed population of russian and tartar establish for the service of the ferry that they may transport messenger go to and from the court of baatu as he always remain on the east side of the volga neither do he ever travel any farther north in summer than to the place where we arrive on that river and be even then descend towards the south from January till August he and all the other tartar ascend by the bank of river towards the cold region of the north and in August they begin again to return from the place where we come to the volga be a journey of five day northward to the first village of the greater bulgarium and i be astonish to think how the mahometan religion should have travel thither as from derbent on the extreme border of persium it be thirty day journey to pass the desert and ascend along the volga into bulgarium and in the whole track there be no town and only a few village where the volga fall into the caspian yet these bulgarian -lrb- 1 -rrb- be the most bigotedly attach to the religion of mahomet of any of the nation that have be pervert to that diabolical superstition the court of baatu have already go towards the south we pass down the stream of the volga in a bark from the before mention village to where he court then be and we be astonish at the magnificent appearance of he encampment as he house and tent be so numerous as to appear like some large city stretch out to a vast length and there be great number of people range about the country to three or four league all around even as the child of israel know every one on which side of the tabernacle to pitch he tent so every tartar know on to what side of the court of he prince he ought to place he house when he unlade it from he cart the prince court be call in they language _ horda _ which signify the middle because the chieftain or ruler always dwell in the midst of he people only that no subject or inferior person must place he dwelling towards the south as the court gate be always open to that quarter but they extend themselves to the right and leave accord as they find it convenient on we arrival we be conduct to a mahometan who do not provide we with any provision and we be bring next day to the court where baatu have cause a large tent to be erect as he house be two small to contain the multitude of man and woman who be assemble at this place we be admonish by we guide not to speak until we should receive order from baatu to that purpose and that then we should be brief in we discourse baatu ask if you majesty have send we as ambassador to he i answer that you majesty have formerly send ambassador to ken-khan and would not have send any on the present occasion or any letter to sartach have it not be that you have be advise they be become christian on which account only i have be send in congratulation and not through any fear we be then lead into the pavilion be strictly charge not to touch any of the tent rope which they consider as equivalent to the threshold of a house which must not be touch we enter the tent barefoot and with we head uncovered form a strange spectacle in they eye for though friar john de plano carpinus have be there before I yet be a messenger from the pope he have change he habit that he might not be despise we be bring forward into the middle of the tent without be require to bow the knee as be the case with other messenger baatu be seat upon a long broad couch like a bed all over gilt and raise three step from the ground have one of he lady beside he the man of note be all assemble in the tent and be seat about in a scattered manner some on the right and some on the left hand and those place which be not fill up by baatus wife be occupy by some of the man at the entrance of the tent there stand a bench well furnished with cosmos and with many superb cup of gold and silver richly set with precious stone baatu survey we earnestly for some time and we he he be of a fresh ruddy color and in my opinion have a strong resemblance to the late lord john de beaumont after stand in the midst of the tent for so long as one might have rehearse the _ miserere _ during which a universal silence prevail we be command to speak and we guide direct we to bow we knee before we speak on this i bow one knee as to a man but he desire I to kneel on both knee and be unwilling to contend about such ceremony i comply and be again command to speak i bethought I of prayer to god on account of my posture and begin in the follow manner : sir we beseech god the giver of all good who have bestow upon you these earthly benefit that he would grant you hereafter the blessing of heaven see that the former be vain without the latter be it know to you therefore of a certainty that you can not attain to the joy of heaven unless you become a christian for god have say whosoever believeth and be baptize shall be save but he that believeth not shall be condemn at this he modestly smile but the other moal clap they hand in derision and my interpreter who ought to have comfort I be quite abashed after silence be restore i proceed thus : have hear that you son be become a christian i come to he with letter from my master the king of the franc and you son send I hither for what reason it behove you to know he then desire I to rise and inquire the name of you majesty and my name and the name of my companion and interpreter all of which he cause to be set down in write after which he ask who it be that you majesty make war against as he have hear that you have depart from you own country with a army to which i answer that you war against the saracen because they have violate the house of god at jerusalem he then ask if you majesty have ever before send ambassador to he and i say never to he he then desire we to be seat and give we to drink and it be account a great favor when any one be admit to drink cosmos in he house while i sit look down upon the ground he desire I to look up either wish to observe I more distinctly or out of some superstitious fancy : for these people look upon it as a sign of ill-fortune when any one sit in they presence hold down he head in a melancholy posture and more especially when he lean he cheek or chin upon he hand we then depart from the tent of audience and immediately afterwards we guide come and tell we that as we king have desire that we might remain in this country baatu could not consent to this without the knowledge and authority of mangu-khan and it be necessary therefore that i should go with the interpreter to mangu while my companion and the clerk should return to the court of sartach and remain there till my return on this the interpreter begin to lament himself as a dead man and my companion declare that rather as separate from I he would allow they to take off he head i add that i could not possibly go without my interpreter and that we should need two servant that we might be sure of one in case of the other be sick upon this the guide return into the presence and report to baatu what we have say who now give order that the two priest and the interpreter should go forwards to mangu but that the clerk must immediately return to sartach and with this answer the guide come to we when i now endeavor to plead for the company of we clerk he desire I to be silent for as baatu have already give the order they must be obey and he dare not go again into the court goset we clerk still have twenty-six yperpera remain of the alms we have formerly receive ten of which he retain for himself and the servant and give we the remain sixteen we then sorrowfully part the clerk return to the court of sartach while we remain follow the court of baatu on assumption eve 14th August we clerk arrive at the court of sartach and the next day the nestorian priest be see adorn in the vestment of which they have deprive we -lrb- 1 -rrb- the greater bulgarium of we author seem to comprehend the province of astracan and casan in russium -- e section xxii _ the journey to the court of mangu-khan _ from the audience we be conduct to the dwelling of a person who be order to provide we in lodge food and horse but as we have no present to give he treat we with great neglect we travel along with baatu down the bank of the volga for five week and be often so much in want of provision that my companion be sometimes so extremely hungry as even to weep for though there be always a fair or market follow the court it be so far from we that we who be force to travel on foot be unable to reach it at length some hungarian who have for some time be look upon as priest find out and relieved we distress one of these be able to sing with a loud voice and be consider by he countryman as a kind of priest be employ at they funeral the other have be decently instruct in the latin grammar so that he understand whatever we speak to he deliberately but be unable to make answer these man be a great consolation to we as they supply we with flesh and cosmos they request some book from we and it grieve I much that we could not comply have only one bible and a breviary but i make they bring some ink and paper and i copy out for they the hour of the bless virgin and the office for the dead it happen one day that a comanian passing by salute we in latin say _ salvete dominus _ surprize at this unusual salutation i question he how he have learn it and he tell I he have be baptize in hungary by we priest who have teach he he say likewise that baatu have inquire many thing at he respect we and that he have give he a account of the nature and rule of we order i afterwards see baatu ride with he company who be the whole of he subject that be householder or master of family and in my estimation they do not exceed 500 man -lrb- 1 -rrb- at length about the holyrood 14th September or festival of the exaltation of the holy cross there come to we a certain rich moal whose father be a millenary or captain of a thousand horse who inform we that he have be appoint to conduct we he inform we that the journey would take we four month and that the cold be so extreme in winter as even to tear asunder tree and stone with its force advise well with yourselve therefore say he whether you be able to endure it for otherwise i shall forsake you by the way to this i answer that i hope we should be able with the help of god to endure hardship like other man but as we be send by he lord under he charge and do not go on any business of we own he ought not to forsake we he then say that all should be well and have examine we garment he direct we what we should leave behind in the custody of we host as not useful for the journey and next day he send each of we a furred gown make of sheep skin with the wool on and breeches of the same likewise shoe or footsock make of feel and boot of they fashion and hood of skin the second day after the holy cross day 16th September we begin we journey attend by three guide and we ride continually eastward during forty-six day till the feast of all-saint 1st November the whole of that region and even beyond it be inhabit by the people name changle or kangittae who be descend from the roman upon the north side we have the country of the greater bulgarium and to the south the caspian sea -lrb- 1 -rrb- this however be only to be understand of what may be term the pretorian or royal horde in a time of profound peace travel in they usual and perpetual round in quest of forage the almost boundless space of the desert must have be intersperse with numerous subordinate horde and though the usual guard of baatu might not have exceed 500 head of family the military force of he dominion though subordinate to mangu-khan certainly exceed 200000 fight man -- e section xxiii _ of the river jaic or ural and of sundry region and nation _ at the end of twelve day journey from the etilium or volga we come to a great river name the jagag -lrb- jaic or ural -rrb- which issue from the land of pascatir -lrb- of zibier or of the baschir now siberia -rrb- fall into the caspian the language of the baschir and of the hungarian be the same and they be all shepherd have no city and they land be bound on the west by the greater bulgarium from which country eastward in these northern part there be no city whatsoever so that the greater bulgarium be the last country which possess town and city from this country of pascatir the hun go who be afterwards call hungarian isidore write that with swift horse they pass the wall of alexander and the rock of caucasus which oppose the barbarian and even exact tribute from egypt and lay waste the whole of europe as far as france be even more warlike in they day than the tartar be now with they the blacian or walachian the bulgarian and the vandal unite these bulgarian come from the greater bulgarium the people name ilac or vlac who inhabit beyond the danube from constantinople not far from pascatir be the same people be properly name blac or blacian but as the tartar can not pronounce the letter b they be call ilac vlac or wallachian from they likewise the inhabitant of the land of the assanus be descend both have the same name in the russian polish and bohemian language the sclavonian and the vandal speak the same language and all of these join themselves formerly with the hun as they now do with the tartar all this that i have write concern the land of pascatir i be inform by certain friar predicant who have travel there before the irruption of the tartar and as they have be subdue by they neighbor the bulgarian who be mahometan many of they adopt that faith other matter respect these people may be know from various chronicle but it be obvious that those province beyond constantinople which be now call bulgarium wallachium and sclavonium -lrb- 1 -rrb- formerly belong to the greek empire and hungary be formerly name pannonium we continue ride through the land of the changle or kangittae as before mention from holy cross-day till all-saint travel every day as well as i could guess about as far as from pari to orlean and sometimes farther -lrb- 2 -rrb- accord as we happen to be provide with relay for sometimes we would change horse two or three time a-day and then we travel quicker while sometimes we have to travel two or three day without find any inhabitant to supply we and then we be force to travel more deliberately out of thirty or forty horse we be always sure to have the worst be stranger as every one take they choice before it come to we turn they always however provide I with a strong horse because i be corpulent and heavy but whether he pace happen to be hard or gentle be all one to they and i dare not to make any complaint we horse often tire before we could fall in with any of the inhabitant and we be then oblige to beat and whip they up be oblige to lay we garment upon spare horse and sometimes two of we oblige to ride on one horse -lrb- 1 -rrb- probably intend for what be now call servium -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this may be take at a medium of thirty mile a day which in forty-six day would amount to 1380 mile no doubt a very fatiguing journey for a corpulent heavy man as he describe himself -- e section xxiv _ of the hunger thirst and other misery we endure _ there be no end of hunger and thirst and cold and weariness in the morning they give we something to drink or some boil millet but afterwards we have nothing to eat until the evening when they bestow some flesh upon we be generally the shoulder and breast of a ram and every one be allow a proportion of the broth to drink and we consider ourselves fortunate when we have enough of broth as it be exceedingly refreshing pleasant and nutritive sometimes we be constrain to eat we meat half boil or even almost raw for want of fuel especially when we be benighted and oblige to pass the night in the field because we could not conveniently gather horse or cow-dung to make a fire and we seldom find any other fuel except a few thorn here and there and a few rare wood on the bank of some river every Saturday i remain fasting until night and be then constrain to my great grief to eat flesh as i could not procure any other food in the desert in the beginning of we journey we guide disdain we exceedingly and seem quite indignant at be oblige to take charge of such base fellow as he seem to esteem we but he afterwards behave better and often take we purposely to the court of rich moal who request we to pray for they and if i have be so fortunate as to have a good interpreter i might have be able to do some good among these ignorant people zingi the first great khan or emperor of the tartar leave four son from whom descend many grandson who be daily multiply and disperse over that immense waste desert which be boundless like the ocean these moal whom we visit and pray for be astonish when we refuse they proffer gift of gold and silver and fine garment they often enquire whether the great pope be actually 500 year old as they have hear from report they likewise enquire into the nature and production of we country especially whether we have abundance of cattle sheep and horse when we speak to they about the ocean they could form no adequate conception of its immense expanse without bank or limit on the feast of all-saint 1st November as the people have now descend very much to the southwards we now discontinue we eastern route and journy directly south for eight day along certain high mountain in the desert we see many wild ass resemble mule call colan or coulan by the tartar which we guide and he companion often chase with great eagerness but without success owe to the great swiftness of these animal upon the seventh day of we southern route we see directly before we some exceedingly high mountain and we enter upon a fine cultivate plain which be irrigate like a garden next day 7th November we arrive at a town belong to the mahometan name kenchat the governor of which come out to meet we guide with ale and other refreshment for it be the custom of all the subject city to welcome the messenger of baatu and mangu with meat and drink on they arrival at this season the ice be fully bear and we find frost in the desert before the feast of st michael 29th September i inquire the name of the province but be in a strange land they could not inform I and could only tell I the name of this city which be very small into this district a large river descend from the mountain which the inhabitant lead off to water or irrigate the whole region so that this river do not discharge itself into any sea but after form many pool or marsh be absorb into the earth in this region we see vine grow and drink twice of they wine section xxv _ of the execution of ban and concern the residence of certain german _ the next day we come to another village nearer to the mountain which i understand be call caucasus and that they reach from the eastern to the western sea even pass the caspian to the west i likewise inquire concern the town of tala in which accord to friar andrew -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be certain german in the service of one _ buri _ and i have formerly make inquiry concern they at the court of sartach and baatu -lrb- 2 -rrb- but i could only learn that they master _ ban _ have be put to death on the follow occasion this ban happen to have he appoint residence in inferior pasture and one day when drunk he say to he people that be of the race of zingi as well as baatu whose brother or nephew he be he think himself entitle to feed he flock on the fine plain of the volga as freely as baatu himself these speech be report to baatu who immediately write to the servant of ban to bring they lord bind before he then baatu demand whether he have speak the word which be report and ban acknowledge they but plead that he be drunk at the time and it be usual among the tartar to forgive the word and action of drunk man but baatu reproach he for daring to use he name in he cup and order he head to be immediately strike off on my arrival at the court of mangu-khan i learn that the before mention german have be remove from the jurisdiction of baatu to a place name bolac a month journey to the east of talus where they be employ to dig for gold and to fabricate arm in the before mention town we learn that tala be near the mountain behind we at the distance of six day journey from the before mention village near the mountain -lrb- 3 -rrb- we go directly eastward coast these mountain and from that time we travel among the immediate subject of mangu-khan who in all place sing and dance in honor of we guide because he be the messenger of baatu it be the custom for the subject of mangu-khan to receive the messenger of baatu in this manner and reciprocally the subject of baatu shew like honor to the messenger of mnngu yet the subject of baatu be more independently spirited and do not evince so much courtesy a few day afterwards we enter upon the mountain where the cara-catayan use to dwell where we find a large river which we have to pass in boat we afterwards come to a cultivate valley in which be the ruin of a castle which have be surround by wall of mud or earth after this we come to a large village call equius inhabit by mahometan who speak persian although so far remove from persium on the day follow have pass those alp which descend from the high mountain towards the south we enter a most beautiful plain have high mountain upon we right hand and a sea or lake on we left which be fifteen day journey in circumference -lrb- 4 -rrb- this plain be water or irrigate at will by means of stream descend from these mountain all of which fall into the before mention lake in the subsequent summer we return by the north side of this lake where likewise there be great mountain -lrb- 5 -rrb- in this plain there use to be many town but most of these have be destroy by the tartar that the excellent land around they might be convert into pasture for they cattle we still find one large town name cailac in which be a market frequent by many merchant and we remain fifteen day at this place wait for one of baatu 's scribe who be to assist we guide in the management of certain affair at the court of mangu this country use to be call organum -lrb- 6 -rrb- and the people organa as i be tell because the people be excellent performer on the organ -lrb- 7 -rrb- or lute and they have a distinct language and peculiar manner of write it be now entirely inhabit by the contomannus whose language and write be use by the nestorian of these part i here first see idolater of whom there be many sect in the east -lrb- 1 -rrb- the person here allude to be a monk name andrew luciumel who have be send ambassador by the pope to the emperor of the mongal in 1247 or 1248 with the same view as in the mission of carpinus and asceline at the same period but of he journey we have no account remain -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be exceedingly difficult or rather impossible to trace the step of the travels of rubruqui for want of latitudes longitude and distance and name of place after pass the volga and ural or jaik he seem to have travel east in the country of the kirgus somewhere about the latitude of 50  n to between the longitude of 65  and 70  e then to have strike to the south across the kisik-tag into western turkestan in which the cultivate vale may have be on the tshuus or the tala river -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- probably near the north side of the arguin or alak mountain -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- this position of rubruqui be sufficiently distinct : have ferry over the river tshuus and cross the jimbaus mountain the route now lay between the alak mountain on he right or to the south and the lake of balkash or palkatus nor to the left or north -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the kisik-tag which he have before pass in descend into western turkestan -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- this absurd derivation of the name of the country and people be unworthy of credit organum be probably the country call irgonekan or irganakon by abulgarus and the word signify a valley surround by steep mountain exactly correspondent with the description in the text -- forst -lrb- 7 -rrb- the contomannus or kontomanian be probably a mongal tribe originally inhabit the bank of the konta or khonda who have afterwards settle on the bank of the river ili and lake of balkash -- forst section xxvi _ how the nestorian and mahometan be mix with idolater _ in the first place arc the jugurs whose country border upon the land of organum among the mountain towards the east and in all they town nestorian and mahometan be mixed among the native and they be diffused likewise in all the town of the mahometan towards persium in the city of cailac or cealac there be three idol temple two of which i go into to observe they folly in one of these i find a person have a cross mark with ink upon he hand whence i suppose he a christian and to all my question he answer like a christian i ask he wherefore he have not the cross and image of christ and he answer that it be not they custom wherefore i conclude the people be actually christian but omit these thing for want of instruction behind a certain chest which serve for a altar and on which they place candle and oblation i see a image with wing like that of st michael and other image hold out they finger as if blessing the spectator that evening i could make no farther discovery for though the saracen invite one into they temple they will not speak of they religion -lrb- 1 -rrb- insomuch that when i inquire at they about they ceremony they be much offended next day be the kalends 1st December be the passover of the saracen and i change my lodging to the neighborhood of another temple of idol for the people of this place shew hospitality to all messenger every one accord to he ability in this other temple i find the priest of the idol who open and adorn the temple at the kalends and the people make offering of bread and fruit i shall first describe the general rite of idolatry and then those of the jugur who be a kind of sect different from the other they all worship towards the north with join hand prostrate themselves upon they knee to the earth and rest they forehead on they hand for which reason the nestorian never join they hand in prayer but spread they hand on they breast they temple be build from east to west have a chamber or vestry for the priest on the north or if the building be square they have a similar chamber on the middle of the north side in place of a choir and before it be place a long broad chest like a table behind which face the south stand the principal idol that which i see at caracarum be as large as the picture of st christopher a nestorian priest who come from catay tell I there be a idol in that country so large that it could be see at the distance of two day journey -lrb- 2 -rrb- other idol be place around the principal one and all be beautifully gilt all the gate of they temple open to the south contrary to the custom of the mahometan and they have large bell as be the case with we wherefore the oriental christian will not use they though they be customary among the russian and the greek in casarium -lrb- 1 -rrb- the saracen be here much abuse by the mistake of we traveller as however erroneous they religious opinion they worship the true god only and abhor even the least semblance of idolatry -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the nestorian probably say a idol-house mean one of the high tower usually erect near chinese temple : and even this must have stand upon a very elevated situation in a extensive plain to be see from so great a distance perhaps of sixty mile -- e section xxvii _ of they temple and idol and the worship of they god _ all they priest shave they head and beard and be clothe in yellow and they live in company of one or two hundred together observe strict celibacy on holy day they sit in the temple on long bench place directly opposite each other hold book in they hand which they sometimes lay on the bench and all the time they remain in the temple they have they head bare and they read to themselves keep profound silence : insomuch that when i go into the temple and endeavor all i could to provoke they to speak i could not succeed wherever they go they carry a string with a hundred or two hundred nut-shell like we rosary and they be continually utter the word _ ou mam hactani _ which be explain to I as signify _ o god thou knowest _ and as often as they pronounce these word in remembrance of god they expect a proportional reward -lrb- 1 -rrb- round the temple there be always a handsome court environ by a high wall on the south side of which be a large portal in which they sit to confer together and over this portal they erect a long pole rise if possible above the whole city that every one may know where to find the temple these thing be common to all the idolater on go to visit this temple i find the priest sit under the outer portal and those whom i saw appear by they shaven beard like french friar they wear conical cap of paper on they head and all the priest of the jugur wear this cap continually and yellow strait tunic fasten down the middle like those in france besides which they wear a cloak on they left shoulder flow loosely before and behind but leave the right arm free somewhat like a deacon carry the pix in lend they mode of write be adopt by the tartar they begin to write at the top of the page and extend they line downward read and write from leave to right they make great use of write papers in they magical incantation and they temple be hung round with short written sentence the letter send by mangu-khan to you majesty be write in these character and in the language of the moal these people burn they dead in the manner of the ancient and deposit the ash on the top of certain pyramid after sit for some time beside these priest and have enter they temple to look at they many image some large and other small i ask what be they belief concern god to which they answer that they believe in one god only on ask they whether he be a spirit or of a corporeal nature they say he be a spirit be ask if god have ever assume the human mature they answer never since then say i you believe god to be a spirit wherefore do yow make so many image of he and as you believe that he never take upon he the human form wherefore do you represent he under the image of a man rather than of any other creature to this they answer we do not make image of god but when any of we rich man die or they wife or child or dear friend they cause image to be make of the deceased which be place in the temple which we venerate in respect to they memory then say i you do these thing in flattery of man : but they insist it be only in remembrance they then ask

even in the same manner god be everywhere rule all thing yet be invisible be intelligence and wisdom i would willingly have proceed in this conference but my interpreter become weary and unable to express my meaning so that i be oblige to desist the moal and tartar follow the same religion in so far that they believe in one only god but they make image in feel of they depart friend which they cover with fine costly garment these they carry about with they in one or two appropriate cart which no person must touch except they priest or soothsayer who have the care of they this be to be understand only of the great man who be of the race of zingi for the poor or meaner people have none such these soothsayer constantly attend upon the court of mangu and other great personage and when the court move these man precede the march like the pillar of cloud before the child of israel they determine on the site of the new encampment and unload they house first after which they be imitate by the whole court on day of festival such as the kalends or commencement of they month these image be place in order around they idol house and the moal enter in and bow themselves before these image to do they reverence stranger be never permit to enter so that once endeavor to go into one of these tabernacle i be sore chidden for my presumption -lrb- 1 -rrb- the follow more complete account of this superstition have be deem worthy of insertion these suppose nestorian christian be undoubtedly professor of the religion of the dalai-lama who have several usage and ceremony resemble corrupt christianity like the roman catholic they have rosary contain 108 bead and they prayer be _ hom-mani-pema - hum _ this do not signify as assert by rubruqui _ god thou knowest it _ nor as suppose by messerschmid _ god have mercy on we _ but its true import be that _ manus _ who hold the flower of the lotus _ and be the beginning and end of the higher magic _ may _ hear _ they prayer be _ propitious _ to they and render they _ happy _ they have roll or cylinder inscribe with they prayer which they twirl round on a axis continually pronounce these mystic word and they believe that all the prayer on these roll be virtually pronounced at each turn of the roll the religion of the dalai-lama be a branch of the shamanian and braminical superstition and have for its foundation the manichaean doctrine of the two principle which mane attempt to incorporate into the christian religion so that it be no wonder the practice of the follower of the dalai-lama should resemble those of the manichaean and nestorian christian -- forst voy and disc 105 section xxviii _ of sundry nation and of certain people who use to eat they parent _ i be convince that these jugur who be mix with

and almost all the nestorian be acquaint with they letter next to the jugur among the mountain to the east be the tangut a powerful people who once make zingi prisoner in battle but have conclude peace he be set at liberty and afterwards subdue they among the tangut there be ox of great strength have flow tail like horse and they back and belly cover with long hair these be shorter leg than other ox but much fiercer have long slender straight and very sharp pointed horn and they be much use for draw the great house of the moal but the cow will not allow themselves to be yoke unless they be sing to at the same time these animal be of the nature of the buffalo for when they see a person clothe in red they run furiously upon he to put he to death beyond these be the people of tebet who be wont to eat the dead body of they parent from a motive of piety consider that to be the most honorable sepulchre but they have discontinue this custom which be look upon as abominable by all other nation they still however continue to make handsome drinking cup of the skull of they parent that they may call they to remembrance even in they mirth i receive this information from a eye-witness in they country there be much gold so that any one who be in want dig till he find enough for he necessity and leave the rest behind for another occasion for they have a opinion that god would conceal all other gold from they in the earth if they be to hoard any in they house i see some of these people who be much deform the people of tangut be tall lusty man of a brown complexion the jugur be of middle stature like ourselves and they language be the root or origin of the turkish and comanian language beyond tebet be the people of langa and solanga -lrb- 1 -rrb- whose messenger i saw in the court of mangu-khan who have along with they more than ten great cart each draw by six ox these be little brown man like the spaniard and be dress in tunic or jacket like we deacon with straiter

polish that they glister in the sun like a mirror or well polished helmet round they temple they have long band of the same material fix to they cap which stream to the wind like two long horn from they temple when too much toss by the wind they fold these over the top of they cap when the principal messenger enter the court he hold in he hand a smooth ivory tablet about a foot long and a palm broad and when speak to by the khan or any other great man he always look on he tablet as if he have see there what be speak never look to the right or the left or to the person who speak to he even in come into the presence and in retire he look perpetually at he tablet beyond these people as i have be tell for truth there be a nation call muc inhabit town in whose country there be numerous flock and herd which be never tend as no person appropriate any of these exclusively but when any one be in need of a beast he ascend a hill and give a loud cry on which all the cattle within hear flock around he and suffer themselves to be take as if they be domesticate when a messenger or any stranger go into that country he be immediately shut up in a house where all necessaries be provide

might have interpret falsely to serve they own purpose i therefore hold my peace fear to gainsay the word of baatu on we arrival at court we guide have a large house appoint for he and only a small cottage be give to we three which would hardly contain we baggage we bed and a small fire many come to we guide with drink make of rice in long necked bottle which have no difference from the best

lend the nestorian fast three day which they call the fast of jona and the armenian fast five day in honor of st lorkis they tutelary saint the nestorian begin they fast on Tuesday and end it on Thursday and on Friday they bless the flesh as if it be the paschal lamb the monk send to mangu to fast that week which he do and on the armenian easter he go in procession to the house of mangu accompany by we and the nestorian priest while we go in some servant meet we carry out some shoulder-blade of sheep burnt as black as coal and on enquire i learn that the khan perform a divination before undertake any important matter in this manner he cause three of these bone to be bring to he unburnt which be seek for all over the _ leskar _ or tartar camp for this purpose and these bone be burn in a particular fire and then bring to he again if the bone be crack across or round piece fly out of they in burn it be consider a evil omen but if they crack lengthway even one of the three he then proceed in he design when we go in before mangu the nestorian priest give he incense which he put upon the censer with which they perfumed he then they sing and bless he cup which be do next by the monk and lastly by we after he have drunk the attendant give drink to the priest but we go out and my companion stay last turn round near the door to make he obeisance to the khan and hastily turn again to follow we stumble on the threshold for which he be seize and carry before the _ bulgaus _ who be the chancellor or chief secretary of the court and judge those who be arraign on matter of life and death but i know not of all this as miss he on look back i think he have be detain to receive thinner apparel for he be very weak and could hardly walk under he load of garment he be send home in the evening and the monk sharply rebuke he for have touch the threshold next day the bulgaus come to I and demand to know if any one have warn we against touch the threshold to which i answer that as we have not we interpreter along with we we should not have understand they if the caution have be give on this my companion be pardon but be never allow afterwards to come into any of the house of mangu-khan from the house of the khan we go to that of he eldest son who have two wife and lodge next on the right from he father as soon as he see we approach he leap from he bed and prostrate himself before the cross strike the ground with he forehead then rise and kiss the cross he cause it to be place on a new cloth in a high place very reverently he have a tutor name david to instruct he who be a nestorian priest and a great drunkard the prince give drink to the priest and he drink himself after the priest have bless he cup from he we go to the court of cota the khan second lady who be a idolater and whom we find very sick yet the armenian monk make she rise from bed and adore the cross on she knee with many ceremony we then go to the third court in which a christian lady formerly reside but on she death she be succeed by a young woman who with the khan daughter joyfully receive we and worship the cross with great reverence we go then into the house of the young lady cerina behind the third court which have formerly belong to she mother who likewise worship the cross with great devotion we next go into the court of the fourth and last lady whose house be very old but the khan give she a new house and new chariot after easter this lady be a idolater yet she worship the cross accord to the direction of the monk and priest from that place we return to we oratory the monk accompany we with great howling and outcry in they drunkenness as they have be plentifully supply with drink at every visit but this be not consider as blameable or unseemly either in man or woman in these part -lrb- 1 -rrb- caten signify _ lady _ and cota be she particular name -- harri section xxxv _ of a great cure perform by the armenian monk sergius on one of the wife of mangu-khan _ sometime after the lady cota be sick almost to death and the divination by lot of the idolater do she no good mangu-khan then send for the monk who indiscreetly engage to cure she on the forfeiture of he head on this the monk send for we and entreat we with tear to watch and pray all night along with he which we do he take of a certain root call rhubarb which he beat to powder and put among water along with a little crucifix and he use to give of that water to all sick person which gripe they by reason of its bitterness and which they attribute to a miracle i propose to prepare some holy water accord to the rite of the church of rome which have great power to cast out devil as i understand the lady be vex of a devil -lrb- 1 -rrb- at he request i consecrate some holy water which he mingle with the rhubarb and leave he crucifix all night in the mixture next morning i and the monk and two nestorian priest go to the lady who be then in a small house behind she great one she sit up in she bed and worship the cross lay it honourably by she upon a silken cloth she drink of the holy water mix with rhubarb and wash she breast and at the desire of the monk i read the passion of we lord accord to st john over she at length she feel herself relieved and order four jascot to be bring which she first lay at the foot of the cross and give three to the monk offer one to I which i refuse then the monk take this likewise and give one to each of the priest keep two to himself so that she give away forty mark in all at this time -lrb- 2 -rrb- she then order wine which she give to the priest and make I drink thrice from she hand in honor of the holy trinity she likewise begin to teach I the language jest with I because i be silent for want of a interpreter next day mangu-khan hearing that we be pass and have learn that the lady cota be somewhat better make we come in and take the cross into he hand ask several question which i do not understand but i do not see that he worship it the monk by my suggestion crave leave to carry the cross aloft on a lance and manga give permission that it might be carry in any way we think fit then pay we obeisance to the khan we go to the lady cota whom we find strong and cheerful she still drink the holy water and we read the passion over she but those miserable priest never teach she the article of we holy faith neither advise she to be baptize nor do they find fault with any kind of sorcery for i see four sword half draw out of they sheath one at the head of she bed one at the foot and one on either side of she door i observe likewise one of we silver chalice probably take from some church in hungary which hang against the wall full of ash on the top of which lay a black stone but these priest not only do not teach they that such thing be evil but even practice similar thing we continue we visit for three day by which time she be restore to perfect health during these visit she continue to rally I on my silence and endeavor to teach I they language i honor the monk sergius as my bishop because he could speak the language though he be totally uneducated and i afterwards learn when i come to he own country on my return that he be no priest but merely a adventurous weaver in many thing he act in a way that much displeased I for he cause to be make for himself a folding chair such as bishop use and glove and a cap of peacock feather with a small gold cross but i be well please with the cross he have scab foot which he endeavor to palliate with ointment -lrb- 3 -rrb- be very presumptuous in speech be present at many of the vain and idolatrous rite of the nestorian and have many other vanity with which i be much displeased yet we join he society for die honor of the cross as he get a banner full of cross on a cane as long as a lance and we carry the cross aloft through among all the tent of the tartar singing _ vexillum regi prodeant _ & c to the great regret of the mahometan who be envious of we favor i be inform of a certain armenian who come as he say from jerusalem along with the monk sergius carry a silver cross of about four mark weight adorn with precious stone which he present to mangu-khan who ask what be he petition he represent himself to be the son of a armenian priest whose church have be destroy by the saracen and crave he help for rebuild that church be ask how much that might cost he say two hundred jascot or two thousand mark and the khan order letter to be give he order those who receive the tribute of persium and the greater armenia to pay he that sum in silver -lrb- 4 -rrb- the monk continue to carry this cross about with he wherever he go and the nestorian priest become envious of the profit which he derive from its use -lrb- 1 -rrb- from the whole of this story it would appear that the lady cota be hysterical from constipation and that sergius have the good fortune to remove the cause by a few dose of rhubarb -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- about l 30 perhaps equal in efficacy to l 300 of modern day no bad fee for administer a dose of rhubarb -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this surely be a sinless infirmity and need not to have be record to he dishonor he be probably afflict with chilblain in consequence of the severity of the tartarian climate -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- l 1500 in weight equal at least to l 15000 of we modern money a most magnificent present to a itinerant beggar -- e section xxxvi _ account of the country under the dominion of the great khan of the manners and custom of he subject of a wonderful piece of mechanism construct by a french goldsmith and of the palace of the khan at caracarum _ from the time of we arrival at the court of mangu-khan the leskar or camp make only two day journey towards the south and it then begin its progress northwards in the direction of caracarum in the whole of my journey i be convince of the truth of what i have be inform by baldwin de hainault at constantinople that the whole way eastward be by a continual ascent as all the river run from the east towards the west sometimes deviate towards the north or south more or less directly but never run east but this be farther confirm to I by the priest who come from kathay -lrb- 1 -rrb- from the place where i find mangukhan it be twenty day journey south-east to kathay and ten day journey right east to oman kerule the original country of the moal and of zingi -lrb- 2 -rrb- in those part there be no city but the country be inhabit by a people call su-moall or mongol of the water who live upon fish and hunting and have neither flock nor herd farther north likewise there be no city but a poor people of herdsman who be call kerki the orangin be there also who bind smooth bone under they foot and thrust themselves with such velocity over the ice and snow as to overtake beast in the chase there be many other poor nation in those part inhabit as far to the north as the cold will permit who join on the west with the country of pascatir or the greater hungary of which i have make mention before -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the north the mountain be perpetually cover with snow and the bound be unknown by reason of the extreme cold all these nation be poor yet they must all betake themselves to some employment as zingi establish a law that none be to be free from service till so old as to be unable for work i be inquisitive about the monstrous man of whom isidore and solinus make mention but no one have ever see any such and i therefore doubt whether it be true once a priest of kathay sit by I clothe in red of whom i ask how that color be procure he tell I that on certain high craggy rock in the east of kathay there dwell certain creature like man not above a cubit long and all hairy who leap rather than walk and dwelt in inaccessible cave that those who go to hunt they carry strong drink which they leave in hole of the rock and then hide themselves these little creature come out from they hole and have taste the drink call out _ chin-chin _ on which multitude gather together and drink till they be drunk and fall asleep then the hunter come and bind they after which they draw a few drop of blood from the vein of the neck of each of these creature and let they go free and this blood be the most precious purple dye he tell I likewise that there be a province beyond kathay into which if a man enter he always continue of the same age at which he enter but this i do not believe -lrb- 4 -rrb- kathay be on the ocean and i be tell by the french goldsmith at caracarum that there be a people or nation call tante and manse inhabit certain island the sea around which be freeze in winter so that the tartar might invade they but they send messenger to the great khan offer a tribute of 2000 tueman or jascot yearly to permit they to live in peace -lrb- 5 -rrb- a tuemen toman or jascot be a piece of money equal to ten mark the ordinary money of kathay be of paper make like pasteboard the breadth and length of a hand on which line be print like the seal of mangu they write with a pencil like that use by we painter and in one figure they comprehend many letter form one word -lrb- 6 -rrb- the people of thibet write as we do and they character be very like we own those of tangut write from right to leave like the arab and multiply they line ascend while the jugurs write in descend column the common money of the rutenian or russian consist in spotted or grizzled fur when we quinquagesima come which be the lend time of all the people of the east the lady cota fast all that week and come every day to we oratory give meat to the priest and other christian of whom a great company come daily to attend the service but the porter of the court see such multitude come daily to we chapel which be within the precinct of the court send one to tell the monk that they would not allow such multitude to come within they bound to this the monk make a sharp reply and threaten to accuse they to the khan but they prevent he and lodge a complaint before mangu that the monk be too full of word and gather too great a multitude to hear he speak on this he be call before the khan who reprove he severely say that as a holy man he should employ himself in prayer to god and not in speech to man but he be afterwards reconcile by promise to go to the pope and to induce all the nation of the west to yield obedience to the khan on he return to the oratory the monk ask I if i think he might gain admission to the pope as the messenger of mangu and whether the pope would supply he with horse to go to st jame in galicium and whether you majesty would send you son to the court of mangu but i counsel he to beware of make false promise to mangu and that god need not the service of lie or deceitful speaking about this time a dispute arise between the monk and one of the nestorian priest more learn than the rest as the monk assert that man be create before paradise which the other deny on reference to I i say that paradise be create on the _ second _ day when the other tree be make whereas man be make on the sixth then the monk say that the devil bring clay on die first day from all the corner of the earth of which he make the body of man which god inspire with a soul on this i sharply reprove he for he heretical ignorance and he scorn I for my ignorance of the language : i depart therefore from he to we own house but when he and the priest go afterwards in procession to the court without call I mangu earnestly enquire the reason of my absence and the priest be afraid excuse themselves as well as they could and report to I the word of the khan murmur at the monk after this the monk be reconcile to I and i entreated he to aid I in acquire the language promise to help he to the knowledge of the holy scripture after the first week of fast the lady cease from come to the oratory and to give meat and drink so that we have nothing but brown bread and paste boil in melted snow or ice which be exceedingly bad my companion be much grieve at this diet on which i acquaint david the teacher of the khan eldest son with we necessity who make a report to the khan and we be then supply with wine flour and oil the nestorian and armenian eat no fish in lend but the monk have a chest under the altar with almond and raisin and dry prune and other fruit on which he feed when alone about the middle of lend the goldsmith son come from caracarum bring a silver cross make in the french fashion with a image of christ as a present for bulgaus the chief secretary of the court and the young man inform mangu that the great work he have command to be make by he father be complete in the neighborhood of caracarum mangu have a large court inclose with a brick wall like we priory within that court be a great palace in which the khan hold feast twice a-year once in easter and the other in summer but the latter be the greater as all the noble meet then at the court when the khan distribute garment among they and display all he magnificence beside the palace there be many great building like we barn in which the victuals and treasure belong to the khan be store because it be indecent to have flaggon go about the hall of the palace as in a tavern william the goldsmith construct a great silver tree just without the middle entrance of the great hall at the root of which be four silver lion have pipe discharge pure cow milk four pipe be convey up the body of the tree to its top which spread out into four great bough hang downward on each of these bough be a golden serpent all they tail twine about the body of the tree and each of these form a pipe one discharging wine a second caracosmo a third ball or mead make of honey and the fourth _ teracina _ or drink make of rice each particular drink have a vessel at the foot of the tree to receive it on the top between the four pipe there stand a image of a angel with a trumpet under the tree there be a vault in which a man be hide and from he a pipe ascend to the angel and when the butler command to sound the trumpet the man below blow strongly and the trumpet emit a shrill sound in a chamber without the palace the liquor be store and servant who be wait pour the liquor each in its proper pipe at the signal when they be convey by conceal pipe up the body of the tree and discharge into they appropriate vessel whence they be distribute by the under butler to the visitor the tree be all ornament with silver bough and leave and fruit all of silver the palace be like a church have a middle aisle and two side one beyond two row of pillar and have three gate to the south and before the middle gate stand the silver tree the khan sit at the north wall on a high place that he may be see of all and there be two flight of step ascend to he by one of which he cup-bearer go up and come down by the other the middle space between the throne and the silver tree be leave vacant for the cup-bearer and the messenger who bring present on the right side of the khan the man sit and the woman on the left one woman only sit beside he but not so high as he about passion Sunday the khan go before with he small house only leave the great one behind and the monk and we follow on the journey we have to pass through a hilly country -lrb- 7 -rrb- where we encounter high wind extreme cold and much snow about midnight the khan send to the monk and we request we to pray to god to mitigate the severity of the weather as the beast in he train be in great jeopardy be mostly with young and about to bring forth then the monk send he incense desire he to put it on the coal as a offering to god : whether he do this or no i know not but the tempest cease which have last two day on palm Sunday we be near caracarum and at dawn of day we bless the willow bough on which as yet there be no bud about nine o'clock we enter the city of caracarum carry the cross aloft with the banner and pass through the street of the saracen in which the market be hold we proceed to the church where the nestorian meet we in procession we find they prepared to celebrate the mass and they all communicate but i decline this have already drink and the sacrament should always be receive lasting after mass be now evening william bouchier the goldsmith bring we to sup at he lodging he have a wife bear in hungary of mahometan parent who speak french and the language of the comanian we find here also one basilicus the son of a englishman likewise bear in hungary who be likewise skilled in these language after supper we retire to we cottage which with the oratory of the monk be place near the nestorian church which be of considerable size and very handsomely build and all the ceiling be cover with silk work with gold i much deliberate with myself whether i should continue in communion with the monk and the nestorian because i see they action full of idolatry and sorcery but i fear to give offence to the khan in separate from the other christian as i see that my presence please he for which reason i always accompany they to court but when there i do not join in they mummery pray always in a loud voice for the church and that god would direct the khan in the right way of salvation on one occasion the khan promise to come to the church next day but he depart on he journey to the northward desire the priest to excuse he because he have learn that the dead be carry thither but we remain behind that we might celebrate the festival of easter there be a vast multitude of hungarian alan rutenian or russian georgian and armenian who have not receive the sacrament since they be take prisoner as the nestorian would not admit they into they church unless they be rebaptize yet they offer they sacrament freely to we and allow I to see they manner of consecration on the vigil of easter i see they ceremony of baptism they pretend to have the ointment with which mary magdalen anoint the foot of jesus and they put in so much of that oil in knead they sacramental bread for all the people of the east use butter or oil or fat from a sheep tail in they bread instead of leaven they pretend also to have of the flour of which the bread be make which be consecrate by we lord at he last supper as they always keep a small piece of dough from each bake to mix up with the new which they consecrate with great reverence in administer this to the people they divide the consecrate loaf first into twelve portion after the number of the apostle which they afterwards break down into smaller piece in proportion to the number of communicant give the body of christ into the hand of every one who take it from he own palm with much reverence and afterwards lay he hand on the top of he head i be much at a loss how to act as the nestorian entreat I to celebrate the festival and i have neither vestment chalice nor altar but the goldsmith furnish I with vestment and make a oratory on a chariot decently paint with scripture history he make also a silver box or pix for the host and a image of the bless virgin and cause a iron instrument to be make for we to make host in we way then i make the before mention christian to confess to I as well as i could by means of a interpreter explain to they the ten commandment the seven deadly sin and other matter exhort they to confession and penitence : but all of they publickly excuse themselves respect theft say that they could not otherwise live as they master neither provide they with food or raiment and i say they might lawfully take necessaries from they master especially as they have forcibly deprive they of they subsistence and liberty some who be soldier excuse themselves from have go to the war as otherwise they would be slay these i forbid to go against christian declare that if slay for they refusal god would account they as martyr after this i give the holy communion to these people on easter day and i hope with the blessing of god to many be assist by the nestorian who lend I they chalice and paten they baptize above threescore person on easter eve with great solemnity to the great joy of all the christian soon after this william bouchier be grievously sick and when recover the monk sergius visit he and give he so great a doze of rhubarb as have almost kill he on this i expostulate with the monk that he ought either to go about as a apostle do miracle by the virtue of prayer and the holy ghost or as a physician accord to the rule of the medical aid and not to administer strong potion to people who be not prepare about this time the principal priest of the nestorian who be a kind of archdeacon over the rest become sick $ and when i endeavor at the request of he family to prevail upon the monk to visit he he say let he alone for he and three other intend to procure a order from mangu-khan to expel you and i and i learn afterwards that there be a dispute between they as mangu-khan have send four jascot on easter eve to the monk to distribute among the priest and sergius keep one to himself have give three to the priest one be a counterfeit and the priest think sergius have keep too great a share to himself find the archdeacon in a die way i administer to he the eucharist and extreme unction which he receive with great humility and devotion but by the advice of the monk i quit he before he die as otherwise i could not have enter the court of mangu-khan for a whole year when he be dead the monk say to I never mind it : this man only among the nestorian have any learning and oppose we henceforwards mangu-khan and all the rest will crouch at we foot he even pretend that he have kill he by he prayer i afterwards learn that the monk practice divination with the aid of a russian deacon though when i challenge he he pretend to excuse himself and to deny the truth of what have be report to I : but i could not leave he have be place there by command of the khan so that i dare not to remove without he special command exclusive of the palace of the khan caracarum be not so good as the town of st deni and the monastery of st denni be worth more than ten time the value of the palace itself it contain two principal street : that of the saracen in which the fair be hold and to which many merchant resort as the court be always near the other be the street of the kathayan which be full of artificer besides these street there be many palace in which be the court of the secretary of the khan there be twelve idol temple belong to different nation two mahometan mosque and one nestorian church at the end of the town the town itself be inclose with a mud wall and have four gate on the east side there be a market for millet and other grain but which be ill supply on the west sheep and goat be sell on the north side ox and waggon and on the south side horse mangu-khan have eight brother three by the mother and five by the father one of these on the mother side he send into the country of the assassine call _ mulibet _ by the tartar with order to kill they all another be send into persium who be suppose to have order to send army into turkey and from thence against bagdat and vestacius one of he other brother have be send into kathay to reduce certain rebel he youngest maternal brother name arabucha live with he and keep up he mother court who be a christian about this time on account of a violent quarrel between the monk and certain mahometan and because a rumor be propagate of four hundred assassin have go forth in diver habit with a intention to murder the khan we be order to depart from we accustomed place before the court and to remove to the place where other messenger dwell hitherto i have always hope for the arrival of the king of armenia -lrb- 8 -rrb- and have not therefore make any application for leave to depart but hear no news of the king or a certain german priest who be likewise expect and fear lest we should return in the winter the severity of which i have already experienced i send to demand the pleasure of the khan whether we be to remain with he or to return and represent that it would be easier for we to return in summer than in winter the khan send to desire that i should not go far off as he mean to speak with I next day to which i answer request he to send for the son of the goldsmith to interpret between we as my interpreter be very incompetent -lrb- 1 -rrb- so for as be travel by rubruqui and in the route which he pursue on the north of the alak mountain this observation be quite correct to longitude 100  e but what he here add respect kathay be directly contradictory to the fact as all the river beyond caracarum run in a easterly direction the great central plain of tangut then traverse by the imperial horde of the mongal and now by the elut and kalka must be prodigiously elevated above the level of the ocean -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the information here seem corrupted or at least be quite incorrect kathay or northern china be due east or east south-east from the great plain to the south of karakum daouria the original residence of the mongol of zingi between the river onon and kerlon be to the north-east -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- the kerki must fee the kirgus a tribe of whom once dwell to the south-west of lake baikal the orangin or orangey inhabit on the east side of that lake pascatir be the country of the bashkir baschkirian or pascatirian in great bulgarium call great hungary in the text between the volga and the ural -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- rubruqui properly reject the story of monstrous man relate by the ancient yet seem to swallow the absurd story of the purple dye engraft by the kathayan priest on a very natural invention for catch ape he disbelieve the last information of the priest which must have be a enigmatical representation of the province of death or of the tomb -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be difficult to guess as to these people and they island which may possibly refer to japan or even corea which be no island such tribute could not have be offer by the rude inhabitant of saghalien or yesso -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- this evidently but obscurely describe the chinese character the most ingenious device ever contrived for the monopoly of knowledge and office to the learn class and for arrest the progress of knowledge and science at a fix boundary -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- from this circumstance it would appear that rubruqui have find the court of the khan in the country of the elut to the south of the changaus mountain perhaps about latitude 44  n and longitude 103  e the meridian of the suppose site of karakum on the orchon and it may be presume that the imperial suite be now cross the changaus chain towards the north -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- haitho of whom some account will be find in the succeed chapter of this work -- e section xxxvii _ of certain dispute between rubruqui and the saracen and idolater at the court of mangu-khan respect religion _ next day i be bring to the court and some of the chief secretary of the khan come to I one of whom be a moal who be cup-bearer to the khan and the rest be saracen these man demand on the part of the khan wherefore i have come there to this i answer as i have do before that i come to sartach who send I to baatu and he have order I to the khan to whom i have nothing to say on the part of any man unless i should speak the word of god if he would hear they for the khan should know best what baatu have write then they demand what word of god i would speak to the khan thinking i mean to prophecy prosperous thing as other have do to this i answer if ye would that i speak the word of god unto the khan get I a interpreter they say they have send for he but urge I to speak by the present one as they would understand I perfectly i therefore say this be the word of god to whom much be give much will be require at he hand and to whom much be forgive he ought the more to love god to manga i would say that god have give much for the power and riches which he enjoy come not from the idol of the tuinian but from the omnipotent god who have make heaven and earth in whose hand be all kingdom and dominion and who transferreth they from nation to nation for the sin of man wherefore if he love god it will go well with he but if otherwise god will require all thing at he hand even to the utmost farthing then they ask if i have be in heaven that i should know the commandment of god i say no but that god have give they from heaven to holy man and have at length descend from heaven to earth to teach we and that we have those thing in the scripture and could judge from they work whether man keep the commandment of god or disobey they they then ask if i mean to say that mangu-khan do not keep the commandment of god to this i answer when i shall have a proper interpreter and be permit i shall then recite the commandment of god before mangu and he shall be he own judge whether he have keep or disobey they upon this they go and tell mangu that i say he be a idolater and tuinian and keep not the commandment of god next day mangu send one of he secretary say ye be here christian mahometan and tuinian wherefore the khan desire that ye will all come together and make comparison of you opinion that he may know the truth to this i answer bless be god that have put this in the heart of the khan but we scripture command the servant of god not to be contentious but meek unto all wherefore i be ready without strife or contention to render a true account of the faith and hope of the christian to every one who may require to be inform they write down my word and bring they to the khan next day another message come from the khan desire again to know on what account i have come to he court to which i answer that this might be know from the letter of bantu but they say that these letter be lose and the khan have forget they contents and would know of I somewhat embolden by this i say the duty and office of we religion be to preach the gospel unto all wherefore have hear of the fame of the mongal i desire to come to they and hear that sartach have become a christian i direct my journey to he and my sovereign the king of the french send he letter contain good word of friendship testify what man we be and request we might be permit to remain with the people of moal that sartach have send we to baatu and he have order we to mangu-khan whom we have entreat and still do entreat to suffer we to stay they write all this and make a report of it to the khan on the morrow he send again that he know we have no message for he but come to pray for he as other priest do but desire to know if any of we ambassador have ever be in they country or any of theirs in we part then i declare unto they all i know respect david and friar andrew all of which be put down in write and lay before mangu they come back say we lord the khan think you have staid long here and he pleasure be that you return into you own country but he desire to know whether you would conduct he ambassador along with you to this i answer that i dare not to carry he ambassador beyond he own dominion as a warlike nation dwelt between they country and ours between the sea and the mountain and be only a poor monk i could not take upon I to be they guide this they likewise set down in write and carry to the khan the nestorian be command to set down in write all that they would speak in favor of the christian religion and they write out a chronicle from the creation of the world to the passion of christ and pass over the passion they speak of the resurrection of the dead and of the day of judgment finding many thing wrong i point they out and we write out the creed or symbol ask they how they mean to proceed in the conference they say they mean to begin with the saracen but i dissuade they from that because as they agree with we in the belief of one only god they would assist against the tuinian i then point out to they the original of idolatry in the world and they desire I to explain these thing before mangu and then to let they speak because i should find it difficult and tedious to speak by a interpreter i then propose to try they by take the side of the tuinian while they should defend the opinion of the christian but they know not how to prove any thing except merely by quote they scripture to this i say that these man believe not in we scripture and would oppose they by advance contrary opinion and position from those book which they account holy then i desire that they would allow I to speak first since if i be overcome they would be permit to speak whereas if they be confute i would be refuse a hearing and to this they consent all thing be arrange we convene at we oratory and mangu-khan send three of he secretary a christian a saracen and a tuinian to be judge of the controversy it be first proclaim this be the order of mangu-khan and none dare say that the commandment of god be otherwise let none speak contentiously or use injurious word to one another or make any tumult whereby this business may be hinder upon pain of death there be a great assembly as every party have convene the wisest of they sect and many other come flock around to listen but all be silent the christian set I in the middle willing that i should contend with the tuinian who murmur against mangu as no khan have ever thus endeavor to search into they secret yet they oppose one from kathay to I who have he interpreter while i have the son of the goldsmith to interpret my word the kathayan say to I friend if you be put to a nonplus who must seek a wiser than thou art to this i make no reply then he demand whether i would dispute as to how the world be make or as to what become of the soul after death for they be desirous to begin with these question as they hold they for the strongest in they doctrine all the tuinian follow the heresy of the manichean believe in a good and a bad principle and they all believe that soul pass from body to body in confirmation of this the goldsmith tell I they have bring a person from kathay who by the size of he body appear to be only three year old yet be capable of reasoning and know how to write and who affirm that he have pass through three several body even one of the wisest of the nestorian demand of I whether the soul of brute could fly to any place after death where they should not be compel to labor to the before-mentioned question of the kathayan i answer : friend this ought hot to be the commencement of we conference all thing be of god who be the fountain and head of we all and therefore we ought first to speak concern god of whom you think otherwise than you ought and mangu desire to know which of we have the better belief the arbitrator allow this to be reasonable and i proceed : we firmly believe that there be but one god in perfect unity what believe you he say fool say there be but one god but wise man say there be many there be great lord in you country and here be still a greater even mangu-khan so it be of the god as in diver country there be diver god to this i answer : you make a bad comparison between god and man for in this way every mighty man might be call a god in he own country and when i mean to have dissolve the similitude he prevent I by ask what manner of god be yours who you say be but one i answer : we god beside whom there be no other be omnipotent and therefore needeth not the help of any other whereas all have need of he help it be not so with man as no man can do all thing wherefore there must be many lord on earthy as no one can support all god be omniscient or knoweth all thing and therefore have no need of any counsellor for all wisdom be from he god be perfectly good and need not therefore any good from we in god we live and move and have we be such be we god and you must not hold that there be any other it be not so say he for there be one highest in heaven whose origin or generation we know not and there be ten under he and on earth they be infinite in number to this he would have add other fable i ask he respect the highest god of whom he have speak whether he be omnipotent or if any of the inferior god be so and fear to answer this he demand why since we god be perfectly good he have make the half of all thing evil to this i answer that this be false for whosoever maketh any evil be no god and all thing whatsoever be good at this all the tuiuian be astonish and set it down in write as false or impossible he then ask I whence cometh evil you ask amiss say i for you ought first to inquire what evil be before you ask whence it come : but let we return to the first question whether do you believe that any god be omnipotent and when that be discuss i will answer whatever you may demand on this he sit a long time without speak and the judge appoint by the khan command he to make answer at length he say that no god be omnipotent on which all the saracen break out into great laughter when silence be restore i say none of you god therefore can save you in all danger since chance may happen in which they have no power besides no man can serve two master how therefore can you serve so many god in heaven and in earth the auditory decree that he should make answer to this but he hold he peace when i be about to have propound reason to prove the truth of the divine essence and to have explain the doctrine of the trinity the nestorian allege that i have say quite enough and that now they mean to speak so i give place to they when therefore they would have dispute with the saracen these man say that they agree to the truth of the law and the gospel of the christian and would not dispute with they in any thing and even confess that they beg from god in they prayer that they may die the death of the christian there be among the idolater a priest of the sect of the jugur who believe in one god and yet make idol with this man the nestorian talk much shewing all thing till the come of christ to judgment and explain the trinity to he and the saracen by similitude all of they hearken to they harangue without attempt to make any contradiction yet none of they say that they believe and would become christian the conference be now break up the nestorian and saracen sing together with a loud voice and the tuinian hold they peace and afterwards they all drink together most plentifully section xxxviii _ the last audience of rubruqui with mangu-khan and the letter he receive for the king of france _ on whitsunday i be call into the presence of the khan and before i go in the goldsmith son who be my interpreter inform I that it be determine i be to

but you interpreter have ill render you word then reach forth the staff on which he lean towards I he say be not afraid to which i answer smile that if i have fear i should not have come hither he then say as if confess he faith : we moal believe that there be but one god and we have a upright heart towards he then say i may god grant you this mind for without he gift it can not be he then add god have give to the hand diver finger and have give many way to man he have give the scripture to you yet you keep they not you certainly find not in the scripture that one of you should dispraise another no say i and i signify unto you highness from the beginning that i would not contend with any one i speak not say he respect you in like manner you find not in you scripture that a man ought to swerve from justice for the sake of money to this i answer that we scripture teach no such evil doctrine neither have i come into these part to get money have even refuse that which be freely offer to I and one of the secretary then present certify that i have refuse a jascot and a piece of silk i speak not of that say the khan god have give you the scripture and you keep they not but he have give to we soothsayer and we do what they bid we and live in peace he drink four time as i think before he disclose these thing and while i wait attentively in expectation that he might disclose any thing farther respect he faith he begin another subject saying : you have stay a long time here and it be my pleasure that you return you have say that you dare not to carry my ambassador with you will you carry my messenger or my letter to this i answer if he would make I understand he word and that they be put in write i would willingly carry they to the best of my power he then ask if i would have gold or silver or costly garment i answer that we receive no such thing but not have wherewith to bear we expence we could not get out of he country without he help he then say that he would provide we in all necessaries through he country and demand how far we would be bring i say it be sufficient if he give we a pass into armenia to this he answer : i will cause you to be carry thither after which look to yourself there be two eye in one head yet they both look to one object you come here from baatu and therefore you must return by he have request and obtain leave to speak i address he thus : sir we be not man of war and desire that they who would most justly govern accord to the will of god may have dominion in the world we office be to teach man to live accord to the law of god : for this purpose we come into these part and would willingly have remain here if it have be you pleasure but since you be pleased that we should return i shall carry you letter accord to my power in obedience to you command i request of you magnificence that when i have deliver you letter it may be lawful for I to come back into you dominion chiefly because you have servant of we nation at balac who want a priest to teach they and they child the law of we religion and i would willingly stay with they he then ask whether i know that we lord would send I back to he to this i answer i know not what may be the purpose of my sovereign but i have licence to go wherever i will where it be needful to preach the word of god and it seem to I necessary in these part wherefore whether my lord send ambassador or not if it be you pleasure i will return then after a long pause as if muse he say you have a lone way to go make yourself strong with food that you may be enable to endure the journey so he order they to give I drink and i depart from he presence and return not again from that time i could have no time nor place to expound to he the catholic faith for a man must not speak before he unless what he pleaseth to order or allow except he be a ambassador who may speak what he will and they always demand of such whether he have any thing more to say the soothsayer be the priest of the mongal and whatever they command to be do be perform without delay i shall describe they office as i learn it from the goldsmith and other of these soothsayer there be great number under the direction of a chief priest whose house be always about a stone 's throw in front of the great house of mangu-khan and under he charge be all the chariot which carry idol the other soothsayer dwell behind the court in place appoint for they and such as have confidence in they art come to consult they from various distant part some of they be skilful in astronomy especially they chief and they foretel eclipse of the sun and moon when these be to happen all the people prepare they food that they may not be under the necessity of go out of door and during the eclipse they play on various instrument of music and set up loud shout : when it be over they indulge in feast and carouse to express they joy these soothsayer pretend to foretell lucky and unlucky day for all affair and the tartar never levy a army or undertake a war without they approbation they have long since resume they attack on hungary but that the soothsayer have always oppose it they make every thing which be send to court pass between two fire as a purification likewise all the household stuff belong to a dead person must be purge in the same manner and if any living creature drop down or any thing whatever fall to the ground during the ceremony it become the property of the soothsayer who besides have a certain proportion of every thing which they purify as they due there be therefore a twofold reason why friar andrew carpinus be make to pass between the fire both because he bring present and because con-khan for whom these have be bring be dead : but as i bring nothing this be not require of I once on a time some very costly fur be present at the court of the christian lady whom pascha the good woman of metz serve and the soothsayer in pass they between the fire take more than be they due another woman who have the custody of the treasure belong to that lady accuse they of the fraud to she mistress who reprove they severely for they conduct sometime afterwards the lady fall sick and the soothsayer accuse the servant who have detect they fraud of have bewitch she she receive the bastinado for seven day successively and other torture to make she confess and on hearing of she mistress 's death beg to be kill that she might follow she for that in truth she have never do she the smallest injury but as she confess nothing mangu-khan command that she should live after this the soothsayer accuse the daughter nurse of the deceased lady which nurse be a christian and wife to the chief of the nestorian priest she and she servant-maid be tortured to make a confession and the maid answer that the nurse have send she to receive response from a certain horse the nurse also confess that she have use some spell to procure the love of she lady but have never do any thing to hurt she on be demand to say whether she husband know of she incantation she excuse he say that he have burn the character which she have make then she be put to death and the husband be send to be judge by he bishop in kathay it happen that the principal wife of mangu bring forth a son and the soothsayer be bring to foretell the destiny of the infant when they prophesy that he should live long and prosperously and become a great lord but he die in a few day on be reproach for they falsehood they say that the nurse of cerina who have be lately put to death have kill the boy and pretend to have see she carry he away there be then in the camp a son and daughter of the nurse whom the lady immediately send for in a rage and order they to be put to death some time afterwards this come to the ear of mangu-khan who be much enraged at the conduct of he wife he cause the man to be behead who have slay the nurse son and make he head to be hung round the neck of the woman who have kill she daughter order she to be cudgel with burn fire-brand through among all the tent and then put to death he would also have put he wife to death if it have not be for the sake of the child he have by she but he command she to be shut up for seven day without food and go out from he court for a whole moon after the feast of pentecost they begin to prepare they letter for you majesty and in the mean time the khan return to caracarum and hold a great feast on the 15th of June at which all the ambassador be desire to be present but i go to church to baptize the three child of a poor german william

ambassador i never hear what they do afterwards on the second Sunday in lend we come to the head of the arax and pass the mountain we come to the euphrate by which we descend eight day journey go to the west till we come to a castle name camath or kemac where the euphrate trend to the south towards halapium or aleppo we here pass to the north-west side of the river and go over very high mountain and through deep snow to the west there be so great a earthquake that year in this country that in one city call arsingan ten thousand person be say to have perish during three day journey we see frequent gap in the earth which have be cleft by the convulsion and great heap of earth which have tumble down from the mountain into the vally we pass through the valley where the soldan of the turk be vanquish by the tartar and a servant belong to my guide who be in the tartar army say the tartar do not exceed 10000 man whereas the soldan have 200000 horse in that plain there break out a great lake at the time of the earthquake and it come into my mind that the earth open she mouth to receive yet more blood of the saracen we remain in sebasta siwa or siva a town of the lesser armenia in the easter week and on the succeed Sunday we come to caesarium of capadocium now call kaisarea in about fifteen day make short journey we come to konieh or iconium this delay arise in part from the difficulty of procure horse but chiefly because the guide choose to stop often for three day together in one place to negotiate he own affair and though much dissatisfied i durst not complain as he might have slay I and we servant or sell we for slave and there be none to hinder it i find many frank at iconium and among these a merchant call nicholas de sancto syrio and he partner boniface de molandino who have a monopoly of all the alum of turkey from the soldan and by this mean they have raise the price so much that what use to sell for fifteen byzant be now sell for forty my guide present I to the soldan who say he would willingly get I convey to the sea of armenia or cilicium but the above merchant know that the turk make little account of I and that i be much distressed with my guide cause I to be convey to curruma -lrb- 15 -rrb- a port in the dominion of the king of armenia have remain here from before the ascension till after pentecost or near a fortnight i hear there be messenger arrive from the king to he father and i go to the king father to learn the news i find he surround by all he son except barum usin who reside in a certain castle and he tell I that he son be on he return and that mangu-khan have much ease he tribute grant he a privilege that no ambassador should come into he country on this the old man and all he son make a banquet and he cause I to be convey by sea to the haven call aijax -lrb- 16 -rrb- whence i pass over into cyprus and at nicosia i find we provincial who the same day carry I with he to antiochium -lrb- 17 -rrb- which be in a very weak state we be there on the feast of st peter and st paul 29th June and from thence we go to tripoli in syrium where the chapter of we order be hold on the assumption of the bless virgin 15th August 1255 we provincial be determine that i shall reside at acon -lrb- 18 -rrb- and will not suffer I to come to you majesty but command I to write what i will by the bearer of these present i would willingly see you highness and some spiritual friend in you kingdom and beseech you majesty to write we provincial to allow I to go to you and to return shortly again into the holy land i would have you majesty to understand that in turkey every tenth man be not a mahometan they be all armenian and greek and be rule over by child the soldan who be conquer by the tartar have a lawful wife of iberium by whom he have one feeble son whom he direct to succeed he as soldan he have another son by a greek concubine whom he commit to the guardianship of a certain great admiral the third he have by a turkish woman to whom many turk and turkoman have gather they propose to have slay all the soldan son by christian mother and if successful to have destroy all the church and to compel all to become mahometan on pain of death but he be overcome in battle and many of he man slay he recruit he army and venture a second battle in which he be defeat and take prisoner and still remain confine pacester the son of the greek concubine be soon afterwards make soldan as the other be weak whom they have send to the tartar the kindred by the mother side of this son such as the iberian and curd be much dissatisfied at he be deprive so that at this time a child ruleth in turkey have no treasure few soldier and many enemy the son of vestacius be weak and at war with the son of assan who be likewise a child and wear out with the servitude of the tartar if therefore a army of the church be now to come to the holy land it be easy to subdue all these country or to pass through they the king of hungary have not above 30000 soldier from cologne to constantinople be not above sixty day journey by waggon and from constantinople not so many to the country of the king of armenia in old time valiant man pass through all these country and prosper yet they have to contend with most valiant opponent whom god have now destroy out of the earth in this way we need fear no danger of the sea or the mercy of sailor and the price of freight would defray the expence by land i say confidently if we countryman would go as the king of the tartar do and would be contented with such victuals they might conquer the whole world it do not seem to I expedient that any more friar should be send to the tartar in the way i go or as the predicant friar go but if we lord the pope be to send a bishop in a honorable style capable to answer they folly he might speak unto they as he please for they will hear whatever a ambassador choose to speak and always demand if he will say any more but he ought to have many good interpreter and ought to be at large expence i have thus write to you highness accord to my weak power and understanding craving pardon from you clemency for my superfluity or want or for any thing that may be indiscreetly or foolishly write as from a man of little understanding not accustom to write long history the peace of god which passeth all understand preserve you heart and

nephew of haitho i king of armenia minor in lesser asia at the demise of he father he refuse to accept of the crown which he resign in favor of he brother thore or theodore but assist he and he son and successor leon iii in all the war and trouble in which they be engage during many year during the reign of he father in 1254 accompany by he wife and child he travel to the court of mangu-khan the great sovereign of the tartar or mongal for the purpose of obtain a abatement of the tribute which have be impose by these conqueror upon he country and appear to have be successful in he negotiation he journey into the east take place in the same year in which rubruqui be on he return and while at the court or leskar of sartach he be of material service to two of the attendant of rubruqui who have be leave at that station and who but for he interference must have perish by famine or would have be reduce to slavery forster assert that haitho meet with rubruqui who be then on he return home but we have already see in the account of the travels of rubruqui that the two traveller do not meet in the year 1305 when he must have become very old haitho become a monk of the praemonstratensian order at episcopium in cyprus he afterwards go to poitou in france where he dictate in french to nicholas salconus a history of the event which have occur in the east from the first commencement of the conquest of the tartar or mongal include the reign of zingis-khan and he successor to mangu-khan inclusively and a particular narrative of the history of he own country armenia minor from the reign of haitho i to that of leon ii both inclusive this account salconus translate into latin in 1307 by order of the reign pope the travels of haitho be perfectly contemporary with those of rubruqui be not sufficiently interesting to be here insert and the historical part of he relation have no connection with the plan of this work which it would swell beyond due bound : but the follow brief account of he geographical description of the east as it exist in the thirteenth century and as abstracted by j r forster in he voyage and discovery in the north have be deem worthy of insertion together with the observation or commentary of that ingenious author -lrb- 1 -rrb- forst hist of voy and disc in the north p 113 section ii _ geographical notice of the east in the thirteenth century by haitho _  1 the empire of _ kathay _ be one of the most extensive most opulent and most populous in the world and be entirely situate on the sea coast the inhabitant have a very high notion of they own superior intelligence which they express by say that they only of all the people on earth have _ two _ eye to the latin they allow _ one _ and consider all other nation as blind the kathayan have small eye and no beard they money consist of small square piece of paper impress with the seal of they emperor to the west this empire be bound by that of the tarsa to the north by the desert of belgian and to the south by the sea in which there be innumerable island the inhabitant of kathay be exceedingly skilful and ingenious in all work of art and in manufacture but be of a very timorous disposition in the foregoing description and in the trait of character the empire and inhabitant of northern china be distinctly indicate -- forst  2 the empire of _ tarsa _ be divide into three province each of which have a sovereign who assume the title of king the inhabitant be call jogur the jugur or uigur of other author they be divide into many tribe ten of whom be christian and the rest heathen they abstain from every article of food which have ever have life and drink no wine but raise abundance of corn they town be very pleasant and contain great number of idol temple they be not incline to war but learn all art and science with great facility and have a particular manner of write which be adopt by all the neighbouring nation to the east this country be bound by kathay to the west by turkestan to the north by a extensive desert and to the south by a very rich province name sym or peim in which diamond be find and which be situate between kathay and indium it appear that haitho here describe the country of the uigur in conjunction with that of the gete : but how it come to receive the name of tarsae i know not -- _ forst _  3 _ turkestan _ be bound on the east by the empire of tarsae to the west by khorasmin or khuaresm and to the south it extend to the desert which form the northern frontier of indium in this country there be few good town but many extensive plain which afford excellent pasturage to cattle and the inhabitant be almost universally shepherd and tender of cattle they dwell mostly in tent and in hut which can be transport from place to place they cultivate only a small quantity of corn and have no wine they drink be beer and milk and they subsist upon meat with rice and millet the people be know by the name of turk and be of the mahometan religion such of they as live in town use the arabian letter ocerra or otrar be the capital of this country  4 _ khorasmin _ or khuaresm be a populous pleasant and fertile country contain many good and strong town the capital be khorasme the country produce abundance of corn and very little wine this empire border on a desert of a hundred day journey in extent to the west be the caspian sea to the north kumanium and to the east turkestan the inhabitant be heathen without letter or law the soldinus be the most intrepid of warrior have a particular language of they own for which they employ the greek character in write and they follow the usage and rite of the greek church be subject in spiritual to the patriarch of antioch accord to ulug-beg who be himself prince of this country the capital of khuaresm be the city of korkang and no author except haitho have ever mention a place call khorasme the soldinus whom he mention as christian of the greek church be unknown perhaps they may have be the sogdian -- _ forst _  5 _ kumanium _ be of vast extent but owe to the inclemency of its climate be very thinly inhabit in some part the cold be so intense in winter that neither man nor beast can remain in they and in other part the heat be so extreme and they be so infested with swarm of fly as to be quite intolerable the whole country be flat and level and without wood except some orchard near the town the inhabitant live in tent and use the dung of they cattle as fuel it be bound on the east by a desert towards khorasmium to the west be the great sea or euxine and the sea of tenue tanna or azof to the north be the empire of kaffia or kiow and to the south it extend to the great river etile or wolga which pass the capital this river be freeze over every year and man and beast walk upon the ice as on dry land along the bank of the river be many small tree and on the other side of the river the country be inhabit by a people who though not kumanian be subject to the khan some live towards the high mountain of coca or caucasus in which there be white kite this range of mountain extend between the black sea or euxine on the west and the caspian on the east this latter have no connection with the ocean but be a vast lake call a sea on account of its extent be the largest lake in the world and contain a great quantity of excellent fish it divide asia into two part that to the east be call _ lower _ asia and that to the west _ greater _ asia in the caspian mountain abundance of buffalo and many other wild beast be find in this sea there be many island to which numerous bird resort to breed particularly the falcon call _ pegrim _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ esmetlione _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- and _ bousaceus _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- and many other bird not to be find elsewhere the largest town of kumanium be sara or saray which be large and of great renown but have be ravage and almost entirely destroy by the tartar who take it by storm it be obvious that haitho here describe that part of the empire of the mongal which be subject to baatu-khan the euxine or black sea he call the _ great sea _ the sea of tenue be that of tanna or azof the town at the mouth of the tanai or don have be know by both of these name the former evidently derive from the ancient name of the river or the river from the town and of which the modern name don be a mere corruption the empire of kaffia be obviously that of kiow kiovium or kiavium long the capital of the russian empire and the residence of the czar or great duke -- forst  6 beyond the great mountain of belgian or bilkhan the tartar live formerly without religion or the knowledge of letter be chiefly employ in tend they flock and be so far from warlike that they readily submit to pay tribute to any neighbouring prince who make the demand all the tribe of the tartar be know by the name of mogle mogul or mongal and in process of time they increase so much as to form seven populous independent nation the first be call tartar after a province of that name which be they original habitation the second tangot tangut or tongusian the third kunat the fourth jalair or thalair the fifth sonich the sixth monghus and the

and maffeus polo he uncle be venetian gentleman engage in commerce and appear to have go into the east in the prosecution of they trade in the year 1260 they reside far some time at the court of kublai-khan the great emperor of the mongal or tartar and return to venice in 1269 they find that the wife of nicolo have die during they absence leave a son marco the author of the follow travels of whom she be pregnant at the time of they departure these circumstance be detail in the first section of this chapter but the date which have be usually assign for the commencement of this first journey 1250 be evidently corrupt as will appear from the follow consideration derive from a comparison of the chronology of the king and prince who be mention in the travels as reign at the time the high probability be that the obvious mistake of assume the year 1250 as the era of the first journey arise from a careless substitution of the figure 5 for 6 in transcription assume the correct date of 1260 as the commencement of the first journey of nicolo and maffeus polo this will appear to be consonant with the chronology of the prince with whose reign they travels be connect while the date of 1250 adopt by ramusio and muller be totally irreconcilable with the truth of history they remain one year at the leskar or camp of bereke-khan whence they travel into bochara where they tarry three year from thence they spend one year on they journey to the court of kublai-khan and be three year on they journey back to venice but as they remain some time at the residence of kublai-khan one year may be allow for that circumstance and this first journey may therefore be allow to have occupy nine year in all kublai-khan reign supreme emperor of the mongal from 1259 to 1294 in which last year he die at eighty year of age if therefore nicolo and maffeus have set out upon they first journey in 1250 they must have arrive at the imperial residence of cambalu or pekin in 1255 at the latest or four year before kublai-khan ascend the throne they first journey commence while baldwin ii be emperor of constantinople who reign from 1234 to 1261 the khan of kiptschak or the western division of the vast empire of the mongal at the time of this journey be bereke who rule from 1256 to 1266 holagu-khan who be then at war with bereke do not begin to reign till 1258 hence it follow that they could not have commence they first journey at the very earliest before 1258 or 1259 rather as it be not to be suppose that holagu would enter upon a dangerous war in the first year of he reign upon the whole therefore the date of 1260 for the commencement of the first journey as already observe be perfectly consistent with the chronology of history the year of they return to venice 1269 be agree upon on all hand and as marco be bear in the first year of they absence he would then be about nine year of age ramusio who date the commencement of the first journey in 1250 suppose marco to have be fifteen year of age at the return of he father and uncle which be absurd as if the era assume by ramusio be possibly true he must then have be in he nineteenth year accord to the opinion of mr j r forster the commencement of the second journey in which marco be engage must have be in 1271 and he found this opinion on the circumstance that gregory ix have then be elect pope from whom they carry letter for kublai-khan but it will appear from the travels themselves that the three polo have commence they journey previously to the election of that sovereign pontiff and that they be detain some time in armenia in consequence of a express send after they for the purpose that they might there wait for he final instruction they may therefore have commence this second journey in 1270 we only know however that they set out from venice for a second journey into tartary soon after they return from the first in 1269 and that they carry young marco along with they on he appearance at the court of cambalu kublai-khan take a fancy to the young venetian and cause he to be instruct in four of the principal language which be speak in the extensive dominion of the mongal marco be afterwards employ by the khan for a considerable number of year in several important affair as will appear in the relation of he travels at length the three polo return to venice in 1295 after a absence of twenty-five or twenty-six year during which long period they have never be hear of by they friend and countryman seventeen year of which marco have be employ in the service of the great khan on they return to they own house in venice they be entirely forget by they relation and former acquaintance and have considerable difficulty to establish they identity and to get themselves recognize by they family and be oblige to use extraordinary means to recover the respect which be they due and a acknowledgement of they name family and rank the particulars of which will be find in the travels themselves about three year after the return of these adventurous traveller hostility arise between the republic of genoa and venice the genoese admiral lampa dorium come to the island of curzolum with a fleet of seventy gally to oppose whom the venetian fit out a great naval force under andrea dandolo under whom marco polo have the command of a galley the venetian be totally defeat in a great naval engagement with the loss of they admiral and eighty-five ship and marco polo have the misfortune to be among the number of the prisoner harri allege that he remain a prisoner during several year in spite of every offer of ransom that be make for he liberation but in this he must have mistake or be mislead by the authority which he trust to as peace be conclude in 1299 the year immediately subsequent to the naval engagement in which he be make prisoner while in prison at genoa many of the young nobility be say to have resort to marco to listen to the recital of he wonderful travels and surprize adventure and they be say to have prevail upon he to send to venice for the note which he have draw up during he peregrination by means of which the follow relation be say to have be write in

publish in italian and subsequently translate into latin by pessurus a dominican monk of bologna copy of the original manuscript though write in the venetian dialect which be extremely different from the tuscan or pure italian be multiply with great rapidity in all part of italy and even make they way into france and germany from one or more of these corrupt by the carelessness or ignorance of transcriber some of whom may have abridge the work or may even have interpolate it from other source a thing quite common before the invention of print the latin translation may have be make and circulate over europe ramusio a early editor of voyage and travels publish these travels in a italian translation from the latin which he erroneously suppose to have be the original dictation of marco to rustigielo and many other edition have be publish in the various language of europe but all from one or other of these corrupted transcript or translation a manuscript of the travels of marco polo in the venetian dialect be long preserve by the soranza family at venice but whether this now exist or have ever be publish be unknown mr pinkerton inform we -lrb- 3 -rrb- that a genuine edition of these travels probably from the original m either of marco himself after he return from genoa or from that of he amanuensis rustigielo be publish at trevigus in 1590 in the dialect of venice which have hitherto escape the attention of all editor and commentator this curious publication be often word in the name of all the three traveller father uncle and son but when the peculiar travels of marco be indicate he name only be employ in the former case the language run thus _ we _ nicolo maffeus and marco have hear see and know & c : in the latter i marco be in that place and see & c in this venetian edition the name of place and person be often widely different from those in the other edition and probably more genuine and correct but that publication be at present inaccessible we be under the necessity of be contented with the edition of harri in which he profess to have carefully collate the edition of ramusio with most of the other translation and with a original m in the royal library of prussium this latter labor however he seem to have take entirely upon trust from muller a german editor and translator probably through the intermediation of bergeron a early french editor of voyage and travel the only freedom which have be assume in the present edition be by divide it into section for more ready consultation and reference and by the addition of explanatory note from various source marco polo be the chief of all the early modern discoverer have be the first who communicate to europe any distinct idea of the immense region of asia from the euxine eastward through the vast extent of tartary to china and japan and the very first author who have make any mention of that distant insular sovereignty even columbus be suppose with some considerable probability to have be prompt to he enterprize which end in the discovery of america by the study of these travels believe that by a western course through the unexplored atlantic he should find a comparatively short passage to those eastern region of the indy which polo have visit describe or indicate in this view he be however so far mislead in he estimation of the distance by the erroneously spread-out longitude of ptolomy bring these region much farther towards the east and consequently nearer by the west than they actual situation and be stop in he western course by the important and unexpected discovery of many island and a vast interpose continent which from preconceived theory he name the west indy such be the account of these travels which have be hand down to we from various source and which they importance and intrinsic merit have induce we to record at some length of these adventurous traveller some notice yet remain which may be worthy of be preserve signior maffio polo the uncle of marco become a magistrate of venice and live for some time in much respect among he countryman nicolo polo the father of marco be say to have marry during the captivity of he son at genoa and to have leave three child by this second marriage marco himself marry after he return to venice from genoa and leave two daughter moretta and fantina but have no male issue he be say to have receive

intelligible we can suppose a tribe of indian or black not far from gombroon to have be under the rule of a mussel man sultan and conquer or subvert by a tartar expedition from touran or the north of persium : but this remain a mere hypothetical explanation -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- for this paragraph the editor be indebted to mr pinkerton mod geog ii xxii who have have the good fortune to procure what he think a original edition from the m of marco polo -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- by some singular negligence in translate mr pinkerton in the passage quote in the precede note have ridiculously call this country the plain of _ formosa _ mistake the mere epithet descriptive of its _ beauty _ in the italian language for its name the district be obviously a distinct small kingdom name ormus from its capital city which from its insular situation and great trade with indium long maintain a splendid independence -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- the two mahometan traveller of the ninth century give precisely the same account of the ship of siraf in the same gulf of persium -- e section iv _ account of several other country and they principal curiosity _ from kerman -lrb- 1 -rrb- in three day ride you come to a desert which extend to cobin-ham -lrb- 2 -rrb- seven day journey across the desert in the first three day you have no water except a few salt bitter pond of a green color like the juice of herb and whoever drink even a small quantity of this water can not escape a dysentery and even beast that be compel to drink of it do not escape without a scour it be therefore necessary for traveller to carry water along with they that they may avoid the inconvenience and danger of thirst in the fourth day you find a subterranean river of fresh water -lrb- 3 -rrb- the three last day of this desert be like the first three cobin-ham be a great city where great mirror of steel be make -lrb- 4 -rrb- tutium also which be a cure for sore eye and spodio be make here in the follow manner : from the mine of this country they dig a certain earth which be throw into furnace from which the vapor force downward through a iron grate condense below into tutium of tutty -lrb- 5 -rrb- and the grosser matter remain in the furnace be call spodio leave cobin-ham you meet with another desert of eight day journey in extent and terribly barren have neither tree or water except what be extremely bitter insomuch that beast refuse to drink of it except when mix with meal and traveller be therefore oblige to carry water along with they after pass this desert you come to the kingdom of timochaim -lrb- 6 -rrb- in the north confines of persium in which there be many city and strong castle in this country there be a extensive plain in which one great tree grow which be call the tree of the sun and by christian arbore-secco -lrb- 7 -rrb- or the dry tree this tree be very thick the leaf be green on one side and white on the other and it produce prickly and husky shell like those of chesnut but nothing in they the wood be strong and solid and of a yellow color like box there be no other tree within a hundred mile except on one side where there be tree at the distance of ten mile in this place the inhabitant say that alexander fight a battle against darius -lrb- 8 -rrb- the city of this place be plentifully furnish with good thing the air be temperate and the people handsome especially the woman who be in my opinion the handsomest in the world -lrb- 1 -rrb- marco here probably mean the town or city of kerm-shir as that lie in the course of he present route from ormus to the north-east of persium -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this name be inexplicable yet from the circumstance of its mine and the direction of the journey it may have be situate near the gebelabad mountain and some german editor may have change _ abad _ into the precisely similar significant termination _ ham _ the original probably have cobin-abad -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- in confirmation of the idea entertain of the present route of marco from ormus by kerm-shir to the north-east of persium there be in the map a short river in the desert between diden and mastih which have no outlet but lose itself in the sand on which account he may have call it subterraneous as sink into the earth -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- more probably of copper whiten by some admixture of zinc and other metal of the existence of which in this district there be sufficient indication in the sequel these mirror may have be similar to telescope metal -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- what be here call tutty be probably the sublime floculent white oxid or flower of zinc -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- timochaim seem obviously segistan to which mechran appear to have be then join from the circumstance before related of the polo have go from china by sea to this kingdom the strange application of timochaim be probably corrupt and may perhaps be explicable on the republication of the trevigus edition of these travels till then we must rest satisfied with probable conjecture -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- the native name of this tree and of the plain in which it grow appear obviously to have be translate by marco into italian -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be possible that this arbore-secco may have some reference to arbela -- e section v _ history of the assassin and the manner in which they prince be kill : with the description of several other country _ mulchet -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the saracen language signify the place of heretic and the people of the place be call huleheticus or heretic in regard to the mahometan law the prince of this country be call the _ old man _ of the mountain concern whom i

aloadin have certain youth from twelve to twenty year of age choose among such as seem of a bold and dauntless character who be initiate in all the pleasure and delight of this paradise and whom he employ to entice other to join the select company of young enthusiast by represent the joy and pleasure of the paradise of aloadin when he think proper he cause ten or twelve of these youth to be cast into a deep sleep by means of a potion and then have they convey severally into different chamber of the garden palace where they be attend upon at they awake by the beautiful damsel and supply with all kind of delicious meat and fruit and excellent wine and in whose company they enjoy all manner of luxurious delight so that they imagine that they be actually transport into paradise when they have revel in delight for a few day they be again cast into a deep sleep and remove from the garden of pleasure and be bring into the presence of aloadin be question by he where they have be the old man then represent that it be the command of the prophet that whoever be faithful and obedient to he lord should enjoy the delight of paradise and that if they would faithfully obey all he command they should be admit to reside continually among the joy of which they have be permit to participate for a short time have thus rouse they passion for pleasure they think themselves happy to execute whatever command they might receive even at the utmost hazard of they life be assure whether living or dead that they obedience would secure they the eternal enjoyment of paradise and all its delight by these means aloadin use to procure the murder of other lord who be he enemy by these he assassin who despise all danger and contemn they life when employ in he service by this procedure he be esteem a tyrant and greatly dread by all around and he have two vicar or deputy one in the neighborhood of damascus and another in curdistan who have similarly instruct young man under they order

river but the hill be high and steep and the pass very difficult of access by which the inhabitant be secure against invasion and in these mountain there be flock of from four hundred to six hundred wild sheep which be very difficult to catch if any one contract a ague by live in the moist plain he be sure to recover he health by a few day residence in the mountain which i marco experience in my own person after a whole year sickness the province bascium or vash on a river of that name which fall into the gihon be ten day journey to the south of balaxiam and the country be very hot on which account the people be of a brown color they have a language of they own and wear gold and silver ear-ring artificially ornament with pearl and other precious stone they eat flesh and rice and be

the strictest chastity many of these man be repute as saint and be hold in high estimation among the people from this province you may go to the indy and the ocean but i shall not now follow out the course to indium but return to balaxiam shall trace the way to kathay betwixt the east and north-east beyond balaxium be a certain river on which there be many castle and village belong to the brother of the king of balaxium and after three day journey we come to vachan -lrb- 8 -rrb- which extend three day journey in length and as much be breadth the inhabitant of this country have a peculiar language and be mahometan they be brave warrior and good huntsman as they country abound in wild beast depart from thence in a direction between the east and north-east we ascend for three whole day journey until we come to a exceed high mountain than which there be none say to be higher in the world in this place between two mountain be a plain in which be a great lake and a fine river run through the plain on the bank of which be such excellent pasture that a lean horse or ox will become quite fat in ten day it contain also great quantity of wild beast and particularly very large wild sheep have horn six span long out of which they make various kind of vessel this plain continue twelve day journey in length and be call _ pamer _ in which there be no habitation so that traveller must carry all they provision along with they this plain be so high and cold that no bird be to be find and it be even say that fire do not burn so bright in this place and do not so effectually boil or dress victuals as in other place -lrb- 9 -rrb- from hence the way to kathay lead for forty day journey between the east and the north-east through mountain hill and vally in which there be many river but no village neither any verdure except that some hut and cottage be to be see among the mountain but the inhabitant be savage and wicked idolater who live by hunting and be clothe in the skin of wild beast the country be call palow -lrb- 10 -rrb- after this you come to the province of caschar -lrb- 11 -rrb- which be inhabit by mahometan who be tributary to the great khan of the mongal or tartar the soil be fertile and the country be full of pleasant field garden and orchard produce vine fruit tree cotton hemp and flax and extend five day journey the inhabitant have a particular language and have many merchant manufacturer and artizan but they be so covetous that they do not allow themselves either good meat or drink among they there be some nestorian christian who also have some church -lrb- 1 -rrb- call likewise mulete or alamut marco make here a sudden return to the north-west of persium and from the abruptness of the transition it have be probably disarrange in transcription this country have be likewise call the land of the assassin it be near cashbin in dilem on the border of mazenderan -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the last of these prince be name moadin who as mention in the text be make prisoner and put to death by houlagu-khan in the sequel of this work there will be find other and more full account of this old man of the mountain or prince of the assassin -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- the transition seem here again abrupt and unconnected at least the intermediate country of mazerderan and chorassan to the desert probably of margiana be very slightly pass over -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- in this section marco seem to trace he journey along with he father and uncle from giazza towards tartary but the regular connection appear to have be throw into confusion by ignorant transcriber and editor -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- probably satugar of the modern map on the western border of balk -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- forster consider this place to be scasse or al-shash on the river sirr or sihon perhaps the tashkund of modern map in the province of shash the distance give by marco must be strangely corrupt by transcriber and editor or marco must have forget when he write he travels perhaps twenty-six year after he pass this country when only a boy the distance between balk on one of the branch of the sihon or oxus and shash on the jihon or sirr be at least 350 mile in a straight line which he appear to have travel in _ five _ day but which would more probably occupy fifteen -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- this river be probably the sirr or sihon and the mountain of karatan and arjun pervade the district the two chain be separate by the river -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- vochan vocham or vakhan on the river vash -- forst -lrb- 9 -rrb- this observation be make on the mountain of savoy and switzerland not many year ago by m de luc and publish as a new discovery the phenomenon must be owe to the diminish pressure of the atmosphere at this great elevation by which water boil at a much lower temperature than be requisite for effective cookery : a digester would effectually remove this evil by enable the water to become sufficiently hot without be dissipate -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- beloro belor or belur accord to forster this immense extent of forty day journey through desert seem to include the desert of sultus cobus and shamo and to reach to the frontier of kathay or northern china -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- cascar chascar cassar kaschgar or hasicar accord to forster cashgar be at the western end of the great desert instead of the eastern as express in the text indeed this route be most confusedly and almost unintelligibly lay down probably from corrupted transcription the series ought to have be the high table land of pamer the province of cashgar and lastly the desert of pelow or belur but care must be take to distinguish this from the chain of belur-tag which run north and south between great and little bucharium -- e section vi _ of the city of samarcand the town of lop the great desert in its neighborhood and other remarkable passage _ samarcand -lrb- 1 -rrb- be a great and famous city in a fertile plain and surround by fine garden it be subject to the nephew of the

year ago zagathaus the brother of the great khan then govern this country and be persuade to become a christian and the christian through he favor build a church in honor of st john the baptist which be construct with such skill that the whole roof seem to depend for support upon one central pillar which be found upon a large stone which by the permission of zagathaus have be take from a building belong to the mahometan after the death of zagathaus he be succeed by a son who be not of the christian faith and from he the mahometan obtain a order by which the christian be compel to restore that stone and though they offer a sum of money as a compensation the mahometan absolutely insist to have the stone itself hope by that mean to reduce the christian church to ruin : but the pillar lift itself up that the mahometan might remove the contest stone and still continue suspend in the air depart from this city we come into the province of charahan -lrb- 2 -rrb- which be about five day journey in length and have plenty of provision the inhabitant be mostly mahometans intermix with some nestorian christian and be subject to the nephew of the great khan they be diligent artificer in

other fine stone be find which be carry by merchant all the way to ouchach or kathay and sell there with great profit from peim to sartem and quite through this latter province the soil be very sandy have very little water and that generally bad when a army pass through this province all the inhabitant take they wife and child with all they cattle and valuable two day journey into the sand to place where they know that good water be to be find and remain there till the army have quit the country after harvest also they uniformly take all they corn into the desert and hide it in pit and the wind soon obliterate all trace of they footstep so that they enemy be unable to discover where they have deposit these precious hoard after travel for five day through the sand from this province we arrive at the great city of lop which be at the entrance of a great desert call the wilderness of lop -lrb- 5 -rrb- the inhabitant of this place be mahometan and be subject to the great khan all the before-mentioned province cashgar yarkand koten peim sartem and lop be in the bound of turkestan it require a month journey to cross this desert from south to north but to go through it lengthway would take up a whole year those who intend to cross the desert remain for some time in lop on purpose to prepare all necessaries for the journey as no provision be to be meet with for a whole month these with they merchandize be load on ass and camel and if provision fall short in the desert the unfortunate traveller be reduce to the necessity of kill they beast of burden for sustenance prefer the ass for this purpose as the camel can carry much heavier burden and be satisfy with less food this journey be entirely through sand and barren mountain in which water be find every day yet at some of the rest place it be so scanty as hardly to suffice for a caravan of fifty of a hundred person and they cattle in three or four place the water be salt and bitter but in all the rest of the journey it be very good in the whole of this journey there be no beast or bird to be see it be report that many evil spirit reside in the wilderness which occasion wonderful illusion to traveller who happen unfortunately to lag behind they companion call they even by they name and cause they to stray farther from the right course so that they lose they way and perish in the sand in the night time also they hear noise as of they friend and sometimes the sound of music be hear in the air and people imagine that they hear the din of drum as if army be march past to avoid the danger of separation the traveller in the desert keep close together and hang bell about the neck of they beast and if any one stay behind they set up mark in the route that they may know how to follow have cross the desert of lop we come to the city of sachion -lrb- 6 -rrb- or sachiou which be subject to the great khan and be situate in the great country of tangut the inhabitant of this city be mostly idolater who have a peculiar language mix with a good many mahometan and some nestorian christian this people be little addict to merchandize or manufacture and live on the product of they soil in this city there be

be immediately consecrate to the protection of some particular idol and the father nourish a sheep in he house for a year with great care and on the anniversary day of that idol he present he son and the sheep as a sacrifice with great reverence and many ceremony before the shrine of this tutelary deity the flesh of the sheep be boil and set before the idol during the continuance of the prayer and

the planet may not have a favourable aspect for six month during all which time the body be keep in the house for this purpose a fit chest or coffin be provide which be so artificially joint that no noisome smell can escape and in this the body be place have be previously embalm with spice the coffin be ornament with painting and be cover over with a embroidered cloth every day while the body remain unburied a table be spread near the coffin and set out with meat bread and wine which remain for as long a time as a live person would require to eat and drink and the soul of the decease be suppose to feed upon the savor the astrologer sometimes forbid the body to be carry out for interment at the principal door of the house pretend to be regulate in this by the star and order it to be carry out by some other way or will even command a passage to be break out in the opposite wall of the house to propitiate the adverse planet and if any one object to this they allege that the spirit of the dead would be offend and would occasion injury to the family when the body be carry through the city to be bury wooden cottage be build at certain distance by the way have porch cover with silk

obviously faulty place -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- charchan charcham carcam hiarkand jarkun jerket jerken urkend such be the variety in the edition of these travels for the yarkand of modern map this paragraph ought obviously to have follow the account of cashgar -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- cotan cotam hotum khoten khotan from which the useful material of manufacture _ cotton _ take its name but instead of be

the journey from sartem to lop be obviously retrograde and this course must have be pursue by the polo for commercial purpose perhaps for collect those valuable stone which be mention by marco as give so much profit when sell in china -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- schatscheu tschat-scheu or chat-chou on the polonkir which run into the hara lake -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be highly probable that this emblematical representation have be substitute by some humane legislator or conqueror in place of the actual sacrifice of the servant cattle and goods themselves which we be well assure be once the practice among many rude nation in honor of they deceased great man -- e section vii _ of the province of chamil and several other country on the road from thence to the city of ezina and of another great desert _

accompany by twelve choice hawk carry by twelve noble many other nobleman and soldier attend he when any crane or pheasant or other bird be see notice be give to the falconer who be near the khan and by these to the khan himself who then order he travel house to be remove and the hawk to be fly at the game and he sit in he bed enjoy the sport ten thousand man attend the khan who disperse two and two together to mark where the falcon fly that they may assist they when needful and bring back they and they game to the khan these man be call _ tascoal _ which signify watchman or marksman and have a peculiar whistle by which they call in the hawk and falcon so that it be not necessary that the falconer who let fly the hawk should follow they as these tascoal be busily employ in take up the hawk and be very careful that none of they be hurt or lose every hawk have a small plate of silver attach to the foot on which be the peculiar mark of its master that each may be restore to its right owner but if the mark be lose or can not be know the hawk be deliver to a certain baron whose name of office be bulangazus to whom all lose thing whatever must be bring otherwise the finder would be punish as a thief and to the bulangazus all who have lose any thing make application this man be distinguish by a peculiarly conspicuous ensign that he may be easily find out in so numerous a assemblage while thus busily employ in hawk the royal retinue come at length to a great plain call carzarmodin where the tent of the khan and all the courtier be pitch to the number of 10000 or more the grand pavilion of the khan be so large that 10000 man might stand within it besides baron and nobleman it be place with its entrance to the south support upon curiously carve pillar and be cover on the outside with the skin of lion and other wild beast to keep out the rain but the whole inside be line with sable and ermine to a immense value for so precious be these skin esteem that a sufficient

pavilion for the son wife and concubine of the khan at a farther distance there be tent for the falcon ger-falcon hawk and other bird of game and the whole encampment seem at a distance like a great city or the station of a large army the khan remain all the month of march in that plain employ in hawk and the multitude of beast and fowl which be take in that time be quite incredible from the

or hunting dog neither to use any device or engine whatever for take any stag deer roe-buck hare or other game lest the breed should be injure by which mean the game be always in great abundance it be quite wonderful to behold what number of merchant and other people and what astonishing quantity of merchandize and goods of all sort be to be see in cambalu the money of the great khan be not of gold or silver or other metal but of a species of paper which be thus make : they take the middle dark of the mulberry tree which they make firm in a particular manner and this be cut out into round piece of various size on which the seal or mark of the khan be impressed of this paper money a immense quantity be fabricate in the city of cambalu sufficient to supply the currency of the whole empire and no person under pain of death may coin or spend any other money or refuse to accept of this in all the kingdom and country which be subject to he dominion all who come into he dominion be prohibit from use any other money so that all merchant come from country however remote must bring with they gold silver pearl or precious stone for which they receive the khan paper money in exchange : and as that money be not receive in other country they must exchange it again in the empire of the great khan for merchandize to carry with they on they return the khan pay all salary stipend and wages to he officer servant and army in this money and whatever be require for the service of he court and household be pay for in the same by all these means there be no sovereign in the world who equal the great khan in extent of treasure as he expend none in the mint or in any other way whatever the great khan have a council of war compose of twelve baron as formerly mention who direct all martial affair and have the power of promote or disgrace officer and soldier as they think proper they office be call _ thai _ or the high court or tribunal as no person in the empire be superior to they except the great khan other twelve baron be appoint as counsellor for the thirty-four province into which the vast empire of the khan be divide these have a splendid palace in cambalu as they office in which there be a judge for each province and many notary this tribunal choose proper person to be appoint governor of the province and present they name to the khan for confirmation they likewise have the charge of the collection and expenditure of the public treasure the name of they office be _ singh _ or the second court which be subordinate only to the khan yet be consider as less noble than the _ thai _ or military tribunal many public road lead from cambalu to all the neighbouring province and on every one of these there be inn or lodgings call _ lamb _ build at the distance of every twenty-five or thirty mile which serve as post - house have large fair court and many chamber furnish with bed and provision every way fit to lodge and entertain great man and even king the provision be furnish from the circumjacent country out of the tribute at every one of these there be four hundred horse two hundred of which be keep ready for use in the stable and the other two hundred at grass each division for a month alternately these horse be destine for the use of ambassador and messenger who leave they tired horse and get fresh one at every stage in mountainous place where there be no village the khan have establish colony of about ten thousand people in each in the neighborhood of these post-house that they may cultivate the ground and supply provision these excellent regulation extend to the utmost limit of the empire in all direction so that there be about ten thousand imperial inn or lamb in the whole empire and the number of horse appoint in these for the service of messenger exceed two hundred thousand -lrb- 2 -rrb- by which mean intelligence be forward to the court without delay from all part of the empire if any person should wonder how so many beast and man can be procure and provide for let he consider that the mahometan and pagan have many woman and great number of child some have even so many as thirty son all able to follow they arm into the field as for victuals they sow rice panik and millet which yield a hundred after one and they allow no land that be fit to carry crop to remain uncultivated as wheat do not thrive in this country it be little sown and they use no bread but feed upon the formerly mention grain boil in milk or make into broth along with flesh they horse continually increase insomuch that every tartar soldier carry six eight or more horse into the field for he own use which he ride upon in they turn all city that be adjoining to river or lake be order to have ferry-boat in constant readiness for the post and those which be on the border of desert must supply horse and provision for such as have to pass through these desert for which service they be allow a reasonable compensation from the state in case of great conscience the messenger have a gerfalcon badge formerly mention and be so equip that he will ride 200 or 250 mile in a day and night be attend in dark night by person who run along with he on foot carry light on approach a post-house the messenger sound a horn that a fresh horse or horse accord to he company may be bring out and ready to mount immediately these speedy messenger have then belly loin and head firmly swathe and they always travel as fast as they horse can go and such as be able to endure this excessive ride be hold in great estimation as nothing be more admire among the tartar than good horsemanship between the _ lamb _ or large post-house there be other habitation at three or four mile distance from each other where foot-post be establish every one of whom have he girdle hang round with shrill sound bell these be always in readiness and when dispatch with the khan letter they convey they with great speed to the next foot-post station where they hear the sound of the bell from a distance and some one be always in readiness to take the letter and to run on to the next station : thus by constant change of swift runner the letter be convey with great dispatch to they destination by this mean the khan often receive letter or new fruit in two day from the distance often ordinary day journey : as for instance fruit grow at cambalu in the morning be convey to xandu by the night of the next day all the people employ in the post besides be exempt from all tribute have a ample recompense for they labor from the gatherer of the khan rent there be inspector employ who examine the state and conduct of these post every month and be empower to punish those who be guilty of fault the khan send every year to the different province of he empire to inquire whether any injury have be sustain to the crop by tempest locust worm or any other calamity and when any province or district have suffer damage the tribute be remit for that year and he even send corn for food and seed from the public granary : for in year of great abundance he purchase large quantity of grain which be carefully preserve for three or four year by officer appoint for the purpose by which mean when a scarcity occur in any province the defect may be supply from the granary of the khan in another province on these occasion he order he grain to be sell at a fourth part of the market price and great care be take to keep he granary always well supply when any murrain attack the cattle of one of the province the deficiency be supply from the tenth which he receive in the other province if any beast or sheep happen to be kill by lightning in a flock or herd he draw no tribute from that flock however great for three year under a idea that god be angry

it often happen that one man arm with a bow and arrow and assist by two of these dog will kill a lion the dog urge on by the man give the onset and the lion endeavor to take shelter beside a tree that the dog may not be able to get behind he yet he scorn to run away and hold on he stately slow space the dog always fasten on he hinder part but so cautiously and nimbly do they manage they assault that whenever the lion turn upon they they be beyond he reach then the magnanimous beast hold on he way towards a tree the man all the while ply he with arrow at every opportunity and the dog

produce great profit to the people and the great khan as large quantity be export for sale to other country in this neighborhood there be large and fine flavored peach one of which weigh two pound five day journey farther south from ciangu be the city of cianglus likewise in kathay between which we pass many city and castle all subject to the great khan and through the middle of this last city of cianglus there run a large river which be very convenient for the transport of merchandize six day journey from thence to the south be the noble kingdom and great city of tudinfu which be formerly subject to its own king but be subdue by the arm of the great khan in 1272 under its jurisdiction there be twelve famous trading city it be most pleasantly situate among garden and orchard and be rich in silk a baron name lucanser who be send to govern this acquisition by the khan with a army of 8000 horse choose to rebel but be defeat and slay by a army of 100000 horse send against he by the khan

inhabitant into two river one branch of which flow by the east towards kathay and the other by the west towards mangus -lrb- 13 -rrb- by these river or canal innumerable vessel incredible for they size and wealth carry vast quantity of merchandize through both of these province and for sixteen day journey to the south from singuimatu we meet with many city and town which carry on immense trade the inhabitant of all these country be idolater and subject to the great khan you then come to a great river call caramoran -lrb- 14 -rrb- which be say to take its rise in the dominion formerly belong to umcan or prester john in the north it be very deep and carry ship of great burden and be well stock with fish within one day journey of the sea be the two city of coigan-zu and quan-zu on opposite side of the river the one a great city and the other a small one where a fleet of 15000 vessel be keep by the great khan each fit for carry fifteen horse and twenty man these be always in readiness to carry a army to any of the island or to any remote region in case of rebellion -lrb- 15 -rrb- on pass the great river caramoran or hoang-ho we enter into the noble kingdom of mangus : but it must not be suppose that i have describe the whole province of kathay as i have not speak of the twentieth part of it for in pass through this province i have only mention the principal city on my way leave those on both side and many intermediate one to avoid prolixity and not to set down in write what i only learn from hearsay -lrb- 1 -rrb- the meaning of this sentence be obscure unless it be intend to guard the reader against the supposition that these country be to the west of europe -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- call lazus by pinkerton from the trevigus edition of these travels mention in the introduction this place therefore may be lassa in the kingdom or province of ou in middle thibet the residence of the dalaus lama situate on a branch of the sampoo or great brahma-pootra or barampooter river which join the gange in the lower part of bengal -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this sentence most probably be mean to imply the use of cowrie sometimes call porellane shell both for money and ornament -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- pinkerton from the trevigus edition name the country cariam and the governor cocagio -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the ordinary european price be about fourteen for one -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- the description of this creature seem to indicate a alligator or crocodile which probably marco have not see and only describe from a imperfect account of the native -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- accord to pinkerton this province be name caritus and its principal town nociam in the edition of trevigus -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- name previously carazam and caraian afterwards caraiam or carian -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- in some modern map mien be introduce as a large province on the river of pegu immediately to the south-west of yunnan in china and divide from bengal by the whole country of ava but the distribution of eastern dominion have be always extremely fluctuating and mien may then have include all the north of ava -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- in the original text this animal be call the unicorn a word of the same import with rhinoceros -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- this either imply that bengal on the border of indium be to the south of thibet or _ south _ be here a error for _ east _ bengal be the eastern frontier province of indium proper -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- the difficulty or rather impossibility of trace the step of marco polo may proceed from various cause the province or kingdom mostly name from they chief city have suffer infinite change from perpetual revolution the name he give besides be corrupt in the various transcription and edition he probably set down orally as give to he in the tartar or mogul dialect very different from those which have be adopt into modern geography from various source many of these place may have be destroy and new name impose upon the whole he present course appear to have be from bengal eastward through the province of the farther indium to mangus or southern china and cangigu may possibly be chittigong yet cangigu be say in the text to be a inland country -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- kathay and mangus as formerly mention be northern and southern china so that the direction of these river ought perhaps to have be describe as north and south instead of east and west about seventy mile from the mouth of the yellow river or hoang-ho there be a town call tsingo near which a canal run to the north communicate with the river on which pekin be situate and another canal run far south into mangus or southern china tsingo though now a inferior town may have be formerly singui-matu and a place of great importance -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- caramoran or hora-moran be the hoang-ho or yellow river and it must be allow that the distance which be place in the text between singui-matu and this river be quite hostile to the idea mention in the precede note of tsingo and singui-matu be the same place the only other situation in all china which accord with the two canal or river communicate both with kathay and mangus be yotcheou on the tong-ting-hou lake which be on the kian-ku river and at a sufficient distance from the hoang-ho to agree with the text in the absence of all tolerable certainty conjecture seem allowable -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- there be no chinese city in we map that in the least appearance of sound correspond with the name of these town or city near the mouth of the hoang-ho hoain-gin be the only large city near its mouth and that be not on its bank all therefore that can be say be that the two city in the text must have stand on opposite side of the hoang-ho in the day of marco polo -- e section xv _ a account of the kingdom of mangus and the manner of its reduction under the dominion of the great khan together with some notice of its various province and city _ the kingdom of mangus be the richest and most famous of all that be to be find in the

custody of he capital to he wife whom he desire to defend it as well as she could as be a woman she need not fear be put to death if she be make prisoner it may be observe that fanfur have be tell by he diviner that he kingdom would never be take from he except by one who have a hundred eye and this be know to the queen she be in hope or preserve the city in all extremity think it impossible for any one man to have a hundred eye but learn that the name of the commander of the tartar have that signification she send for he and deliver up the city believe he to be the person indicate by the astrologer and to whom destiny have predetermine the conquest of the city and kingdom -lrb- 6 -rrb- she be send to the court of the great khan where she be most honourably receive and entertain as become she former dignity after the surrender of the capital the citizen and inhabitant of the whole province yield to the obedience of the great khan -lrb- 7 -rrb- i shall now speak of the city in the kingdom of mangus coiganzu be a very fair and rich city situate towards the south-east and east in the very entrance of the province of mangus -lrb- 8 -rrb- in this city which be situate on the river carama -lrb- 9 -rrb- there be vast number of ship employ in trade and great quantity of salt be make in that neighborhood proceeding from coigan-zu we ride one day journey to the south-east on a stone causeway on both side of which be great fence with deep water through which people may pass with proper vessel -lrb- 10 -rrb- and there be no entrance into mangus but by this causeway except by

they manufacture arm and harness for war naughin -lrb- l3 -rrb- be a province to the west -lrb- 14 -rrb- of tangui one of the greatest and noblest in all mangus and a place of vast trade have abundance of beast and fowl wild and tame and plenty of corn the inhabitant be idolater and manufacture stuff of silk and gold use only paper money this country produce large revenue to the khan especially in the custom which he receive from trade sian-fu be a large and noble city in the province of mangus have twelve great and rich city under its jurisdiction this city be so strong that it be three year besiege by the army of the tartar and could not be vanquish at the time when the rest of the kingdom of mangus be subdue it be so environ with lake and river that ship come continually with plenty of provision and it be only accessible from the north the long resistance of this city give much dissatisfaction to the khan which come to the knowledge of nicolo and maffeus polo then at he court they offer they service to construct certain engine after the manner of those use in europe capable of throw stone of three hundred weight to kill the man and ruin the house in the besiege city the khan assign they carpenter who be nestorian christian to work under they direction and they make three of these engine which be try before the khan and approve of these be accordingly send by ship to the army before sian-fu and be plant against the city cast great stone into it by which some of the house be beat down and destroy the inhabitant be very much astonished and terrify by the effect of these machine and surrender themselves to the authority and dominion of the khan on the same condition with the rest of mangus and by this service the venetian brethren acquire great reputation and favor from this city of sian-fu to another call sin-gui it be account fifteen mile to the south-east this city though not very large have a prodigious number of ship as it be situate on the greatest river in the world call quiam -lrb- l5 -rrb- be in some place ten in other eight and in other six mile broad but its length extend to a distance of above a hundred day journey from its source to the sea receive numberless navigable river in its course from various and distant region by which mean incredible quantity of merchandize be transport upon this river there be about two hundred city which participate in the advantage of this river which run through or past the boundary of sixteen province the greatest commodity on this river be salt with which all the province and city which have communication with its water be supply i marco once see at singui five thousand vessel yet some other city on the river have a greater number all these ship be cover have but one mast and one sail and usually carry 4000 venetian cantharus and upward some as far as 12000 in these vessel they use no cordage of hemp even they hawser or tow rope be make of cane about fifteen pace long which they split into thin piece from end to end and bind or wreath together into rope some of which be three hundred fathom long and serve for drag they vessel up or down the river each vessel have ten or twelve horse for that purpose on that river there be rocky hillock in many place on which idol temple with monastery for the priest be build and in all the course of the river we find cultivate vally and habitation innumerable cayn-guus be a small city on the same river to the south eastward of sin-gui where every year great quantity of corn and rice be bring which be carry for the most part to cambalu for from the quiam or kian-ku river they pass to that city by means of lake and river and by one large canal which the great khan cause to be make for a passage from one river to another so that vessel go all the way from mangus or southern china to cambalu without ever be oblige to put to sea this great work be beautiful and wonderful for its size and vast extent and be of infinite profit to the city and province of the empire the khan likewise cause great causeway to be construct along the bank of this prodigious canal for the conveniency of travel by land and for tow the vessel in the middle of the great river there be a rocky island with a great temple and monastery for the idolatrous priest cin-ghian-fu -lrb- 16 -rrb- be a city of the province of mangus which be rich in merchandize and plentiful in game and provision of all kind in 1274 the great khan send marsachis a nestorian christian to govern this city who build here two christian church from the city of cin-ghian-fu in a journey of three day journey to the south-eastward we find many city and castle all inhabit by idolater and at length come to the great and handsome city of tin-gui-guus which abound in all kind of provision when chinsan baian conquer the kingdom of mangus he send a large body of christian alanus -lrb- 17 -rrb- against this city which have a double inclosure of wall the inhabitant retire from the outer town within the inner wall and the alanian find great store of wine indulge themselves too freely after a severe march in the night time the citizen sally out upon they while all be drunk and asleep and put every man of they to the sword but baian send afterwards a fresh army against they which soon master the city and in severe revenge massacre the whole inhabitant the great and excellent city of sin-guus -lrb- 18 -rrb- be twenty mile in circumference and contain a vast population among whom be great number of physician and magician and wise man or philosopher it have sixteen other city under its jurisdiction in each of which there be much trade and many curious art and many sort of silk be make in its territory the neighbouring mountain produce rhubarb and ginger in great plenty the name sin-guus signify the city of the earth and there be another city in the kingdom of mangus call quin-saus which signify the city of heaven from singui it be one day journey to vagiu where also be abundance of silk and able artisan and many merchant as be universally the case in all the city of this kingdom -lrb- 1 -rrb- call tou-tsong by the chinese historian the fifteenth emperor of the nineteenth dynasty who succeed to the throne in the year 1264 -- harri -lrb- 2 -rrb- the name of this general be say to have signify _ a hundred eye _ doubtless a tartar title denote he vigilance and foresight by the chinese historian this general be name pe-yen which may have the same signification these historian attribute the conquest of mangus or southern china to the indolence debauchery and extreme love of pleasure of this emperor whom they name tou-tsong -- harri -lrb- 3 -rrb- the name of all place and province in the travels of marco polo be either so disguise by tartar appellation or so corrupted that they can not be refer with any certainty to the chinese name upon we map coiganzu describe afterwards as the first city in the south-east of mangus in go from kathay may possibly be hoingan-fou which answer to that situation the termination _ fou _ be merely _ city _ and other termination be use by the chinese as _ tcheou _ and other to denote the rank or class in which they be place in regard to the subordination of they governor and tribunal which will be explain in that part of we work which be appropriate to the empire of china -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- or guinsaus to be afterwards describe -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- it do not appear where these island be situate whether hainan or formosa properly tai-ouan or tai-wan or the island in the bay of canton -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- these sagacious diviner must have be well acquaint with the military energy of the tartar government and the abject weakness of they own and certainly know from they brethren in kathay the significant name of the tartar general on which foundation they construct the enigma of they prophecy which like many other contribute towards its own accomplishment -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- about a year after the surrender of he capital tou-tsong die leave three son who all perish in a few year afterwards the eldest be make prisoner and die in captivity in tartary the second die of a consumption at canton where he have take refuge at eleven year of age the third name ti-ping after all the country be seize by the tartar be carry on board the chinese fleet which be pursue and bring to action by a fleet which the tartar have fit out for the purpose when the chinese lord who have the charge of the infant emperor see the vessel in which he be embark surround by the tartar he take the young prince in he arm and jump with he into the sea one considerable squadron of the chinese fleet force a passage through that of the tartar but be afterwards entirely destroy in a tempest -- harri -lrb- 8 -rrb- this direction must be understand in reference to kathay as it be perfectly obvious that the entrance here speak of must be in the north-east of mangus suppose the c aspirate coigan-zu and hoaingan-fu both certainly arbitrarily orthographize from the chinese pronunciation be not very dissimilar -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- perhaps a error in transcription for hara-moran or kara-moran the mongul or tartar name of the hoang-ho or whang river near and communicate with which hoaingan or whan-gan-fou be situate -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- this be a obscure indication of navigable canal on each side of the paved road of communication to the south -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- cin-guus or in the italian pronunciation chin or tsin-guus may possibly be yen-tching tin-guus may be sin-yang or tsin-yang to the north-east of yen-tching -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- obviously yang-tcheou the latter syllable be its title or designation of rank and precedency marco certainly mistake from distant recollection the direction of he travels which be very nearly south with a very slight deviation towards the east south-east would by this time have lead he into the sea -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- though call a province this obviously refer to the city of nankin the nau-ghin of the text be probably a corruption for nan-ghin -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- for west we ought certainly here to read south-west -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- quiam kiang kian-ku kin-tchin-kian or yang-tsi-kiang in modern map there be a town on the northern shore of this river name tsing-kiang which may possibly be the singuus of marco and we may perhaps look for the sian-fu of the polo at yang-tcheou at the southern extremity of a chain of lake immediately to the north of the river kian-ku the subject be however full of perplexity difficulty and extreme uncertainty -- e -lrb- 16 -rrb- this must be tchin-kian-fou the three separate syllable in both of these oral orthography have almost precisely similar sound always remember that the soft italian _ c _ have the power of _ tsh _ or we hard _ ch _ as in the english word _ chin _ and the italian _ gh _ the sound of the hard english _ g _ -- e -lrb- 17 -rrb- this evince the great policy of the military government of the tartar in employ the subjugate nation in one corner of they empire to make conquest at such enormous distance from they native country the alanian come from the country between the euxine and caspian in long 60  e and be here fight long 135  e above 4000 mile from home -- e -lrb- 18 -rrb- by the language in this place either sin-gui and tin-gui-guus be the same place or the transition be more than ordinarily abrupt if the same the situation of sin-guus have be attempt to be explain in a former note if different tin-gui-guus be probably obliterate on this occasion as no name in the least similar appear in the map of china -- e section xvi _ of the noble city of quinsaus and of the vast revenue draw from thence by the great khan _ in a journey of three day from vagiu we find number of city castle and village all well peopled and rich the inhabitant be all idolater and subject to the great khan at the end of these three day journey we come to quinsay or

recreation for they ordinarily work only a part of each day spend the remainder in party of pleasure with they friend or with woman either on the lake or in drive through the city in chariot all the street be pave with stone as be all the highway in the kingdom of mangus only a space on one side be leave unpaved for the use of the foot post the principal street of quinsaus have a pavement of ten pace broad on each side the middle be lay with gravel and have channel in every place for convey water it be keep always perfectly clean in this street there be innumerable long close chariot each of which be accommodate with seat and silk cushion for six person who divert themselves by drive about the street or go to the public garden where they pass they time in fine walk shady bower and the like and return at night in the same chariot to the city -lrb- 7 -rrb- when a child be bear the father note down the exact point of time and with this memorandum go immediately to some astrologer of whom there be many in every market place to consult the destiny in regard to he future fortune and they use the same form before celebrate they marriage to ascertain the lucky time when a person of note die the kindred clothe themselves in canvas or sackcloth and accompany the body to the funeral both man and woman people be employ to play on musical instrument and singing all the way prayer to they idol and be come to the place they cast into the fire in which the body be burnt many piece of cotton paper on which figure of slave horse camel stuff of silk and gold money and all other thing be paint which by this mean they believe the dead person will really possess in the next world and they make a grand concert of music under the idea of the joy with which the soul of they depart friend will be receive by they idol in the other life which he be now to begin as they timber house be very liable to accident by fire there be stone tower in every street to which they carry they goods for security on such occasion on most of the bridge there be guard-house in which soldier continuallv watch five in each by day and five by night in case of any alarm or disturbance in every guard-house there hang a great bason -lrb- 8 -rrb- on which the warder strike the successive hour begin one at sunrise and begin a new series at sunset these guard patrole during the night and if they see any light or fire in a house after the appoint time or meet any person in the street after legal hour they cause they to answer before the judge or magistrate of the district when a fire happen the guard collect from they different station to assist in quench it and to carry away the goods to the stone tower or into the island in the lake for during the night none of the citizen be permit to go out except such as be in danger from fire the khan keep always a large body of he best and most faithful soldier for the security of the city which be the largest and richest in the whole earth and besides the small guard-house on the bridge already mention there be larger lodge build of wood all over the city for the accommodation of party of guard to preserve peace and order on the reduction of mangus to obedience the khan divide it into nine great province place a viceroy in each to administer the government and to dispense justice every year each of these viceroy give a account to the tribunal of the khan at cambalu of the revenue and all other matter connect with he government and every third year the viceroy and all the other officer be change the viceroy who reside in quinsaus command over 140 other city all large rich and populous nor be the extent of this government to be wonder at as there be in mangus 12000 city all inhabit by rich and industrious people in every one of which the khan maintain a garrison proportional to its greatness and importance in some 1000 man and even up to 10 or 20000 man -lrb- 9 -rrb- these be not all tartar for the tartar soldier be cavalry only and be keep in place where there be conveniency for exercise they horse the great majority of the troops in mangus be kathayan and the garrison in kathay be compose of people from mangus every third year such a number of man fit to carry arm as be want be select for fill up the garrison and be send to serve in place at least twenty day journey from they home and after serve four or five year they be permit to go home and be replace by fresh recruit most part of the revenue of the khan be expend in this way and on the other necessary expence of government and by this distribution of so powerful a military force a army can be suddenly call together in the event of any town rebelling in the city of quinsaus there be a constant garrison of 30000 soldier and the smallest city in all mangus contain at least 1000 regular troops if any person be not able to work he be carry to some hospital of which there be many in quinsaus found by the ancient king and endowed with large revenue : but when they be well again they must return to they labor i come next to speak of the palace of the late king fanfur he predecessor cause a large park to be inclose with high wall ten mile in circuit -lrb- 10 -rrb- and divide within into three part that in the middle be enter by a gate lead to a range of large gallery or hall whose roof be sustain by pillar finely work and paint and richly adorn with gold and azure the smallest of these gallery be that nearest the gate of entrance and they gradually become larger and fairer in succession the most sumptuous be at the farthest end the wall of all these apartment be elegantly paint with the portrait and history of the former king every year on certain holiday dedicate to the idol fanfur use to hold open court on which occasion he feast he chief lord the principal merchant and rich artificer of quinsaus 10000 at a time in these hall the feast continue for ten or twelve successive day with incredible magnificence every guest use he utmost endeavor to appear in the most pompous dress on one side of this magnificent range of gallery there be a wall divide it from a great cloistered court have a terrace all round set with pillar communicate with which be the chamber of the king and queen all curiously work carve gilded and paint with the utmost splendor and magnificence from this cloister a covered gallery six pace wide extend a great length all the way to the lake and on each side of this gallery there be ten court answer to each other like cloister each have fifty chamber with they garden and in these there be 1000 concubine for the king service sometimes with the queen and sometimes with these concubine the king use to go in he barge for recreation on the lake or to visit the idol temple the rest of the great inclosure be divide into grave lake and garden in which all sort of beast of chase be keep as stag roebuck hare cony and other and there the king use to divert himself with he damsel in chariot or on horseback no man be allow to enter there in this place the lady hunt with dog and when wearied with sport they retire into the grove and throw off they garment come forth naked and fall to swim in the lake in the king presence sometimes he banquet in these grove be serve by he damsel all of these particulars i learn from a old rich merchant of quinsaus who have be familiar with king fanfur and know all the incident of he life and reign and have see the palace in its most flourishing state and he carry I to see it the viceroy now reside there the first describe gallery remain still in they original state but the chamber of the damsel be fall to ruin the wall also which encompass the wood and garden be all fall down the beast and tree be all go and all the other ornament be destroy twenty-five mile from quinsai we come to the ocean between the east and the north-east near which be a city call gampu -lrb- 11 -rrb- have a excellent port frequent by merchant ship from the indy while i marco be in quinsaus a account be take for the great khan of the revenue and the number of inhabitant and i see that there be enrol 160 toman of fire reckon for each fire a family dwelling in one house each toman be 10000 which make 1600000 family -lrb- 12 -rrb- and for all this population there be only one nestorian church all the rest be idolater every householder be oblige to have write over he door the name of every individual in he family whether male or female as also the number of horse add or efface as the family increase or diminish and this rule be observe in all the city of mangus and kathay those also who keep inn must write down in a book the name of all they guest with the day and hour of they arrival and departure and these book be send daily to the magistrate who preside at the market place the revenue which accrue to the khan from quinsaus and the other city under its authority be first from salt eight toman of gold every toman be 80000 sazzus and a sazzus be more than a gold florin which will amount to six million and four hundred thousand ducat the cause of this be that be near the sea there be many lake or saline of sea water which dry up and coagulate into salt in summer and five other province in mangus be supply from the coast of quinsaus this province produce plenty of sugar which pay like all other spice three and a third in the hundred which be likewise pay for rice-wine all the twelve company which we say before have twelve thousand shop and all merchant who bring goods hither by sea or carry any away pay a similar rate those who come from indium or other remote country pay ten per cent all breed cattle and all production of the earth as silk rice corn and the like pay to the khan the whole computation be make in my presence amount yearly besides the above mention produce from salt to two hundred and ten toman of gold which be equal to sixteen million and eight hundred thousand golden ducat -lrb- 13 -rrb- a day journey from quinsaus to the south-east we pass the whole way through house village fine garden and abundant cultivation and then come to a fine city call tapin-zu three day hence be uguiu and two day farther we still ride past castle city and well cultivate field so near adjoining that the whole seem to traveller like one continue city in this district be great cane fifteen pace long and four palm thick two day farther be the large and handsome city of conguus and travel thence for four day through place well fill with industrious people have plenty of beef buffalo goat and swine but no sheep we come to the city of zengian which be build on a hill in the middle of a river which after encompass it divide into two branch one of which run to the south-east and the other to the north-west three day journey thence through a most pleasant country exceedingly well inhabit we come to the large city of gieza which be the last in the kingdom of quinsaus after this we enter into another province of the kingdom of mangus call concha the principal city of which be fugiu by which you travel six day journey south-east through hill and dale always find inhabit place and plenty of beast fowl and game and some strong lion be find in the mountain and forest ginger galingal and other spice grow here in great plenty and there be a herb of which the fruit have the same color smell and effect with saffron which it be not and be much use in they meat -lrb- 15 -rrb- the inhabitant be idolater and subject of the great khan and eat man flesh if the person have not die of disease even consider it as better flavored than any other when they go into the field they shave to the ear and paint they face with azure all they soldier serve on foot except the captain who be on horseback and they arm be sword and lance they be very cruel and when they kill a enemy they immediately drink he blood and afterwards eat he flesh after six day journey be quelinfu a great city with three bridge each of which be eight pace broad and above a hundred pace long the man be great merchant and manufacturer and the woman be fair and delicately shape the country produce plenty of ginger and galingal and great abundance of silk and cotton i be tell but see they not that they have hen without feather hairy like cat which yet lay egg and be good to eat -lrb- 16 -rrb- in this part of the country there be many lion which make the way very dangerous after three day journey we arrive in a populous country inhabit by idolater who make great quantity of silk stuff the chief city be unguem near which abundance of sugar be produce and send from thence to cambalu before the reduction of this country by the great khan the inhabitant of this country could only manufacture a bad kind of sugar by boil down the juice of the cane into a black paste but certain inhabitant from _ babylonium _ teach they refine it by means of the ash of a certain tree -lrb- 17 -rrb- fifteen mile farther be the city of cangiu still in the province of concha and here the khan have always a army in readiness for keep the country under subjection through this city there run a river of a mile broad with handsome building on both side and the river be constantly cover with vessel carry sugar and other goods this river disembogue itself at the distance of five day journey south-east from cangiu into the sea at zaitum all the country between be extremely pleasant and abound in tree and shrub of camphor zaitum be a famous port and much frequent by ship with rich cargo from indium for the supply of mangus and kathay and from this port the production of these region be disperse all over indium at this port such quantity of pepper be import that what come through alexandrium into we western world be not to be compare to it be hardly a hundredth part the concourse of merchant to this famous emporium be incredible as it be one of the most commodious port in the whole world and be exceedingly productive in revenue to the great khan who receive ten in the hundred of all merchandize the merchant pay likewise so high for freight that not above a half of they cargo remain to themselves for sale and yet of that moiety they make immense profit the inhabitant of zaitum be idolater and much give to pleasure and in it there be many artizan employ in embroidery and arras-work -lrb- 18 -rrb- this river be large wide and swift one arm of it reach to quinsaus and the other to zaitum -lrb- 19 -rrb- and at the parting of these branch the city of tringuus be situate where porcelain dish be make -lrb- 20 -rrb- i be tell of a certain earth which be cast up into conical heap and leave expose to the weather for thirty or forty year without stir after which refine by time it be make into dish which be paint and baked in furnace and so cheap be this manufacture that eight of these dish may be buy for one venetian groat -lrb- 21 -rrb- from this province of concha the great khan derive nearly as great a revenue as he do from quinsaus in these two province i travel but in none of die other province of mangus in all of which one language be use with considerable variety in dialect and but one kind of writing -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be two chinese measure call li of the greater there be 200 to a degree of latitude and of the smaller 250 it be possible that marco may have mistake one or other of these measure for mile either of which supposition would reduce the bound of quinsaus to some decent moderation be thirty-four mile for the greater and twenty-seven mile for the smaller li yet a large city on even the latter substitution koan-sing which may likewise be write quan - sing all chinese name in alphabetical character be quite of arbitrary orthography be the only place which can be suppose the same with quinsaus but similarity of sound be a very uncertain guide from other circumstance in the text the modern kua-hing may have once be quinsay -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- calculate by li this extent will be reduce to eleven or thirteen mile -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- by the same reduction these square will be reduce to half a quarter of a mile in the side -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- probably a mistaken translation or transcription for melon pumpkin or gourd -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- this amount to more than one sixth of a ounce daily for a population of a million include infant a thing utterly incredible and which must arise from some corruption of the text it exceed 9000 ton yearly perhaps instead of _ pepper _ the original have _ salt _ -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- this alone would give a work population exceed a million include the woman child and aged belong to these but populous as the country certainly be the chinese in all age from polo down to staunton have impose those ridiculously exaggerated account upon all inquisitive traveller this subject will be discuss in that division of this work which particularly relate to china -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- the contrast between the cleanness and splendor of quinsay and the gloomy dirt of european city in the thirteenth century be very striking china then enjoy hackney coach tea garden and hilarity while the delight of european capital be procession of monk among perpetual dunghill in narrow crooked lane -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- probably mean a gong -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- there must be some corruption in the text here for even chinese exaggeration could hardly venture upon this computation which would extend the garrison in mangus alone to many million -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- if li from 2-1\/2 to 3-1\/2 mile -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- suppose kua-hing to have be quan-sai no city appear in the direction indicate in the text for the situation of gampu but if we might venture to suppose north-east a error for south the city of hanfcheou be nearly at the distance mention by marco and stand at the bottom of a deep bay of the ocean in a very convenient situation for trade communicate with kua-hing by the great canal -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- multiply this number of family by five would give a population of eight million of individual of every age and sex fortunately marco permit we to suppose that this population belong to the viceroyalty or province over which quinsaus preside -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- either this computation or that of the duty on salt be erroneous if 8 toman be 6400000 ducat 210 toman would amount to 168000000 instead of the sum in the text if the latter computation be right 16800000 ducat from 210 toman the duty on salt or 8 toman ought only to have be 640000 ducat which appear to be the truth the whole revenue therefore of the province will be 17440000 ducat equal to l 2911250 sterling at 3 7d the ducat -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- besides the utter discrepancy of these name to those of any city now in china it appear obvious that the direction of the itinerary in the text be erroneous or corrupted we have be already on the ocean or bay of nankin the eastern boundary of china and of the land yet the text persist continually to travel _ south-east _ which be impossible the direction of the itinerary must have be westwards probably south-west -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- this be probably turmeric so much use in the eastern cookery though it be the root which be employ -- e -lrb- 16 -rrb- obviously what be now call friesland but more properly frizzle hen -- e -lrb- 17 -rrb- in the manufacture of sugar it be necessary to neutralize a certain redundant acid in the juice of the cane by a fit proportion of some alkaline ingredient to enable the sugar to crystallize : the ordinary _ temper _ as it be call for this purpose in the west indy be lime but any alkali will produce nearly the same effect this subject will be fully elucidate in that part of we work which be peculiarly appropriate to the sugar colony in the west indy -- e -lrb- 18 -rrb- there can hardly be a doubt that the zaiturn of marco be the modern canton yet from the cause already mention in several note it be next to a impossibility to trace the route or itinerary from quinsaus to this place -- e -lrb- 19 -rrb- this be a obvious error corruption or interpolation for on no conceivable hypothesis of the situation of quinsaus and zaitum can any river be find in china which answer to this description -- e -lrb- 20 -rrb- this be the only hint in marco of the peculiarly famous manufacture of china from which all the best _ earthen ware _ of europe have acquire this name as _ par excellence _ from this circumstance and from the fame of nankin for this manufacture i strongly suspect that this passage have be foist in by some ignorant or careless editor in a wrong place -- e -lrb- 21 -rrb- it be singular that marco should make no mention whatever of the peculiar beverage of the chinese _ tea _ though particularly describe both in name and use by the mahometan traveller in the _ ninth _ century four hundred year earlier as use in all the city of china -- e section xvii _ of the island of zipangu and of the unsuccessful attempt make by the tartar for its conquest _ i shall now leave the country of mangus and proceed to discourse of indium the greater the middle and lesser in which i have be both in the service of the great khan and also on we return

attend by two or three of a smaller size able to carry a thousand bag of pepper and have sixty mariner in each and these smaller ship be sometimes employ to tow the greater vessel each of the larger ship hare ten small boat for fishing and other service which be fasten aloft on they side and let down when want for use after have be employ for a year these ship be sheathe all over so that they then have three course of board : and they proceed in this manner till they sometimes hare six course alter which they be break up zipangu -lrb- 2 -rrb- be a very large island on the east and fifteen hundred mile distant from the shore of mangus the people of this island be of a white complexion and of gentle manners and have a king of they own they have gold in great plenty as jew merchant report

barley bread the wood of this tree be so heavy as to sink in water like iron and of it they make excellent lance but be very heavy they be under the necessity of make they short these be harden in the fire and sharpen and when so prepared they will pierce through armor easier than if make of iron about 150 mile to the northward of lambrus there be two island one call nocueran and the other angaman -lrb- l5 -rrb- in the former of which the inhabitant live like beast and go entirely naked but have excellent tree such as clove red and white sander coco-nut brazil and various spice in the other island the inhabitant be equally savage and be say to have the head and tooth of dog -lrb- 1 -rrb- probably the gulph of siam -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- south-west certainly -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- the inland in the gulf of siam be small and not numerous so that the passage be probably corrupt and may have be in the original that leave the gulf of cheinan on the north they leave infinite island & c on the south after all the gulf of cheinan may mean the whole sea of china -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- it be difficult to say precisely what division of farther indium be here mean by ziambar 1500 mile would carry we to the coast of malaya but 1500 li or about 500 mile reach only to the coast of cochin-china or it may be tsiompa ziambar in the edition be variously write ciambau ciariban and ziambar -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the direction of the voyage be here obviously erroneous it must have be between the south and the south-west or south-south-west in the trevigus edition the java of this part of we text be lava and accord to valentine lava be the name of the principal city and kingdom in borneo which at all event must be the island here mention by marco -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- accord to the trevigus edition as report by pinkerton these island be only seven mile from lava or borneo at about seventy mile distance to the south-west there be two island name carema and soorooto which may be those mention in the text -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- call lochach in some of the edition and say to be 200 mile from sondor and condur whether this may be ma-lacca or ma-laya it be impossible to determine -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- in the trevigus edition only five mile and the island be call pentara this may possibly be the island of bintang in the south-eastern entrance of the strait of malacca -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- most probably the kingdom of malacca from the trevigus edition pinkerton call this malonir and curiously identify pepetam pentara or pentan as the name of the city and kingdom of malonir or malaiur -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- if right in we former conjecture the island speak of in the text must be sumatra not that now call java indeed the mention immediately afterwards of the island of nocueran and angaman 150 mile to the north which can only he the nicobar and andaman island establish the identity of java-minor here call java the less and sumatra -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- the animal here describe under the name of unicorn be the rhinoceros monocero or one-horned rhinoceros of naturalist but the single horn be place a little above the nose not on the middle of the forehead as here erroneously describe by marco -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- he have evidently miss the monsoon and have to await its return from this kingdom or division of the island it probably acquire the name of sumatra by which it be know in modern geography from the circumstance in the text of not see the great bear it be probable that marco be stop near the south-eastern extremity of the island what be here translate the great bear pinkerton call from the trevigus edition _ del maistro _ the polar star be invisible of course -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- call deragolum by pinkerton from the trevigus edition -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- he here distinctly

sable and various other animal produce fine fur which the tartar be very skilful in take this country abound in great lake which be freeze over except for a few month in every year and in summer it be hardly possible to travel on account of marsh and water for which reason the merchant who go to buy fur and who have to travel for fourteen day through the desert have wooden house at the end of each

grape and raisin which be there more plentiful in my opinion than in any other part of the world it be one of the principal city in all persium and its saracen inhabitant allege that no christian can live there above a year continue we journey forwards for many day i come to a city name comum -lrb- 8 -rrb- which be a great city in old time near fifty mile in circumference and often do much damage to the roman in this place there be stately palace now destitute of inhabitant yet it have abundance of provision travel from thence through many country i come at length into the land of job name we -lrb- 9 -rrb- which border on the north of chaldea this land be full of all kind of provision and manna be here find in great abundance four partridge be sell here for less than a italian groat and the mountain have excellent pasture for cattle in this country the man card and spin and not the woman and the old man be very comely -lrb- 1 -rrb- perhaps the sea of marmora or it may indicate the euxine or black sea -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the holy traveller ought rather to have say that the spring or rivulet near azaron flow into the euphrate azaron be obviously erzerum on or near one of the higher branch of the frat or euphrate -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- tebriz in persium -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- sultanium or sultanie -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the caspian so call in this place from baku or baccou a city on its bank in the province of shirvan -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- oderic must have make a mistake here as casbin be not above seventy or eighty mile from sultanie and the journey of the caravan between these city could not have exceed four or five day -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- yezd about 500 mile east from ispahan -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- this be obviously the city of kom or koom above 400 mile to the north-west of yezd and much nearer sultanie we traveller therefore must either have strangely forget he route or he come back again from yezd instead of journey forwards -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- khus or khosistan the south-western province of persium -- e section ii _ of the manners of the chaldean and concern indium _ from thence i travel into chaldea which be a great kingdom have a language peculiar to itself

but the woman be ugly and deform and be clothe in coarse shift only reach to they knee with long sleeve hang down to the ground and breeches or trowser which likewise reach the ground but they foot be bare they wear no head-dress and they hair hang neglect and dishevel about they ear there be many other strange thing to be see in this country from thence i travel into the lower indium which be overrun and lay waste by the tartar -lrb- 1 -rrb- in this country the people subsist chiefly on date forty-two pound weight of which may be purchase for less than a venetian groat travel on for many day i arrive at ormus on the main ocean which be a well fortified city have great store of merchandize and treasure the heat of this country be excessive and constrain the people to make use of extraordinary expedient to preserve they life -lrb- 2 -rrb- in this place they ship or bark be call _ jase _ the plank of which be sew together with hemp embarking in one of these vessel in which i could find no iron whatever i arrive in twenty-eight day sail at thana -lrb- 3 -rrb- in which place four of we friar suffer martyrdom for the christian faith this country be well situate for trade and have abundance of bread and wine and of all other article necessary for the food of man the kingdom in ancient time be very large and populous and be under the dominion of king porus who fight a great battle with alexander the macedonian conqueror the inhabitant be idolater worship the fire and likewise pay divine honor to serpent and even to tree the saracen have conquer the whole of this land and be themselves under subjection to king daldilus -lrb- 4 -rrb- in this country there be great number of black lion ape and monky be also very numerous and they bat be as large as we pigeon they have rat also as large as the dog in italy which be hunt by means of dog as cat be unable to cope with they in this country every one have a bundle of great bough of tree as large as a pillar standing in a pot of water before the door and there be many other strange and wonderful novelty a relation of which would be exceedingly delightful -lrb- 1 -rrb- by lower indium we author seem here to indicate the southern province of persium -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- tantus est calor quod virilia hominum exeunt corpus et descendant usque at mediam tibiarum : ideo faciunt unctionum et ungunt illa et in quibusdam

translate from the venetian or friul dialect of oderic into monkish latin and may have be originally _ il re dal deli _ or the king of delhus -- e section iii _ of the martyrdom of the friar _ -lrb- l -rrb- four of we friar tolentinus de marchia jame of padua demetrius a lay brother and peter de seni suffer martyrdom in the city of thana these friar have engage for they passage at ormus to polumbrum but be forcibly carry to thana where there be fifteen house of christian schismatic of the nestorian communion and on they arrival they be hospitably entertain in one of these house a strife happen to take place between the man of that house and he wife in which the man beat he wife severely she complain to the kadi who interrogate she how she could prove she assertion on which she answer that there be four priest of the frank who be present and could attest the bad usage she have receive on this a person of alexandrium who be present request of the kadi that these man might be send for since they be learn man versant in the scripture and it would be right to dispute with they concern the faith we friar be accordingly send for and leave peter to take charge of they goods the other three go to the kadi who begin to dispute with they concern we faith say that christ be a mere man and not god but friar thoma -lrb- 2 -rrb- shew evidently both from reason and by example draw from scripture that christ be really god and man and so confound the kadus and the other infidel that they be unable to produce any rational argument in contradiction to he on this some one exclaim and what do you say concern mahomet to this friar thoma reply since i have prove to you that christ be really god and man who have give the law to mankind and since mahomet set himself contrary thereto and teach a opposite law if ye be wise you may well know what ought to be conclude respect he but the kadus and the other saracen insist that he should declare he own opinion concern mahomet you may all see say he what must be my opinion and as you insist that i should speak out plainly i must declare that you mahomet be the son of perdition and be in hell with he father the devil and not he only but all who have hold he law which be entirely abominable and false contrary to god and adverse to the salvation of soul on hearing this the saracen cry out let he die let he die who have thus blaspheme against the prophet then they seize upon the friar and expose they to the burning sun that they might suffer a severe death by the adust heat of the sun ray : for such be the excessive heat of the sun in that place that any person who remain expose to its direct influence during the time necessary to say the mass be sure to die but the friar remain hale and joyful from the third to the ninth hour of the day praise and glorify the lord the saracen astonish at this come to the friar say we intend to make a large fire and to throw you therein and if you faith be true as you say the fire will not be able to burn you but if you be burnt it will plainly appear that you faith be false to this the friar answer that they be ready to endure chain and imprisonment and even the fire and all other torment for the faith but should the fire consume they it be not to be infer that it do so on account of they faith but as a punishment for they sin : declare that they faith be most true and perfect and the only one by which the soul of man could possibly be save while they thus determine upon burn the friar the report of this affair spread over the whole city and all the people of both sex young and old flock to behold the spectacle the friar be accordingly lead to the most public square of the city where a great fire be light up into which friar thoma endeavor to throw himself but a saracen hold he back say : you shall not do so old man as you may have some spell or contrivance about you for prevent the fire from hurt you and you must allow another of you people to go into the fire then four of the saracen seize upon friar jame intend to have throw he into the fire but he request permission to walk in of he own accord to shew he devotion to the faith this however they refuse and throw he in headlong the fire be so large and fierce that he could not be see yet he voice be hear from the midst of the flame call upon the name of the glorious virgin when the fire be totally consume friar jame be see standing on the ember unhurt and joyful with he hand raise to heaven in form of the cross and himself praise and glorify god who have thus manifest the greatness of he faith and nothing whatever about he person not even he clothes or he hair be find in the slightest degree injure by the fire upon this all the people begin to cry aloud they be holy they be holy it be sinful to do they any injury for we see now that they faith be good and holy to this the kadi object say that he be not holy notwithstanding he remain unhurt amid the fire but that he tunic be fabricate from the wool of the land of habraa have protect he : that he ought therefore to be throw naked into the fire and they should then see whether or not he would be consume after this the wicked saracen by direction of the kadi make a fire twice as large as the former and have strip jame quite naked they wash he body and anoint he abundantly with oil besides pour a great quantity of oil upon the faggot which compose the fire and when the fire be fully kindle they throw friar jame into the midst friar thoma and demetrius retire from among the people remain on they knee pray to god with many tear friar jame however come a second time unhurt from the fire and the people again cry out that it be sinful to injure these holy man upon this the melich or governor of the city call friar jame to he presence and cause he to put on he garment say to the friar we see brother that by the grace of god ye have suffer no harm from we : wherefore we be convince that ye be holy man and that you faith be good and true we advise you to take yourselve away out of this land as quickly as possible as the kadi will do he utmost to destroy you because you have confound he argument at this time likewise the people be full of astonishment and admiration of what they have see and be so fill with wonder at the miracle that they know not what to believe or how to conduct themselves the melich order the three friar to be carry across a small arm of the sea into a village at a moderate distance from the city where he order they to be lodge in the house of a idolater afterwards the kadi go to the melich and represent to he that the law of mahomet would be overthrow if these people be allow to live he observe farther that by the precept of mahomet in the alcoran it be declare that any one who slew a christian acquire as much merit by that action as by the pilgrimage to mecca then say the melich unto he go thy way and do what thou wilt whereupon the kadi take four armed man whom he direct to go and slay the friar these man cross over the water while it be night but be then unable to find the friar in the meantime the melich cause all the christian in the city to be take up and throw into prison in the middle of the night the three friar rise up to say matins and be then discover by the four armed saracen they be drag out of the village to a place beneath a certain tree where they thus address we friar : know ye that we be order by the kadi and the melich to slay you which we be very unwilling to do as you be good and holy man but we dare not refuse as we and we wife and child would be put to death then answer the friar do ye even as you have be command that by a temporal death we may gain eternal life since for the love of we lord jesus christ who be crucify and die for we and in honor of we faith in he holy gospel we be prepared willingly to suffer every kind of torment and even death itself a christian man who have join company with the friar reason much with the four armed saracen declare if he have a sword he would either defend these holy man from death or would die along with they then the armed man cause the friar to take off they garment and friar thoma on he knee and with he arm fold in form of the cross have he head smite off friar jame have he head divide to the eye by the first blow and by a second he head be sever from he body they wound friar demetrius at first in the breast and then cut off he head in the moment of the martyrdom of these holy man the moon shine out with unusual splendor and the night become so exceedingly light that all admire greatly : after which it suddenly become excessively dark with great thunder and lightning and violent coruscation so that all expect to be destroy and the ship which ought to have carry away the friar be sink with all on board so that no tiding of it be ever hear afterwards in the morning the kadi send to take possession of the goods belong to the friar and then friar peter de senlis who have be leave in charge of the goods be find and carry before the kadi who together with the other saracen promise he great thing if he would renounce the christian faith and conform to the law of mahomet but friar peter scorn all they offer and deride they : whereupon they inflict every species of torment upon he from morning until mid-day which he bear with patience and constancy in the faith continually praise god and hold out the belief in mahomet to scorn and contempt the saracen then hang he up on a tree and see that he bear this unhurt from the ninth hour till evening they cut he in two in the morning after when they come to look for he body no part of it be to be find it be afterwards reveal to a person worthy of credit that god have hide he body for a season until he should be please to manifest the body of he saint and should shew the soul of the saint rejoice together with god and he angel and the saint in bliss on the night follow the martyrdom of these holy friar they appear to the melich in a vision glorious and resplendent like the noon-day sun each hold a sword on high in a menacing posture as if about to stab or cut he in piece in horror at the sight he cry out aloud to the great terror of he family to whom he say that these rabbi of the frank whom he have order to be slay have come upon he with sword to slay he the melich likewise send for the kadi to whom he communicate he vision seek advice and consolation as he fear to be slay by the martyr and the kadi advise he to give large alms to they brethren if he would escape from the hand of those whom he have slay then the melich send for the christian whom he have throw into prison from whom he beg forgiveness for what he have do promising henceforward to be they companion and brother and he ordain that if any person in future should injure a christian he should suffer death and send away the christian unhurt each man to he home the melich cause four mosque or chapel to be build in honor of the four martyr and appoint saracen priest to officiate in they when the emperor dodsus -lrb- 3 -rrb- hear of the slaughter of the four friar he order the melich to be bring bind before he and question he why he have cruelly order these man to be slay the melich endeavor to justify himself by represent that they have exert themselves to subvert the law of mahomet against whom they have speak blasphemously the emperor thus address he o most cruel dog when you have see how the almighty god have twice deliver they from the flame how dare you thus cruelly to put they to death and the emperor order the melich and all he family to be cut in two sentence he to the same death which he have inflict on the holy friar on these thing come to the knowledge of the kadi he flee out of the land and even quit the dominion of the emperor and so escape the punishment he have so justly merit -lrb- 1 -rrb- the whole of this and the follow section be omit in the old english of hakluyt and be here translate from the latin -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- probably he who be name above tolentinus -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- probably the same call at the close of the former section daldili and there conjecturally explain as the king of delhus -- e section iv _ of the miracle perform by the four martyr _ it be not the custom in that country to commit the body of they dead to the grave but they be expose in the field that they may be consume by the heat of the sun but after the body of these martyr have remain fourteen day expose to the sun they remain as fresh and uncorrupted as on the day of they martyrdom on this be see by the christian who inhabit the land they bury the body with great reverence when i oderic hear of the circumstance attend the death of these martyr i go to the place and dig up they body and have collect all they body into beautiful _ towallia _ i carry they with I into upper indium to a certain place assist by a companion and a servant while we be on we way we rest in the house of a hospitable person and place the bone at my head i go to sleep and while i be asleep the house be suddenly set on fire by the saracen that i might be burnt therein my companion and servant make they escape leave I and the bone in the burning house see the fire above and all around I i take up the bone and withdraw with they into one of the angle of the house whence i see all the other three corner on fire while i remain safe along with the bone so long as i remain there with the bone the fire keep itself above my head like lucid air but the moment that i go out with the bone the whole of that place where i have stand be envelop in the flame and many other surround building be likewise burnt to the ground another miracle happen as i be go by sea with the bone to the city of polumbrum where pepper grow in great abundance when the wind totally fail we on this occasion the idolater begin to pray to they god for a favourable wind but which they be unable to attain then the saracen industriously make they invocation and adoration to as little purpose after this i and my companion be order to pray to we god and the commander of the ship say to I in the armenian language which the rest of the people on board do not understand that unless we could procure a favourable wind from we god he would throw both we and the bone into the sea then i and my companion go to we prayer and we vow to celebrate many mass in honor of the holy virgin if she would vouchsafe we a wind but as the time pass on and no wind come i give one of the bone to we servant whom i order to go to the head of the ship and cast the bone into the sea which he have no sooner do than a favourable gale spring up which never again fail we till we have arrive at we destine port in safety owe entirely to the merit of these holy martyr we then embark in another ship on purpose to sail to the higher indium and we arrive at a certain city name carchan in which there be two house of the brethren of we order and we intend to have deposit these holy relic in that place there be in that ship above 700 merchant and other and the idolater have a custom that always before they go into port they search the whole ship carefully for the bone of dead animal which they throw into the sea thinking by that mean the more readily to reach the harbor and to escape the danger of death but though they search frequently and carefully and even often touch the bone of the martyr they eye be always delude so that they could not perceive they : and thus we bring they reverently to the dwelling of we brethren where they rest in peace and where god continually work miracle by they means among the idolater when any one labor under heavy sickness they go to the place where the body of the martyr be deposit and take some of the earth it be mixed among water which be drink by the diseased person who be thus free from they infirmity section v _ of the place where pepper grow and in what manner it be procure _ pepper grow in the kingdom of minibar -lrb- malabar -rrb- where it be more plentiful than in any other part of the world be find abundantly in that country in a forest which extend for eighteen day journey in circuit in the wood or forest there be two city name flandrina and cyncus lim -lrb- 1 -rrb- flandrina be inhabit both by jew and christian who be often engage in quarrel and even in war in which the christian be always victorious in this forest which we have mention the plant which produce the pepper be plant near the large tree as we plant vine in italy it grow with numerous leaf like we pot herb and climb up the tree produce the pepper in cluster like we grape when these be ripe they be of a green color and be gather be lay in the sun to dry after which they be put into earthen vessel for sale in this forest there be many river have great number of crocodile and serpent and the native make large fire of straw and other dry fuel at the proper season for gather the pepper that they may do so without danger from these noxious animal at one end of this forest the city of polumbrum be situate which abound in all kind of merchandize the inhabitant of that country worship a living ox as they god which be make to labor in husbandry for six year and in he seventh year he be consecrate as holy and be no more allow to work with this strange animal god they use the follow strange ceremony : every morning they take two bason of silver or gold in one of which they collect the urine of the holy ox and he dung in the other and the devotee wash they face eye and all they five sens in the urine and anoint they eye cheek and breast with the dung after which they consider themselves sanctify for the whole of that day and even the king and queen of the country use this absurd superstition they worship a idol also which resemble a man from the navel upward all below be in the likeness of a ox and this idol deliver oracle as they believe and sometimes require the sacrifice of forty virgin on this account the people consecrate they son and daughter to the idol even as we christian dedicate we son and daughter to some particular order of religion or to some of the saint in heaven they even sacrifice they son and daughter so that many be put to death in honor of this accursed idol and they commit many other abominable and beastly action and i see many other strange thing among they which i refrain from relate -lrb- 2 -rrb- this nation have another most abominable custom that when a man die he body be burn to ash and he living wife be burn along with he that she may assist she husband in he trade or husbandry in the next world yet if she have child by she husband she may remain alive with they if so inclined without shame or reproach yet most of they prefer to be burn with the body of they husband but husband be not influence by any similar law as when they lose they wife they may marry again there be some other strange custom among the people of this country insomuch that the woman drink wine which the man do not and the woman shave they eyebrow and eyelid and they beard besides many other filthy custom contrary to the true decorum of the sex from that country i travel ten day journey to another kingdom call moabar -lrb- 3 -rrb- in which there be many city and in a certain church of that country the body of st thoma the apostle lie bury which church be full of idol and round about it there be fifteen house inhabit by nestorian priest who be bad christian and false schismatic -lrb- 1 -rrb- the name of these city or town in the pepper country of malabar which be call minibar in the text be so thoroughly corrupt that no conjectural criticism can discover they in we modern map hakluyt on the margin correct flandrina by a equally unknown alandrina they may possibly refer to place now fall into ruin in the kingdom or province of travancore which have always be a great mart of pepper -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- friar oderic appear only to have observe the superstition in the southern part of indium very superficially if at all and as many opportunity will occur in the course of this collection for explain the strange belief custom and ceremony of the braminical worship it have not be think necessary to discuss these in note on the present occasion -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- hakluyt have explain moabar on the margin by maliassor or meliassor the country here indicate be obviously the carnatic or kingdom of arcot of modern time from the circumstance of contain the shrine of st thoma the idol mention by oderic as fill the church of st thoma be probably nestorian image not sanction by the roman ritual -- e section vi _ of a strange idol and of certain custom and ceremony _ in the kingdom of moabar there be a wonderful idol in the shape of a man all of pure and polished gold as large as we image of st christopher and there hang about its neck a string of most rich and precious stone some of which be singly more valuable than the riches of a entire kingdom the whole house in which this idol be preserve be all of beaten gold even the roof the pavement and the lining of the wall both within and without -lrb- 1 -rrb- the indian go on pilgrimage to this idol just as we do to the image of st peter some have halter round they neck some with they hand bind behind they back and other with knife stick in various part of they leg and arm and if the flesh of they wounded limb should corrupt owe to these wound they believe that they god be well please with they and ever after esteem the diseased limb as sacred near this great idol temple there be a artificial lake of water in a open place into which the pilgrim and devotee cast gold and silver and precious stone in honor of the idol and as a fund for repair the temple and when any new ornament be to be make or any repair be require the priest take what be want from the oblation that be throw into this lake at each annual festival of this idol the king and queen of the country with all the pilgrim and the whole multitude of the people assemble at the temple and place the idol on a rich and splendid chariot they carry it from the temple with song and all kind of musical instrument have a great company of young woman who walk in procession two and two singing before the idol many of the pilgrim throw themselves under the chariot wheel that they may be crush to death in honor of they god and the body of these devotee be afterwards burn and they ash collect as of holy martyr in this manner above 500 person annually devote themselves to death sometimes a man devote himself to die in honor of this abominable idol on which occasion accompany by he relation and friend and by a great company of musician he make a solemn feast after which he hang five sharp knife around he neck and go in solemn procession before the idol where he take four of the knife successively with each of which he cut off a piece of he own flesh which he throw to the idol say that for the worship of he god he thus cut himself then take the last of the knife he declare aloud that he be go to put himself to death in honor of the god on utter which he execute he vile purpose he body be then burn with great solemnity and he be ever after esteem as a holy person the king of this country have vast treasure in gold and silver and precious stone and possess the largest and fairest pearl that be to be see in the whole world leave this country i travel fifty day journey to the southward along the shore of the ocean when i come to a country call lamourus -lrb- 2 -rrb- in which owe to the extreme heat the whole inhabitant go stark naked both man and woman and they deride I for wear clothes say that adam and eve be create naked in this country the woman be all common so that no one have a wife and when a child be bear the mother give it to any of the man she please who may have be connect with she the whole of the land likewise be possess in common but everyone have he own house human flesh if fat be use as commonly in that country as beef with we and though the manners and custom of the people be most abominable the country be excellent and abound in flesh and corn gold and silver aloes-wood and camphor and many other precious commodity merchant who trade to this country usually bring with they fat man among they other commodity which they sell to the native as we do hog and these be immediately slay and devour in this region toward the south there be a island or kingdom call symolora -lrb- 3 -rrb- where both the man and woman mark themselves with a hot iron in twelve different part of they face -lrb- 4 -rrb- and this nation be continually at war with a certain naked people in another region i then go to another island name java the coast of which be 3000 mile in circuit and the king of java have seven other king under he supreme dominion this be think to be one of the largest island in the world and be thoroughly inhabit have great plenty of clove cubeb and nutmeg and all other kind of spice and great abundance of provision of all kind except wine the king of java have a large and sumptuous palace the most lofty of any that i have see with broad and lofty stair to ascend to the upper apartment all the step be alternately of gold and silver the whole interior wall be line with plate of beaten gold on which the image of warrior be place sculptured in gold have each a golden coronet richly ornamented with precious stone the roof of this palace be of pure gold and all the lower room be pave with alternate square plate of gold and silver the great khan or emperor of cathay have have many war with the king of java but have always be vanquish and beat back -lrb- 1 -rrb- more recent and more accurate traveller have inform we that this profusion of gold on the idol and temple of the buddist especially be only rich gilding -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this seem properly enough correct on the margin by hakluyt by the word comorus or the country about cape comorin -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- simoltra or sumatra -- hakluyt -lrb- 4 -rrb- probably allude to tatoo which will be explain in the voyage to the island of the pacific ocean -- e section vii _ of certain tree which produce meal honey wine and poison _ near to java be another country call panten or tathalmasin -lrb- 1 -rrb- the king of which have many island under he dominion in this country there be tree which produce meal honey and wine and likewise the most deadly poison in the world the only remedy for which be human ordure dissolve in water which drink in considerable quantify act as a cathartic and expel the poison these tree be very large and when cut down a quantity of liquor exude from the trunk which be receive into bag make of leaf and after exposure for fifteen day to the sun it harden into meal this be first steep in sea water and be afterwards wash in fresh water when it become a savoury paste which may either be eat as bread or cook in various way -lrb- 2 -rrb- i have eat of this bread which be fair on the outside and somewhat brown within beyond this country the _ mare mortuum _ or dead sea -lrb- 3 -rrb- stretch with a continual current far to the south and whatever fall into it be see no more in this country there grow cane of a incredible length as large as tree even sixty pace or more in height there be other cane call _ cassan _ which spread over the earth like grass even to the extent of a mile send up branch from every knot and in these cane they find certain stone of wonderful virtue insomuch that whoever carry one of these about he can not be wound by a iron weapon on which account most of the man in that country carry such stone always about they many of the people of this country cause one of the arm of they child to be cut open when young put one of these stone into the wound which they heal up by means of the powder of a certain fish with the name of which i be unacquainted and through the virtue of these wonderful stone the native be generally victorious in they war both by sea and land there be a stratagem however which they enemy often successfully use against they to counteract the power of these stone provide themselves with iron or steel armor to defend they from the arrow of these people they use wooden stake point like weapon of iron and arrow not have iron head but infuse with poison which they extract from certain tree and they thus slay some of they foe who trust to the virtue of these stone wear no defensive armor from the cane formerly mention name cassan they build themselves small house and manufacture sail for they ship and many other thing be make from they from thence after many day travel i come to another kingdom call campa -lrb- 4 -rrb- which be a very rich and beautiful kingdom abound in all kind of provision the king who reign at the time of my be there have so many wife and concubine that he have three hundred son

possible the river banjar and the port of masseen otherwise call bendermassin or banjar-massin in the great island of borneo may be here indicate panten petan or perhaps bentam be perhaps a small woody island mention by marco polo near great java or borneo the name of place however in these early traveller have be so confound by ignorant transcriber as often to defy all criticism -- e -lrb- 2

e section viii _ of vast multitude of fish which throw themselves on the dry land _ the follow most wonderful circumstance be to be observe in this country of siampa all the kind of fish which

prognosticate priest request he to inquire of he god whether or not he father be to recover then both go to a idol of gold or silver which they thus address : we adore thee as we lord and god and we beseech thee to inform we whether such a man be to die or to recover from he present infirmity then the devil return a answer from the idol and if he say the man be to recover the son return to the

immediately strangle he after this the dead body be cut in piece and all the friend and relation be invite to feast upon this horrible banquet which be accompany with music and all manner of mirth but the bone be solemnly bury on my blame this abominable practice they allege as its reason and excuse that it be do to prevent the worm from devour the flesh which would occasion great torment to he

province of mancy _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- after sail for many day on the ocean towards the east i arrive at the great province of mancy or mangus which be call indium by the latin and i be inform by christian saracen and idolater and by many person in office under the great khan that this country contain more than 2000 great city and that it abound in all manner of provision as bread wine rice flesh and

afterwards carry away and eat up by the priest -lrb- 1 -rrb- otherwise mangus or southern china -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this place which on the margin be correct by the equally unknown name of ceuskalum be probably canton but have endeavor to explain the distorted name of place in china in the travels of marco polo it be unnecessary to resume the almost impossible task in these much less interesting and perhaps fabricate travels of oderic -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- oderic here mean pelican call alca-trarzi by the spaniard -- hakluyt -lrb- 4 -rrb- call in p 404 carchan -- e section xi _ of the city of fuko or

instead of feather this be a stately and most beautiful city and standeth on the sea travel onward for eighteen day i pass through many province and city and in my way i pass over a certain great mountain on one side of which all live creature be quite black whereas on the other side all be as white as snow and the inhabitant of the two side of the mountain differ exceedingly from each other in they manners and custom in these part all the married woman wear a large tire or cap of horn like a small barrel on they head as a mark that they have husband journey onward for other eighteen day

arm certain diving bird bind to pole and he tie a thread about every one of they neck lest they might swallow the fish they be to catch he carry likewise three large basket to the river side he then loose he diver from the pole on which they go into the water and in less than a hour they catch as many fish as fill the three basket mine host then untie the thread from they neck and send they again into the water where they feed themselves with fish and when satisfy they return to they master allow themselves to be fasten to the pole as before i eat of these fish and find they very good travel thence many day i come to another city name canasium -lrb- 1 -rrb- which signify in they language the city of heaven i never see so great a city for it be a hundred mile in circumference and every part of it be thoroughly inhabit yea many of its house be ten or even twelve story high it have many large suburb which contain more inhabitant than even the city itself there be twelve principal gate and at the distance of about eight mile from every one of these there be a large city each of they larger in my opinion than venice or padua the city of canasium be situate among water or lake which be always stagnant without flux or reflux and it be defend against the violence of the wind in the same manner as venice in this city there be more than 10002 bridge -lrb- 2 -rrb- many of which i

the number of bridge be extend to 11000 -- hakluyt -lrb- 3 -rrb- this enumeration would give 890000 fire or almost ten million of household which at four person to each would produce a aggregate

western part of the earth be on he way to cambalu to pray for the life of the great khan and you must shew he some rare thing that he may be able to say on he return to he own country what strange and novel sight he have behold in we city of quinsay then the priest take two great basket full of broken victuals and lead I to a small walled inclosure of which he have the key the door of which he unlock and we go into a pleasant green plot in which stand a small hillock like a steeple all adorn with fragrant herb and tree he then beat upon a cymbal at the sound of which many animal of various

down the broken victuals for they to eat and when they have eat he ring again upon he cymbal and they all return to they place of abode wonder greatly at this strange sight this man inform I that these creature be animated by the soul of depart person of rank and that they be feed by he and he brethren out of love for the god that govern the world he add that when a man be noble in this life he soul enter after death into the body of some excellent beast while the soul of the deceased common rude people possess the body of vile animal i then endeavor to refute that gross error but my

about to certain tavern or cook shop inform each of the landlord that such and such of he friend be to come there for entertainment in he name and that he will allow a certain sum for the banquet by this mean he friend be better entertain in diver place than if all have be collect into one ten mile from the city of janzu and at the mouth of the river thalay there be another city name montu which have a greater number of ship than i ever see in any part of the world all the ship be white as snow and have banquett house in they and there be many other rare and wonderful thing that no one would

multitude but they mostly return soon again to they idol on which account the friar have continually to abide among they to exhort and instruct they in the faith i see another terrible thing in those part pass by a certain valley near a pleasant river i see many dead body therein and i hear issue therefrom many sweet and harmonious musical sound especially of lute insomuch that i be much amaze this valley be at least seven or eight mile long into which whoever enter be sure to die immediately for which cause all who travel by that way pass by on one side no one be able to travel through that valley and live but i be curious to go in that i might see what it contain make therefore my prayer and recommend myself to god i enter in and see such vast quantity of dead body as no one would believe unless he have see they with he own eye at one side of the valley i see the visage of a man upon a stone which stare at I with such a hideous aspect that i think to have die on the spot but i cease not to sign myself with the sign of the cross continually say the word become flesh and dwelt with we yet i dare not to approach nearer than seven or eight pace and at length i flee to another part of the valley i then ascend a little sand hill from whence look around i see on every side the before mention lute which seem to I to sound of themselves in a most miraculous manner without the aid of any musician on the top of this sand hill i find great quantity of silver resemble the scale of fish and gather some of this into the bosom of my habit to shew as a wonder but my conscience rebuke I i throw it all away and so by the blessing of god i depart in safety when the people of the country know that i have return alive from the valley of the dead they reverence I greatly say that the dead body be subject to the infernal spirit who be in use to play upon lute to entice man into the valley that they might die but as i be a baptize and holy person i have escape the danger thus much i have relate which i certainly behold with mine own eye but i have purposely omit many wonderful thing because those who have not see they would refuse to believe my testimony -lrb- 1 -rrb- the place in which these wonderful thing be see be no where indicate neither be the omission to be regret as the whole be evidently fabulous -- e section xxi _ of the honor and reverence shewn to the great khan _ i shall here report one thing more concern the great khan of cathay of which i be a witness it be customary when he travel through any part of he wide dominion that he subject kindle fire before they door in such place as he mean to pass into which they fling spice and perfume that he may be regale by they sweet odour and numberless multitude flock from all quarter to meet he and do he homage upon a certain time when the approach of the khan to cambalu be announce one of we bishop together with several minorite friar and myself go out two day journey from the city to meet he when we come nigh to he presence we bear aloft a cross upon a pole and begin to sing _ veni creator _ in a loud voice while i carry the censer when he come up to the place where we be singing by the way side he call we to come towards he for no man dare approach within a stone throw of he chariot unless call except those only who be appoint to attend upon he person when we come near he take off he cap or helmet of inestimable value and do reverence to the cross i immediately put incense into the censer and the bishop take the censer into he own hand perfumed the khan and give he he benediction besides this as those who approach the great khan always bring with they some offering to present to he accord to the ancient law thou shalt not come empty hand into my presence so we carry some apple along with we and reverently offer they to he on a salver and he be please to take two of we apple of one of which he eat a part the khan then give a sign for we to depart lest we might have be injure by the crowd of horse upon which we turn aside to certain of he baron who have be convert to the christian faith and who be then in he train to whom we offer the remainder of we apple which they joyfully receive as if we have make they some great gift section xxii _ conclusion of the travels and account of the death of friar oderic _ all the above be put down in write by friar william de solanga as

1 -rrb- introduction although we have admit this article into we collection on the authority of ramusio and j r forster we be dispose to consider the whole as a fabrication altogether unworthy of any credit the first section indeed may possibly have have some foundation in truth as the zeno may have navigate about the close of the fourteenth century to the orkney and some imperfect and disfigured narrative of they voyage may have fall into the hand of marcolinus the author or editor of these strangely distorted and exaggerated or pretended voyage in regard to the second section unless we could suppose that by estoitland and drogio some strangely distorted account of different district in ireland be mean to be enigmatically convey the whole of that section must be pronounce a palpable and blunder forgery but it appear obviously intend by the relater to impress upon he reader that some portion of the western hemisphere afterwards name america have be visit by antonio zeno and the high probability be that marcolinus a patriotic venetian have invent the whole story on purpose to rob the rival republic of genoa of the honor of hay give birth to the real discoverer of the new world if there be any truth whatever in the voyage of the zeno it be only to be find in the first section of this chapter and even there the possible truth be so strangely envelop in unintelligible name of person and place as to be entirely useless the _ second _ section be utterly unworthy of the slightest serious consideration and must either have be a posterior fabrication engraft upon a authentic but ignorantly tell narrative or the seeming possibility of the _ first _ section be invent to give currency to the wild forgery of the _ second _ latin book a library gold ship and foreign trade corn beer numerous town and castle all in the most northern part of america in the _ fourteenth _ century where only nomadic savage have ever exist be all irrefragable evidence that the whole or at least that portion of the voyage of the zeno be a idle romance to increase the absurdity as if to try the gullability of the reader _ dedalus _ a king of scotland be assume to have be the first discoverer of the western world and he son _ icarus _ be introduce to give he name to a civilized island already name estoitland in the narrative after this decide opinion of the falsehood and absurdity of the whole of this present chapter it may be necessary to state that in a work so general and comprehensive as that we have undertake it do not seem advisable or proper to suppress a article which have be admit into other general collection of voyage and travel the remainder of this introduction be from the work of mr j r forster extract partly from ramusio and partly consist of a ingenious attempt to explain and bolster up the more than dubious production of marcolinus : but these observation be here considerably abridged as a extended grave and critical commentary on a narrative we believe fabulous might appear incongruous though it do not seem proper to omit they altogether -- e the family of zeno in venice be very ancient and not only of the highest rank of nobility but celebrate for the performance of great action and the highest office of the state have be fill from time immemorial by person of the family about the year 1200 marin zeno assist in the conquest of constantinople and he be podesta or governor of that city about 1205 he have a son name pietro zeno who be father to rinieri zeno who be elect doge or duke of venice in 1282 and govern the republic for seventeen year during which period he wage a successful war against the genoese he adopt andrea the son of he brother marco who be afterwards raise to be captain-general of the venetian fleet in the war against genoa rinierus zeno the son of andrea be the father of pietro zeno who in 1362 be captain-general of the venetian squadron in the ally fleet of the christian against the turk and have the surname of dracone from the figure of a dragon which he wear on he shield pietro have three son carlo leone the eldest who be procurator and captain-general of the fleet : of the republic and rescue she from imminent danger in a war in which almost all europe be league for she destruction the second nicolo call likewise il cavaliere or the night shew great valor in the last mention war of _ chioggium _ against the genoese antonio be the youngest francesco marcolinus a learn italium extract the whole of the ensue relation from the original letter of the two zeno nicole and antonio which be publish in the collection of ramusio and declare that antonio lay down all the particulars of these voyage and of the country he and he brother have visit on a map which he bring with he to venice and which he hang up in he house as a sure pledge and incontestible proof of the truth of he relation and which still remain as a incontrovertible evidence in the time of marcolinus many have be incline to reject the whole of this narrative because the name which it assign to several of the country be nowhere else to be find after have carefully examine and make a translation of the whole i be fully convince that the narrative be true and that it contain internal proof of its own authenticity and i hope fully to solve in the course of this dissertation all the difficulty attend the name which have be strangely pervert by a vicious orthography it have be allege that the whole narrative have the appearance of a mere fable and it may be ask where be _ friesland _ and the other country which it mention to be find who have ever hear of a _ zichmunus _ who vanquish kako or hakon king of norway in 1369 or 1380 all this be very plausible but we think a good deal may be do for clear away the difficulty marcolinus extract this relation from the original letter of the two zeno who be of one of the most considerable family in venice a family which could not be suppose to have boldly forge a story of this kind the truth could easily have be detect whether these brother exist or not and whether they ever make voyage to the north besides this the map actually construct by antonio and hang up in he house at venice exist in the time of marcolinus as a sure and incontestable proof of the fidelity of the narrative how then be it possible to harbor any doubt in this case there must be a end of all faith in history i once hold that the country describe by the zeno have be swallow up by a earthquake but reflect that so great a revolution in nature must have leave some historical vestige or tradition i examine the matter over again and find that the country describe bear a strong resemblance to the orkney shetland faro and western island & c the zeno have represent _ porland _ as compose of a cluster of small island i suspect the other name might likewise refer to collective group thus _ estland _ appear to resemble in name the shetland zetland or hitland island and on compare the name of _ tola broa iscant trans mimant dambre _ and _ bre _ with those of yell zeal or teal burray or bura of which name there be two place west bura and east bura and when take collectively the buras unst tronda main-land hamer which be the name of a place in the mainland of orkney and brassa or bressa the resemblance seem so obvious that i no longer harbour any doubt the land of _ soranus _ which lay over against scotland naturally suggest the _ suderoe _ or southern island of the norwegian now call the western island or hebride _ ledovo _ and _ ilofe _ be the lewi and islay _ sanestol _ the cluster of island name _ schants-oer bondendon _ pondon or pondon-towny in sky _ frisland _ be faira or _ fera _ also call faras-land _ grisland _ seem grims-ay a island to the north of iceland : though i would prefer enkhuysan to the eastward of iceland but as that be probably nothing more than a island of ice we be compel to assume grims-ay _ engroneland _ be obviously greenland _ estoitland _ must have be _ winland _ the newfoundland of the modern and the latin book may have be carry there by bishop eric of greenland who go to winland in 1121 _ drogio _ lay much farther south and the people of _ florida _ when first discover have city and temple and possess gold and silver _ icarium _ with its king _ icarus _ could be no other than ireland -lrb- 2 -rrb- and perhaps the name take its origin from kerry and as _ icarus _ be choose for the name of its first king and lawgiver he father must of course be _ dedalus _ who in all probability be some scottish prince have a name of a similar sound _ neome _ i take to be strom-oe one of the faro isle _ porland _ probably mean the far-oer or faro island as far-oe or far - land be easily transmute into _ porland _ it be true that we find no such name as _ zicumnus _ among the prince of the orkney the race of the ancient earl of orkney descendant of jarl einar-torf become extinct magnus smak king of norway nominate about 1343 erngisel sunason bot a swedish nobleman to be jarl or earl of orkney in 1357 malic conda or malli sperre claim the earldom afterwards in 1369 henry sinclair put in he claim and be nominate earl in 1370 by king hakon in 1375 hakon nominate alexander le-ard to be earl for a year but sinclair vanquish le-ard and by a large sum procure the investiture from hakon in 1379 and we know from history that he remain earl in 1406 and be likewise possess of shetland the name _ sinclair _ or _ siclair _ might easily to a italian ear seem _ zichmni _ and as sinclair vanquish le-ard who represent the king of norway it be no great impropriety to say that he have beat the king of norway after these elucidation there can be no reason leave to doubt of the truth of this narrative of the zeno which besides as consider with relation to the geography of the north at that period be of great importance -- forst -lrb- 1 -rrb- ramusio forst voy and disc p 158 -lrb- 2 -rrb- this be a most unlucky blunder as icarium and estoitland be obviously one and the same place in the narrative of marcclinus and therefore both must be america or both ireland or both in nubibus -- e section i _ narrative of

with he army conquer all the country as he go they stay here but a short time and then shape they course to the westwards till they come to the other cape of the gulf or bay and here turn again they find certain island and broken land all of which they bring under subjection to _ zichmnus _ or sinclair these sea be all full of shoal and rock insomuch that if nicolo zeno and the venetian mariner have not act as pilot the whole foot in the opinion of all who be in it must have be lose so small be the skill of they people in comparison with ours who have be train up in the art and practice of navigation from they childhood after the proceedings already mention the admiral by the advice of nicolo zeno determine to make for the shore at a town call _ bondendon _ -lrb- 8 -rrb- with a view to get intelligence of the success which _ zichmnus _ have meet with in the prosecution of the war on land they here learn to they great satisfaction that he have fight a great battle in which he have put the army of the enemy to flight and in consequence of this intelligence the inhabitant send ambassador from all part of the island agree to yield the country to he pleasure and take down they flag and ensign in every town and castle it be therefore think advisable to remain at _ bondendan _ for he arrival as they have receive report that he would certainly be there in a short time on he arrival there be great congratulation and rejoicing as well for the victory obtain by land as for the success of the naval expedition and the venetian be much honor and extol for they skill every tongue be

for the great valor he have display in the taking of many town where indeed there be no great difficulty or opposition in reward for which he bestow upon he the honor of knighthood and distribute rich and liberal present among he follower depart from _ bondendon _ the fleet return in triumph to _ frislanda _ the chief city of which be situate on the south-east side of the island within a gulf of which there be many in that island in this gulf or bay there be such vast quantity of fish take that many ship be yearly laden thence to supply flander britannium -lrb- 9 -rrb- england scotland norway and denmark and the produce of this fishing bring great riches into the country the foregoing circumstance be contain in a letter send by nicolo zeno to he brother antonio in which he invite he to come to _ frislanda _ and accordingly the latter set sail for this purpose and have surmount many danger safely join he brother in that far distant country antonio remain fourteen year in frisland or orkney four year of that time along with he brother and ten year alone after the death of nicolo the elder zeno ingratiate himself so much into the favor of the prince that he be appoint admiral of a fleet which be send out upon a expedition against _ estland _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- which lie between frisland and norway the invader commit great ravages in that country but hearing that the king of norway be come against they with a considerable fleet they depart in haste and be assail by a violent tempest they be drive on certain shoal where a part of they ship be lose and the remainder be save upon _ grisfand _ -lrb- 11 -rrb- a large but uninhabited island the fleet of the king of norway be overtake by the same storm and mostly perish of which _ zichmnus _ who be personally engage in this expedition be apprize in consequence of one of the enemy 's ship have likewise be force to take refuge in _ grisland _ finding himself drive so far to the north and have repair he ship zichmnus now resolve to make a attack upon the island of iceland which be under the dominion of the king of norway but find it too well fortified and defend for he small force and reflect that he diminish fleet be now in bad repair he deem it prudent to retire in he way homewards however he make a attack upon the island of _ estland _ of which there be seven in number these be _ tola _ yeal or zel _ broa _ brassa sound _ iscant _ unst or vust _ trans _ trondra _ mimant _ mainland _ danbert _ -lrb- 12 -rrb- and _ bre _ or bressa all of which he plunder and build a fort in bre where he leave nicolo zeno in the command with a sufficient garrison and a few small bark while he return himself to frisland in the ensue spring nicolo zeno resolve to go out upon discovery and have fit out three small vessel he set sail in July shape he course to the northward and arrive in _ engroveland _ -lrb- 13 -rrb- where he find a monastery of predicant friar and a church dedicate to st thoma hard by a mountain that throw out fire like etna or vesuvius in this place there be a spring of boil hot water by means of which the monk heat they church monastery and cell it be likewise bring info they kitchen and be so hot that they use no fire for dress they victuals and by enclose they bread in brass pot without any water it be baked by means of this hot fountain as well as if a oven have be use for the purpose the monk have also small garden cover over in winter which be water from the hot spring be effectually defend from the extreme cold and snow which be so rigorous in this region so near the pole by these means they produce flower and fruit and different kind of herb just as they grow in temperate climate and the rude savage of those part from see these to they supernatural effect take the friar for god and supply they with poultry flesh -lrb- 14 -rrb- and various other thing reverence the monk as they lord and ruler when the frost and snow be considerable the monk warm they apartment as before describe and by admit the hot water or open they window they be able in a instant to produce such a temperature as they may require in the building of they monastery they use no more material than be present to they by the before mention volcano take the burning stone which be throw from the crater they throw they while hot into water by which they be dissolve into excellent lime which when use in building last forever the same stone when cold serve to make they wall and vault as they can not be break or cut except with a iron instrument the vault which they build with these stone be so light as to require no prop for support they -lrb- 15 -rrb- on account of these great convenience the monk have construct so many wall and building of different kind as be really wonderful to see the covering or roof of they house be construct for the most part in the follow manner : have carry the wall to its full height they make it to incline or bend in gradually till it form a regular vault they be little incommoded with rain in this country as the climate be so extremely cold that the first snow that fall do not thaw for nine month the monk live mostly on fish and wild fowl for in consequence of the boil hot water run into a large and wide haven of the sea that bay be keep from freezing and there be so great a concourse of sea fowl and fish in that place that they easily take as many of they as they can possibly have occasion for with which they maintain a great number of people round about whom they keep constantly employ either in building or in catch fish and fowl and in a thousand other necessary occupation relative to the monastery the house of these native be build on the hill near the monastery of a round form about twenty-five foot wide at the bottom and grow gradually narrower as they go up in a conical form end in a small hole at top to admit light and air and the floor of the house be so hot that the inhabitant feel no cold within door at any season to this place many bark resort in summer from the neighbouring island from the cape above norway and from _ trondon _ or drontheim which bring to the father all kind of commodity and merchandize that they have occasion for take fish in exchange dry either in the sun or by means of cold and the fur of various animal the commodity bring here for sale be wood for fuel wooden utensil very ingeniously carve corn and cloth for make into garment by these mean the monk be plentifully supply with every thing they need in exchange for they fur and fish which be in great request by all the neighbouring nation monk resort to this monastery from norway and sweden and other country but principally from iceland it often happen that many bark be detain here ail the winter by the sea become freeze over the fishermen boat of this country be make in the form of a weaver shuttle long and narrow and point at each end construct of a light frame of fish bone case all over with the skin of fish sew together in many double and so tight and strong that it be wonderful to see the people bind themselves fast within they during storm and allow the wind and wave to drive they about without fear of they boat splitting or of themselves be drown even when they be drive against a rock they remain sound and without hurt or damage in the bottom of each boat there be a kind of sleeve or nose tie fast in the middle by a string and when any water get into the boat they let it run into the upper half of the sleeve which they then fasten with two piece of wood after which they loosen the under band and squeeze the water out and they repeat this operation as often as may be necessary with great facility and without danger the water of the boiling spring be sulphureous be convey into the monastery and the cell of the principal friar by means of pipe make of copper tin or stone and be so hot that it heat the apartment like a stove without communicate any disagreeable or unwholesome stench they sweet water for drinking be convey in a subterraneous canal of masonry into a great copper reservoir in the middle of the court of the convent and this reservoir be contain within a larger bason supply from the boiling spring be continually keep of a proper temperature and prevent from freezing this they use in the preparation of they victuals for drinking and for water they garden thus they derive much convenience and comfort from the adjoining volcano and these good friar make it they chief study to keep they garden in order and to erect commodious and even elegant building for this latter purpose they be in no want of good workman and ingenious artizan as they give good wages so that there be a great resort of workman and artizan of every denomination they be likewise very bountiful to those who carry they fruit and seed and other article and as great profit be to be make and provision be very cheap there be a great resort of workman and artist of every denomination and of trader to this place most of these monk speak latin particularly the superior and principal of the monastery this be all that be know of _ engroveland _ or greenland from the relation of nicolo zeno who give likewise a particular description of a river that he discover as be to be see in the map which i antonio zeno have draw of all these country not be able to bear the cold of these northern and inhospitable region nicolo zeno fall sick and soon afterwards return to frisland where he die he leave two son behind he john and thoma the latter of whom have likewise two son nicolo the father of the celebrated cardinal zeno and peter from whom be descend the rest of the zeno who be now live after the death of nicolo he fortune honor and dignity devolve upon he brother antonio and though he make great supplication and entreaty for the purpose he be not permit to return to he native country as zichmnus who be a man of a high spirit and great valor have resolve to make himself master of the sea and for this purpose make use of the talent and advice of antonio and order he to go with a few bark to the westwards because in the summer several island have be discover by some of the fisherman of this voyage and the discovery which be make in consequence of it antonio give a account in a letter to he brother carlo which we here give exactly as it be write have only alter a few antiquated word -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- faira or fara in the orkney call farras-land and corrupt into feislanda or frisland -- forst -lrb- 2 -rrb- mr forster be not happy in he explanation of this word porlanda or porland which he endeavor to derive from fara-land precisely the same with fris-land from faras-land only drop the genitive _ s _ porland seem use as a general name of the earldom perhaps connect with the strange name pomona still use for mainland the largest of the orkney island frisland the particular fara island or one of they -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- sorany or soranus of which sinclair be say to have be duke or lord mr forster consider to have be the sodor-oe or southern island of the norwegian or those now call the western island and trace the corruption from the norwegian plural _ suder-oer _ contract _ soroer _ vary _ soroen _ and transmute to _ sorani _ all this may be possible but it do not appear in scot history that the sinclair ever hold the western island and certainly not at this period : soranus ought therefore to be look for in caithness or it may possibly refer to _ roslin _ near edinburgh which belong to the family of sinclair -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- by this latter distinction zeno probably mean a deck vessel -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be hardly possible to mention all the little island and the place situate on the largest of the orcadian island which by the ancient be call pomona and on account of its size be likewise call mainland also _ hross-ey _ ie _ gross-ey _ or large island the town be call _ kirkiu-og _ or the harbor near the church now call by the scot kirkwall -- forst in this note mr forster wander from the subject in hand and he observation have no reference to the present expedition _ ledovo _ be probably the island of lewi and _ ilofe _ may possibly be hay though that conjecture would lead they too far to the south -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- _ sudero _ or _ suder-oe _ might mean the western island so call by the norwegian but certainly here mean some bay of sutherland as they here meet the troops of sinclair who have march by land the town of _ sanestol _ be quite inexplicable though mr forster suppose it to have be the cluster of island call schant or shanti-oer which he think be here corrupt into sanestol : but if correct in we opinion that they must have be on the main land of scotland he conjecture must be erroneous these conquest could be nothing more than predatory incursion strangely exaggerate -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- this be a very early mention of salted fish yet within the lifetime of william beukel the suppose inventor of the art of pickle herring who die in 1397 professor sprengel have shew that herring be catch at _ gernemue _ or yarmouth so early as 1283 in leland 's collectanea we meet with a proof that pickle herring be sell in 1273 and there be german record which speak of they so early as 1236 vide gerken cod diplom brandenb i 45 and ii 45l -- forst -lrb- 8 -rrb- this be certainly a place in the isle of sky call pondontown -- forst -lrb- 9 -rrb- britannium in this place be assuredly put for britany in france -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- estland be probably mean for shetland formerly call yaltaland or hitland and afterwards change into zet-land and shetland this will appear more distinctly in the sequel when the name give by zeno to the particular island of the group come to be compare with the modern name -- forst -lrb- 11 -rrb- grisland seem to be the island which lie to the eastward of iceland call enkhuyzen perhaps the island of grims-ey to the north of iceland -- forst -lrb- 12 -rrb- probably hamer a place on the north of mainland -- forst -lrb- 13 -rrb- engrgroneland groenland or greenland -- forst -lrb- 14 -rrb- the poultry here mention in the text must have be ptarmagan and the flesh that of the reindeer -- forst -lrb- 15 -rrb- the lime or mortar here describe appear to be the terra puzzuolana or terras a compound of lime and oxid of iron which form a indestructible cement even under water and the remarkably light stone eject from the volcano and use in the construction of they vault be probably of pumice -- e -lrb- 16 -rrb- the greater part of this conclude paragraph must necessarily be in the language of the editor perhaps of ramusio it contain however some palpable contradiction since nicolo zeno could hardly be suppose to mention the _ rest _ of the zeno descendant of he grand-nephew while still live himself neither do it appear how the son of nicolo get back to venice and there be no account of antonio ever be allow to return at all -- e section ii _ sequel of the narrative by antonio zeno _ twenty-six year ago four fishing boat which have be overtake by a violent storm be drive out to sea for a great many day and on the cessation of the tempest they discover a island call _ estoitland _ which lay above a thousand mile to the westward of _ frisland _ one of the boat contain six man be cast away upon this island and the man be make prisoner by the inhabitant be conduct to a fine and populous city where the king reside who send for various interpreter but none could be find except one who speak latin this man who in like manner have be cast by accident on the same island ask they by order of the king from what country they have come and be make acquaint with they case the king order that the should stay in the country these order they obey as indeed they could not do otherwise and they remain five year on the island during which time they learn the language of the people one of they be in various part of the island and affirm that it be a very rich country abound in every commodity and convenience in life be little less than iceland but much more fertile have a very high mountain in the center from whence four great river take they source and traverse the whole country the inhabitant be a very ingenious and sensible people and have art and handicraft of every kind as we have and it be highly probable that they formerly carry on some traffic with europe as this man say he see latin book in the king library but which at present they do not understand for they have a language of they own and peculiar letter or character in which it be write they trade with _ engroveland _ or greenland and get from thence fur brimstone and pitch to the south of _ estoitland _ there be a very large and populous country which abound with gold the people sow corn and make the liquor call beer which be drink by the people of the north as wine be among we in italy they have large and extensive wood make they building with wall and have a great number of town and castle they build ship and navigate the sea but they have not the loadstone and know nothing about the use of the compass on which account these fisherman be hold in high estimation insomuch that the king send they with twelve ship to the southward to a country call drogio in they voyage thither they have such contrary wind and stormy weather that they think to have founder at sea but escape that death they meet with a fate still more dreadful as they be make prisoner by the savage who be cannibal and most of they be devour but the frisland fisherman and he companion by teach these barbarian the way to catch fish with net save they life this man use to go every day to the sea or the river in which he catch vast quantity of fish which he give away among the principal people of the country by which mean he get into such high favor that he be beloved and respect by every body the fame of this man spread abroad through the whole country and one of the lord be very desirous to have he that he might see and learn this new and wonderful art of catch fish make war against the lord with whom he live and prevail in consequence of he superior power and greater skill in war the fisherman and he companion be give up to he as the price of peace during thirteen year that he reside in these part he say that he be transfer in this manner to twenty-five different lord as they be continually at war with each other to procure possession of he so that by wander about the country in this manner he become perfectly well acquaint with every part of it he say that it be a very extensive country and as it be a new world but that the inhabitant be a rude unpolished people without the enjoyment of any convenience of life for although they take or kill many wild animal in hunting they have not the sense to make they skin into garment but all go naked and be miserably pinch with cold they be besides extremely uncivilized and savage continually engage in war against each other in which they commit horrible ravages and devour they prisoner they know not the use of any metal and live by the chase be arm with spear of wood make sharp at the point and use bow the string of which be make of slip of hide they be divide into small tribe each of which have its lord or governor and the law or custom of the several tribe differ much from each other farther to the southwest however the manners be more civilized in proportion to the increase mildness of the climate and there the people be not without some degree of knowledge make use of gold and silver and have city and temple dedicate to idol in which they offer up human sacrifice after reside many year among this savage people the principal fisherman become desirous of return into he own country but he companion be without hope of ever see it again wish he prosperity in he attempt and resolve to remain where they be bid they farewell he flee through the wood in the direction which lead towards _ drogio _ and be receive with great kindness by one of the lord of that country who know he and who be a determine enemy to the lord from whence he have escape thus pass from one lord to another with all of whom he be well acquaint as he have formerly reside with they all he at length and with great difficulty arrive in drogio where he stay three year then fortunately hear that some small vessel have arrive on the coast he go thither and learn to he unspeakable satisfaction that they be from _ estoitland _ upon this he earnestly request to be take on board which they do very willingly and as he understand the language of the country which the other do not he become they interpreter he afterwards make repeat voyage from _ estoitland _ to _ drogio _ and acquire great riches after which he equip a bark of he own in which he return to _ frisland _ where he make a report to he lord of all that have befall he and of the discovery he have make of a extensive and wealthy country as this strange and marvellous story be confirm by the testimony of the sailor he have bring along with he it gain full credit and accordingly zichmnus determine to send I antonio zeno with a fleet into these part and so great be the desire among the people to embark in this expedition that we fleet be well man and equip without expence to the public i accordingly set sail with a great number of ship and man but not commander in chief as i expect for zichmnus go in person on the expedition we great preparation for the voyage to _ estoitland _ begin in a unlucky hour as three day before we departure the fisherman die who be to have be we guide yet zichmnus would not give up the enterprise but take for he guide several of the sailor who have return with the fisherman from _ estoitland _ shape we course to the westwards we pass several island subject to _ frisland _ and arrive at _ ledovo _ or the lewi where we staid a week to refresh ourselves and to provide the fleet with necessaries depart thence we arrive on the first of July off the island of _ ilofe _ or islay and the wind be favourable do not stop there but stand on we voyage not long afterwards be in the main sea we be overtake by a dreadful tempest which toss we to and fro at the mercy of the wind and wave for eight day so that we know not whereabouts we be by the violence of this tempest we lose many of we vessel but after the return of good weather we collect the remains of we shatter fleet and have a fair wind we stand on to the westward and at length descry the coast of _ estoitland _ and arrive in a good and safe harbor here we see a infinite number of armed man run furiously towards the shore apparently for the purpose of defend the island upon this zichmnus command sign of peace to be make and the islander send ten man to we who could speak ten different language but we could understand none of these except one man who happen to be a icelander this man be bring to we prince and give the follow account of the country and people the land be call _ icarta _ and all its king be name _ icarus _ after the name of its first king who be the son of _ daedalus _ king of scotland this _ daedalus _ have discover and conquer the island and after institute the body of law by which they be still govern have leave they he son to be they king after this _ daedalus _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- sail in quest of farther discovery but be overtake by a violent storm and drown in memory of which they name they island icarium the sea surround it the _ icarian _ sea and all they successive king _ icarus _ he state moreover that they be perfectly contented with the state in which they have be place by providence and not choose to make the smallest change in they manners and custom would admit no stranger into they land and therefore request the prince not to attempt violate the law of they king of glorious memory as any such attempt would turn to he manifest destruction since they be resolve to sacrifice they life in defense of they law they be willing however to receive _ one _ of we man who should be advance to the rank of a chief on purpose to learn we language have already receive _ ten _ different man with that view from ten different nation upon this _ zichmnus _ sail from the harbor as if mean to go away from the island but be in want of wood and water he skirt along the coast at some distance and put into another harbor on the eastern side of the island with all he fleet here the mariner go on shore and procure the necessary supplies with all possible speed lest they might be attack by the native this precaution be by no means unnecessary for the inhabitant near this harbor make signal by fire and smoke to the rest of the country and take to they arm be soon join by other and come down upon we man with bow and arrow and other weapon and in the conflict many of they be kill and other dangerously wound -lrb- 2 -rrb- we be therefore oblige to depart and make a large circuit round the island always accompany on the shore and on the hill by a vast number of armed man to oppose we landing see that nothing could be do here zichmni set sail to the eastward with a fair wind and after six day sail we come in sight of land which we find to be a very good country with a excellent harbor we descry a mountain at a considerable distance which emit smoke and zichmnus send a hundred soldier to explore the country and to inquire if it be inhabit in the meantime we take in wood and water and catch vast quantity of fish and sea-fowl and procure immense number of egg so that we people before almost famish have now more provision than they could eat to this harbor we give the name of port _ trin _ and the point that stretch out into the sea be name cape _ trin _ the soldier who have be send out to examine the country return at the end of eight day and report they have be all through the island quite to the smoking mountain and that the smoke we see proceed from a fire at its bottom where there be a spring of liquid pitch which run into the sea they say likewise that the interior of the island be inhabit by a wild people who be very short in stature and timid and hide themselves in cave on receive this piece of intelligence and consider that the island be bless with a pure and wholesome air good soil fine river and many other advantage ziehmnus resolve to people it and to build a town at port trin and take great pain to discover the whole of it and to explore the sea on both side of _ engroveland _ or greenland but many of he people begin to murmur be quite wearied with so tedious a voyage allege that as the winter be fast approach they should not be able to return home before the ensue summer if they make any longer delay on this account retain only the row-boat and as many man as be willing to stay with he zichmnus send away all the rest of the people with the ship give the command to I antonio zeno much against my will take therefore we departure we sail twenty day to the eastward without see any land on which we shift we course to the south-east and after five day we come in sight of the island of neome -lrb- 3 -rrb- so that we pass iceland without see it we here procure refreshment from the inhabitant who be subject to zichmnus and sail thence in three day to _ frisland _ where we be receive with great joy as the people think in consequence of we long absence that they prince and the whole armament have be lose as to the particulars concern the people and they custom the animate and the production of these country i have write all these in a separate book in which i have describe the country and the wonderful fish of _ frisland estland _ norway _ estoitland drogio icarium _ and _ engroveland _ on both its side i have compose likewise the life of my brother nicolo zeno with a account of he discovery and a history of the life and act of _ zichmnus _ a prince as worthy of immortal fame as any that ever live have be famous for he valor enterprising spirit and humanity -lrb- 1 -rrb- or icarus for the language in forster be ambiguous and do not clearly fix this important historical fact -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the expression be here so equivocal as to leave in doubt whether the kill and wound be _ icarian _ or _ frislander _ or part of both -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- _ neome _ seem to be the isle or stromoe one of the faro island as it be in fact to the southward of iceland and only three day sail from the orkney the faras-island or _ frisland _ of this author -- forst chap xvi _ travels of john schildtberger into

ulug-beg here mention be probably chinese astronomer in the service of that prince send on the present occasion to ascertain and report the geographical circumstance of the journey -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the text here be obscure as appear to indicate kathayan ambassador go to kathay they may have be ambassador from yong-lo to shakh-rokh now on they return -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- call asperah by forster -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- from this description of the route and the imply division of empire it would appear that shah-rokh rule over a very ample portion of the vast conquest of timur have under have command the country of iran and touran or persium chorassan balkh kharism great bucharium and fergaana even include samarkand the imperial residence of timur -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- mr forster call this place pielgutu and explain the name by the substitution of _ palcha _ with a mark of interrogation as doubtful the geography of the east be render difficult and obscure by the frequent recurrence of name in

the jesuit map there be a river call cheldo near the ili on which this town may have stand -- astl -lrb- 14 -rrb- this be doubtless a mistake for tarfan or turfan in little bucharium the arabic f and k differ only by a point astl turfan turkhan or farkhaan be situate in tenduc or uigurium in lat 43  n long 85  so e the snowy mountain cross in such haste must have be the alahtag the cold desert of the tribe of jel be probably in the eastern part of soongrium perhaps the karang desert north from turfan and the alak mountain -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- this be suppose to be the same place with aramuth in

they arrival at the karaul and interpose a desert of several day journey between these two place -- e -lrb- 23 -rrb- this seemingly trifling circumstance be matter of great surprize and scandal to the

of telegraph -- e -lrb- 25 -rrb- six merre make a pharasang or persian league which be equal to four english mile and 868 foot one merre be therefore equal to 1221 yard and each post station of ten

the kan - chew of the text -- e -lrb- 27 -rrb- the description give in the text of this chinese pagoda have much the air of a fiction yet we can hardly conceive the author would venture to report to shah-rokh what must have be contradict by he ambassador if false -- astl -lrb- 28 -rrb- this be call lam in the french of thevenot and be the same with the lamb of marco polo -- astl -lrb- 29 -rrb- this be the cara-moran or whang-ho which they cross a second time between shen-si and shan-si where it be much larger than at lan-chew the place probably allude to in this part of the text -- astl in the edition by forster this river be name abus daraan or the daraan afterwards kara-raan but be obviously the kara-moran whang - ho or hoang-ho -- e -lrb- 30 -rrb- this _ other _ river certainly be the same kara-moran pass again at a different part of they route -- astl -lrb- 31 -rrb- this must have be some city in the province of pe-che-li or near its border in shan-si but no such name as that of the text be to be find in any of the map of china -- astl in forster edition this place be name chien-dien-puhr perhaps tchin-teuen-pou a city at some distance to the west of the hoan-ho river the route be not distinctly indicate in the text but seem to have be from soutcheo at the nw extremity of chensus in lat 40  n follow a s e direction to the hoan-ho somewhere about yung - nam in lat 37  n long 104  e and yung-nam may have be the fine city which the persian name rosna-baad or the habitation of beauty -- e -lrb- 32 -rrb- about seventeen or twenty-one english mile or nineteen mile on the

inconclusive : these vestment be probably present to the ambassador and they suite -- e -lrb- 36 -rrb- what this may have be do not appear it may possibly have be arrack or the wine make of rice and

appoint to guard the provision with order to distribute regular share to each person on board twice a day quirinus himself not except as a substitute for they disabled rudder they construct by the advice of the carpenter out of some spare mast and yard two rudder with triangular board end in order to steady the course of the vessel these be properly fasten proved highly serviceable and inspire they with fresh hope of safety but by the extreme violence of the wind and wave this they last refuge be tear away on the 26th of November the storm increase to such extreme violence that they expect every moment to founder and have no doubt this be to have prove the last day of they life by degree indeed the storm abate but they be drive out to sea to the wnw and the sail from be perpetually fatigue by the rain and wind be now tear to shiver and though they put up new one they be soon likewise destroy the ship now drive without either sail or rudder at the mercy of the wind and wave and be fill by the sea which continually beat over it insomuch that the crew wear out with constant labor anxiety and watch be scarcely able to keep the water under on heave the lead they find water at 80 fathom on which they splice all they four cable on end and ride at anchor for the space of forty hour when one of die crew terrify at the dreadful working of the ship occasion by the wind and wave cut the cable at the forecastle and the ship now drive about as before on the 4th December four large wave break in succession over they ill-fated vessel and fill it so full of water that it seem just ready to sink by exert they utmost strength and resolution the crew bale the water out though it reach to they waist and at length succeed in empty the vessel entirely on the 7th the tempest increase with such violence that the sea flow into the ship uninterruptedly from the windward and they speedy destruction seem quite inevitable so that they be now of opinion they only chance of safety be by cut away the mainmast which might lighten the ship this be do therefore immediately and a large wave fortunately carry the mast and yard clear away by which the ship work with considerably less strain and violence the wind and wave too now become less violent and they again bale out the water but now the mast be go the ship would no longer keep upright and lay quite over on one side so that the water run into she in torrent and the people be quite exhaust with labor and want of food have not strength remain to clear out the water in this desperate situation expect every moment that the vessel would sink or go to piece they come to the resolution of endeavor to save themselves in the boat of which the larger hold only forty-seven man and the smaller twenty-one quirinus have the choice of either of the boat and at last go with he servant into the larger boat in which the officer have embark they take with they a stock of provision and on the 17th December the wind and wave have somewhat moderate they quit they unfortunate ship among other costly article of commerce the ship be laden with 800 cask of malmsey wine and a great quantity of sweet-scented cyprus wood with pepper and ginger on the follow night the small boat in which twenty-one of the crew be embark be separate from they by the violence of the storm and they never hear of she more those in the larger boat be oblige to throw overboard most of they stock of wine and provision and all they clothes except those they have on in order if possible to lighten she a little as the weather prove fair for some time they steer to the eastward in hope of get as they think to iceland but the wind again chop about drive they about at its will and they be quite ignorant whereabouts they be they liquor now begin to fail and many of the people be quite exhaust with incessant labor long watching and the other hardship they have undergo and through scarcity of provision a great number of they die so great particularly be the scarcity of drink that the allowance for each man be only a fourth part of a moderate cupful once in twenty-four hour they be better provide with salted meat cheese and biscuit but this dry and salt food excite a intolerable thirst which they have no means to quench in consequence of which some of they die suddenly and without have exhibit any previous symptom of illness and it be particularly observe that those be first carry off who have formerly live in the most intemperate manner and have give themselves up to drunkenness or have continually indulge themselves in hover over the fire though these have the external appearance of be strong and healthy they be least able to endure the hardship they have now to suffer and two or three of they use to die in a day this mortality prevail for ten day from the 19th to the 29th of December on the 29th the last remainder of the wine be serve out and every one resign himself to meet death which seem at hand some of the people urge by rage thirst drink sea water which evidently hasten they dissolution other have recourse to they own urine and this nauseous beverage join to the precaution of eat as little salt provision as possible contribute most of all to the preservation of they life for the space of five day they continue in this dreadful situation sailing all the time to the north-eastward at length on the 4th of January one of the people who sit in the bow of the boat descry somewhat to leeward which he conceive to be the shadow of land and immediately inform the crew of he discovery in a anxious voice all eye be now eagerly direct to this object and as day break they see with extreme joy that it really be the land the sight of this welcome object inspire they with fresh vigor and they now ply they oar in order to arrive the sooner at the shore but on account of its great distance as well as the shortness of the day which be only two hour long they be unable to accomplish this desire besides they be now so weak as to be unable to make use of they oar for any length of time and as night soon overtake they and be of long continuance it seem to man in they forlorn state as if it would never end when the next day break they could no longer discern the land which they have see the day before but they discover another mountainous country very near they and to leeward that they might not lose the way to this during the ensue night they take its bearing by the compass and hoist sail with a fair wind they reach it about four o'clock in the evening on approach the shore they observe that it be surround by many shallows as they distinctly hear the sea break over these but they give themselves up to the guidance of providence and at one time the boat ground on a shoal but a vast wave come and float they over and at the same time carry they safely to land upon a shelve rock which be now they great security as the spot be encompass on every side with rugged project rock and they could not possibly have get on shore in any other place here therefore they run they boat on shore and those who be on the bow leap directly on the coast which they find entirely cover with snow which they swallow in immense quantity fill they parch and burn stomach and bowels they likewise fill a kettle and pitcher for those who from weakness remain in the boat and quirinus allege that he swallow as much snow as he would have find it difficult to have carry on he back all he happiness and welfare seem to depend upon the quantity of it he could swallow this extravagant quantity of snow agree so ill with some of the people that five of they die that night though they death be attribute to the sea water which they have previously drink section ii _ preservation of quirinus on the coast of norway and residence in the isle of rostoe _ as they have no rope with which to make fast they boat to the shore and prevent it from be dash to piece they remain in it the whole night next day at dawn sixteen weak miserable and exhaust wretch the sad remains of forty-seven who have originally take refuge in the large boat go on shore and lay themselves down in the snow hunger however soon oblige they to examine if there might not remain some of the provision which they have bring with they from the ship : all they find be a very small ham a inconsiderable remnant of cheese and some biscuit dust in a bag mix with the dung of mouse these they warm by means of a small fire which they make of the boat seat and in some measure appease they hunger on the follow day have convince themselves beyond doubt that the rock on which they then be be quite desert and uninhabited they resolve to quit it in hope of be able to reach some inhabit island or part of the adjacent coast of norway but after fill five small cask with snow water and get into the boat to put they resolution into execution the water run in torrent through all the seam and the boat go to the bottom immediately so that they be force to get on shore again quite drench in the sea during the whole of the precede long night the boat have be beat against the rock which have loosen its plank and open all the seam despair now of any relief as they be utterly destitute of any means to repair they boat they construct two small tent of they oar and sail to shelter themselves from the weather and hew the material of they boat in piece to make a fire to warm themselves the only food they be able to procure consist in a few muscle and other shell-fish which they pick up along the shore thirteen of the company be lodge in one of the tent and three in the other the smoke of the wet wood cause they face and eye to swell so much that they be afraid of become totally blind and what add prodigiously to they suffering they be almost devour by louse and maggot which they throw by handful into the fire the secretary of quirinus have the flesh on he neck eat bare to the sinew by these vermin and die in consequence besides he three spaniard of a robust frame of body likewise die who probably lose they life in consequence of have drink sea water while in the boat and so weak be the thirteen who still remain alive that during three day they be unable to drag away the dead body from the fire side eleven day after landing on this rock or uninhabited island quirini 's servant have extend he search for shellfish they only food quite to the farthest point of the island find a small wooden house both in and around which he observe some cow-dung from this circumstance the forlorn people conclude that there be man and cattle at no great distance which inspire they with fresh hope of relief and revive they drooping spirit this house afford they abundant room and good shelter and all except three or four who be too weak to be able for the fatigue of remove to such a distance change they abode to this hut crawl with great difficulty through the deep snow the distance be about a mile and a half and they take with they as much as they be able of the ruin of they boat to serve they for fire-wood two day after this while go along the shore in search of the usual supply of shell-fish one of the company find a very large fish quite recently cast up by the sea which appear to weigh about two hundred pound and be quite sweet and fresh this most providential supply they cut into thin slice and carry to they dwelling where they immediately set to work to broil and boil it but so great be they famine and so tempting its smell that they have not patience to wait till it be thoroughly dress but devour it eagerly half raw they continue to gorge themselves with this fish almost without intermission for four day but at length the evident and rapid decrease of this stock of food teach they more prudent economy and by use it sparingly in future it last they ten day more those who staid behind in one of the tent near the place of they first landing send one of they number to see what have become of the rest and when he have be refresh with some of the fish he carry a portion to he two companion and the whole survivor be soon afterwards reassemble in the wooden hut during the whole time that they subsist upon the providentially find fish the weather be so exceedingly tempestuous that they certainly would not have be able to have look out for shellfish and they must inevitably have perish of famine have make a end of the large fish which seem to have last they for fourteen day they be oblige to have recourse again to the precarious employment of gathering shellfish along the shore for they subsistence about eight mile from the rock upon which they now be which fioravente inform we be call _ santus _ or sand-ey by the native there be another isle name _ rustene _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- which be inhabit by several family of fisher it happen that a man and two of he son come over from rost to sandey to look after some cattle which be amiss observe the smoke from the hut in which quirinus and he wretched companion have take shelter curiosity lead they to examine the hut on they approach they voice be hear by the people within the hut but they believe it to be only the scream of the sea-fowl who devour the body of they deceased companion christopher fioravente however go out to examine whence the unusual sound proceed and espy the two youth he run back in haste call aloud to he companion that two man be come to seek they upon this the whole company run out immediately to meet the lad who on they part be terrify at the sight of so many poor famished wretch these latter debate for some time among themselves whether they should not detain one of they visitor with the view of make themselves more certain to procure assistance but quirinus dissuade they from this project violence they all accompany the youth to the boat and entreat the father and son to take two of they people along with they to they habitation in order the sooner to procure they assistance from thence for this purpose they choose one gerrard of lyon who have be purser of the ship and one cola a mariner of otranto as these man could speak french and a little

when they perceive six boat approach to they relief on landing the dominican priest inquire which of they be the captain of the unhappy crew and when quirinus make himself know as such the priest present he with some rye bread and some beer which he look upon as manna send from heaven after this the priest take he by the hand and desire he to choose two of he companion to accompany he and

alania which be without the island towards moncastro -lrb- 22 -rrb- the goth of these place speak a dialect of the german language as i learn from a german servant who accompany I on my travels for he converse with they and they understand each other tolerably well just as a native of friulus in the pope dominion might understand a florentine -lrb- 23 -rrb- from the vicinity or intermixture of the goth and alanian originate the denomination of _ gotitalanus _ the alanian be the first inhabitant of this county : the goth come at a after period and make a conquest of part of the country inhabit by the alanian and as the two nation mingle together this mixed name become likewise into use all these people profess the greek religion which be likewise follow by the tscherkassian or circassian have already make mention of tuman and githerean i shall now relate some remarkable particulars concern they go from tuman eastward or rather to the north-east in seven day journey we arrive at the river _ ledil _ -lrb- 24 -rrb- on the bank of which stand _ githercan _ -lrb- 25 -rrb- a small insignificant town lay waste and in ruin it be formerly a very considerable and celebrated place as before the devastation of it by tamerlane the spice and silk which go to syrium -lrb- 26 -rrb- be carry by githercan and thence to tanna from whence they be bring by six or seven large gally to venice for at that time no other nation besides venice trade to syria the ledil or wolga be a large and very broad river which discharge itself into the sea of baku or the caspian twenty-five italian mile below astracan and both this river and the caspian which be tolerably salt contain innumerable quantity of fish call tunny and sturgeon one may sail up this river to within three day journey of moscow in russium and the inhabitant of that place go every year with they vessel to astracan to procure salt the passage downward be easy as the river mosco run into the oka and that again into the wolga in this river there be many island and many forest along its bank some of these island be thirty mile in circumference and in the forest there be tree of such vast size that one of they may be hollow into a boat that will require eight or ten horse and twice as many man to draw it against the stream cross the river wolga and go fifteen day journey to the north-west along the river we meet with innumerable horde of tartar but in travel northwards towards russium we come to a small town call risan -lrb- 27 -rrb- which belong to a relation of the grand duke of russium the inhabitant of this place be all christian and follow the usage of the greek church this country abound in corn cattle honey and other good thing and they import a species of beer call _ bossa _ -lrb- 28 -rrb- and the country abound in wood and village without number somewhat farther and about half way between riazan and moscow be a town call colonna the fortification both of riazan and colonna be build of timber as be also the house as nothing be to be see in these part construct of brick or stone three day journey from colonna to the north-west we come to the city and province of moscow or mosqua where the great duke jvan or john reside and through this province there run a river of the same name have several bridge over it and from which the city and province have probably acquire they name the castle of moscow be situate upon a hill and be encompass round with wood -lrb- 29 -rrb- the fertility of this country in respect to corn and cattle may be understand from this circumstance that flesh be not sell by weight but they give it out in large piece as much as would weigh four pound -lrb- 30 -rrb- seventy hen may be buy for a ducat worth four or five shilling and a goose may be have for less than threepence in this country the cold of winter be very severe and the river be long freeze over : take advantage of this circumstance they carry ox and other beast to market in winter ready slaughter skin and embowell which they set up on they foot in the market place freeze as hard as a stone and in such number that one may buy 200 or more of they at a time cut they in piece as in we market be quite impossible as they be as hard as marble and be deliver out whole the only fruit to be meet with be apple nut and small walnut when the russian have a mind to travel especially if the distance be very great they prefer the winter season when the whole country be cover over with frozen snow and all the river be passable on the ice they then travel with great convenience and expedition be only subject to the severity of the cold at this season they use sledge which be to they as waggon be to we and in they they take every thing along with they with the utmost ease that they have a mind to in the summer the road be extremely miry and full of inequality proceed from the country be extremely woody and they do not therefore take long journey at that season more especially as it be very thinly inhabit they have no grape but make a species of wine from honey and a kind of beer from millet into which they put hop blossom of which the odour be so strong as to occasion sneezing and which intoxicate like wine i must not omit to mention in this place that about twenty-five year ago the great duke on finding that he subject be much addict to drinking which make they neglect they affair give order that no more beer or mead should be make by which mean he oblige they to live sober and regular life besides this he do many other thing for the advantage of he dominion before the reign of this prince the russian pay tribute to the tartar but they have now conquer a country call kasan which be 500 mile to the east of moscow and the chief city of which lie on the left bank of the wolga in descend towards the sea of _ bochrus _ or the caspian -lrb- 31 -rrb- this country of kasan enjoy considerable trade especially in fur of which large quantity be carry from thence by way of moscow to poland prussium and flander these fur come from a great distance to the north-east out of the empire of zagathaus -lrb- 32 -rrb- and from moxium -lrb- 33 -rrb- both of which northern district be inhabit by tartar part of whom be idolater particularly the moxian who continue so to this day have receive some account of these moxian i shall relate what i know concern they religious custom at a certain season they lead a horse into the middle of they assembly and fasten it strongly by the head and foot to five stake drive into the ground for that purpose after this a particular person go to some distance with he bow and arrow and shoot at the heart of the animal till he have kill he the horse be then flay and the flesh eat after the performance of certain ceremony they then stuff the horse skin with straw and sew it up so as to appear entire fix piece of wood under the skin of the leg that the stuff animal may stand up as it do when alive they next construct a scaffold amid the branch of a large tree upon which they fix the stuff horse skin and worship it as a god offer up to it the fur of sables ermines gray squirrel and fox which they hang among the bough of the sacred tree just as we offer up wax-light to the image of the saint the food of this people consist mostly of flesh and that chiefly of venison get by hunting but they likewise catch abundance of fish in the river of they country many of the tartar be idolater and carry the idol which they worship about with they on cart in they moveable hut and some of they have the strange custom of worship each day the animal they meet first in a morning after go out of they house the grand duke of russium have likewise conquer nowgorod or novogorod -lrb- 34 -rrb- this be a extensive province about eight day journey to the north-west of moscow which be formerly a republic the inhabitant be without sense or reason and have a great many heretic among they but at present the catholic faith make its way among they by degree though some be still misbeliever in the meantime however they lead more rational life and justice be properly administer poland be twenty-two day journey from moscow and the first place we come to in poland be a fortified town call trockus or trozk -lrb- 35 -rrb- to which we arrive through wood and over hill travel a long way in a uninhabited desert there be it be true certain place by the way in which traveller may rest a while and make a fire if order before hand and sometimes though very rarely one find a small hamlet or two a little way out of the road go beyond trozk one meet with more hill and forest in which there be some habitation and nine day journey beyond trozk we come to a fortified town call _ lonirus _ or lonin -lrb- 36 -rrb- after this we quit that part of poland call lithuanium and come to a district name _ varsonich _ -lrb- 37 -rrb- which belong to certain lord who be subject to _ kazimir _ or cassimir king of poland this part of the country be fertile and contain a great many walled town and village but none of any great importance from warsaw it be seven day journey to the frontier of poland through a good and beautiful country where one meet with _ mersaga _ -lrb- 38 -rrb- a tolerably good town where poland end respect the town and province of poland i shall say nothing farther for want of proper information except that the king and he son and whole household be very good christian and that the eldest of he son be king of bohemia travel four day more beyond poland we come to francfort a city which belong to the margrave of bandenburgh but have reach germany i shall say nothing of it as we be now in a manner at home and in a country with which most people be well acquaint -lrb- 1 -rrb- forster voy and disc in the north p 165 -lrb- 2 -rrb- call likewise the sea of zabachus ischaback-denghissus the palus maeoti and sea of asof -- forst -lrb- 3 -rrb- this be explain to signify deodatus or give by god -- forst -lrb- 4 -rrb- the _ ch _ be use in italian orthography before _ e _ and _ i _ to indicate the letter _ k _ hence cheremuch be kererouk and chertibeus kertibeus or kertibey in the perpetually vary nomenclature from vitious orthography and change of dominion it be often difficult to ascertain the nation or district indicate this be peculiarly the case in the present instance and the sequel which enumerate a number of the caucasian petty tribe lie between the sea of asof and the caspian now mostly subject to the russian empire whose momentary name and station we dare not pretend to guess at -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- this odd expression that these province be not far from each other certainly mean that they be not large -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- otherwise call sebastopoli also isguriah or dioskurio -- forst -lrb- 7 -rrb- hence _ asper _ the ordinary denomination of silver coin in modern turkey be evidently borrow from the greek -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- now precop -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- kumanium and gazzarium here say to be province of the crimea or island of kaffa must have be small district of that peninsula inhabit by tribe of the kumanian and gazzarian of the country between the sea of asof and the mouth of the wolga now frequently call the cuban tartary the whole of that country together with the country between the wolga and ural river often bear the name of kumanium but the destructive conquest of the mongal have in all age break down the nation of those part into fragment and have induce such rapid and frequent change as to baffle all attempt at any fixed topography except of lake river and mountain -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- the ancient taurica chersonesus the crimea of we day now again call taurida by the russian -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- probably ulu-beg or the great prince -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- soragathus or solgathus be name by abulfeda soldet or kirm and be at present call eskikyrym or the old citadel -- forst from the name of this place chirmium kirmium kirm or crim the name of the peninsula and its inhabitant chrimea and crim-tartar be evidently derive -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- kerkiardus be the kerkrus of abulfeda and signify in turkish forty man some call the place kyrk and the pole name it kirkjel it be situate on a inaccessible mountain and be one of the castle belong to the goth who dwell in those mountain absurdly call jew by some author of whom some trace remain not long ago as they language contain many word resemble german -- forst -lrb- 14 -rrb- i should suspect that this term here apply to one place only have be originally the general appellation of the _ forty _ castle belong to the goth who long defend themselves in the tauric chersonese the ridiculous conversion of these goth into jew may be account for by suppose that some ignorant transcriber have change teutschus into judeus either in copying or write from the ear -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- the pantikapaeum of the ancient bosphorian king the ol-kar of abulfeda -- forst -lrb- 16 -rrb- this be nearly on the same spot with the theodosium of the greek and roman -- forst -lrb- 17 -rrb- otherwise soldadium soldadium or more properly sugdaja now sudak or suday by which name it be mention in abulfeda -- forst -lrb- 18 -rrb- grasuus or grusuus now unknown perhaps stand at a place now call krusi-musen which seem to preserve some trace of the name -- forst -lrb- 19 -rrb- call likewise cimbolo the -lrb- greek : symbolan hormoo -rrb- or -lrb- greek : lymaen -rrb- the buluk-lawa of the modern or liman -- forst -lrb- 20 -rrb- otherwise sherson and schurschus which be formerly call cherson trachea and be build 600 year before the christian era by the inhabitant of heraclea in pontus it be also call chersonesus or the peninsula but that term properly signify the whole of the peninsula between this harbor and symbolon or liman which be entirely occupy by the greek the russian take this place in the reign of wolodimer the great and it be call korsen in they annals by the turk it be name karaje-burn it must be carefully distinguish from another cherson on the dnieper at no great distance but not in the peninsula -- forst -lrb- 21 -rrb- this seem a corruption of klima as all the town name by barbaro formerly belong to -lrb- greek : chastxa ton chlima -rrb- of the greek and all belong till lately to the turk -- forst -lrb- 22 -rrb- this be a place at the mouth of the dniester call ak-kierman by the turk tshelatalba by the walachian belgorod by the russian aspro kastra by the greek and moncastro by the genoese it be the alba julium of the roman -- forst -lrb- 23 -rrb- this circumstance be before notice by rubruqui and be likewise mention by busbeck father mohndorf meet with many slave in the gally at constantinople who be descend from the goth and speak a dialect of german now that the crimea belong to russia it be to be wish that the remain trace of the gothic language may be inquire after as this language might serve to explain and illustrate the remains we still possess of ulfilum 's translation of the gospel into gothic while the name and custom of this people together with many of they phrase and turn of expression might throw light on the manners and custom of the ancient german it be even possible that some family among they of the higher rank may still possess some book in they ancient language which would be a very important discovery -- forst -lrb- 24 -rrb- otherwise call erdir erdil atel athol etilium and now the volga or wolga -- forst -lrb- 25 -rrb- likewise name citracan and astrakhan astracan -- forst -lrb- 26 -rrb- there be a obvious blunder here for this account of the trade must be understand as follow : that the trade in silk and spice from the east which now come by way of syrium come over land by way of astracan to tanna whence it be transport by sea to venice the conclude sentence that no other nation but the venetian then trade with syrium be quite inexplicable as the syrian trade could not possibly come to venice by way of astracan and tanna the various route of trade from indium or the east to western europe before the portuguese discover the way by sea have be well illustrate by dr robertson and will be explain in the course of this work -- e -lrb- 27 -rrb- riazan on the oka the capital of a province or the same name -- e -lrb- 28 -rrb- even at present they make a inebriating liquor in russium from millet call busa which be very heady and be probably what be name bossa in the text -- forst -lrb- 29 -rrb- i strongly suspect that this passage be wrong translate and that it ought to have be that the castle as encompass with wooden wall as it be well know that the city of moscow environs the castle or kremlin -- e -lrb- 30 -rrb- this expression have no meaning barbaro probably write that four pound could be have at moscow for the same money that would buy one in venice -- e -lrb- 31 -rrb- the caspian besides the name of bochrus and bakhu be likewise call the sea of khozar and the sea of tabristan -- e -lrb- 32 -rrb- zagathaus be one of the son of the great conqueror zingi khan and receive that part of the empire for he share which comprehend turkistan mawaralnahar and kuaresm which extensive country take from he the name of zagathaus -- forst the fur mention in the text could not be bring from this country which besides be to the _ south-east _ of kasan to the north-east lie siberium the true country of fine fur and which barbara by mistake must have name zagathaus : though perhaps it might at one time form part of that extensive empire -- e -lrb- 33 -rrb- moxium be the country of the morduanian one tribe of whom call themselves mokscha or moxa -- forst -lrb- 34 -rrb- this word signify the new castle of this name there be two city and province in european russium novogorod proper and nisney novogorod : the former be the one here mean -- e -lrb- 35 -rrb- this be near wilna in lithuanium -- forst -lrb- 36 -rrb- i imagine that slonym be here mean formerly a place of note and which use to be the appanege of one of the lithuanian prince -- forst -lrb- 37 -rrb- varsonich be a evident corruption for varsovich or warsaw the capital of masurea or masovium -- forst -lrb- 38 -rrb- it be not easy to determine the situation of _ mersaga _ but as on the border of poland towards brandenburgh and in the direction of francfort on the oder it be probable that meseriz or miedzyrzyez be here mean -- forst end of volume first end of the project gutenberg ebook of a general history and collection of voyage and travels vol 1 by robert kerr
