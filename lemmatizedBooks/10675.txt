pebble on the shore on choose a name as for you name i offer you the whole firmament to choose from in that prodigal spirit the editor of the _ star _ invite I to join the constellation that he have summon from the vasty deep of fleet street i be he say to shine punctually every Wednesday evening wet or fine on winter night and summer eve at home or abroad until such time as he cry : hold enough and apply the extinguisher that come to all the invitation reach I in a tiny village on a spur of a range of beech clad hill whither i have flee for a breathing space from the nightmare of the war and the menacing gloom of the london street at night here the darkness have no terror in the wide arch of the sky we lamp be light nightly as the sun sink down far over the great plain that stretch at we foot none of the palpitation of fleet street disturb we and the rumor of the war come to we like far-off echo from another world the only sensation of we day be when just after darkness have fall the sound of a whistle in the tiny street of thatched cottage announce that the postman have call to collect letter in this solitude where one be throw entirely upon one 's own resource one discover how dependent one be upon man and book for inspiration it be hard even to find a name not that find a name be easy in any circumstance every one who live by he pen know the difficulty of the task i would rather write a article than find a title for it the thousand word come easily -lrb- sometimes -rrb- but the five-words summary of the thousand that be to flame at the top like a beacon light be a gem that have to be seek in travail almost in tear i have write book but i have never find a title for one that i have write that have always come to I from a friend even the man of genius suffer from this impoverishment when goldsmith have write the finest english comedy since shakespeare he do not know what to call it and have to leave johnson to write the label i like to think that shakespeare himself suffer from this sterility -- that he too sit bite the feather of he quill in that condition of despair that be so familiar to smaller man indeed we have proof that it be so in the title themselves be not the title _ as you like it _ a confession that he have bite he quill until he be tire of the vain search for a name and what be _ twelfth night : or what you will _ but a evidence that he could not hit upon any name that would fit the most joyous offspring of he genius what parent do not know the same agony to name a child to give he a sign that shall go with he to he grave and that shall fit that mystery of the cradle which time and temptation and trial shall alone reveal -- _ hoc opus hic labor est _ many fail by start from false grounds -- fashion ambition or momentary interest perhaps the little stranger arrive with the news of a battle or when a popular novel appear or at a moment when you be under the influence of some austere or heroic name and forgetful that it be the child that have to bear the burden of you momentary impulse you call he inkerman jone or kitchener smith or milton spink and so he be start on he journey like a little historical memory or challenging comparison with some hero of fact or fable perhaps milton spink grow up bow-legged and commonplace -- all spink and no milton as plain john he would pass through life happy and unnoticed but the great name of milton hang about he like a jest from which he can never escape -- no not even in the grave for it will be continue there until the lichen have cover the name on the headstone with stealthy and kindly oblivion it be a good rule i think to avoid the fanciful in name so few of we child be go to be hero or sage that we should be careful not to stamp they with the mark of greatness at the outset of the journey horatio be a happy stroke for nelson but how few horatio win immortality or deserve it and how disastrous if horatio turn out a knave and a coward if young spink have any miltonic fire within he it will shine through plain john more naturally and lustrously than through any borrow patronymic you may be as humble as you like and john will fit you : as illustrious as you like and john will blaze as splendid as you deed link you with that great order of nobility of which john milton john hampden and john bright be type i have write thus far when it occur to I that i have still my own name to choose and that soon the whistle of the postman would be hear in the street i go out into the orchard to take counsel with the star the far horizon be still stain wine-red with the last ember of the day northward over the shoulder of the hill the yellow moon be rise full-orbed into the night sky and the firmament glitter with a thousand lamp how near and familiar they seem to one in the solitude of the country in the town we vision be limit to the street we see only the light of the pavement and hear only the rattle of the unceasing traffic the star seem infinitely remove from we life but here they be like old neighbor for whom we never look in vain intimate though eternal friendly and companionable though far off there be orion come over the hill and there the many-jewelled pleiade and across the great central dome of the sky the vast triangle form by the pole star golden arcturus -lrb- not now visible -rrb- and ice-blue vega but these be not name for I better be those homely sound that link the pageant of night with the immemorial life of the field arcturus be alpha of the herdsman shall it be that and then my eye rove westward to where the great bear hang head downward as if to devour the earth great bear charle 's wain the plough the dipper the chariot of david -- with what fancy the human mind through all the age have play with that glorious constellation let my fancy play with it too there at the head of the plough flame the great star that point to the pole i will hitch my little waggon to that sublime image i will be alpha of the plough on letter-writing two soldier evidently brother stand at the door of the railway carriage -- one inside the compartment the other on the platform now you will not forget to write bill say the latter no say bill i shall be back at -- tonight and i 'll write all round to-morrow but lor what a job there be mother and the missus and bob and sarah and aunt jane and uncle jim and -- well you know the lot you have have to do it sam yes say sam ruefully it be a fair teaser and if you write to one and miss another they be offend continued bill but i always mention all of 'em i say ` love to sarah ' and ` hope aunt jane 's cold 's better ' and that sort of thing and that fill out a page but i be blow if i can find anything else to say i just begin ` hope this find you well as it leave I at present ' and then i be do what else be there to say nothing say sam mournfully i just sit and scratch my head over the bless paper but nothing 'll come seem as though my head 's as empty as a drum same here ` tis not like write love-letter when i be up to that game 'twa easy enough when i get stick i just put in half a page of cross and that fill up fine but write to mother and the missus and sarah and jim and the rest be different you can not fill up with cross it would look ridiklus it would say sam then the train begin to move and the soldier in the train sink back on he seat take out a cigarette and begin to smoke i find he have be twice out at the front and be now home on sick leave he have be at the battle of mon through the retreat to the marne the advance to the aisne the first battle of ypre and the fighting at festubert in a word he have see some of the greatest event in the world 's history face to face and yet he confess that when he come to write a letter even to he wife he could find nothing to say he be in the position of the lady mention by horace walpole whose letter to she husband begin and end thus : i write to you because i have nothing to do : i finish because i have nothing to say i suppose there have never be so much letter-writing in the world as be go on to-day and much of it be good writing as the papers show but the case of my companion in the train be the case of thousand and ten of thousand of young fellow who for the first time in they life want to write and discover that they have no gift of self-expression it be not that they be stupid it be that somehow the act of write paralysis they they can not condense the atmosphere in which they live to the concrete word you have to draw they out they need a friendly lead when they have get that they can talk well enough but without it they be dumb in the great sense letter-writing be no doubt a lost art it be kill by the penny post and modern hurry when madame de sévigny cowper horace walpole byron lamb and the carlyle write they immortal letter the world be a leisurely place where there be time to indulge in the luxury of write to you friend and the cost of franking a letter make that letter a serious affair if you could only send a letter once in a month or six month and then at heavy expense it become a matter of first-rate consequence the poor of course could not enjoy the luxury of letter-writing at all de quincey tell we how the dalesman of lakeland a century ago use to dodge the postal charge the letter that come by stage coach be receive at the door by the poor mother who glance at the superscription see from a certain agree sign on it that tom or jim be well and hand it back to the carrier unopened in those day a letter be a event now when you can send a letter half round the globe for a penny and when the postman call half a dozen time a day few of we take letter-writing seriously carlyle saw that the advent of the penny post would kill the letter by make it cheap i shall send a penny letter next time he write to he mother when the cheap postage be about to come in and he foretell that people would not bother to write good letter when they could send they for next to nothing he be right and the telegraph the telephone and the postcard have complete the destruction of the art of letter-writing it be the difficulty or the scarcity of a thing that make it treasured if diamond be as plentiful as pebble we should not stoop to pick they up but the case of bill and sam and thousand of they comrade to-day be different they do not want to write literary letter but they do want to tell the folk at home something about they life and the great thing of which they be a part but the great thing be too great for they they can not put they into word and they ought not to try for the secret of letter-writing be intimate triviality bill could not have describe the retreat from mon but he could have tell as he tell I about the blister he get on he heel how he hunger for a smoke how he march and march until he fall asleep march how he lose he pal at le cateau and how he boot sole drop off at meaux and through such triviality he would have give a living picture of the great retreat in short to write a good letter you must approach the job in the lightest and most casual way you must be personal not abstract you must not say this be too small a thing to put down you must say this be just the sort of small thing we talk about at home if i tell they this they will see I as it be they 'll hear my voice they 'll know what i be about that be the purpose of a letter keat express the idea very well in one of those voluminous letter which he write to he brother george and he wife in america and in which he pour out the wealth of family affection which be one of the most amiable feature of he character he have describe how he have be to see he mother how she have laugh at he bad joke how they go out to tea at mr millar 's and how in go they be strike with the light and shade through the gateway at the horse guard and he go on : i intend to write you such volume that it will be impossible for I to keep any order or method in what i write that will come first which be uppermost in my mind not that which be uppermost in my heart -- besides i should wish to give you a picture of we life here whenever by a touch i can do it even as you must see by the last sentence we walk past whitehall all in good health and spirit -- this i be certain of because i feel so much pleasure from the simple idea of you play a game of cricket there be the recipe by one of the master of the craft a letter write in this vein annihilate distance it continue the personal gossip the intimate communion that have be interrupt by separation it preserve one 's presence in absence it can not be too simple too commonplace too colloquial its familiarity be not its weakness but its supreme virtue if it attempt to be orderly and stately and elaborate it may be a good essay but it will certainly be a bad letter on reading in bed among the few legacy that my father leave I be a great talent for sleep i think i can say without boast that in a sleep match i could do as well as any man i can sleep long i can sleep often and i can sleep sound when i put my head on the pillow i pass into a fathomless peace where no dream come and about eight hour later i emerge to consciousness as though i have come up from the deep of infinity that be my normal way but occasionally i have period of wakefulness in the middle of the night my sleep be then divide into two chapter and between the chapter there be a slab of unmitigated dreariness it be my hour of pessimism the tide have ebb the water be dead-low and there be a vista of endless mud it be then that this tragi-comedy of life touch bottom and i see the heaven all hang with black i despair of humanity i despair of the war i despair of myself there be not one gleam of light in all the sad landscape and the abyss seem wait at my foot to swallow I up with everything that i cherish it be no use say to this demon of the darkness that i know he be a humbug a mere dismal jemmy of the brain who sit there croak like a night owl or a tenth-rate journalist my dismal jemmy be not to be exorcise by argument he can only be drive out by a little sane companionship so i turn on a light and call for one of my bedside friend they stand there in noble comradeship ready to talk willing to remain silent only ask to do my pleasure oh bless be the name of gutenberg the master printer a german i care not even if he have be a prussian -- which i rejoice to think he be not -- i would still say : bless be the name of gutenberg though sir richard cooper mp send I to the tower for it for gutenberg be the prometheus not of legend but of history he bring down the sacred flame and scatter the darkness that lay on the face of the water he give we the _ daily owl _ it be true but he make we also freeman of time and think companion of the saint and the sage sharer in the wisdom and the laughter of the age thanks to he i can for the expenditure of a few shilling hear homer sing and socrate talk and rabelai laugh i can go chivy the sheep with don quixote and roam the hill with borrow i can carry the whole universe of shakespeare in my pocket and call up spirit to drive dismal jemmy from my pillow who be these spirit in choose they it be necessary to avoid the deep-browed argumentative fellow i do not want plato or gibbon or any of the learn brotherhood by my bedside nor the poet nor the novelist nor the dramatist nor even the professional humorist these be all capital fellow in they way but let they stay downstairs to the intimacy of the bedside i admit only the kindly fellow who come in they dressing-gown and slipper so to speak and sit down and just talk to you as though they have know you ever since you be a little nipper and you father and you grandfather before you of course there be old montaigne what a glorious gossip he be what strange thing he have to tell you what a noble candor he show he turn out he mind as carelessly as a boy turn out he pocket and give you the run of he whole estate you may wander everywhere and never see a board warning you to keep off the grass or remind you that you be a trespasser and bozzy who could do without bozzy by he bedside -- dear garrulous old bozzy most splendid of toady most miraculous of reporter when bozzy begin to talk to I and the old doctor growl sir all the worry and anxiety of life fall magically away and dismal jemmy vanish like the ghost at cock-crow i be no longer imprison in time and the flesh : i be of the company of the immortal i share they triumphant aloofness from the play that fill we stage and see its place in the scheme of the unending drama of man that sly rogue pepy of course be there -- more thumb-stained than any of they except bozzy what a miracle be this man who live more vividly in we eye than any creature that ever walk the earth what be the secret of he magic be it not this that he succeed in put down on paper the real truth about himself a small thing well you try it you will find it the hardest job you have ever tackle no matter what secrecy you adopt you will discover that you can not tell yourself the _ whole truth _ about yourself pepy do that benvenuto cellinus pretend to do that but i refuse to believe the fellow benjamin franklin try to do it and very nearly succeed st augustine be frank enough about he early wickedness but it be the overcharge frankness of the subsequent saint no pepy be the man he do the thing better than it have ever be do in this world i like to have the _ paston letter _ at my bedside too then i go off to sleep again in the fifteenth century with the voice of old agne paston sound in my ear dead half a thousand year yet across the gulf of time i hear the painful scratch of she quill as she send goddi blyssyng to she son in london and tell he all she motherly gossip and make the rough life of far-off tudor england live for ever dear old agne she little think as she struggle with she spelling and she pen that she be write something that be immortal if she have know i do not think she would have bother she be a very matter-of-fact old lady and be too full of worry to have much room for vanity i should like to say more about my bedside friend -- strapping george borrow sit with petulengro 's sister under the hedge or fight the flaming tinman the dear little boston doctor who talk so chirpily over the breakfast table the _ compleat angler _ that take you out into a eternal may morning and sainte-beuve whom i have find a first-rate bedside talker but i must close there be one word however to be add you bedside friend should be dress in soft leather and print on thin paper then you can talk to they quite snugly it be a great nuisance if you have to stick you arm out of bed and hold you hand rigid on cat and dog a friend of mine call to see I the other day and observe my faithful airedale -- quilp by name -- whose tail be in a state of violent emotion at the prospect of a walk remark that when the new tax come in i should have to pay a guinea for the privilege of keep that dog i say i hope that mr mckenna would do nothing so foolish in fact i say i be sure he will do nothing so foolish i know he well and i have always find he a sensible man let he say i tax we all fairly accord to we income but why should he interfere with the way in which we spend the money that he leave we why should he deny the friendship of that most friendly animal the dog to a poor man and make it the exclusive possession of the well-to-do the emotion of quilp 's tail keep pace with the fervor of my remark he know that he be the subject of the conversation and he large brown eye gleam with intelligence and he expressive eyebrow be eloquent of self-pity and appeal he be satisfy that whatever the issue i be on he side and at half a hint he would have give my friend a taste of the rough side of he tongue but he be a well-mannered brute and know how to restrain he feeling in company what would be the result of you high tax i continue with passion it would be a blow at the democracy of dog it would reduce the whole of dogdom to a pampered class of degenerate be there anything more odious than the spectacle of a fat woman in fur nurse a lap dog in fur too it be as degrade to the noble family of dog as a footman in gold button and gold braid be to the human family but it be just these degenerate whom a high tax would protect honest fellow like quilp here -lrb- more triumphant tail flourish -rrb- dog that love you like a brother that will run for you carry for you bark for you whose candor be so transparent and whose faithfulness have be the theme of countless poet -- dog like these would be tax out of existence now cat i continue -- -lrb- at the thrilling word quilp become tense with excitement -rrb- cat be another affair personally i do not care two penny if mr mckenna tax they a guinea a whisker there be only one moment in the life of a cat that be tolerable and that be when it be not a cat but a kitten who be the frenchman who say that woman ought to be bear at seventeen and die at thirty cat ought to die when they cease to be kitten and become cat cat say my friend coldly be the spiritual superior of dog the dog be a flunkey a serf a underling a creature that be eternally watch its master look at quilp at this moment what a spectacle of servility you do not see cat make themselves the slave of man they like to be stroke but they have no affection for the hand that stroke they they be not parasite but independent soul go they own way live they own life indifferent to applause call no man master that be why the french consider they so superior to dog i do not care what the french think i say with warmth but they be we ally say my friend severely the german on the other hand prefer dog i hope you be not a pro-german on the cat-and-dog issue i be and i do not care who know it i say recklessly and i hate these attempt to drag in prejudice moreover i would beg you to observe that it be a great frenchman none other than pascal who pay the highest of all tribute to the dog the more i see of man he say the better i like dog i challenge you to produce from any french source such a encomium on the cat no i continue the dog be a generous warmhearted chivalrous fellow who will play with you mourn for you or die for you why literature be full of he heroism who have climb helvellyn without be haunt by that shepherd 's dog that inspire scott and byron or the pass of st bernard without remember the faithful hound of the great monastery but the cat be a secret and alien creature selfish and mysterious a dr jekyll and mr hyde see she purring on the hearth-rug in front of the fire and she seem the picture of innocence and guileless content all a blind my dear fellow all a blind wait till night come then where be demure mistress puss be she at home keep vigil with the good dog tray no the house may be in blaze or ransack by burglar for all she care she be out on the tile and in back garden pursue she unholy ritual -- that strange ritual that seem so oriental so sinister so full of devilish purpose i can understand the old association of witchcraft with cat the sight of cat almost make I believe in witchcraft in spite of myself i can believe anything about a cat she be heartless and mercenary she name have become the synonym of everything that be mean spiteful and vicious a old cat be the unkindest thing you can say about a woman but the dog wear he heart on he sleeve he life be as open as the day he have he indecorum but he have no secret you may see the worst of he at a glance but the best of he be inexhaustible a cat be as remote from you life as a lizard but a dog be as intimate as you own thought or you own shadow and he loyalty be one of the consolation of a disloyal world you remember that remark of charle reade 's : he be only a man but he be as faithful as a dog it be the highest tribute he could pay to he hero -- that he be as faithful as a dog and think of he service -- see he draw he cart in belgium round up the sheep into the fold on the yorkshire fell tend the cattle by the highway warning off the night prowler from the lonely homestead always alert always obedient always the friend of man be he never so friendless shall we go for a walk at the joyous word quilp leap on I with a frenzied demonstration good dog i say if mr mckenna put a guinea tax on you i 'll never say a good word for he again wg the worst of spending week-end in the country in these anxious day be the difficulty of get news about six o'clock on Saturday evening i be seize with a furious hunger what have happen on the east front what on the west what in serbium have greece make up its heroic mind be rumanium still tremble on the brink what do the french communiqué say these and a hundred other question descend on I with frightful insistence clearly i can not go to bed without have they answer but there be not a evening paper to be get nearer than the little railway station in the valley two mile away and there be no way of get it except by shank ' mare and so unable to resist the glamour of _ the star _ i start out across the field for the station as i stand on the platform last Saturday evening devour the latest war news under the dim oil lamp a voice behind I say in broad rural accent bill i say wg be dead at the word i turn hastily to another column and find the news that have stir he and even in the midst of world-shaking event it stir I too for a brief moment i forget the war and be back in that cheerful world where we use to be happy where we greet the rise sun with light heart and see its setting without fear in that cheerful world i can hardly recall a time when a big man with a black beard be not my king i first see he in the ` seventy i be a small boy then and i do he the honor of play truant -- play wag we call it i feel that the occasion demand it to have the god of my idolatry in my own little town and not to pay he my devotions -- why the idea be almost like blasphemy a half-dozen or even a dozen from my easily infuriate master would be a small price to pay i should take the stripe as a homage to the hero he would never know but i should be proud to suffer in he honor unfortunately there be a canvas round the field where the hero play and as the mark of the mint be absent from my pocket i be on the wrong side of the canvas but i know a spot where by lie flat on you stomach and keep you head very low you could see under the canvas and get a view of the wicket it be not a comfortable position but i see the king i think i be a little disappointed that there be nothing supernatural about he appearance and that there be no portent in the heaven to announce he come it do not seem quite right somehow in a general way i know he be only a man but i be quite prepared to see something tremendous happen the sun to dance or the earth to heave when he appear i never feel the indifference of nature to the affair of man so acutely i see he many time afterwards and i suppose i owe more undiluted happiness to he than to any man that ever live for he be the genial tyrant in a world that be all sunshine there be other game no doubt which will give you as much exercise and pleasure in play they as cricket but there be no game that fill the mind with such memory and seem envelop in such a gracious and kindly atmosphere if you have once love it and play it you will find talk in it enough for the wear out of six fashion as falstaff say i like a man who have cricket in he soul i find i be prejudice in he favor and be dispose to disbelieve any ill about he i think my affection for jorkin begin with the discovery that he like myself see that astounding catch with which ulyett dismiss bonnor in the australian match at lord 's in 1883 -- or be it 1884 and when to this mutual and immortal memory we add the discovery that we be both at the oval at the memorable match when crossland rattle surrey out like ninepin and the crowd mob he and key and roller miraculously pull the game out of the fire we friendship be seal the fine thing about a wrangle on cricket be that there be no bitterness in it when you talk about politician you be always on the brink of bad temper when you disagree about the relative merit of wb yeat or franci thompson you be afflict with scorn for the other 's lack of perception but you may quarrel about cricketer and love each other all the time for example i be prepare to stand up in a truly christian spirit to the bowling of anybody in defense of my belief that -- next to he of the black beard -- lohmann be the most naturally gifted all-round cricketer there have ever be what grace of action he have what a instinct for the weak spot of he opponent what a sense for fitting the action to the moment above all what a gallant spirit he play the game in and that after all be the real test of the great cricketer it be the man who bring the spirit of adventure into the game that i want of the quaife and the scotton and the barlow i have nothing but dreary memory they do not mean cricket to I and even shrewsbury and hayward leave I cold they be too faultily faultless too icily regular for my taste they play cricket not as though it be a game but as though it be a proposition in euclid and i do not like euclid it be the hearty joyousness that wg shed around he that make he so dear to we youngster of all age i will admit if you like that ranjitsinhjus at he best be more of a magician with the bat that johnny brigg make you laugh more with he wonderful antic that ap luca have more finish palairet more grace and so on but it be the abundance of the old man with the black beard that be so wonderful you never come to the end of he he be like a generous roast of beef -- you could cut and come again and go on come other man flit across we sky like meteor but he shine on like the sun in the heaven and like the sun in the heaven he scatter largesse over the land he do not seem so much a man as a institution a symbol of summer and all its joy a sort of father christmas clothe in flannel and sunshine it do you good merely to look at he it make you feel happy to see such a huge capacity for enjoyment such mighty subtlety such ponderous gaiety it be as though jove or vulcan or some other god of antiquity have come down to play game with the mortal you would not have be much surprised if when the shadow lengthen across the greensward and the umpire signal that the day 's play be do he have wrap himself in a cloud of glory and float away to olympus and now he be go indeed and it seem as though a part and that a very happy part of my life have go with he when sanity return to the earth there will arise other deity of the cricket field but not for I never again shall i recapture the careless rapture that come with the vision of the yellow cap flaming above the black beard of the herculean frame and the mighty bared arm and all the godlike apparition of the master as i turn out of the little station and pass through the field and climb the hill i feel that the darkness that have come upon the earth in these day have take a deeper shade of gloom for even the light of the happy past be be quench on see vision the postman -lrb- or rather the postwoman -rrb- bring I among other thing this morning a little paper call _ the superman _ which i find be devote to the star the line of the hand and similar mystery i gather from it that althea a normal clairvoyant and other seer have visit the planet -- in they astral body of course -- to make inquiry on various aspect of the war althea and the other seer seem to have have quite a busy time run about among the star and talk to the inhabitant about the trouble in we particular orb they seem really to have get to the bottom of thing it appear that there be a row go on between lucifer and arniel lucifer be a fall planetary god whose lust for power have drive he from he seat of authority as ruler of jupiter he be the evil genius overshadow the kaiser and be strive to possess this world so that he may pass it on to jupiter and eventually blot out the solar logo etc etc i do not know who send I this paper or for what purpose but let I say that it be sheer waste of postage stamp and material i hope i be not intolerant of the opinion of other but i confess that when people talk to I about read the star and the line of the hand and thing of that sort i shut up like a oyster i do not speak of the humbug who deliberately exploit the credulity of fool i speak of the sincere believer -- people like my dear old friend wt stead who be the most extraordinary combination of wisdom and moonshine i have ever know he would startle you at one moment by he penetrate handling of the fact of a great situation and the next moment would make you speechless with some staggering story of spirit visitor or starry conspiracy that seem to he just as actual as the pavement on which he walk i be not at home in this atmosphere of mystery it be not that i do not share the feeling out of which it be bear i do thoreau say he would give all he possess for one true vision and so long as we be spiritually alive we must all have some sense of expectancy that the curtain will lift and that we shall look out with eye of wonder on the hidden meaning of this strange adventure upon which we be embark for thousand of year we have be wander in this wilderness of the world and speculate about why we be here where we be go and what it be all about it can never have be a greater puzzle than now when we be all busily engage in kill each other and at every stage there have be those who have cry lo here and lo there and have call man to witness that they have read the riddle and have tear the secret from the heart of the great mystery and so long as man can feel and think the quest will go on we could not cease that quest if we would and we would not if we could for without it all the meaning would have go out of life and we should be no more than the cattle in the field nor be the quest in vain we follow this trail and that catch at this hint of a meaning and that gleam of vision and though we find this path end in a cul-de-sac and that bring we back to the place from whence we start we be learn all the time about the mystery of we wilderness and one day perhaps -- suddenly it may be as that vision of the great white mountain of the oberland break upon the sight of the traveller -- we shall see whither the long adventure lead say not the struggle naught availeth say a poet who be not give to cultivate illusion and he go on : -- for while the tired wave vainly break seem here no painful inch to gain far back through creek and inlet make come silent flooding in the main but though i want to see a vision as much as anybody i be out of touch with the company of the credulous i be with doubt thoma i have no capacity for believe the impossible and have a entire distrust of dark room and magic people with bee in they bonnet leave I wonder but cold i know a man -- a most excellent man -- whose life be a perfect debauch of vision and revelation he seem to discover the philosopher 's stone every other day sometimes it be brown bread that be the way to salvation if you eat brown bread you will never die or at any rate you will live until everybody be tire of you sometimes it be a new tax or a new sort of bath that be the secret key to the whole contraption for one period he could talk of nothing but dry milk for another acetic acid be the thing rub yourself with acetic acid and you would be as invulnerable to the ill of the body as achille be after he have be dip by theti in the water of styx the star tell he anything he wish to believe and he can conjure up spirit as easily as another man can order a cab it be not that he be a fool in practical affair he be astonishingly astute it be that he have a illimitable capacity for belief he be always on the road to damascus for my part i be content to wait i be for wordsworth 's creed of wise passiveness i should as soon think of read my destiny on the sole of my boot as in the palm of my hand the one would be just as illuminating as the other it would tell I what i choose to make it tell I that and no more and so with the star people who pretend to read the riddle of we affair in the pageant of the star be deceive themselves or be try to deceive other they be give they own little fancy the sanction of the universe the butterfly that i see flit about in the sunshine outside might as well read the european war as a comment on its aimless little life the star do not chatter about we but they have a balm for we if we will be silent the huge and thoughtful night speak a language simple August universal it be one of the smaller consolation of the war that it have give we in london a chance of hearing that language the lamp of the street be blot out and the lamp above be visible five night of the week all the year round i take the last bus that go northward from the city and from the back seat on the top i watch the great procession of the star it be the most astonishing spectacle offer to man emerson say that if we only see it once in a hundred year we should spend year in prepare for the vision it be hang out for we every night and we hardly give it a glance and yet it be well worth glance at it be the best corrective for this agitate little mad-house in which we dwell and quarrel and fight and die it give we a new scale of measurement and a new order of idea even the war seem only a local affair of some ill-governed asylum in the presence of this order march of illimitable world i do not worry about the vision i do not badger the star to give I they view about the war it be enough to see and feel and be silent and now i hope althea will waste no more postage stamp in send I she desecrate gibberish on black sheep when i be in france a few week ago i hear much about the relative quality of different class of man as soldier and one of the most frequent theme be the excellence of the black sheep it be not merely that he be brave that one might expect it be not even that he be unselfish that also do not arouse surprise the pride in he i find be chiefly due to the fact that he be so good a soldier in the sense of discipline enthusiasm keenness even intelligence it be i believe a well-ascertained fact that a unusually high proportion of reformatory boy and other socially doubtful man have win reward for exceptional deed and every one know the case of the man with twenty-seven conviction against he who win the vc for one of the bravest act of the war it must not be assume from this that to be a successful soldier you must be a social failure on the contrary nothing have be so conclusively prove by this war as the widespread prevalence of the soldierly instinct hero have spring up from all rank and all calling -- from draper ' shop and furniture van from stool in the city and loom in lancashire from durham pit and bishop ' palace whatever else the war have do it have knock on the head the idea that the cult of militarism be necessary to preserve the soul of courage and chivalry in a people we with a wholly civic tradition have show that in the hour of need we can draw upon a infinite reservoir of heroism as splendid as anything in the annals of the human race but the case of the black sheep have a special significance for we the war have discover the good that be in he and have release it for useful service after all the black sheep be often only black by the accident of circumstance upbringing or association he be a misfit in he as in all of we there be a infinite complexity -- good and ill together no one who have faithfully examine he own life can doubt how trifling a weight turn the scale for or against we a accidental meeting a casual friendship a phrase in a book -- and the current of life take a definite direction this way or that there be no doubt people in whom the element be so perfectly adjust that the balance be never in doubt they character be superior to circumstance but they be rare they be the star that dwell apart from we human struggle most of we know what it be to be on the brink of the precipice -- know if we be quite honest with ourselves how narrow a shave we have have from join the black sheep perhaps if we be still honest with ourselves we shall admit that the thing that turn the balance for we be not a very creditable thing -- that we be protect from ourselves not by any high virtue but by something mean a touch of cowardice a paltry ambition a consideration that we should be ashamed to confess we be so strangely compact that we do not ourselves know what the ordeal will discover in we you have no doubt read that incident of the sergeant who in a moment of panic flee be place under arrest and sentence to be shoot before the sentence be ratify by the commander-in-chief there come a moment of extreme peril to the line when irretrievable disaster be imminent and every man who could fill a gap be need the condemn man be call out to face the enemy and even in the midst of brave man fight with a bravery that single he out for the victorium cross tell I -- which be the true man i see the other day a letter from a famous doctor deal with the question of the psychology of war he be against shoot a man for cowardice because cowardice be not necessarily a quality of character it be often a temporary collapse due to physical fatigue or a pass condition of mind five time he say i have be at work in circumstance in which my life be in imminent peril on four occasion i work with a curious sense of exaltation on the fifth occasion i be seize with a sudden and unreasoning panic that paralyse I perhaps it be a failure of digestion perhaps a want of sleep anyhow at that moment i be a coward the truth be that except for the aforesaid star who dwell apart we all have the potential saint and the potential sinner the hero and the coward the honest man and the dishonest man within we there be a fine poem in _ a shropshire lad _ that put the case of the black sheep as pregnantly as it can be put : -- there sleep in shrewsbury gaol to-night or wake as may betide a better lad if thing go right than most that sleep outside if thing go right do not i pray you think that in say this i be hold the candle to that deadly doctrine of determinism or that like the tragic novelist i see man only as a pitiful animal catch in the trap of blind circumstance if i believe that i should say better dead but what i do say be that we be so variously compose that circumstance do play a powerful part in give rein to this or that element in we and make the scale go down for good or bad and that often the best of we only miss the wrong turning by a hair 's breadth dirt it be say be only matter in the wrong place put it in the right place and it cease to be dirt give that man with twenty-seven conviction against he a chance of reveal the better metal that be in he and lo he be hail as a hero and decorate with the vc the village and the war well have you hear the news it be the landlord of the blue boar who speak he stop I in the village street -- if you can call a straggle lane with a score of thatched cottage and half a dozen barn a street -- evidently burst with great tiding he be a old soldier himself and he view on the war be hold in great esteem i have not hear the news but whatever it be i could see from the landlord 's immense smile that there be nothing to fear jim have get a commission say the landlord and he say it in a tone that leave no doubt that now thing would begin to move for jim be he son a sergeant-major in the artillery who have be out at the front ever since mon the news have create quite a sensation but we be get so use to sensation now that we be become _ blasé _ there have never be such a year of wonder in the memory of any one live the other day thousand of soldier from the great camp ten mile away descend on we terrain -- i think that be the word -- and have a tremendous two-day ' battle in the hill about we they break through the hedge and sleep in the cornfield and ravish the apple-tree in my orchard and raid the cottager for tea and tramp to and fro in we street and give we the time of we life _ i _ never seed such a sight in _ my _ life say old benjamin to I in the evening man and boy i have live in that there bungalow for eighty-five year come michaelma and _ i _ never seed the like o ' _ this _ before yes eighty-five year come michaelma and my father have that there land on a peppercorn rent and the way he lose it be like this -- happily at this moment there be a sudden alarum among the soldier and i be able to dodge the familiar rehearsal of old benjamin 's grievance and who would ever have dream that we should live to hear french talk in we street as a familiar form of speech but we have in a little cottage at the other end of the village be a family of belgian a fragment of the flotsam throw up by the great inundation of 1914 they have bring the story of frightfulness near to we for they pass through the terror of louvain hiding in the cellar for night and day have two of they child kill and escape to the coast on foot every Sunday night you will see they very busy carry they few chair and table into a neighbouring barn for on Monday morning mass be celebrate there the priest come up in a country cart from ten mile away and the refugee scatter for mile around assemble for worship after which there be a tremendous pow-pow in french and flemish with much laughter and gaiety old benjamin do not hold with they priest and he have grave suspicion about all foreign tongue but the belgian have become quite a part of we and they child be learn to lisp in english down at the school in the valley much less agreeable be the frame of mind towards the occupant of the cottage next to the blue boar they be the wife and child of a german who have work in this country for many year and be now in america the woman be english and amiable but the proximity of anything so reminiscent of germany be painful to the village and especially to the landlord whose view about german can hardly be put into word i should hope there 'll be no prisoner take after _ this _ he say grimly whenever he hear of a new outrage vermin -- that be what they be he say and they should be treat according-ly the german in fact have become the substitute for every term of execration even with mild david the labourer he come into the orchard last evening stagger under a 15-ft ladder we have decide that if we be go to have the pear before the wasp have spoil they we must pick they at once it be a wunnerful crop say david i have know this pear-tree -lrb- look up at one of they from the foot of he ladder -rrb- for twenty-five year and i have never see such a crop on it afore then he mount the ladder and begin to pick the fruit well i be blow he say if they be not be at 'em a ` ready and he fling down pear after pear scoop out by the wasp close to the stalk reg ` lar german -- that be what they be he say look at 'em round that hive he go on they 'll hev all the honey and they bee will starve and git the isle o ' wight -- that be what they 'll git lor he add reflectively i dunno what wosps be make for -- wosps _ and _ german it git over I i say it get over I too and then from among the branch while i hang on to the foot of the ladder to keep it firm david unbosomed he disquiet to I about enlist most o ' the chap round here have go he say a ' i do not like stay be'ind seem as though you be hang back like ` taint that i should not like to go but it be this way -lrb- hullo i get my hand on a wasp that time -rrb- there be such a lot o ' women-folk dependent on I there be my wife and there be my mother down the village _ and _ my aunt and not a man to do anything for 'em but I after my work on th ' farm i keep all three garden go and a patch of allotment down the valley as well you be grow a lot of good food and that be military work i say he seem cheer by the idea and ask I if i would like to see the potato he have dig up that evening -- they be a wunnerful fine lot he say so after he have strip the pear-tree he shoulder the ladder and we go down the village to david 's garden there i see he potato some lie to dry where they have be dig up other in sack also he marrow and bean and cabbage and lettuce a little apologetically he offer I some of the largest potato -- just as a hobby he say meaning thereby that it be only a trifle he offer as i go away in the gathering dark with my hand full of potato i meet the landlord of the blue boar he shirt sleeve roll up as usual above he brown muscular arm bad news that about mr lummi he say look towards the cottage on the other side of the road what be that say i she son there have be no news of he for two month yes poor jack she be get news that he be kill near la bassée in June nice feller -- and she only son then more cheerfully he add jim 's come home to-morrow go to get he officer 's rig out you know and have a rest -- the first since he go out a year ago you 'll be glad to see he say i not half say he with a vast smile on rumor i be speak the other day to a man of cautious mind on a subject of current rumor well he say if i have be ask whether i believe such evidence four month ago i should have say ` certainly ' but after the great russian myth i believe nothing that i can not prove i believe in that army of ghost that come from archangel there be people who say they do not believe in it some of they believe they do not believe in it but i say defiantly that i do believe in it and i say further that there be never a rumor in the world that seem base upon more various or more convincing evidence and it be not true well i find i be a changed man i find i be no longer a believer : i be a doubter this experience i suppose be not uncommon the man who believe as easily to-day as he do six month ago be a man on whom lesson be throw away we have live in a world of gigantic whisper and most of they have be false whisper even the magic word official leave one cold it be not what i be officially tell that interest I : it be what i be officially not tell that i want to know in order to arrive at the truth you remember that famous answer of the plaintiff in a action against a london paper year ago what do you tell he i tell he to tell the truth the whole truth no _ select truth _ what we have to guard against in this matter of rumor be the natural tendency to believe what we want to believe take that case of the report victory in poland in November 1914 there be strong reason to believe that a large part of hindenburg 's army narrowly escape be encircle that have rennenkampf come up to time the trick would have be do but it be not do yet nearly every correspondent in petrograd send the most confident news of a overwhelming victory the _ morning post _ correspondent speak of it as something terrible but sublime there have be nothing like it since napoleon leave the bone of half a million man behind he in russium even lord kitchener in the house of lord say that russium have accomplish the greatest achievement of the war and so just afterwards with the equally empty rumor of hindenburg 's victory which send berlin into such a frenzy of rejoice it believe without evidence because it want to believe and another fruitful source of rumor be fear the famous concrete emplacement at maubeuge will serve as a instance we have the most elaborate detail of how the property be acquire by german agent how in secret the concrete platform be lay down and how the great 42-cm howitzer shell maubeuge from it and instantly we hear of concrete emplacement in this country -- at willesden edinburgh and elsewhere we begin to suspect every one who have a garage or a machine shop with a concrete foundation of be a german agent i confess that i share these suspicion in regard to a certain factory overlook london and could not wholly argue myself out of they though i have not a atom of evidence beyond the fact that the building have be own by german and have a commanding position i be under the hypnotism of maubeuge and the fear to which it give birth yet there never be a concrete emplacement at maubeuge and no 42-cm howitzer be use against that fortress the property belong not to german agent but to respectable frenchman and the apology of the _ matin _ for the libel upon they may be read by anybody who be interested in these myth of the war i refer to this subject to-day not to recall these historic fable but to show what cruel wrong we may do to the innocent by accept rumor about we neighbor without examine the fact be there ever a more pitiful story than that tell at the inquest on a elderly woman at henham in suffolk she husband have be the village schoolmaster for twenty-eight year the couple have a son whom they send to germany to learn the language the average village schoolmaster have not much money for luxury and i can imagine the couple screw and save to give they boy a good start in life when he have finish he training he set out to seek he fortune in south america and there in far guatemalum he become a teacher of language when the war break out he hear the call of the motherland to she child and like thousand of other come back to fight but in the meantime the lie tongue of rumor have be busy with he name in he native village it be say that he be a officer in the german army and on the strength of that rumor he parent be order by the chief constable to leave the village and not to dwell on the east coast it be a sentence of death on they the order break the old man 's heart and he commit suicide the son arrive to find he father dead and he mother distract by she bereavement he take she away to the seaside for a rest but on they return to the village she too committed suicide and the jury do not say kill by slander : they say suicide while of unsound mind oh cautious juryman how do rumor get abroad there be many way let I illustrate one of they in he criticism of the war the other week mr belloc say : the official german communiqué which appear in print last Saturday be a very good example upon which to work i quote it as it appear in the _ westminster gazette -lrb- which have from the beginning of the war and even before its outbreak be remarkable for the volume of its german information _ -rrb- and as it be deliver through the marconus channel then follow the communiqué now when i read this i smile for i love the subtlety of the ingenious mr belloc he quote a document which appear in every paper in the country but he say he quote it from the _ westminster gazette _ why since it appear everywhere do he mention one paper obviously in order to make that parenthetical remark which i have italicise now the reputation of the _ westminster _ stand too high to be affect by the suggestion that it be remarkable -- which it be not -- for its german information but suppose you a mere ordinary citizen be allege by some one to have special intercourse with germany at this time you might be as innocent as that suffolk schoolmaster but that would not save you from the suspicion of you neighbor and perhaps the attention of the chief constable let I give another little illustration a friend of mine who happen to be a liberal journalist go to a private dinner recently to meet m painlevé the french academician senator lafontaine of brussels and two other french and belgian deputy the next morning he be state in the _ daily express _ -lrb- edit by mr blumenfeld -rrb- to have dine with _ three or four foreigner _ for the purpose of discuss peace and in the next issue of the _ london mail _ the question be ask who be the foreigner with whom ------ dine you see the insinuation you see how the idea grow he do not reply because there be some papers that one can afford to ignore no matter what they say but i mention the thing here to show how a legend be launch and the moral of all this it be that of my friend whom i have quote let we suspect all rumor whether about event or person when napoleon 's marshal tell he they have win a victory he say show I you prisoner when you be tell a rumor do not swallow it like a hungry pike say show I you fact and before you accept they be sure they be whole fact and not half fact on umbrella moral a sharp shower come on as i walk along the strand but i do not put up my umbrella the truth be i could not put up my umbrella the frame would not work for one thing and if it have work i would not have put the thing up for i would no more be see under such a travesty of a umbrella than falstaff would be see march through coventry with he regiment of ragamuffin the fact be the umbrella be not my umbrella at all it be the umbrella of some person who i hope will read these line he have get my silk umbrella i have get the cotton one he leave in exchange i imagine he flaunt along the strand under my umbrella and throw a scornful glance at the fellow who be carry he abomination and get wet into the bargain i daresay the rascal chuckle as he eye the say abomination ah he say gaily to himself i do you in that time old boy i know that thing it will not open for nut and it fold up like a sack now this umbrella but i leave he to he unrighteous communing he be one of those people who have what i may call a umbrella conscience you know the sort of person i mean he would never put he hand in another 's pocket or forge a cheque or rob a till -- not even if he have the chance but he will swop umbrella or forget to return a book or take a rise out of the railway company in fact he be a thoroughly honest man who allow he honesty the benefit of the doubt perhaps he take you umbrella at random from the barber 's stand he know he can not get a worse one than he own he may get a better he do not look at it very closely until he be well on he way then dear I i have take the wrong umbrella he say with a air of surprise for he like really to feel that he have make a mistake ah well it be no use go back now he would be go _ and i have leave he mine _ it be thus that we play hide-and-seek with we own conscience it be not enough not to be find out by other we refuse to be find out by ourselves quite impeccable people people who ordinarily seem unspotted from the world be afflict with umbrella moral it be a well-known preacher who be find dead in a first-class railway carriage with a third-class ticket in he pocket and as for book who have any moral where they be concerned i remember some year ago the library of a famous divine and literary critic who have die be sell it be a splendid library of rare book chiefly concern with seventeenth-century writer about whom he be a distinguished authority multitude of the book have the mark of library all over the country he have borrow they and never find a convenient opportunity of return they they cling to he like precedent to law yet he be a holy man and preach admirable sermon as i can bear witness and if you press I on the point i shall have to own that it _ be _ hard to part with a book you have come to love indeed the only sound rule about book be that adopt by the man who be ask by a friend to lend he a certain volume i be sorry he say but i can not have not you get it ask the other yes i have get it he say but i make it a rule never to lend book you see nobody ever return they i know it be so from my own experience here come with I and he lead the way to he library there say he four thousand volume every -- one -- of -- 'em -- borrow no never lend book you can not trust you dearest friend there i know where be that _ gil bla _ go eh and that _ silvio pellico _ and but why continue the list he know he know and hat there be people who will exchange hat now that be unpardonable that go outside that dim borderland of conscience where honesty and dishonesty dissemble no one can put a strange hat on without be aware of the fact yet it be do i once hang a silk hat up in the smoking-room of the house of common when i want it it be go and there be no silk hat leave in its place i have to go out barehead through palace yard and whitehall to buy another i have often wonder who be the gentleman who put my hat on and carry he own in he hand be he a tory be he a radical it can not have be a labor man for no labor man could put a silk hat on in a moment of abstraction the thing would scorch he brow fancy will crook in a silk hat one would as soon dare to play with the fancy of the archbishop of canterbury in a bowler -- a thought which seem almost impious it be possible of course that the gentleman who take my silk umbrella do really make a mistake perhaps if he know the owner he would return it with he compliment the thing have be do let I give a illustration i have myself exchange umbrella -- often i hope i have do it honestly but one can never be quite sure indeed now i come to think of it that silk umbrella itself be not mine it be one of a long series of exchange in which i have sometimes gain and sometimes lose my most memorable exchange be at a rich man 's house where i have be invite to dine with some politician it be summer-time and the weather be dry i have not occasion for some day afterwards to carry a umbrella then one day a sensation reign in we household there have be discover in the umbrella-stand a umbrella with a gold band and a gold tassle and the name of a certain statesman engrave upon it there have never be such a super-umbrella in we house before before its golden splendor we be at once humble and terrify -- humble by its magnificence terrify by its presence i feel as though i have be catch in the act of steal the british empire i write a hasty letter to the owner tell he i admire he politics but have never hope to steal he umbrella then hail a cab and take the umbrella and the note to the nearest dispatch office he be very nice about it and in return my own umbrella take all the blame on himself what he say between the noble-looking gentleman who thrust a hat on my head and the second noble-looking gentleman who hand I a coat and the third noble-looking gentleman who put a umbrella in my hand and the fourth noble-looking gentleman who fling I into a carriage i have not the least idea what i be take i be too bewilder by all the noble flunkey to refuse anything that be offer I be it observe it be the name on the umbrella that save the situation in this case that be the way to circumvent the man with a umbrella conscience i see he eye he exchange with a secret joy then he observe the name and address and he solemn conviction that he be a honest man do the rest after my experience to-day i think i will engrave my name on my umbrella but not on that baggy thing standing in the corner i do not care who relieve I of that it be anybody 's for the take on talk to one 's self i be at dinner at a well-known restaurant the other evening when i become aware that some one sit alone at a table near by be engage in a exciting conversation with himself as he bent over he plate he face be contorted with emotion apparently intense anger and he talk with furious energy only pause briefly in the interval of actual mastication many glance be turn covertly upon he but he seem wholly unconscious of they and so far as i could judge he be unaware that he be do anything abnormal in repose he face be that of a ordinary business man sane and self-controlled and when he rise to go he agitation be over and he look like a man who have win he point it be probable that this habit of talk to one 's self have a less sinister meaning than it superficially suggest it may be due simply to the energy of one 's thought and to a concentration of mind that completely shut out the external world in the case i have mention it be clear that the man be temporarily detach from all he surroundings that he be so absorb by he subject that he eye have cease to see and he ear to hear he be alone with himself or perhaps with he adversary and he only come back to the present with the end of he dinner and the pay of he bill he be like a man who have emerge from another state of consciousness from a wake sleep fill with tumultuous dream obviously he be unaware that he have be harangue the room in quite a audible voice for half a hour and i daresay that if he be tell that he have the habit of talk to himself he would deny it as passionately as you -lrb- or i -rrb- would deny that you -lrb- or i -rrb- snore in we sleep and he would deny it for precisely the same reason he do not know and here a dreadful thought assail I what if i talk to myself too what if like this man i get so absorb in the drama of my own mind that i can not hear my own tongue go nineteen to the dozen it be a disquieting idea a strong conviction to the contrary i see amount to nothing this man doubtless have a strong conviction to the contrary -- probably express a amuse interest in any one talk to himself as he pass he in the street and the fact that my friend have never tell I of the fail go for nothing also they may think i like to talk to myself more probably they may know that i do not like to hear of my failing i must watch myself but no that will not do i might as well say i would watch my dream and keep they in check how can the conscious state keep a eye on the unconscious if i do not know that i be talk how can i stop myself talk ah happy thought i recall occasion when i have talk to myself and have be quite conscious of the sound of my voice they have be remark i have make on the golf link brief emphatic remark deal with the perversity of golf club and the sullen intractability of golf ball those remark i have hear distinctly and at the sound of they i have come to myself with a shock and have even look round to see whether the lady in the red jacket playing at the next hole be likely to have hear I or -lrb- still worse -rrb- to have see I i think this be evidence conclusive for the man who talk to himself habitually never hear himself he word be only the echo of he thought and they correspond so perfectly that like a chord in music there be no dissonance it be thus with the art student i see copy a picture at the tate gallery ah a little more blue he say as he turn from the original to he own canvas and a little later : yes that line want better draw several people stand by watch he work and smile at he utter thought he alone be unconscious that he have speak there be it be true case in which the conscious and unconscious state seem to mingle -- in which the intentional word and the unintentional come out almost in the same breath it be so with thoma landseer the father of sir edwin he be one day visit a artist and inspect he work ah very nice indeed he say to he friend excellent color excellent then as if all around he have vanish and he be alone with himself he add : poor chap he think he can paint and this instance show that whether the habit be a mental weakness or only a physical defect it be capable of extremely awkward consequence as in the case of the banker who be ruin by unwittingly reveal he secret while walk in the street how be it possible to keep a secret or conduct a bargain if you tongue be uncontrollable what be the use of jone explain to he wife that he have be keep late at the office if he tongue go on to say entirely without he knowledge or consent that have he declare no trump in that last hand he would have be in pocket by he evening at the club i see horrible vision of domestic complication and public disaster arise from this not uncommon habit and yet might there not be gain also from a universal practice of utter we thought aloud imagine a world in which nobody have any secret from anybody -- could have no secret from anybody i see the kaiser after consciously declare that he only purpose be peace unconsciously blurt out to the british ambassador that the ultimatum to serbium be a plant -- that what germany mean be war that she propose to attack belgium and so on and i see the british ambassador have explain that england be entirely free from commitment add dreamily but if there be a war we shall be in it in the same way jone after make smith a firm offer of # 30 for he horse would say absentmindedly of course it would be cheap at # 50 and i might spring # 55 if he be stiff about it it would be a world in which lie would have no value and deception would be a waste of time -- a world in which truth would no longer be at the bottom of the well but on the tip of every man 's tongue we should have all the rascal in prison and all the dishonest trader in the bankruptcy court secret diplomacy would no longer play with the life of man for there would be no secret those little perverse concealment that wreck so many life would vanish you sir who find it so easy to nag at home and so difficult to say the kind thing that you know to be true would be discover to you great advantage and to the peace of you household yes i think the world would go very well if we all have tongue that tell we true thought in spite of we but what a lot of we would be find out my own face crimson at the think so i think do yours on boswell and he miracle as i pass along great queen street the other evening i see that boswell 's house so long threaten be at last fall a victim to the housebreaker the fact be one of the by-product of the war while the hun be abroad in belgium the vandal be busy at home you may see they at work on every hand the few precious remains we have of the past be vanish like snow before the south wind in the strand there be a great heap of rubbish where when the war begin stand two fine old house of charle ii 's london they disappearance would in normal time have set all the press in revolt but they have go without a murmur so preoccupy be we with more urgent matter and so with the elizabethan house in cloth fair they have be demolish without a word of protest and what devastation be afoot in lincoln 's inn among those fine reposeful dwelling hardly one of which be without some historic or literary interest in the midst of all this vandalism it be too much perhaps to hope that boswell 's house would escape bozzy be not a englishman he residence in london be casual and what be more to the point he have only a reflect greatness macaulay 's judgment of he be now feel to be too harsh but even he warmest advocate must admit that he picture of himself be not engage he be gross in he habit full of little malevolence -lrb- observe the spitefulness of he reference to goldsmith -rrb- and he worship of johnson be abject to the point of nausea he make himself a sort of doormat for he hero and treasured the dirt that come from the great man 's heavy boot no insult level at he be too outrageous to be record with pride you be drunk last night you dog say johnson to he one morning during the tour in the hebride and down go the remark as if he have receive the most gracious of good morning have you no better manners say johnson on another occasion there be _ you want _ and boswell go home and write down the snub together with he apology and so when he have be express he emotion on hearing music sir say johnson i should never hear it if it make I such a fool once indeed he rebel it be when they be dine with a company at sir joshua reynold 's johnson attack he he say with such rudeness that he keep away from he for a week he story of the reconciliation be one of the most delightful thing in that astonishing book : after dinner when mr langton be call out of the room and we be by ourselves he draw he chair near to mine and say in a tone of conciliatory courtesy ` well how have you do ' boswell : ` sir you have make I very uneasy by you behavior to I when we be last at sir joshua reynold 's you know my dear sir no man have a greater respect or affection for you or would sooner go to the end of the world to serve you now to treat I so -- ' he insist that i have interrupted he which i assure he be not the case and proceed ` but why treat I so before people who neither love you nor I ' johnson : ` well i be sorry for it i 'll make it up to you in twenty different way as you please ' boswell : ' i say to-day to sir joshua when he observe that you _ toss _ I sometimes i do not care how often or how high he toss I when only friend be present for then i fall upon soft ground but i do not like fall upon stone which be the case when enemy be present i think this be a pretty good image sir ' johnson : ` sir it be one of the happiest i ever have hear ' be there anything more delicious outside falstaff and bardolph or don quixote and sancho panza indeed bardolph 's immortal would i be with he wheresoe'er he be whether in heaven or in hell be in the very spirit of boswell 's devotion to he hero it be he failing as much as he talent that enable he to work the miracle he lack of self-respect and humor he childish egotism he love of gossip he naive bathos and he vulgarity contribute as much to the making of he immortal book as he industry he wonderful verbal memory and he doglike fidelity i have say that he greatness be only reflect but that be hardly just it might even be more true to say that johnson owe he immortality to boswell what of he would remain to-day but for the man who take he scourging so humbly and repay they by lick the boot that kick he who now read _ london _ or _ the vanity of human wish _ or _ the rambler _ i once read _ rassela _ and find it pompous and dull and i have read _ the life of the poet _ and though they be not pompous and dull they be often singularly poor criticism and the essay on milton be in some respects as mean a piece of work as ever come out of grub street but _ the life _ what in all the world of book be there like it i have be read it off and on for more than thirty year and still find it inexhaustible it ripen with the year it be so intimate that it seem to be a record of my own experience i have dine so often with johnson at the mitre and sir joshua 's and langton 's and the rest that i know he far better than the shadow i meet in daily life i seem to have be present when he be talk to the king and when goldsmith sulk because he have not share the honor when he meet wilke and when he insult sir joshua and for once get silence when he down robertson and when for want of a lodging he and savage walk all night round st jame 's square full of high spirit and patriotism inveigh against the minister and resolve that they would _ stand by they country _ and at the end of it all i feel very much like mr birrell who when ask what he would do when the government go out of office reply i shall retire to the country and really read boswell not finish boswell you observe no one could ever finish boswell no one would ever want to finish boswell like a sensible man he will just go on read he and read he and read he until the light fail and there be no more reading to be do what a achievement for this uncouth scotch lawyer to have accomplish he know he have do a great thing but even he do not know how great a thing have he know he might have answer as proudly as dryden answer when some one say to he that he _ ode to st cecilium _ be the finest that have ever be write or ever will be say the poet dryden 's ode have be eclipse more than once since it be write but boswell 's book have never be approach it be not only the best thing of its sort in literature : there be nothing with which one can compare it boswell 's house be fall to dust no matter he memorial will last as long as the english speech be speak and as long as man love the immortal thing of which it be the vehicle on see ourselves a friend of mine who be intimate enough with I to guess my secret say to I quizzingly the other day : do you know ` alpha of the plough ' i have never see the man i say promptly and unblushingly he laugh and i laugh what never he say never i say what be more i never shall see he what not in the looking-glass say he that be not ` alpha of the plough ' i answer that be only he counterfeit it may be a good counterfeit but it be not the man the man i shall never see i can see bit of he -- he hand he foot he arm and so on by shut one eye i can see something of the shape of he nose by thrust out the upper lip i can see that the fellow wear a moustache but he face as a whole be hide from I i can not tell you even with the help of the counterfeit what impression he make on the beholder now i continue pause and take stock of my friend i know what you be like i take you all in at one glance you can take I in at a glance the only person we can none of we take in at a glance be the person we should most like to see it be a mercy say he i be not sure that he be right in this matter as in most thing in this perplexing world there be much to be say on both side it be lucky for some of we undoubtedly that we be condemn to be eternal stranger to ourselves and that not merely to we physical self we do not know even the sound of we own voice mr pemberton-billing have never hear the most sepulchral voice in the house of common and lord charle beresford do not know how a foghorn sound when it become articulate i have no idea and you have no idea what sort of impression we manner make on other if we have how stricken some of we would be we should hardly survive the revelation we should be sorry we have ever be bear imagine for example that eminent politician mr sutherland bang mp meeting himself out at a dinner one evening mr sutherland bang cherish a comfortable vision of himself as a handsome engaging fellow with a gift for talk a breezy manner a stylish presence and a elegant accent and seat beside himself at dinner he would discover that he be a pretentious bear that he talk be windy commonplace he breezy manner a offence he fine accent a unpleasant affectation he would say that he would never want to see that fellow again and realize that that be mr sutherland bang as he appear to the world he would return home as humble and abject as mr tom lofty in _ the good-natured man _ be when he imposture be find out you ought to have you head stick in a pillory say mr croaker stick it where you will say mr lofty for by the lord it cut a poor figure where it stick at present mr sutherland bang would feel like that but if make we own acquaintance would give some of we a good deal of surprise and even pain it would also do most of we a useful turn as well burn put the case quite clearly in he familiar line : o wad some pow ' r the giftie gie we to see oursel as other see we : it wad frae monie a blunder free we a ' foolish notion we should all make discovery to we advantage as well as we discomfiture you sir might find that the talent for argument on which you pride yourself be to I only irritating wrong-headedness and i might find that the bright wit that i fancy i flash around make you feel tired jone 's eyeglass would drop out of he eye because he would know it only make he look foolish brown would see the ugliness of he cant and robinson would sorry that he have be bear a bully and as prickly as a hedgehog it would do we all good to get this objective view of ourselves it be not necessarily the right view or the complete view you remember that ingenious fancy of holme ' about john and thoma they be talk together and do not quite hit it off and holme say it be no wonder since six person be engage in the conversation six you say lift you eyebrow yes six say he there be john 's ideal john -- that be john as he appear to himself thoma 's ideal john -- that be john as thoma see he and the real john know only to he maker and so with thoma there be three of he engage in the talk also now john 's ideal john be not a bit like thoma 's ideal john and neither of they be like the real john and so it come about that john and thoma -- that be you and i -- get at cross purpose if i -lrb- john -rrb- could have you -lrb- thoma 's -rrb- glimpse of myself my appearance my manner my conduct and so on it would serve as a valuable corrective it would give that faculty of self-criticism which most of we lack that faculty be simply the art of see ourselves objectively as a stranger see we who have no interest in we and no prejudice in we favor few of we can do that except in fleeting flash of illumination we can not even do it in regard to the thing we produce if you paint a picture or write a article or make a joke you be pretty sure to be a bad judge of its quality you only see it subjectively as a part of yourself -- that be you do not see it at all put the thing away for a year come on it suddenly as a stranger might and you will perhaps understand why thoma seem so cool about it it be not because he be jealous or unfriendly as you suppose : it be because he _ saw _ it and you do not even great man have this blindness about they own work how else can we account for a case like wordsworth 's he be one of the three greatest poet this country have produce and also a acute critic of poetry yet he write more flat-footed commonplace than any man of he time apparently he do not know when he be sublime and when he be merely drivel he do not know because he never get outside the hypnotism of self i have sometimes feel angry with that phrase what do they know of england who only england know it be the watchword of a shallow imperialism but i feel a certain truth in it once i be alone in the alp in a immense solitude of peak and glacier and as i wait for the return of my guide who have go on ahead to prospect i look like richard towards england in that moment i seem to see it imaginatively comprehensively as i have never never see it in all the year of my life in it i see its green pasture and moorland its mountain and its lake its city and its people its splendor and its squalor as if it be all a vision project beyond the verge of the horizon i see it with a fresh eye and a new mind seem to understand it as i have never understand it before certainly love it as i have never love it before i find that i have leave england to discover it that be what we need to do with ourselves occasionally we need to take a journey from we self-absorbed center and see ourselves with a fresh eye and a unprejudiced judgment on the english spirit i have see no story of the war which within its limit have please I more than that which mr alfr noye tell in the newspaper in he fascinating description of he visit to the fleet it be a story of the battle of jutland in the very hottest moment of this most stupendous battle in all history he say two grimy stoker ' head arise for a breath of fresh air what domestic drama they be discuss the world may never know but the word that be actually hear pass between they while the shell whine overhead be these : ` what i say be ' e ought to have marry ` er ' if you do not enjoy that story you will never understand the english spirit there be some among we who never will understand the english spirit in the early day of the war a excellent friend of mine use to find a great source of despair in tipperary what hope be there for a country whose soldier go to battle singing tipperary against a foe who come on singing ein ' feste burg put that way i be bind to confess that the case look black against we it seem all lombard street to a china orange as the tag of other day would put it it be true that for a music-hall song tipperary be unusually fresh and original contrast it with the maudlin keep the home fire burn which hold the field to-day and it touch great art i never hear it even now on the street organ without a certain pleasure -- a pleasure mingle with pain for its happy lilt come weight with the tremendous emotion of those unforgettable day it be like a butterfly catch in a tornado a catch of song in the throat of death but it be only a music-hall song after all and to put it in competition with luther 's mighty hymn would be like put a pop-gun against a 12-inch howitzer the thunder of luther 's hymn have come down through four century and it will go on echo through the century till the end of time it be like the march of the element to battle like the heaving of mountain and the surge of ocean in nothing else be the sense of power so embody in the pulse of song and the word be as formidable as the tune carlyle catch they massive rugged strength in he great translation : a safe stronghold we god be still a trusty shield and weapon he 'll help we clear from all the ill that have we now o'ertaken yes on the face of it it seem a poor lookout for tipperary against such a foe but it be not and any one who know the english temperament know it be not i put aside the fact that for practical everyday use a cheerful tune be much better than a solemn tune tipperary quicken the step and shorten the march luther 's hymn so far from lighten the journey would become a intolerable burden the mind would sink under it you would either go mad or plunge into some violent excess to recover you sanity it be the craziest of philosophy to think that because you be engage in a serious business you have to live in a state of exaltation that the bow be never to be unstrung that the top note be never to be relax you will not do you business better because you wear a long face all the time you will do it worse if you be talk about you high ideal all day you be not only a nuisance : you be either dishonest or unbalanced we be not creature with wing we be creature who walk we have to foot it even to mount pisgah and the more cheerful and jolly and ordinary we be on the way the sooner we shall get over the journey the noblest englishman that ever live and the most deeply serious be as full of innocent mirth as a child and lay he head down on the block with a jest let we keep we course by the star by all means but the immediate task be much nearer than the star -- the charity that soothe and heal and bless be scatter all about we foot -- like flower it be just this frightful gravity of the german mind that have make they mad they have not learn to play they have not learn to laugh at themselves they sombre religion have pass into a sombre irreligion they have grow gross without grow light-hearted the spiritual battle song of luther have become a material battle song and the safe stronghold be no longer the city of god but the city of krupp they have neither the splendid intellectual sanity of the french nor the homely humor of the english it be this homely humor that have puzzle europe it have puzzle the french as much as the german for the french genius be declamatory and need the inspiration of idea and great passion greatly state it be assume that because the british soldier sing tipperary move in a atmosphere of homely fun indulge in no heroics never talk of glory rarely of patriotism or the fatherland and only joke about the flag there be no great passion in he some of we frenzied people at home have the same idea they still believe we be a nation of slacker because we do not shriek with they the truth of course be that the english spirit be distrustful of emotion and display it be ashamed of make a fuss and hate heroics the typical englishman hide he feeling even from he family clothes he affection under a mask of indifference and crack a joke to avoid make a fool of himself it be not that he be without great passion but that he do not like talk about they he be too self-conscious to trust he tongue on such big theme he might make a exhibition of himself and he dread that above all thing this habit of reticence have its unlovely side but it have great virtue too it keep the mind cool and practical and the atmosphere commonplace and good-humoured it give reserve of strength that people who live on they top note have not get it go on singing tipperary as though it have no care in life and no interest in idea or cause and then the big moment come and the great passion that have be keep in such shamefaced secrecy blaze out in deed as glorious as any that be do on the plain of windy troy turn to those story of the winning of the vc and then ask yourself whether the nation whose son be capable of this noble heroism deserve to have the whip of zabern lay across its shoulder by any jack-in-office who choose to insult we those two stoker put they head out for a breath of fresh air in the midst of the battle be true to the english type death be all about they and any moment might be they last but they be so completely master of themselves that in the brief-breathing space allow they they could turn they mind to a simple question of everyday conduct what i say be ' e ought to have marry ` er that be not the stuff of which heroics be make but it be the stuff of which heroism be make on fall in love do not if you please imagine that this title foreshadow some piquant personal revelation story god bless you i have none to tell sir i have not fall in love for quite a long time and look in the glass and observe what holme call time 's visit card on my face and hair i come to the conclusion that i shall never enjoy the experience again i may say with mr kipling 's soldier that that be all shuv be'ind I long ago and fur away but just as poetry accord to wordsworth be emotion recall in tranquillity so it be only when you have leave the experience of fall in love behind that you be really competent to describe it or talk about it with the necessary philosophic detachment now of course there be no difficulty about fall in love any one can do that the difficulty be to know when the symptom be true or false so many people mistake the symptom and only discover when it be too late that they have never really have the true experience hence the overtime in the divorce court hence too the importance of calf love which serve as a sort of apprenticeship to the mystery and enable you to discriminate between the substance and the shadow and in calf love i do not include the adumbration of extreme childhood like those immortalise in _ annabel lee _ : -- i be a child and she be a child in that kingdom by the sea \* \* \* \* \* but we love with a love that be more than love i and my annabel lee i know that love i have it when i be eight she be also eight and she have just come from indium she be frightfully plain but then -- well she have come from indium she have all the romance of indium 's coral strand about she and it be indium 's coral strand that i be in love with moreover she be a soldier 's daughter and to be a soldier 's daughter be next to be a soldier the noblest thing in the world for that be about the time when under the inspiration of _ the story of the hundred day _ i have set out with a bag contain a nightshirt and a toothbrush to enlist in the black watch -lrb- it be a forlorn adventure that go no further than the railway station -rrb- finally she have give I as a token of she love _ poor little gaspard 's drum _ wherein i read of napoleon and the egyptian desert and above all of the mameluke how that word thrill I the mameluke what could one do but fall in love with a girl who use such incantation but this be not the true calf love that come with the down upon the lip people laugh at calf love but one might as well laugh at the wonder of dawn or the come of spring when david copperfield fall in love with the eldest miss larkin he be really in love with the opening universe and the eldest miss larkin happen to be the only available lightning conductor for he emotion the important thing be that you should contract calf love while you be young it be like the measles which be harmless enough in childhood but apt to be dangerous when you be grow up the calf love of a elderly man be always a disaster hence the say there be no fool like a old fool a elderly man should not _ fall _ in love he should walk into it he should survey the ground carefully as mr barki do that admirable man take the business of fall in love seriously : ` so she make ' say mr barkis after a long interval of reflection ` all the apple parsty and do all the cooking do she ' i reply that such be the fact ` well i 'll tell you what ' say mr barkis ` p ` rap you might be writin ' to she ' ' i shall certainly write to she ' i rejoin ` ah ' he say slowly turn he eye towards I ` well if you be writin ' to she p ` rap you would recollect to say that barki be willin ' would you ' this be a model of caution in the art of middle-aged love-making the mistake of the northern farmer be that he apply the same middle-aged caution to youth doänt thou marry for munny but goä wheer munny be he say to he son sammy who want to marry the poor parson 's daughter and he hold up he own love-making as a inspiration for sammy : and i go wheer munny wor and thy moother coom to and wus ' lot o ' munny laäid by and a nicetish bit o ' land maybe she wear would a beauty : i nivver giv ' it a thowt but worn would she as good to cuddle and kiss as a lass as a not nowt i have always hope that sammy reject he father 's counsel and stick to the poor parson 's daughter there be no harm of course in marry money george borrow say that there be worse way of make a fortune than marry one and perhaps it be true though i do not think borrow 's experience be very convincing i have know people who have go where money be and have fall honestly and rapturously into love but you have get to be very sure that money in such a case be not the motive if it be the penalty never fail to follow mr bumble married mr corney for six teaspoon a pair of sugar tong and a milk-pot with a small quantity of secondhand furniture and twenty pound in money and in two month he regret he bargain and admit that he have go dirt cheap only two month to-morrow he say it seem a age those who believe in love at first sight take the view that marriage be make in heaven and that we only come to earth to fulfil we destiny johnson who be a excellent husband to the elderly mr porter scoff at that view and hold that love be only the accident of circumstance but though that be the sensible view there be case like those of dante and beatrice and abelard and heloise in which the passion do seem to touch the sky in those case however it rarely end happily a more hum-drum way of fall in love seem better fit to earthly condition the method of sir thoma more be perhaps the most original on record he prefer the second of three sister and be about to marry she when it occur to he -- but let I quote the word in which roper he son-in-law record the incident : and all beit he mynde most serve he to the seconde daughter for that he thoughte she the fayrest and best favor yet when he consider that it woulde be bothe great griefe and some shame alsoe to the eldest to see she yonger sister in mariage prefer before she he then of a certeyn pittye frame he fancye towarde she and soon after marye she it be love to order yet there be never a more beautiful home life than that of which this most perfect flower of the english race be the center in short there be no formulum for fall in love each one do it as the spirit move on a bit of seaweed the postman come just now and among the letter he bring be one from north wale it be fat and soft and bulgy and when it be open we find it contain a bit of seaweed the thought that prompt the sender be friendly but the momentary effect be to arouse wild longing for the sea and to add one more count to the indictment of the kaiser who have send we for the holiday into the country where we could obey the duty to economise rather than to the seaside where the temptation to extravagance could not be dodge oh how it smell of sheringham say one whose vote be always for the east coast no there be the smack of sidmouth and dawlish and torquay in its perfume say another whose passion be for the red cliff of south devon and so on each finding as he or she sniff at the seaweed the window of memory open out on to the foam of summer sea and soon the table be envelop in a rush tide of recollection -- memory of bathing and boat of barefooted race on the sand of jolly fisherman who always seem to be look out seaward for something that never come of hunting for shell and of all the careless rapture of dawn and noon and sunset by the seashore all awaken by the smell of a bit of seaweed it be this magic of reminiscence that make the world such a storehouse of intimacy and confidence there be hardly a bird that sing or a flower that blow or a cloud that sail in the blue that do not bring we some hint from the past and set we tingle with remembrance we open a drawer by chance and the smell of lavender issue forth and with that linger perfume the past be unrolled like a scroll and place long unseen leap to the inward eye and voice long unheard be speak to we : -- we tread the path they foot have wear we sit beneath they orchard tree we hear like they the hum of bee and rustle of the bladed corn who can see the first daffodil of spring without feel a sort of spiritual festival that the beauty of the flower alone can not explain the memory of all the spring of the past be in they dancing plume and the assurance of all the spring to come they link we up with the pageant of nature and with the immortal of we kind -- with wordsworth watch they in sprightly dance by ullswater with herrick finding in they the sweet image of the beauty and transience of life with shakespeare greet they in the sweet o ' the year by avon 's bank long century ago and in this sensitiveness of memory to external suggestion there be infinite variety it be not a collective memory that be awaken but a personal memory that bit of seaweed open many window in we but they all look out on different scene and remind we of something individual and inexplicable of something which be a part of that ultimate loneliness that belong to all of we everything speak a private language to each of we that we can never translate to other i do not know what the lilac say to you but to I it talk of a garden-gate over which it grow long ago i be a child again stand within the gate and i see the red-coated soldier march along with jolly jest and snatch the lilac spray from the tree as they pass the emotion of pride that these hero should honor we lilac tree by ravish its blossom all come back to I together with a flood of memory of the old garden and the old home and the vanish face why that momentary picture should have fix itself in the mind i can not say but there it be as fresh and clear at the end of nearly fifty year as if it be paint yesterday and the lilac tree burst into blossom always unveil it again it be these multitudinous association that give life its color and its poetry they be the garnering of the journey and unlike material gain they be no burden to we back and no anxiety to we mind the true harvest of my life say thoreau be something as intangible and indescribable as the tint of morning and evening it be the summary the essence of all he experience we be like bee forage in the garden of the world and hoard the honey in the hive of memory and no hoard be like any other hoard that ever be or ever will be the cuckoo call over the valley the blackbird fluting in the low bough in the evening the solemn majesty of the abbey the life of the street the ebb and flow of father thame -- everything whisper to we some secret that it have for no other ear and touch a chord of memory that echo in no other brain those deep within we find only a crude expression in the vehicle of word and action and we intercourse with man touch but the surface of ourselves the rest be as intangible and indescribable as the tint of morning and evening it be one of the most companionable of man william morri who say : that god have make each one of we as lone as he himself sit that be why in moment of exaltation we only refuge be silence and the world of memory within answer the world of suggestion without and what do the seaweed remind you of say one as i look up after smell it it remind I i say of all the sea that wash we shore and of all the brave sailor who be guard these sea day and night while we sit here secure it remind I also that i have a article to write and that its title be ' a bit of seaweed ' on live again a little group of man all of whom have achieve conspicuous success in life be recently talk after dinner round the fire in the smoking-room of a london club they include a eminent lawyer a politician whose name be a household word a well-known divine and a journalist the talk traverse many theme and arrive at that very familiar proposition : if it be in you power to choose would you live this life again with one exception the answer be a unanimous no the exception i may remark be not the divine he like the majority have find one visit to the play enough he do not want to see it again the question i suppose be as old as humanity and the answer be old too and have always i fancy resemble that of we little group round the smoking-room fire it be a question that do not present itself until we be middle-aged for the thought of youth be long long thought and life then stretch out in such a interminable vista as to raise no question of its recurrence it be when you have reach the top of the pass and be on the downward slope with the evening shadow fall over the valley and the church tower and with the end of the journey in view that the question rise unbidden to the lip the answer do not mean that the journey have not be worth while it only mean that the way have be long and rough that we be footsore and tired and that the thought of rest be sweet it be nature 's way of reconcile we to we common lot she have show she child all the pageant of life and now prepare he for he patrimony of a little mould -- thou hast make he mouth avid of all dominion and all mightiness all sorrow all delight all topless grandeur all beauty and all starry majesty and dim transtellar thing -- even that it may fill in the end with a puff of dust confess -- it be enough yes it be enough we accept the verdict of mortality uncomplainingly -- nay we would not wish it to be reverse even if that be possible now this question must not be confound with that other rather foolish question be life worth live the group round the smoking-room fire would have answer that question -- if they have trouble to answer it at all -- with a instant and scornful yes they have all find life a great and splendid adventure they have make good and wholesome use of it they would not surrender a moment of its term or a fragment of its many-coloured experience and that be the case with all healthy-minded people we may like job in moment of depression curse the day when we be bear but the curse die on we lip swift it be true keep he birthday as a day of mourning but no man who hate humanity can hope to find life endurable for the measure of we sympathy be the measure of we joy in live even those who take the most hopeless view of life be careful to keep out of mischief a friend of mine tell I recently of a day he have spend with a writer famous for the sombre philosophy of he book in the morning the writer declare that no day ever pass in which he do not wish that he have never be bear in the afternoon he have a most excellent opportunity of be drown through some trouble with a sailing boat and he reject the chance with almost pathetic eagerness yet i daresay he go on believe that he wish he have never be bear it be not only the child who live in the world of let we make pretend no we be all glad to have come this way once it be the thought of a second journey over the same ground that chill we and give we pause sometimes you will hear man answer yes if i could have the experience i have have in this life by which they mean yes if i could come back with the certainty of make all the short cut to happiness that i now see i have miss but that be to vulgarise the question it be to ask that life shall not be a splendid mystery every day of which be a arch wherethrough gleam the untravelled world but that it shall be a thoroughly safe three per cent investment into which i can put my money with the certainty of have a good time -- all sunshine and no shadow but life on those term would be the dreariest funeral march of the marionette take away the uncertainty of life and you take away all its magic it would be like go to the wicket with the certainty of make as many run as you like no one would trouble to go to the wicket on those preposterous term it be because i may be out first ball or stay in and make a hundred run -lrb- not that i ever do any such heroic thing -rrb- that i put on the pad with the feverish sense of adventure and it be because every dawn break as full of wonder as the first day of creation that life preserve the enchantment of a tale that be never tell moreover how would experience help we it be character which be destiny if you come back with that weak chin and flickering eye not all the experience of all the age would save you from futility no if life be to be live here again it must be live on the same unknown term in order to be worth live we must come as we come before like wanderer out of eternity for the brief adventure of time and in spite of all the fascination of that adventure the balance of we feeling be against repeat it for we know that every thing that make life dear to we would have vanish with all the old familiar face and happy association of we former pilgrimage and there be something disloyal in the mere thought of come again to form new attachment and traverse new way holme once write a poem about be homesick in heaven but it would be still harder to be homesick on earth -- to be wander about among the ghost of old memory and try to recapture the familiar atmosphere of thing we should make new friend but they would not be the same they might be better but we should not ask for better friend : we should yearn for the old one there be a fine passage in guido rey 's noble book on the matterhorn which come to my mind as a fitting expression of what i think we feel he be on he way to climb the mountain when on one of its lower slope he see stand lonely in the evening light the figure of a grey-headed man it be whymper the conqueror of the matterhorn -- whymper grow old standing there in the evening light and gaze on the mighty rock that he have vanquish in he prime he climbing day be do and he seek no more victory on the mountain he have have he day and be content to stand afar off alone with he memory leave the joy of battle to the young and the ardent there be not one of those memory that he would be without -- save of course that terrible experience in the hour of he victory over the matterhorn but have you ask he if he be still avid for those topless grandeur and starry majesty he would have say it be enough tu-whit tu-whoo there be two voice that be most familiar to I on this hillside one be the voice of the day the other of the night throughout the day the robin sing he song with unflagging spirit it be not a very brilliant song but it be indomitably cheerful wet or fine warm or cold it go on through the November day from sunrise to sunset the little fellow hop about in he bright red waistcoat from tree to tree he flutter to the fence and from the fence to the garden path and so to the door and into the kitchen if you will give he decent encouragement he will come on to you hand and take he meal with absolute confidence in you good faith then he will trip away and resume he song on the fence there be some people who say hard thing about the robin -- that he be selfish and gey ill to live wus ' and so on -- but to I he seem the most cheerful and constant companion in nature he be a bringer of good tiding -- a philosopher who insist that we be master of we fate and that winter be just the time when there be some sense in be a optimist anybody he seem to say can be a optimist when the day be long and the air be warm and worm be plentiful but it be just when thing be look a little black and the other fellow begin to grouse that i put on my brightest waistcoat tune up my best whistle and come and tell you that the unconquerable soul be greater than circumstance the other voice come when night have descend and the valley below be blot out by the darkness then from the copse beyond the orchard there sound the mournful threnody of the owl the day be over he say and all be lose tu-whit tu-whoo i only be leave to tell the end of all thing tu-whit tu-whoo i have tell it all before a thousand time but you would not believe I tu-whit tu-whoo now you can not deny it for the night be dark and the wind be cold and all the earth be a graveyard tu-whit tu-whoo where be the song of spring and the leaf of summer tu-whit tu-whoo where the red-cheeked apple that hang on the bough and the butterfly that flutter in the sunshine all all be go tu-whit tu-whoo tu-whit tu-whoo tu-whit tu-whoo a cheerless fellow some people find he a intolerable companion i be talk at dinner in london a few night ago to a woman who have a house in sussex and i find that she have not be there for some time i use to find the owl endurable say she but since the war i have find he unbearable he hoot all night and make I so depressed that i feel that i shall go mad and so you come and listen to the owl in london i say the owl in london she ask yes i say the owl that hoot in carmelite street and printing house square ah she say but he be such a absurd owl now the owl down in the country be such a solemn creature he say a very foolish thing in such a solemn way i murmured yes but in the silence and the darkness there do not seem any answer to he madame i say if you will look up at the star you will find a very complete answer i confess that i find the owl not only tolerable but stimulating i like to hear the pessimist really let himself go it be the nameless and unformed fear of the mind that paralyse but when my owl come along and state the position at its blackest i begin to cheer up and feel defiant and combative be this the worst that can be say then let we see what the best be and set about accomplish it the thing be impossible say the pessimist to cobden indeed say that great man then the sooner we set about do it the better oh oh say i to my owl all be lose be it you wait till the dawn come and hear what that little chap in the red waistcoat have to say about it he be get quite another tale to tell and it be a much more likely tale than yours i shall go to bed and leave you to gummidge in the tree until the sun come up and tell you what a dismal fraud you be tu-whit tu-whoo hoot the owl back at I yes my dear sir but you say that last night and you have be say it every night i have know you and always the sun come up and the spring come round again and the flower bloom and the field be golden with harvest tu-whit tu-whoo oh bother you you ought to be a _ daily mail _ placard no doubt the owl be quite happy in he way loui xv express the owlish philosophy when he say let we amuse ourselves by make ourselves miserable i have no doubt the wretched creature do amuse himself after he fashion i have always think that secretly mrs gummidge have a roaring time she really enjoy be miserable and make everybody about she miserable i have know such people and i daresay you have know they too -- people who nurse unhappiness with the passion of a miser they be have the time of they life now they go about say tu-whit tu-whoo the russian be beat again or if they be not beat they will be tu-whit tu-whoo we be slacker and sloucher and the german be too many for we tu-whit tu-whoo they be on the way to indium and egypt and nothing will stop they all all be lose but i notice that they enjoy a beef-steak as much as anybody and do not refuse they soup though they salt it with they tear i like that story of stonewall jackson and the owl the owl be a general and he rush up to jackson in the crisis of the first battle of bull 's run cry all be lose we be beat oh say jackson if that be so i would advise you to keep it to yourself half-an-hour later the charge of jackson 's brigade have win the battle i do not know what happen to the owl but i daresay he go on tu-whit-ing and tu-whoo-ing to the end the owl can not help be a owl ah there be little red waistcoat singing on the fence let we find a worm for the philosopher on point of view as i sit in the garden just now with a writing-pad on my knee and my mind range the heaven above and the earth beneath in search of a subject my eye fall on a tragedy in progress at my elbow a small greenfly have get entangled in a spider 's web and be flutter its tiny wing violently to effect a escape the filament of the web be so delicate as to be hardly visible but they be not too delicate to bear the spider whom i see advance upon he prey with dreadful menace i forget my dislike of greenfly and be overcome with a fierce antagonism for the fat fellow who have the game so entirely in he hand here say i be the hun encompass the ruin of poor little belgium what chance have the weak and the innocent little creature against the cunning of this rascal who hang out he gossamer trap in the breeze and then lie in hide until he victim be enmesh and helpless what justice be there in nature that allow this unequal combat by this time the spider have reach the fly and throw a new filament round he then at frightful speed he race to the top of he web and disappear in the woodwork of the arbor draw the new filament tight round the victim which continue its fluttering for a little time and then give up the ghost at this moment i be call in to lunch and at the table i tell the story of the spider and the fly with undisguised hostility to the spider that say robert home from the front -- that be simply a sentimental point of view my sympathy as a practical person be all with the spider he be the friend of man the devourer of insect the scavenger of the garden he help in the great task of keep the equilibrium of nature moreover say he i have see you kill greenfly yourself you kill they because you know they be a nuisance why should you object to the spider do the same useful work for a living ah say i weakly i suppose it be because he do it for a living now i now you interrupt the other do it for a living too because you want you fruit tree to bear fruit and you rose to thrive and you cabbage to prosper who more merciless than you on slug and other pest that fly or crawl no no we be all out for a living you as much as the spider the spider as much as the fly we be all hun say i what a detestable world it be not at all say he it be a very jolly world i drink to the health of the spider and you have no pity for the fly i say not a little bit he reply i be on the side of right whose side be that i ask mine say he we must all act accord to we point of view that be what the greenfly do that be what the spider do we shall never in this world get all the point of view in accord we shall go on scramble for a live to the end sometimes the greenfly will be on top sometimes the spider look at that cherry-tree in the orchard a month ago its branch be laden with fruit now there be not a cherry to be see the blackbird and the starling have strip the tree as clean as a bone they point of view be that the cherry be provide for they and they be right they know nothing of the law of property which man make for he own protection it be no use go out to they and ask they to look at you title-deed and remind they of the policeman and the law against larceny we moral code be for we not for they we be all creature of we own point of view he go on before jone next door buy a motor-car he have very bitter feeling about motorist -- use to call they road-hog say he would tax these ` land-torpedo ' out of existence and be full of sympathy and pity for the poor child come from school now he drive a car as hard as anybody blow the hoggiest of horn and say it be disgraceful the way parent allow they child to play about in the street nothing have change except he point of view he have shift round to another position and see thing from a new angle of vision samuel butler hit the comedy of the thing off long ago : -- what make all doctrine plain and clear about two hundred pound a year and that which be prove true before prove false again two hundred more be we point of view then all dictate by we selfish motive as those of you friend the spider who have probably by this time gobble my friend the greenfly no i do not say that i think that comprehend all we private point of view there be a absolute motive run through human society call it the world spirit the mind of the race or what you will that be something greater and better than we the collective motion of humanity be except in very rare case nobler than its individual manifestation i respond and you respond to a abstract justice a abstract righteousness which be purer and better than anything we be capable of we be all at the bottom i think better than we action paint we better than we limited point of view permit we to be and in we illuminate moment we catch a glimpse of that jacob 's ladder that franci thompson see with ascend angel at chare cross some one call shelley ` a ineffectual angel ' i think most of we be ineffectual angel take this tragedy that be fill the world with horror to-day we be fight like tiger for we own point of view but in we heart we be ashamed of the spectacle and know that humanity be better than its deed one day perhaps the ineffectual angel will find he wing and outsoar the spider point of view and by the way suppose we go and see how the spider be get on we go out into the garden and find the web but the little green corpse have go and the spider be digest he meal somewhere out of sight _ -lrb- note _ -- this article should be read in connection with that entitle on the downs -rrb- on beer and porcelain i be read a american journal just now when i come across the remark that one would as soon think of drinking beer out of porcelain as of slapping nietzsche on the back drinking beer out of porcelain the phrase amuse I and set I idly wonder why you do not drink beer out of porcelain you drink it -lrb- assume that you drink it at all -rrb- with great enjoyment out of a thick earthenware mug or a pewter pot or a vessel of glass but out of china never if you be offer a drink of beer out of a china basin or cup you would feel that the liquor have somehow lose its attraction just as if you be offer tea out of a pewter pot you would feel that the drink be degrade and unpleasant the explanation that the one drink be coarse and the other fine do not meet the case people drink beer out of glass and the finer the glass the better they like it but there be something fundamentally discordant between beer and porcelain it be not i imagine that porcelain actually affect the taste or quality of the liquor it be that some subtle sense of fitness be outrage by the association the harmony of thing be jangle touch and taste be no longer in sympathy and we be conscious of a jar to some remote and inexplicable fiber of we be it be in the realm of the palate that we get the miracle of these affinity and antipathy in they most elementary shape who be it who discover that two such curiously diverse thing as mutton and red-currant jelly make a perfect gastronomic chord by what stroke of inspiration or luck do some unknown cook first see that apple sauce be just the thing to make roast pork sublime who be the prometheus who bring to earth the tiding that a clove be the lover for whom the apple pudding have pine through all the age see in the large this world be just a inexhaustible mine of material out of which that singular adventurer man be eternally bring to light new revelation of harmony the musician gather together the vibration of the air and discover the law of musical agreement and out of that discovery emerge the stupendous mystery of song the poet take word and out of they rhythm find the harmonious vehicle for idea the scientist see the apple fall and have the revelation of a universe move in a symphony before which the mind stand mute and awestruck the cook take the pig from the stye and the apple from the tree and make a pretty lyric for the dinner-table the great adventure in short be just this passionate pursuit of the soul of harmony in thing great and small spiritual and material we be all in the quest and we captain be those who lead we to the highest peak of revelation -- bach fashion that immortal concerto for two violin that take we out like unsullied child into field of asphodel wordsworth look out over tintern abbey and capture for we that sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused whose dwelling be the light of set sun and the round ocean and the living air and the blue sky and in the mind of man botticellus weave the magic line of the _ madonna of the magnificat _ into a harmony that once deeply feel seem to dwell in the heart for ever and you and i though we be not captain in the adventure all have we glimpse -- glorious moment when the mind sing in tune with circumstance when the beauty of the world or the sense of fellowship with man or the anthem of incommunicable thing seem to open out the vision of something that we would fain possess and be mean to possess a mirage you say be a cynical person -- a mirage just to keep we go through the desert -- a sort of carrot hold before the nose of that donkey man well look at the world to-day it do rather seem that if harmony be the main concern of the adventure humanity have better give up the enterprise in the light of the event in which we live man be not merely the most discordant creature on earth : he be also the most ferocious animal that exist dryden 's famous line read like a satire : -- from harmony from heavenly harmony this universal frame begin from harmony to harmony through all the compass of the note it run the diapason closing full in man if dryden could see europe to-day he might at least find one flaw in that ode of which he have so exalted a opinion but the story of man be a long story and we can not see its drift from any episode however vast and catastrophic we be still only in the turbulent childhood of we career and frightful as we excess be there be a motive behind they that make they profoundly different from the war of old that motive be the idea of human liberty the sanctity of public law the right of every nation small or great to live its life free from the terrorism of force when in the ancient or mediaeval world be there fight a war for a world idea like this despotism then have it all its own way even the peace of rome be only the peace of universal subjugation not the peace of universal liberty base on law which the world be fight to establish to-day never before have embattled democracy challenge the principle of tyranny for the possession of the world ah i know what you be think as you run you mind over the ally liberty do russia stand for liberty yes in the circumstance of to-day even russia stand for liberty for do not forget that this be not a war of the russian bureaucracy but a war sustain by the passion of the russian people and russium apart or russium include who can doubt that the cause of human freedom be in we hand and the cause of ancient tyranny be in the hand of we enemy may we not see in these baleful fire the twilight of the god -- of those old god of blood and iron that have hold the world in subjection through the long century of its travail may we not see even in the midst of this discord and carnage this hell of death and destruction the new birth of humanity -- the promise of a world set free perhaps in that distant time when the tragedy of to-day be only a old chapter in the story of the human race it will be see that dryden after all be not guilty of a grim jest but that this mighty discord be the announcement of that final harmony for which all that be best in we yearn it may seem a hard vision to cherish to-day but we must cherish it or accept the hideous alternative that this be after all in very truth the madhouse of the universe can you live with that idea would it be worth while live with that idea if not then the other hold the field and it be for all of we in we several way small or great to work so that it may possess the field i have wander somewhat far from the question of the beer and the porcelain and yet i think you will find that the sequence be not lack and that the little window command a large landscape on a case of conscience it be rain when victor crummle step out into the street but he do not notice the fact true he put he umbrella up but that be mere force of habit he be not aware that he have put it up he mind be far too engage with the ordeal before he to permit any consciousness of external thing to creep into it he be up against it and no mistake he observe to himself there be the paper in he pocket tell he the time and place at which he be to present himself for medical examination he put he hand in he pocket it be there all right kilburn twelve o'clock yes he be fairly up against it not as he hasten to assure himself that he object not at all he have always be a patriot and always would be he would love to have a smack at the hun he would give they what for he wish he would be a bit younger -- that be what he wish if he would be a bit younger he would have go like a shot that be what he would have do -- he would have go like a shot no fetch he -- if he would be a bit younger but a chap at thirty-eight well here be the golden crown yes he think he would better have just one it would pull he together and give the doctor a chance he ought to give they a chance whatever the consequence to himself a whisky-and-soda would just put he in the pink there that be better now he could face anything now for kilburn how should he go it be two mile at least a good two mile there be no 16 -- he could take that and there be the tube -- he could take that or he could walk there be plenty of time yes on the whole he think he ought to walk there be that varicose vein the doctor ought to know about that it would not be fair to they or to the country that they should not know about it varicose vein be very serious affair indeed he know because he would look the subject up in the dictionary it have make such a deep impression on him-that he could repeat what it say : -- the dilation and thicken of the vein with lengthen and tortuosity and projection of certain point in the form of knot or knob in which the blood coagulate fibrin be deposit and in the center sometimes even osseous matter in addition the coat of the vein be diseased there be more about it than that it look a very black case indeed many a man have be turn down for varicose vein and -- and -- well the doctor ought to know about it that be all they ought to know about it he ought not to go there and pass himself off under false pretence mind you he want to fight the german all right he want to do he bit -- nobody more so but be it fair not to let the doctor see what be the matter with he he certainly have those knot and knob when he walk very hard who know perhaps there be fibrin and osseous matter there at any rate the doctor ought to see he leg under fair condition he do not hold with allow you patriotism to make you deceive you country it be not fair to the country to let it spend a heap of money on a fellow who might crock up in the first week or two it be not fair to the fellow either not that he be think about himself not at all it be the country he be think of a fellow must think about the country sometimes it be he duty to put he own feeling as it be under the tap he want to go to the war as much as any man but he do not want the country to lose by he yes it be he duty to walk it be he duty not to conceal those knot and knob he hope they would not be a fatal objection but he be go to play a straight bat with the country whatever happen he be not the man to palm himself for what he be not he would show the doctor quite plainly what he varicose vein be like when victor crummle enter the room he be feel a bit tired but courageous he have take another stiffener at the spread eagle and feel equal to any fate there be two doctor in the room -- one sit at a table the other standing by the window anything the matter with you say he at the table not that i know say victor with the air of a man who mean business then as if unwillingly drag the truth out of himself he add i have get a bit of a varicose vein but it be hardly worth mention oh do not worry about that say the doctor we have get past that stage now strip do not worry about that get past that stage what do it mean well he have do he duty if there be fibrin and osseous matter in he vein he have give they fair warn it be the country that would suffer these doctor well there strip now let 's have a look at you the doctor examine he carefully perhaps that varicose vein would surprise he after all he would walk two mile and it ought to be not that he want it to be but if it be -- well it be only fair they should know what do you say you age be thirty-eight sir thirty-eight thirty-eight um come here jeffkin jeffkin come from the window and join he colleague and together the two doctor take stock of victor they be take no notice of he leg well it be they look out he would not be to blame if he break down you can dress and the two doctor go to the window and consult in low tone then the first come back well my man it will not do he say we like you spirit very creditable very creditable indeed but -lrb- laughing -rrb- thirty-eight come come light be break in on victor be he really be reject and because he be too old oh the scandal the shame and he die to get at those hun but upon my oath he be really in earnest now there there we understand say the doctor you have do you best and it be very creditable to you -- very but thirty-eight come come now good morning outside victor 's anguish and indignation be too bitter to be bear unaided he turn into the spread eagle on the guinea stamp my eye be catch as i pass along the street just now by a advertisement on a hoarding which announce that mr martin harvey be appear in a new cinema play entitle _ the hard way _ which be describe as a fine story by a peer i confess that i take a objection to that play on the spot it may be a good play i do not know i never shall know for i shall never see it but why should it be assume that you and i will run off to the pay box to see a new play by a peer suppose the anonymous playwright have be a lawyer or a journalist or a pork-butcher or a grocer would the producer have think it helpful to announce a new play by a pork-butcher or a lawyer or a grocer or a journalist he certainly would not he would have leave the play to stand or fall on its merit why then do he think that the fact that it be by a peer will bring we all crowd to he door you may of course take it as a reflection on the peerage you may be suppose to think it such a miraculous thing that a peer should be able to write a play that you may be expect to go and see it as you would go to barnum 's to see a two-headed man or a bearded woman we may be invite to see it merely as a marvel much as we use to be invite to go and see the horse that could count or the monkey that could ride bicycle if it be so i should feel it be unjust to the peerage which be certainly not below the average in intellectual capacity but it be not so it be something much more serious than that it be not intend to be a reflection on the peerage it be a unconscious reflection on the british public the idea behind the announcement be not that we shall go to see the play in a spirit of curiosity as if it have be write by a ourang-outang but that we shall go to see it in a spirit of flunkeyism as if it have be write by a demi-god we be conceive sit in hushed wonder that a visitor from realm far above we experience should stoop down to amuse we i wish i could feel that this be a false estimate of the british public it would certainly be a false estimate of the french public the most splendid thing i think in connection with the french people be they freedom from flunkeyism the great wind of the revolution blow that rubbish out of they soul for ever it give they the sublime conception of citizenship as the basis of human relationship it destroy all the social fence that feudalism have erect to keep the people out of the common inheritance of the possibility of human life it liberate they from sham and make they the one realistic people in europe they look truth in the face because they have clean its face of the dirty accretion of the past they see and they be the only people in europe who as a nation have see that the rank be but the guinea stamp : the man 's the gowd for a ' that it be this fact which have make france the standard-bearer of human ideal it be this fact which put she spiritually at the head of all the nation i be afraid it must be admit that we be still in the flunkey stage we be still hypnotise by rank and social caste i see a crowd run excitedly after a carriage near the gaiety theater the other day and find it be because princess so-and-so be pass we press reek with the disease and love to record this sort of thing : -- the duke of connaught in new york while stroll down fifth avenue the duke of connaught accidentally collide with a messenger boy carry a parcel whereupon he turn round and beg the boy 's pardon you see the idea behind such banality it be that we be stricken with respectful admiration that people with title should act like ordinary decent human being it be a insult to they and it ought to be a insult to the intelligence of the reader but the newspaper man know he public as well as the cinema producer he know we have the soul of flunkey i be no better than the rest when i know mr kearley the grocer i look on he as a man and a equal when he blossom into lord devonport i feel that he have take wing and fly beyond my humble circle i feel the flunkey strong in I i hate he but i can not kill he it be not the fact that inferior people get title which should give we concern it be not even that they get they so often by secret gift by impudent tout by base service these thing be know and they be no worse to-day than they have always be every honor list make we gape and smile if we see a really distinguished name in it we feel surprise and a certain sorrow what be he do in that galley i confess i have never feel the same towards jm barrie since he allow a tag to be stick on to a great name what do he want with a tag that any tuft hunter in public life can get it be only littleness that can gain from title greatness be always dishonour by they fancy sir charle dickens or lord dickens or lord darwin or lord carlyle or lord shakespeare or john milton masquerade as the marquis of oxfordshire yes tennyson become a lord and be the smaller man for the fact who do not recall swinburne 's scornful comment : stoop chaucer stoop keat shelley burn bow down and who do not share the feeling of mark pattison at the pitiful anti-climax there certainly be something about tennyson he say that you find in very few poet in say what he say in the best word in which it can be say he be quite sophoclean but this business of the peerage it be really so sad that i hardly like to speak of it compare that with milton 's end and mark the difference but it be the corrupting effect of title on the national currency that be they real offence they falsify we ideal they set up sham in place of reality they turn we mind from the gold to the guinea stamp and make we worship the false idol of social ambition we thinking as a people can not be right when we symbol be wrong we can not have the root of democracy in we soul if the tree flower into coronet and gee-gaw france have the real jewel of democracy and we have only get the paste do not think that this be only a small matter touch the surface of we national character it be a poison in the blood that infect we with the deadly sin of servility and snobbery and already it be permeate even the free life of the colony if i be a australian or a canadian i would fight this hateful taint of the old world with all my might i would make it a criminal offence for a colonial to accept a title as for we i know only one remedy it be to make a title a money transaction let we have a tariff for title if american millionaire like lord astor want they let they pay for they at the market rate it would be at least a more wholesome method than the present system and it would bring the whole imposture into contempt nobody would have a title when everybody know what he have pay for it it be a poor way of get rid of the abomination compare with the french way but then we be some century behind the french people in these thing on the dislike of lawyer i have spend a large part of my life in advise business man how to get out of they difficulty say mr asquith the other day it be a statement wring from he by a deputation which be inflict on he the familiar talk about lawyer and the need of business man to run we affair i suppose there have be no more banal cackle in this war than the cackle about a business government and the pestilence of lawyer i be not a lawyer and have no particular affection for lawyer i keep out of they professional reach as much as possible but it be as foolish to ban they as a class as it would be to assume that a grocer or a tailor be a great statesman because he be a successful grocer or tailor run a empire be quite a different job from run a grocery establishment and it be folly to suppose that because a man have be successful in buy and sell bacon and butter for he own profit he can _ ipso facto _ govern a nation with wisdom and prudence who be the most distinguished grocer of to-day they be lord devonport and sir thoma lipton both excellent man i have no doubt but would you like to hand over the premiership to either of they now would you the great statesman have to prove himself a great statesman just as the great grocer have to prove himself a great grocer he have to prove it by the quality of statesmanship exercise in the full glare of publicity if the grocer make a howler in he trade the world know nothing about it if the statesman make a howler all the world know about it he have to emerge to the front in the most public of all battle and you may be sure that no one come to eminence without great power which have pass the test of the fiercest trial he do not evade that test because he be a lawyer mr asquith have to survive it just as mr chamberlain who be a maker of nail have to survive it just as mr balfor who be a landowner have to survive it no one say to mr chamberlain yah nailmaker or to mr balfor yah landlord think he have dispose of they why should you suppose that when you have say yah lawyer to mr asquith or mr lloyd george you have dispose of they be the idea that lawyer be more selfish than other people -- brewer or soap boiler or banker i doubt it they be just the average and include good and bad like any other class judge jeffrey be a monster but on the other hand it be the lawyer of the seventeenth century who largely save the liberty of this country i doubt whether the world have ever produce a wiser more unselfish more heroic figure than lincoln and he be a lawyer i doubt whether any man in politics to-day have make such financial sacrifice as mr asquith have make he have a practice at the bar which i believe bring he in # 10000 a year and have he devote himself to it instead of to politics would have bring he in far more and he give it up for a job immeasurably more burdensome that have never bring he more than # 5000 he might have be lord chancellor with a comfortable seat on the woolsack and # 10000 a year and he choose instead to sit in the house of common every day to be the target of every disappointed placeman ah you say but look at the glory well look at it i would as danton say rather keep sheep on the hillside than meddle with the government of man it be the most ungrateful call on earth and whatever other defect may be attribute to mr asquith a passion for such a empty thing as glory be not one of they you will discover more passion for glory in mr churchill in five minute than you will discover in mr asquith in five year and mr churchill be not a lawyer but this dislike of lawyer in the abstract have a certain basis it be a old dislike you remember that remark of johnson 's when he be ask on a certain occasion who be the man who have leave the room : i do not like say unpleasant thing about a man behind he back _ but i believe he be a attorney _ and carlyle be not much more civil when he describe a barrister as a loaded blunderbuss -- if you buy he he blow you opponent 's brain out if you opponent buy he he blow yours out he weapon be the law but he object be not justice as often as not he aim at defeat justice and the more skilful a lawyer he be the more injustice he succeed in do it be this detachment from the merit of a case this deliberate repudiation of conscience in he business relation that make he so suspect of course he have a very sound reply it be my business to put my client 's case and my opponent 's business to put he client 's case and it be the business of the judge and jury to see that justice be do as between we that be true but it do not get rid of the suspicion that attach to a man who fight for the guilty or the innocent with equal fervor and then he deal in such a tricky article when sancho panza be governor of the island of baratarium he administer justice if he have be the governor of the island of britain he would have administer the law and he decision would have be very different law have about the same relation to justice that grammar have to shakespeare if shakespeare be put in the dock and try by the grammarian he would be condemn as a rogue and vagabond and similarly justice be not infrequently hang by the lawyer we must have law just as we must have grammar but we have no love for either of they they be dry bloodless science and we look askance at those who practice they you may be the greatest rascal of you time but if you study the law and keep within its letter the strong lance of justice can not reach you no law which be the servant of justice often betray he master but do not let we be unjust if law to-day be more nearly the instrument of justice than it have ever be it be the great lawyer to whom we chiefly owe the fact there be dodson and fogg in the law but there be also pym and pratt who have uphold the liberty of this country in the tooth of tyrant king and servile parliament on the cheerfulness of the blind i be come off a tube train last evening when some one say to I : will you please give this gentleman a arm to the lift he be blind i do so and find as i usually find in the case of the blind that my companion be uncommonly talkative and cheerful this gaiety of the blind be a perpetual wonder to I it be as though the outer light be quench a inner light of the spirit illuminate the darkness outside the night be black and dread but inside there be warmth and brightness the world be narrow to the circle of one 's own mind but the very limitation feed the flame of the spirit and make it leap higher it be the most famous of blind englishman who in the day of he darkness make the blind samson say : -- he that have light within he own clear breast may sit i ' th ' center and enjoy bright day and it have be remark in many case in which man have go blind that they cheerfulness so far from be diminish have by some miracle gain a new strength in no case of which i have have any knowledge have it apparently have the contrary effect the zest of live seem heighten not long ago mr galsworthy write to the _ time _ a letter in which he speak with pity of the unhappiness of the blind and there promptly descend on he a avalanche of protest from the blind themselves i suppose there be never a man who seem to have a more intense pleasure in life than the late dr campbell the founder of the normal school for the blind who work wonder in extend the range of the activity of the blind and himself do such apparently impossible thing as ride a bicycle and climb mountain nor be the case of mr pulitzer the famous proprietor of the _ new york world _ less remarkable night come down on he with terrible suddenness he be watch the sunset from he villa in the mediterranean one evening when he say : how quickly the sun have set but it have not set say he companion oh yes it have it be quite dark he answer in that moment he have go stone blind but i be tell by those who know he that he vivacity of mind be never greater than in the year of he blindness my friend mr gwe russell have a theory that the advantage of the blind over the deaf and dumb in this matter of cheerfulness be perhaps more apparent than real he point out that it be in company that the blind be least conscious of he misfortune and that the deaf and dumb be most conscious of it that be certainly the case in conversation the sightless be on a equality with the see while the deaf and dumb be shut up in a terrible isolation the fact that they see be not they gain but they loss they watch the movement of the lip and the sign of laughter but this only add to the bitterness of the prison of soundlessness in which they dwell hence the appearance of gloom on the other hand in solitude the deaf and dumb have the advantage all the color and movement of life be before he while the blind be not only deny that vision of the outside world but have a restriction of movement that the other do not share mr russell 's conclusion therefore be that while the happiest moment of the blind be those when he be observe the happiest of the deaf and dumb be when he be not observe there be some measure of truth in this but i believe nevertheless that the common impression be right and that judge by the test of the cheerful acceptance of affliction the loss of sight be less depressing than the loss of hearing and speech and this for a very obvious reason after all the main interest in life be in easy familiar intercourse with we fellow i love to watch a golden sunset to walk in the high beech wood in spring -- or for that matter in summer or autumn or winter -- to see the apple redden on the tree and the hedgerow thick with blackberry but this be the setting of my drama -- the scenery of the play not the play itself it be its human contact that give life its vivacity and intensity and it be the ear and tongue that be the channel of the cheerful interplay of mind with mind in that interplay the blind man have full measure and brimming over he very affliction intensify he part in the human comedy and give he a peculiar delight in homely intercourse he be not merely at he ease in the human family : he be the center of it he fulfil johnson 's test of a good fellow : he be a clubbable man and even in the enjoyment of the external world it may be doubt whether he do not find as much mental stimulus as the deaf-and-dumb he can not see the sunset but he hear the shout of the cuckoo the song of the lark the hum of bee and rustle of the bladed corn and if as usually happen he have music in he soul he have a realm of gold for he inheritance that make life a perpetual holiday have you hear mr william wolstenholme the composer improvise on the piano if not you have no idea what a jolly world the world of sound can be to the blind of course the case of the musician be hardly a fair test with he hearing be life and deafness death there be no more pathetic story than that of beethoven break the string of the piano in he vain effort to make he immortal harmony penetrate he soundless ear can we doubt that have he be afflict with blindness instead of deafness the tragedy of he life would have be immeasurably relieve what peace could he have hear he ninth symphony would have slide into he soul blind milton sit at he organ be a less tragic figure and probably a happier man than milton with a useless ear-trumpet would have be perhaps without the stimulus of the organ he could not have fashion that song which as macaulay say in he grandiloquent way would not have misbecome the lip of those ethereal being whom he see with that inner eye which no calamity could darken fling down on the jasper pavement they crown of amaranth and gold it be probable that in a material sense blindness be the most terrible affliction that can befall we but i be here speak only of its spiritual effect and in this respect the deprivation of hearing and speech seem to involve a more forlorn state than the deprivation of sight the one affliction mean spiritual loneliness : the other deepen the spiritual intimacy of life it be a man who have go blind late in life who say : i be thankful it be my sight which have go rather than my hear the one have shut I off from the sun : the other would have shut I off from life on tax vanity that quaint idea of sir edward clarke 's that as a revenue expedient in time of war we should impose a tax on those who have name as well as number on they garden gate have a principle in it which be capable of wide extension it be the principle of tax we on we vanity i be not suggest that there be not also a practical point in sir edward 's idea there be no doubt that this custom of give we house name be the source of much unnecessary labor and irritation to other people -- postmen tradesman debt collector and errand boy mr smythe -- formerly smith -- of 236 belinda avenue be easily discoverable but what be you to do about mr smythe of chatsworth house belinda avenue on a dark night how be you to find he there be 350 house in belinda avenue all as like as two pea and though mr smythe have a number he never admit it chatsworth house be where he live and if you want he it be chatsworth house that you have to find the other night a friend of mine be call to the door at a late hour it be dark and rain and dismal at the door stand a coal-heaver please sir he say can you tell I where balmoral be i have get a load of coal to take there and i have be up and down this road in the dark twice and can not make out where it be it be the fourth house from here to the right say my friend and the coal-heaver thank he and go away that illustrate the practical case for a tax on house name but it be not that case which be in sir edward 's mind he view be that we ought to pay for the innocent vanity of live at chatsworth house instead of 236 belinda avenue now if that principle be carry into effect i see no end to its operation i be not sure that sir edward himself would escape i have often admire he magnificent side-whisker i doubt whether there be a pair of side-whisker to match they in london that he be proud of they go without say nobody could possibly have whisker like they without feel proud of they i feel that if i have such whisker i should never be away from the looking-glass and consider the pleasurable employment they give in idle moment satan it be say have mischief still for idle hand to do but no one with such streamer as sir edward 's can ever have idle hand when you have nothing else to do with they you stroke you whisker and purr certainly they be worth pay for i think they would be dirt cheap at a tax of # 1 a side and then there be white spat i do not know how you regard white spat but i never see they without feel that something ought to be do about it i daresay the people who wear they be quite nice people but i think they ought to suffer in some way for the jolt they give to the sensibility of humbler mortal who could no more wear white spat than they could stand on they head in the middle of fleet street i be aware that white spat be often only a sort of business advertisement i have know career found on a pair of white spat there be simpkin for example i remember quite well when he first come to the club in white spat we all smile and say it be like simpkin he be pushful mean to get on and have set up white spat as a part of he stock-in-trade we know simpkin of course and discount the white spat but they make a great impression on he client and he forge ahead from that day now he wear a fur-lined coat drive he own motor-car and have a man in livery to receive you at the door but the foundation of he fortune be the white spat he understand that maxim of rochefoucauld that to succeed in the world you must appear to have succeed already and the white spat do the trick i think he ought to pay for they -- # 2 a spat be my figure most of we too i think will agree that if vanity be to be tax the wear of a eyeglass can not be overlook it be impossible to dissociate vanity from the use of the monocle there be some people it be true who wear a eyeglass naturally and unaffectedly as though they be really bear with it and have forget that it be there i see a lady in a bus the other day who use a eyeglass and yet carry it so well with such simple propriety and naturalness that you could not feel that there be any vanity in the matter but that be a exception ordinarily the wear of a monocle seem like a announcement to the world that you be a person of consequence disraelus know that he remark when chamberlain make he first appearance in the house that at least he wear he eyeglass like a gentleman show that he know that in general it be a affectation it be so in he own case of course i hope sir edward clarke will agree that # 5 be a reasonable tariff for a eyeglass there be a thousand other vanity more or less innocent that will occur to you in look round i should put a very stiff tax on paint cheek and hair-dye any lady dye she hair once would be tax # 5 for the privilege if grow tired of auburn she decide to change again to a raven hue she would pay # 10 the tax in fact might be double for every change of color if rather than pay the tax mr fitzgibbon jone resolve to wear she hair as nature arrange that she should life will be simplify for I the first time i meet mr fitzgibbon jone she have black hair a year later i meet she husband with a lady with chestnut hair he introduce I to she as he wife and she say we have meet before i say i think she be mistaken and it be not until we have part that i realize that it be the same lady with another head of hair and another system of coloration altogether the weak point about sir edward 's idea as a financial expedient be that so few of we vanity would survive the attention of the tax-collector personally i should have the name-plate off my gate at once indeed i be not sure i 'll not have it off as it be it be there when i come and i have always be a little ashamed of its foppery and have long use only the number now the name seem rather more absurd than ever its pretentiousness be out of tune with these time i think many of we be get ashamed of we little vanity without the help of the tax-collector on thought at fifty stevenson it will be remember once assign he birthday to a little girl -- or be it a boy -- of he acquaintance the child be fond of birthday while he have reach a time of life when they have cease to have any interest for he most of we if we live long enough experience that indifference the birthday emotion vanish with the toy that awaken it i remember when life be a journey from one birthday to another the tedium of which be only relieve by such agreeable incident as christmas easter and the school holiday but for many year i have stumble up against my birthday as it be with a shock of surprise have give it a nod of recognition as one might greet a ancient acquaintance with whom one have lose sympathy and have pass on without a further thought about the occasion but to-day it be different one can not pass over one 's fiftieth birthday without feeling that a event have happen fifty why the psalmist 's limit be only seventy fifty from seventy a easy sum but what a impressive answer twenty year and they the year of the sere the yellow leaf only twenty more time to hear the cuckoo call over the valley and see the dark beech wood burst into tender green i look back twenty year and it seem only a span and yet how remote fifty seem in those day it be so remote as to be hardly worth think about to be fifty be to be among the old fellow to be on the shelf to have become a antiquity and now here be i at fifty and so far from feel like a antiquity i feel as much of a young fellow as at any time of my life i have fear that when middle age overtake I i should feel middle-aged and full of sad longing for the old toy and the old pleasure how would life be tolerable when cricket for example have cease to play a important part in it never again to have the ecstasy of a drive along the carpet to the boundary or with a flash of the arm snap a opponent in the slip what a dreary desolation life must be strip of those joy and on the contrary i find that the spirit of youth be no more dependent on cricket than it be on the taste for lollipop it consist in the contented acceptance of the thing that be possible to we do not suppose young fellow that you be any younger than i be because you can jump five foot eight and i have cease to want to jump at all the feeling of youth be something much deeper and more enduring than the ability to jump five foot eight it may be as vigorous at eighty as it be at eighteen it be only its manner of expression which be change holme never admit that he have grow old i be eighty-three young to-day he would say and johnson with he old age and he infirmity still insist that he be a young fellow -- as indeed he be for where shall we find such freshness of spirit such a defiance of the tooth of time as in that grand old boy youth in fact be not a physical affair at all but a affair of the soul you may be spiritually bald-headed at twenty-five or a romp young blade at eighty byron be only thirty-four when he write : -- i be ash where once i be fire and the soul in my bosom be dead what i love i now merely admire and my heart be as gray as my head perhaps there be some affectation in this for byron be always dramatise himself but that he die a old man at thirty-six be as indisputable as that browning die a young man at seventy-seven with that triumphant envoi of _ asolando _ as he last expression of the eternal youth of the soul in thinking of old age the mistake be to assume that the spirit must decay with the body of course if the body be maltreat it will react on the spirit but the natural decline of the physical power leave the healthy spirit untouched with age should indeed leave it strengthen -- glowing not with passion but with a steadier fire when we be young in year we eager spirit cry for the moon we look before and after and pine for what be not but as we get older we learn to be satisfy with something nearer than the moon the horizon of we hope and ambition narrow but the sky above be not less deep and we make the wonderful discovery that the thing that matter be very near to we it be the homing of the spirit we have be avid of the topless grandeur of life and we return to find that the spiritual satisfaction we seek be all the time within very easy reach and in cultivate those satisfaction intensively we make another discovery we find that this be the true way to the topless grandeur themselves for those topless grandeur be not without we but within but i be afraid i be sermonising and i do not want to sermonise though if ever a man may be allow to sermonise it be when he be complete he half-century let I as a antidote recall a little story which the present bishop of chester once tell I over the dinner table for it contain a practical recipe for keep the heart young he be in he earlier day associate with archdeacon jone of liverpool the archdeacon then over eighty have be tutor to gladstone and one day the future bishop turn the conversation into a reminiscent channel and seek to evoke the archdeacon 's memory of the long past presently the archdeacon abruptly change the subject by ask what be the concert of the philharmonic like last night and then in answer to the obvious surprise which the question have arouse he add although i be a old man i want to keep my heart young and the best way of do that be not to let one 's thought live in the past but to keep they in tune with the life around one the truth be that every stage of the journey have its own interest probably none be better than another but my own preference have always be for that stage which i happen to be do at the time when i be twenty i think there be no age like twenty and now i be fifty i have transfer my enthusiasm to fifty there be no age like it i feel for all-round enjoyment and i have a strong conviction that if i have the good fortune to reach sixty i shall be find declare that there be no age like sixty and why not it be pleasant to see the sun on the morning hill but it be not less pleasant to walk home when the shadow be lengthen and the cool of the evening have come the one-eyed cat there be peggy with that horrid cat again -- the one-eyed cat from over the fence i look out as i hear the ejaculation and there in truth come down the garden path be peggy bearing affectionately in she arm the one-eyed cat from over the fence peggy like the animal in spite of its one eye i be not sure that she do not like it all the more because of its one eye i think she have a idea that if she nurse the cat it forget that it have only one eye and recover its happiness she have a passion for all four-legged creature i have see she spend a whole day pick handful of grass in the orchard and run with they to the donkey or the horse standing patiently in the neighbor 's paddock and when she have not animal to play with she will put a horseshoe on each hand and each foot and then you will hear from above the plod-plod-plod of a horse go its daily round but while she have a comprehensive affection for all four-legged thing she most fervent love be reserve for the halt and the blind it be only among child that we find the quality of charity sufficiently strong to forgive deformity the natural instinct be to turn away from any physical imperfection it be the instinct of the race for the preservation of its form we call these form beauty and the departure from they ugliness and it be from beauty 's rise as shakespeare say that we desire increase if you shudder at the touch of a withered hand or at the sight of a one-eyed cat it be because you feel that they be a menace to the established form of life you be unconsciously play the part of policeman for nature you be the guardian of its tradition when you blush at the glance of two eye and shudder at the glance of one and yet it be not impossible to fall in love with the physically defective and sincerely to believe that they be beautiful take that incident mention by descarte he say that when he be a child he use to play with a little girl who have a squint and that to the end of he day he like people who squint in this case it be the association of memory that give a glamour to deformity and make it beautiful the squint bring back to he the memory of the golden age and through the mist of that memory it be transmute into loveliness nor be it memory alone that will work the miracle intellectual sympathy will do it too wilke be renown for he ugliness but he claim that give half a hour 's start he would win the smile of any woman against any competitor and when one of he lady admirer engage in defend he be remind that he squint badly she reply : of course he do but he do not squint more than a man of he genius ought to squint nor be it woman alone whom the fellow fascinate who can forget the scene when tom davy bring he into the company of dr johnson who hate wilke ' radicalism and would never willingly have consent to meet he for a time johnson refuse to unbend but at last he could hold out no longer and fall a victim to the charm of wilke ' talk in the same way johnson believe he wife to be a woman of perfect beauty to the rest of the world she be extraordinarily plain and commonplace but to johnson she be the mirror of beauty pretty creature he would say with a sigh in refer to she after she death and there i fancy we touch the root of the matter the sense of beauty be in one respect a affair of the soul and only superficially a aesthetic quality we start with a common prejudice in favor of certain physical form they be the form with which nature have make we familiar and we seek to perpetuate they but if the conventionally beautiful form be ally with spiritual ugliness it cease to be beautiful to we and if the conventionally ugly form be ally with spiritual beauty that beauty irradiate the physical deficiency the soul dominate the sens franci thompson express the idea very beautifully when he say : -- i can not tell what beauty be she dole who can not see she feature for she soul as bird see not the casement for the sky but there be another sense in which beauty be the most matter-of-fact thing i can conceive that if the human family have develop only one eye and that plant in the center of the forehead the appearance of a person with two eye would be as offensive to we sense of beauty as a hand that consist not of finger but of thumb we should go to the show to see the two-eyed man with just the same feeling as we go now to see the bearded woman we should not go to admire he two eye any more than we go to admire the beard we should go to enjoy a pleasant sense of disgust at he misfortune and a comfortable satisfaction at the fact that we have not be the victim of such a calamity we should roll we single eye with a proud feeling that we be in the true line of beauty from which the two-eyed man in front be a hideous and fantastic departure beauty in short be only a tribute which we pay to necessity in equip itself for the struggle for existence humanity have find that it be convenient to have two eye and a stereoscopic vision just as it be convenient to have four finger on the hand and one thumb instead of five thumb we member have be develop in the manner best fit to enable we to fight we battle and the more perfectly they fulfil that supreme condition the more beautiful we declare they to be we idea of beauty therefore be not absolute they be conditional they be the humble servant of we necessity two eye be necessary for we to get about we business and so we fall in love with two eye and the more perfect they be for they work the more we fall in love with they and the more beautiful we declare they to be i think that peggy nursing she one-eyed cat there in the sun have not yet accept we creed of beauty she will be as conventional as the rest of we when she frock be longer on the philosophy of hat the other day i go into a hatter 's to get my hat iron it have be ruffle by the weather and i have a reason for wish it to look as new and glossy as possible and as i wait and watch the process of polish the hatter talk to I on the subject that really interested he -- that be the subject of hat and head yes say he in reply to some remark i have make there be a wonderful difference in the shape of ` ead _ and _ the size now you ` ead be what you may call a ord ` nary ` ead i mean to say he add no doubt see a shadow of disappointment pass across my ordinary face i mean to say it be not what you would call extry-ord ` nary but there be some ` ead -- well look at that ` at there it belong to a gentleman with a wonderful funny-shaped ` ead long and narrer and full of nobble -- ` stror ` nary ` ead ' e ` as and as for size it be wonderful what a difference there be i do a lot of trade with lawyer and it be astonishing the size of they ` ead you would be surprised i suppose it be the amount of think they have to do that make they ` ead swell now that ` at there belong to mr ------ -lrb- mention the name of a famous lawyer -rrb- wonderful big ` ead ' e ` as -- 7-1\/2 -- that be what ' e take and there be lot of 'em take over 7 it seem to I he go on that the size of the ` ead be accord to the occupation now i use to be in a seaport town and i use to serve a lot of ship ' captain ` stror ` nary the ` ead they have i suppose it be the anxiety and worry they get think about the tide and the wind and the iceberg and thing i go out of the shop with my ord ` nary ` ead conscious of the fact that i have make a poor impression on the hatter to he i be only a 6-7\/8 size and consequently a person of no consequence i should have like to point out to he that it be not always the big head that have the jewel in they of course it be true that great man often have big head bismarck 's size be 7-1\/4 so be gladstone 's so be campbell-bannerman 's but on the other hand byron have a small head and a very small brain and do not goethe say that byron be the finest brain that europe have produce since shakespeare i should not agree in ordinary circumstance but as a person with a smallish head i be prepare in this connection to take goethe 's word on the subject as holme point out it be not the size of the brain but its convolution that be important -lrb- i think by the way that holme have a small head -rrb- now i should have like to tell the hatter that though my head be small i have strong reason to believe that the convolution of my brain be quite top-hole i do not do so and i only recall the incident now because it show how we all get in the way of look at life through we own particular peep-hole here be a man who see all the world through the size of its hat he reverence jone because he take 7-1\/2 he dismiss smith as of no account because he only take 6-3\/4 in some degree we all have this restricted professional vision the tailor run he eye over you clothes and reckon you up accord to the cut of you garment and the degree of shininess they display you be to he simply a clothes-peg and you merit be in exact ratio to the clothes you carry the bootmaker look at you boot and take you intellectual social and financial measurement from they quality and condition if you be down-at-the-heel the glossy condition of you hat will not alter he opinion about you the hat do not come in he range of vision it be not a part of he criterion it be so with the dentist he judge all the world by its tooth one look in you mouth and he have settle and immovable conviction about you character you habit you physical condition you position and you mental attribute he touch a nerve and you wince ah say he to himself this man take too much alcohol and tobacco and tea and coffee he see the tooth be irregular poor fellow he say how badly he be bring up he observe that the tooth be neglect a careless fellow he say spend he money on folly and neglect he family i 'll be bind and by the time he have finish with you he feel that he could write you biography simply from the evidence of you tooth and i daresay it would be as true as most biography -- and as false in the same way the business man look at life through the keyhole of he counting-house the world to he be a emporium and he judge he neighbor by the size of he plate glass and so with the financier when one of the rothschild hear that a friend of he who have die have leave only a million of money he remark : dear I dear I i think he be quite well off he life have be a failure because he have only put a million by for a rainy day thackeray express the idea perfectly in _ vanity fair _ : -- you see say old osborne to george what come of merit and industry and judicious speculation and that look at I and my banker 's account look at you poor grandfather sedley and he failure and yet he be a better man than i be this day twenty year -- a better man i should say by twenty thousand pound i fancy i too have my professional way of look at thing and be dispose to judge man not by what they do but by the skill they have in the use of word and i know that when a artist come into my house he size I up from the picture on the wall just as when the upholsterer come he place I accord to the style of the chair and the quality of the carpet or as when the gourmet come he judge by the cooking and the wine if you give he champagne he reverence you if hock he put you among the commonplace in short we all go through life wear spectacles color by we own taste we own calling and we own prejudice measure we neighbor by we own tape-measure sum they up accord to we own private arithmetic we see subjectively not objectively what we be capable of see not what there be to be see it be not wonderful that we make so many bad guess at that prismatic thing the truth on see london i see that the _ spectator _ in review a new book on the tower say that whilst visitor to london usually visit that historic monument londoner themselves rarely visit it there be i suppose a good deal of truth in this i know a man who be bear in london and have spend all he work life in fleet street who confess that he have never yet be inside the tower it be not because he be lack in interest he have be to st peter 's at rome and he go to madrid largely to see the prado if the tower have be on the other side of europe i think he would probably have make a pilgrimage to it but it have be within a stone 's - throw of he all he life and therefore he have never find time to visit it it be so more or less with most of we apply the test to yourself or to you friend who live in london and you will probably be astonish at the number of precious thing that you and they have not see -- not because they be so distant but because they be so near have you be to the record office for example i have not although it be within a couple of hundred yard of where i work and although i know it be rich in priceless treasure i be always go but never get as they say in lancashire it be too handy i be talk the other day to a city merchant who live at sydenham and who have never see hampstead heath he have be travel from sydenham to the city for a quarter of a century and have wear the rut so deep that he can not get out of it and have hardly more likelihood of see the northern height than of visit the mountain of the moon yet hampstead heath which he could see in a morning for the cost of a threepenny ride in the tube be one of the incomparable thing of nature i doubt whether there be such a wonderful open space within the limit of any other great city it have hint of the seaside and the mountain the moor and the down in most exquisite union and the spaniard road be as noble a promenade as you will find anywhere this incuriousness be not a peculiarity of londoner only it be a part of that temporising habit that afflict most of we if a thing can be do at any time then that be just the thing that never get do if my fleet street friend know that the tower be go to be blow to piece by a zeppelin to-morrow he would i be sure rush off to see it this afternoon but he be conscious that he have a whole lifetime to see it in and so he will never see it we be most of we slacker at the bottom and need the discipline of a timetable to keep we on the move if i could put off write this article till to-morrow i should easily convince myself that i have not time to write it to-day the point be very well express in that story of the pope who receive three american visitor in turn how long be you stay he say to the first six month you holiness be the reply you will be able to see something of rome in that time say the pope the second be stay three month you will see a great deal of rome in three month say the pope the third be only stay three week you 'll see all there be to be see in rome in three week be the pope 's comment he be a good judge of human nature but if we londoner be no worse than most people we certainly miss more for there be no such book of revelation as this which we look at so differently i love to walk its street with those who know its secret mr john burn be such a one the very stone begin to be eloquent when he be about they pour out memory at he invitation as the rock pour out water at the touch of mose the house tell you who build they and who live hi they and where they stone come from the whole pageant of history pass before you and you see the spot where julius caesar cross the river at battersea -- where else should he cross -- you discover it may be for the first time the exquisite beauty of waterloo bridge and learn what canova say about it york gate tell you of the long past when the embankment be not and when great noble come through that archway to take the boat for westminster or the tower he make you dive out of the strand to see a beautiful doorway and out of fleet street to admire the henry room every foot of whitehall babble its legend you see tyburn as we forefather see it and george fox meeting cromwell there on he return from ireland in westminster hall he be at he best you feel that he know rufus and all the mason who build that glorious fabric in fact you almost feel that he build it himself so vividly do its story live in he mind and so strong be he sense of possession if i be a dictator i would make he the great showman of london i would have he take we round and inspiring we with something of he own delight in we astonishing city we should no longer look upon london then as if it be a sort of bradshaw 's guide : we should find it as fascinating as a fairy tale as full of human interest as a canterbury pilgrimage we should never go to snow hill without memory of fagin or to eastcheap without see falstaff swaggering along its pavement bread street would resound to we with the tread of young milton and southwark with the echo of shakespeare 's voice and the jolly laughter of the pilgrim at the tabard hogarth would accompany we about covent garden and out of bolt court we should see the lumbering figure of johnson emerge into he beloved fleet street we would sit by the fountain in the temple with tom pinch and take a wherry to westminster with mr pepy we should see london then as a great spiritual companionship in which it be we privilege to have a fleeting part on catch the train thank heaven i have catch it i be in a corner seat the compartment be not crowd the train be about to start and for a hour and a half while we rattle towards that haven of solitude on the hill that i have write of aforetime i can read or think or smoke or sleep or talk or write as i choose i think i will write for i be in the humor for write do you know what it be to be in the humor for write -- to feel that there be a head of steam somewhere that must blow off it be not so much that you have something you want to say as that you must say something and after all what do the subject matter any peg will do to hang you hat on the hat be the thing that say of rameau fit the idea to perfection some one be ask that great composer if he do not find difficulty in select a subject difficulty a subject say rameau not at all one subject be as good as another here bring I the _ dutch gazette _ that be how i feel now as the light of london fade in we wake and the fresh air of the country blow in at the window subject difficulty here bring I the _ dutch gazette _ but while any subject would serve there be one of particular interest to I at this moment it come into my mind as i run along the platform just now it be the really important subject of catch train there be some people who make nothing of catch train they can catch train with as miraculous a ease as cinquevallus catch half-a-dozen billiard-ball i believe they could catch train in they sleep they be never too early and never too late they leave home or office with a quiet certainty of do the thing that be simply stupefying whether they walk or take a bus or call a taxi it be the same : they do not hurry they do not worry and when they find they be in time and that there be plenty of room they manifest no surprise i have in mind a man with whom i once go walking among the mountain on the french-italian border he be enormously particular about train and arrangement the day or the week before we need they and he be wonderfully efficient at the job but as the time approach for catch a train he become exasperatingly calm and leisured he begin to take he time over everything and to concern himself with the arrangement of the next day or the next week as though he have forget all about the train that be imminent or be careless whether he catch it or not and when at last he have get to the train he begin to remember thing he would stroll off to get a time-table or to buy a book or to look at the engine -- especially to look at the engine and the nearer the minute for start the more absorb he become in the mechanism of the thing and the more animated be he explanation of the relative merit of the plm engine and the north-western engine he be always give up as lose and yet always step in as the train be on the move he manner aggravatingly unruffle he talk pursue the quiet tenor of he thought about engine or about what we should do the week after next now i be different i have be catch train all my life and all my life i have be afraid i should not catch they familiarity with the habit of train can not get rid of a secret conviction that they aim be to give I the slip if it can be do no faith in my own watch can affect my doubt as to the reliability of the watch of the guard or the station clock or whatever deceitful signal the engine-driver obey moreover i be oppress with the possibility of delay on the road to the station they crowd in on I like the ghost into the tent of king richard there may be a block in the street the bus may break down the taxi-driver may be drunk or not know the way or think i do not know the way and take I round and round the square as tony lumpkin drive he mother round and round the pond or -- in fact anything may happen and it be never until i be safely inside -lrb- as i be now -rrb- that i feel really happy now of course this be a very absurd weakness i ought to be ashamed to confess it i be ashamed to confess it and that be the advantage of write under a pen name you can confess anything you like and nobody think any the worse of you you ease you own conscience have a gaol delivery of you failing -- look they so to speak straight in the face and pass sentence on they -- and still enjoy the luxury of not be find out you have all the advantage of a conviction without the nuisance of the penalty decidedly this write under a pen name be a great easement of the soul it remind I of a occasion on which i be climb with a famous rock climber i do not mind confess -lrb- over my pen name -rrb- that i be not good on rock my companion on the rope keep address I at critical moment by the name of saunder my name i rejoice to say be not saunder and he know it be not saunder but he have to call I something and in the excitement of the moment could think of nothing but saunder whenever i be slow in find a handhold or foothold there would come a stentorian instruction to saunder to feel to the right or the left or higher up or lower down and i remember that i find it a great comfort to know that it be not i who be so slow but that fellow saunder i seem to see he as a laborious futile person who would have be better employ at home look after he hen and so in these article i seem again to be impersonate the ineffable saunder of whom i feel at liberty to speak plainly i see before I a long vista of self-revelation the real title of which ought to be the show up of saunder but to return to the subject this train-fever be of course only a symptom it proceed from that apprehensiveness of mind that be so common and incurable a affliction the complaint have be very well satirised by one who suffer from it i have have many and severe trouble in my life he say _ but most of they never happen _ that be it we people who worry about the train and similar thing live in a world of imaginative disaster the heaven be always go to fall on we we look ahead like christian and see the lion wait to devour we and when we find they be only poor imitation lion we timorous imagination be not set at rest but invent other lion to scare we out of we wit and yet intellectually we know that these apprehension be worthless experience have teach we that it be not the thing we fear that come to pass but the thing of which we do not dream the bolt come from the blue we take elaborate pain to guard we face and get a thump in the small of the back we propose to send the fire-engine to ulster and turn to see europe in flame cowper put the case against all fearful saint -lrb- and sinner -rrb- when he say : the cloud ye so much dread be big with mercy and will break with blessing on you head it be the cloud you do not dread that swamp you cowper know for he too be a apprehensive mortal and it be only the apprehensive mortal who really know the full folly of he apprehensiveness now save once i have never lose a train in my life the exception be at calai when the brussels express do in defiance of the time-table really give I and other the slip carry with it my bag contain my clothes and the note of a most illuminating lecture i chase that bag all through northern france and belgium inquire at wayside station wiring to junction hunting among the mountain of luggage at lille it be at lille that -- but the train be slow down there be the slope of the hillside black against the night sky and among the tree i see the glimmer of a light beckon I as the lonely lamp in greenhead ghyll use to beckon wordsworth 's michael the night be full of star the landscape glisten with a late frost : it will be a jolly two mile ' tramp to that beacon on the hill in praise of chess i sometimes think that grow old must be like the end of a tiring day you have work hard or play hard toil over the mountain under the burning sun and now the evening have come and you sit at ease at the inn and ask for nothing but a pipe a quiet talk and so to bed and the morrow 's uprising to deed shall be sweet you have have you fill of adventure for the day the morning 's passion for experience and possession be satisfied and you ambition have shrink to the dimension of a easy chair and so i think it be with that other evening when the late blackbird be fluting its last vesper song and the toy of the long day be put aside and the plan of new conquest be waste-paper i remember hearing sir edward gray say once how he look forward to the time when he would burn all he blue-book and mulch he rose-tree with the ash and mr belloc have give we a very jolly picture of the way in which he be go to spend he evening : if i ever become a rich man or if ever i grow to be old i will build a house with deep thatch to shelter I from the cold and there shall the sussex song be sing and the story of sussex tell i will hold my house in the high wood within a walk of the sea and the man that be boy when i be a boy shall sit and drink with I there be mr birrell too who as i have remark elsewhere once say that when he retire he would take he modest savings into the country and really read boswell these be typical i suppose of the dream that most of we cultivate about old age i too look forward to a cottage under the high beech wood to a well-thumbed boswell and to a garden where i shall mulch my rose-tree and watch the bud come with as rich a satisfaction as any that the hot battle of the day have give I but there be another thing i shall ask for on the lower shelf of the bookcase close to the boswell there will have to be a box of chessman and a chessboard and the man who be boy when i be a boy and who come and sit with I will be expect after supper to set out the chessman as instinctively as they fill they pipe and then for a hour or it may be two we shall enter into that rapturous realm where the knight prance and the bishop lurk with he shine sword and the rook come crash through in double file the fire will sink and we shall not stir it the clock will strike and we shall not hear it the pipe will grow cold and we shall forget to relight it bless be the memory of he who give the world this immortal game for the price of a taxicab ride or a visit to the cinema you may thanks to that unknown benefactor possess a world of illimitable adventure when alice pass through the look glass into wonderland she do not more completely leave the common day behind than when you sit down before the chessboard with a stout foe before you and pass out into this magic realm of bloodless combat i have hear unhappy people say that it be dull dull my dear sir or madam why there be no excitement on this earth comparable with this kingly game i have have moment at lord 's i admit and at the oval but here be a game which be all such moment where you be up to the eye in plot and ambuscade all the time and the fellow in front of you be up to he eye in they too what agony as you watch he glance wander over the board do he suspect that trap do he see the full meaning of that offer of the knight which seem so tempting he hand touch the wrong piece and you heart thump a te deum be he yes no he pause he remove he hand from the piece oh heaven he eye be wander back to that critical pawn ah light be dawn on he you see it illuminate he face as he bend over the board you hear a murmur of revelation issue from he lip he be draw back from the precipice you ambuscade be in vain and now you must start plot and scheming all over again nay say it be anything you like but do not say it be dull and do not please suggest that i be talk of it as a old man 's game only i have play it since i be a boy forty year ago and i can not say at what age i have love it best it be a game for all age all season all sex all climate for summer evening or winter night for land or for sea it be the very water of lethe for sorrow or disappointment for there be no oblivion so profound as that which it offer for you solace and what satisfaction be there comparable with a well-won mate it be different from any other joy that game have to offer there be a swift delight in a late cut or a ball that spread-eagle the other fellow 's wicket there be a delicate pleasure in a long jenny neatly negotiate in a drive that sail straight from the tee towards the flag on the green in a hard return that hit the back line of the tennis court but a perfect mate irradiate the mind with the calm of indisputable thing it have the absoluteness of mathematics and it give you victory ennoble by the sense of intellectual struggle and stern justice there be mate that linger in the memory like a sonnet of keat it be medicine for the sick mind or the anxious spirit we need a means of escape from the infinite from the maze of this incalculable life from the burden and the mystery of a world where all thing go contrairy as mr gummidge use to say some people find the escape in novel that move faithfully to that happy end which the tangled skein of life deny we some find it in hobby where the mind be at peace in watch process that be controllable and result that with patience be assure but in the midst of this infinity i know no finite world so complete and satisfying as that i enter when i take down the chessman and marshal my knight and squire on the chequered field it be then i be truly happy i have close the door on the infinite and inexplicable and have come into a kingdom where justice reign where cause and effect follow as the night the day and where come victory or come defeat the sky be always clear and the joy unsullied on the downs we spread we lunch on the crown of one of those great billow of the downs that stand along the sea down in the hollow tiny village or farmstead stand in the midst of clump of tree and the cultivate land look like square of many-coloured carpet brown carpet and yellow carpet and green carpet with the cloud shadow pass over they and move like battalion up the gracious slope of the downs beyond a gleam of white in the midst of one of the brown field catch the eye it seem like a patch of snow that have survive the rigor of the english summer but suddenly it rise as if blow by the wind and come towards we in tiny flake of white that turn to seagull they sail high above we utter that querulous cry that seem to have in it all the unsatisfied hunger of the sea in this splendid spaciousness the familiar form seem incredibly diminutive that little speck move across one of the brown carpet be a ploughman and he team that white stream that look like milk flow over the green carpet be a flock of sheep run before the sheep-dog to another pasture and the ear no less than the eye learn to translate the faint suggestion into known term at first it seem that save for the lark that spring up here and there with they cascade of song the whole of this immense vacancy be soundless but listen there be the wind on the heath brother and below that and only audible when you have attuned you ear to the silence be the low murmur of the sea you begin to grow interested in probe the secrecy of this great stillness that ah that be the rumble of some distant railway train go to brighton or eastbourne but what be that through the voice of the wind and the sea that we have learn to distinguish we catch another sound curiously hollow and infinitely remote not vaguely pervasive like the murmur of the sea but round and precise like the beating of a drum somewhere on the confines of the earth the gun yes the gun across fifty mile of sea and fifty mile of land the sound be bear to we as we sit in the midst of this great peace of earth and sky when once detach as it be from the vague murmur of the breathing air it become curiously insistent it throb on the ear almost like the beating of a pulse -- baleful sepulchral like the stroke of doom we begin count they wonder whether they be the gun of the enemy or we own speculate as to the course of the battle we have become spectator of the great tragedy and the throb of the gun touch the scene with new suggestion those cloud shadow drift across the valley and up the slope of the downs on the other side take on the shape of mass battalion the apparent solitude do not destroy the impression there be no solitude so complete to the outward eye as that which brood over the country when the army face each other in the grip of death i have look from the mountain of rheim across just such a valley as this twenty mile of battle front lay before I and in all that great field of vision there be not a move thing visible there be no cattle in the field and no ploughman follow they team road march across the landscape but they be empty road it be as though life have vanish from the earth yet i know that all over that great valley the earth be crawl with life and full of immense and sinister secrecy -- the gallery of the sapper the trench and redoubt the hiding-place of great gun the conceal observation of the watcher yes it be just such a scene as this the only difference be that you have not to put you ear to the ground to catch the thunder of the gun but the voice of war that have break in upon we peace fade when we be once more on the move over the downs and the vision it have bring with it seem unreal and phantasmal in they serene and sunlit world the shadow turn to mere shadow again and we tread the wild thyme and watch the spiral of the lark with careless rapture we dip down into a valley to a village hide among the tree without fear or thought of bomb-proof shelter and mask battery and there in a cottage with the rose over the porch we take rest and counsel over the teacup then once more on to the downs the evening shadow be stretch across the valley but on these spacious height the sunshine still rest some one start singing that jolly old song the farmer 's boy and soon the air resound to the chorus : to plough and sow to reap and mow and be a farmer 's boy-o-o-o-oy and be a farmer 's boy no one recall the throbbing of the gun or stop to catch it from amidst the murmur of the air this -- this be the reality that be only a echo from a bad dream from which we have awaken and when a hour or two later we reach the little village by the sea we rush for the letter that await we with eager curiosity there be silence in the room as each of we devour the budget of news await we i be vaguely conscious as i read that some one have leave the room with a sense of haste i go up to my bedroom and when i return the sitting-room be empty save for one figure i see at a glance that something have happen robert have be kill in battle he say how near the sound of the gun have come on short leg and long leg a day or two ago a soldier return from the front be loudly inveigh in a railway carriage against the bumptiousness and harshness of the captain under whom he have serve let I git ` im over ` ere he say and i 'll lay ` im out -- see if i do not i have ` ad enough of ` be bullyin ' it be not even as if ' e be a decent figure of a man ' e do not stand more 'n five-feet-two i could knock ` im out with one ` and and i would ` ave do it before now only you must not out there if you do you would get a pound o ' lead pump into you now i dare say little five-feet-two deserve all that be say of he and all he will get by way of punishment but the point about the remark that interest I be the contempt it reveal for the man of small stature there be no doubt that a little man start with a grievance with a aggravating sense of a inferiority that have nothing to do with he real merit i know the feeling for myself i be just the right height -- no more no less i be five-feet-nine-and-a-half and i would not be a shade different either way i dare say that be the general experience every one feel that he own be really the ideal standard it be so in most thing aristotle say that a man ought to marry at thirty-eight i think he say it because he himself marry at thirty-eight now i marry at twenty-three and my opinion be that the right age at which to get marry -- if you be of the marry sort -- be twenty-three in short whatever we do or whatever we be we have a deep-rooted conviction that we be it and it be well that it should be so without this innocent self-satisfaction there would be a lot more misery in the world but though i be the perfect height of five-feet-nine-and-a-half i always feel depressed and out-classed in the presence of a man say of six-feet-two he may be a ass but still i have to look up to he in a physical sense and the mere act of look up seem to endow he with a moral advantage i feel a grievance at the outrageous length of the fellow and find i want to make he fully understand that though i be only five-feet-nine-and-a-half in stature my intellectual measurement be about ten foot and that i be look down on he much more than he be look down on I it be this irksome self-consciousness that be the permanent affliction of the physically small man indeed it be the affliction of any one who have any physical peculiarity -- a hare-lip for example byron rage all he life against he club-foot and doubtless that malformation be largely the cause of he savage contempt for a world that go about on two well-matched foot i be sure that if i have a strawberry mark on the face i should never think about anything else if i talk to any one i should find he address he word to my strawberry mark i should feel that he be deliberately and offensively dwelling on my disfigurement say to himself how glad he be he have not a strawberry mark and what a miserable chap i must be with such a article he would not be do anything of the sort of course he would probably be do he best to keep he eye off the strawberry mark but i should not think so for i should be in that unhealthy condition of mind in which the whole world would seem to revolve around my strawberry mark and so with the small man he live in perpetual consciousness that the world be talk over he head not because there be less sense in he head than in other head but simply because he leg be shorter than the popular size of leg he be either overlook altogether or he be look down upon and in either case he be miserable occasionally he shortage lay he open to public ridicule a barrister whom i know -- a man with a large head a fair-sized body and leg not worth mention -- once rise to address a judge before whom he have not hitherto appear he have hardly open he mouth when the judge remark severely : it be usual for counsel to stand in address the court my lord say the barrister i be stand now can you imagine a agony more bitter than that to a sensitive man i daresay he lose he case for he must certainly have lose he head you can not cross-examine a witness effectively when you be think all the time about you miserable leg and even if he win he case it probably give he no comfort for he would feel that the jury have give they verdict out of pity for the little ` un it be this self-consciousness that be the cause of that assertiveness and vanity that be often characteristic of the little man he be probably not more assertive or more vain than the general run of we but we can keep those defect dark so to speak he on the other hand have to go through life on tip-toe carry he head as high as he neck will lift it and say as it be : hi you long-legged fellow do not forget I and this very reasonable anxiety to have a place in the sun give he the appearance of be aggressive and vain he be only try to get level with the long-legged people just as the short-sighted man try to get level with the long-sighted man by wear spectacles the discomfort of the very tall man be less humiliating than that of the small man but it be also very real he be just as much remove from contact with the normal world and he have the add disadvantage of be horribly conspicuous he can never forget himself for all head look up at he as he pass he do not fit any doorway he can not buy ready-made clothes if he sleep in a strange bed he have to leave he foot outside and in the railway carriage or a bus he have to tie he leg into uncomfortable knot to keep they out of the way in short he find himself a nuisance in a world make for people of five-feet-nine-and-a-half but he have one advantage over the small man he do not have to ask for notice the result be that while the little man often seem vain and pushful the giant usually be very tame and modest and unobtrusive the little man want to be see : the giant want not to be see and so it come about that we virtue and we failing have more to do with the length of we leg than we think on a paint face the other day i meet in the street a young lady who but yesterday seem to I a young girl she have in the interval take that sudden leap from youth to maturity which be always so wonderful and perplexing when i have see she last there would have be no impropriety in give she a kiss in the street now i should as little have think of offer to kiss she as of whistle to the archbishop of canterbury if i have see that dignitary pass on the other side of the road she have take wing and fly from the nest she be no longer a child : she be a personage i find myself try -lrb- a little clumsily -rrb- to adapt my conversation to she new status and when i leave she i raise my hat a trifle more elaborately than be my custom but the thing that strike I most about she and the thing that have set I write about she be this : i notice that she face be paint and powdered now if there be one thing i abominate above all other it be a paint face on the stage of course it be right and proper the stage be a world of make-believe and it be the business of the lady of sixty to give you the impression that she be a sweet young thing of seventeen there be no affectation in this it be she vocation to be young and she follow it as willingly or unwillingly as you or i follow we respective calling at the moment for example i would do anything to escape write this article for the sun be shine in the bluest of April sky and the bee be forage in the orchard and everything call I outside to the wood and hill but i must bake my tale of brick first with as much pretence of enjoy the job as possible and in the same way and perhaps sometimes with the same distaste the juliet of middle age put on the bloom of the juliet of seventeen but that any one not compel to do it for a living should paint the face or dye the hair be to I unintelligible it be like attempt to pass off a counterfeit coin it be either a confession that one be so ashamed of one 's face that one dare not let it be see in public or it be a attempt to deceive the world into accept you as something other than you be it have the same effect on the observer that those sham oak beam and upright that be so popular on the front of suburban house have they be not real beam or upright they do not support anything or fill any useful function they be only a thin veneer of oak stick on to pretend that they be the real thing they be a detestable pretence and i would rather live in a hovel than in a house trick out with such vulgar deceit that do not deceive and in the same way the paint on the face and the dye on the hair never really achieve they object if they do they would not cease to be a sham but at least they would not be a transparent sham there be of course degree of failure mr gamp 's curl be so obviously false that they could not be say to be intend to deceive on the other hand the great lady who employ the most scientific face-maker in order to defeat the encroachment of time do very nearly succeed but she failure be really more tragic than that of mr gamp how tragic i realize one day when i be introduce to a distinguished society woman whose youthful beauty be popularly suppose to have survive to old age at a distance she do indeed seem to be a miracle of girlish loveliness but when i come close to she and see the old bleared eye in the midst of that beautifully enamelled face the shock have in it something akin to horror it be as though death himself be peep out triumphantly through the paint mask and in that moment i seem to see all the pitiful year of struggle that this unhappy woman have devote to the pretence of never grow older she pink and white cheek be not a thing of beauty they be only a grim jest on herself on she ambition she ideal she poor little soul why should we be so much afraid of wrinkle and gray hair in they place they can be as beautiful as the freshest glow on the face of youth there be a beauty of the sunrise and a beauty of the sunset and of the two the beauty of the sunset be the deeper and more spiritual there be some face that seem to grow in loveliness as the snow fall around they and the acid of time bite the gracious line deeper the dimple have become a crease but it be none the less beautiful for in that crease be the epic of a lifetime to smooth out the crease to cover it with the false hue of youth be to turn the epic into a satire and if the paint face of age be horrible the paint face of youth be disgust it be artistically bad and spiritually worse it be the mark of a debased taste and a shallow mind it be like paint the lily or add a perfume to the violet and have on one the unpleasant effect that be make by the heavy odour in which the same type of person drench herself so that to pass she be like pass through a sickly fog these thing be the symptom of a diseased mind -- a mind that have lose the healthy love of truth and nature and have take refuge in falsity and sham the paint on the face do not stop at the cheek it stain the soul on write a article i be put on my boot just now in what the novelist call a brown study there be no urgent reason for put on my boot i be not go out and my slipper be much more comfortable but something have to be do i want a subject for a article now if you be accustom to write article for a living you will know that sometimes the difficulty be not write the article but choose a subject it be not that subject be few : it be that they be so many it be not poverty you suffer from but a embarrassment of riches you be like buridan 's ass that wretched creature starve between two bundle of hay because he could not make up he mind which bundle to turn to first and in that he be not unlike many human being there be a eighteenth-century statesman for example who use to find it so difficult to make a choice that he would stand at he door look up the street and down the street and finally go inside again because he could not decide whether to go up or down he would stay indoors all the morning consider whether he should ride out or walk out and he would spend all the afternoon regret that he have do neither one nor the other i have always have a great deal of sympathy with that personage for i share he temperamental indecision i hate make up my mind if i go into a shop to choose a pair of trousers my infirmity of purpose grow with every new sample that be show I and finally i choose the wrong thing in a fit of desperation if the question be a place for a holiday all the artifice of my family can not extract from I a decide preference for any place in particular bournemouth certainly how jolly that walk along the sand by poole harbor to studland and over the hill to swanage but think of the lake district and north wale and devon and cornwall and i do not so much make decision as drift into they or fall into they i be what you might call a eleventh hour man i take a header just as the clock be about to strike for the last time this common fail of indecision be not necessarily due to intellectual laziness it may be due as in the case of goschen to too clear a vision of all the aspect of a subject goschen say a famous first sea lord be the cleverest man we ever have at the admiralty and the worst administrator he see so many side to a question that we could never get anything do a sense of responsibility too be a severe check on action i doubt whether any one who have deal with affair ever make up he mind with more painful questioning than lord morley i have hear he say how burdensome he find the indium office because day by day he have to make irrevocable decision a certain adventurous recklessness be necessary for the man of affair joseph chamberlain have that quality mr churchill have it to-day if it be control by high motive and a wide vision it be a incomparable gift if it be a mere passion for have one 's own way it be only the gift of the gambler but you ask what have this to do with put on my boot it be a reasonable question i will tell you for a hour i have pace my room in my slipper in search of a subject i have look out of the window over the sunlit valley watch the smoke of a distant train vanish towards the west observe the activity of the rook in a neighbouring elm i have pare my nail several time with absent-minded industry and sharpen every pencil i have on I with elaborate care but the more i pare my nail and the more i sharpen my pencil the more perplexed i grow as to the theme for a article subject crowd on I not single spy but in battalion they jostle each other for preference they clamour for notice as i have see the dock labourer clamour for a job at the london dock they hold out they hand and cry here be i : take I and distract by they importunity and starve in the midst of plenty i fish in my pocket for a pencil i have not sharpen there be not one leave it be at this moment that i remember my boot yes i would certainly put on my boot there be nothing like put on one 's boot for help one to make up one 's mind the act of stoop change the current of the blood you see thing in a new light -- like the man who look between he leg at bolton abbey and cry to he friend : oh look this way it be extraordinary what a fresh view you get so i fetch my boot and sit down to put they on the thing work like a charm for in my preoccupy condition i pick up my right boot first then mechanically i put it down and seize the left boot now why say i do i do that and then the fact flash on I that all my life i have be put on my left boot first if you have ask I five minute before which boot i put on first i should have say that there be no first about it yet now i find i be in the grip of a habit so fix that the attempt to put on my right boot first affect I like the scrape of a harsh pencil on a slate the thing could not be do the whole rhythm of habit would be put out of joint i become interested how i wonder do i put on my jacket i rise take it off find that my right arm slip automatically into its sleeve try the reverse process discover that it be as difficult as a unfamiliar gymnastic operation why say i i be a mere bundle of little habit of which i be unconscious this thing must be look into and then come into my mind that fascinating book of samuel butler 's on _ life and habit _ yes certainly here be a subject that would go i dismiss all the importunate beggar who have be clamour in my mind take out a pencil seize a write pad and sit down to write on the force of habit and here i be i have get to the end of my article without reach my subject i have look up and down the street so long that it be time to go indoors on a city that be i saw in a newspaper a few day ago some picture of the ruin of the cloth hall and the cathedral at ypre they be excellent photograph but the impression they leave on my mind be of the futility even of photography to convey any real sense of that astonishing scene of desolation which be once the beautiful city of ypre we talk of ypre as if it be still a city in be in which man trade and child play and woman go about they household duty in a vague way we feel that it be so in a vague way i feel that it be so myself until i enter it and find myself in the presence of the ghost of a city how wonderful be the solitude and the silence in the midst of which it stand like the ruin of some ancient and forget civilisation far behind you have leave the hurry and tumult of the great army -- every village seethe with a strange and tumultuous life soldier bargaining with the woman for potato and cabbage in the marketplace boil they pot in the field play football by the way side mend the road march camping feeding sleeping officer fly along the road on horseback or in motorcar vast procession of lorry coil they way over the landscape or standing at rest with they death-dealing burden while the man take they mid-day meal giant caterpillar drag great gun along the highway everywhere the sense of a fearful urgency everywhere the feeling of a brooding and awful presence that overshadow the heaven with a cosmic menace it be as though you be live on the slope of some vast volcano whose eruption may at any moment submerge all this phantasmal life in a sea of molten lava and hark through the sound of the road and the street the chaffering of the market-place the rush of motor-car the rhythmic tramp of man there come a dull hollow roar as from the mouth of a volcano itself as you advance the scene change the movement become more feverish more intense the very breath of the volcano seem to fan you cheek and the hollow roar have become near and plangent it be no longer like the breaking of great sea on a distant shore : it be like thunder rend the sky above you a little further and another subtle change be observable on either hand the land have become solitary and unkempt all the life of the field have vanish and the soldier be in undisputed possession then even the soldier seem left behind and you enter the strange solitude where the war be wage before you rise the great mound of ypre in the distance it look like a live city with quaintly break skyline but as you approach you see that it be only the tomb of a city standing there desolate and shatter in the midst of a universal desolation it be midday as you pass through its street but there be no move thing visible amidst the ruin the very spirit of loneliness be about you -- not the invigorating loneliness of the mountain top but the sad loneliness of the grave i have stand upon the ruin of carthage but even there i do not feel the same sense of solitude that i feel as i walk the street of ypre there at least the bird be singing above you and the arab sit beside he camel on the grass in the sunshine here nature itself seem blast by some dreadful flame of death the street preserve they contour but on either side the house stand like gaunt skeleton roofless and shattered front knock out floor smash through or hang in fragment bedstead tumble down through the broken ceiling of the sitting-room picture askew on the totter wall household treasure a forlorn wreckage hat still hang on the hat-peg the table-cloth still lay the fireplace lustreless with the ash of the last fire and in the center of this scene of utter misery the cathedral and the cloth hall still tower above the general desolation sublime even in they ruin the roof go the interior a heap of rubbish -- the rubbish of priceless thing -- the outer wall batter and break but stand as they have stand for century most wonderful of all as i see it a single pinnacle of the cloth hall still stand above the wreck slender and exquisitely carven point like a accuse finger to the eternal tribunal for long the german have be shell that finger of ypre they shell it the afternoon i be there and fill the market-place with great mass of masonry from the wall but they shell it in vain and as i leave ypre in the twilight when the thunder of the gun have cease and look back on the great mound of the city that be i see above the ruin the finger still point heavenward but if the solitude of ypre be memorable the silence be terrible it be the silence of imminent and breathless thing full of strange secret thrill with a fearful expectation break by sudden and shatter voice that speak and then be still -- voice that seem to come out of the bowels of the earth near at hand and be answer by voice more distant the vicious hiss of the shrapnel the crisp rattle of the machine-gun the roar of mother that sound like a invisible express train thunder through the sky above you the solitude and the silence assume a oppressive significance they be only the garment of the mighty mystery that envelop you you feel that these dead wall have ear eye and most potent voice that you be not in the midst of a great loneliness but that all around the earth be full of most tremendous secret and then you realize that the city that be as dead as nineveh to the outward eye be the most vital city in the world one day it will rise from its ash its street will resound once more with jest and laughter its fire will be relit and its chimney will send forth the cheerful smoke but its glory throughout all the age will be the memory of the day when it stand a mound of ruin on the plain with its finger point in mute appeal to heaven against the infamy of man on pleasant sound the wind have drop and on the hillside one seem to be in a vast and soundless universe far down in the valley a few light glimmer in the general darkness but apart from these one might have fancy oneself alone in all the world then from some remote farmstead there come the sound of a dog bark it ring through the night like the distant shout of a friend it seem to fill the whole arch of heaven with its reverberation and to flood the valley with the sense of companionship it bring I news from the farm the day 's task be over the cattle be settle for the night the household be at they evening meal and the watch-dog have resume he nocturnal charge he bark seem to have in it the music of immemorial thing -- of labor and rest and all the cheerful routine and comradeship of the field it be only in the country that one enjoy the poetry of natural sound a dog bark in a suburban street be merely a disturber of the peace and i know of nothing more forlorn than the singing of a caged bird in let we say tottenham court road wordsworth 's poor susan find a note of enchantment in the song of the thrush that sing at the corner of wood street off cheapside but it be only a enchantment that pass into deeper sadness as the vision of the green pasture which it summon up fade into the drab reality : they fade the mist and the river the hill and the shade : the stream will not flow and the hill will not rise and the color have pass away from she eye there be something in the life of town which seem to make the voice of the country alien and sorrowful they be lose in the tumult and if hear sound only like a reproach against a fretful world a echo from some eden from which we have be exile in the large silence of the countryside sound have a significance and intimacy that they can not have where life be crowd with activity and interest in a certain sense life here be richer because of its poverty -- because of its freedom from the thousand distraction that exhaust its emotion and scatter its energy because we have little we discover much in that little take the sound of church bell in the city it be hardly more please than the song of the bird in tottenham court road it do not raise my spirit it only depress they but when i hear the sound of the bell come up from the valley last evening it seem like the bringer of a personal message of good tiding it have in it the rapture of a thousand memory -- memory of summer eve and snowy landscape of vanish face and forget scene it be at once stimulate and calming and speak somehow the language of endure and incommunicable thing it be i suppose the association of sound rather than they actual quality which make they pleasant or unpleasant the twitter of sparrow be in itself as prosaic a sound as there be in nature but i never hear it on wake without a feeling of inward peace it seem to link I with some incredibly remote and golden morning and with a child in a cradle wake for the first time to light and sound and consciousness and so with that engaging ruffian of the feathered world the rook it have no more music in its voice than a tin kettle but what jollier sound be there on a late February morning than the splendid hubbub of a rookery when the slovenly nest be be build in the naked and sway branch of the elm betsy trotwood be angry with david copperfield 's father because he call he house blunderstone rookery rookery indeed she say it be almost the only point of disagreement i have with that admirable woman not to love a rookery be _ prima facie _ evidence against you i have hear of man who have buy estate because of the rookery and i have love they for they beautiful extravagance i be sure i should have like david copperfield 's father from that solitary incident record of he he be not a very practical or business-like man i fear but people who love rookery rarely be you can not expect both the prose and the poetry of life for you endowment how much the feeling create by sound depend upon the setting may be illustrate by the bagpipe the bagpipe in a london street be a thing for ribald laughter but the bagpipe in a highland glen be a thing to stir the blood and make the mind thrill to memory of old unhappy far off thing and battle long ago it be so even with the humble concertina that instrument be to I the last expression of musical depravity it be the torture which dante would provide for I in the last circle of hell but the sound of a concertina on a country road on a dark night be as cheerful a noise as i want to hear but just as omar love the sound of a _ distant _ drum so distance be a essential part of the enchantment of my concertina and of all pleasant sound what be there to excel the music of the hammer and the anvil in the smithy at the entrance to the village no wonder the child love to stand at the open door and see the burning spark that fly and hear the bellows roar i would stand at the open door myself if i have the pluck for i be as much a child as any one when the hammer and the anvil be play they primeval music it be the oldest song of humanity play with the most ancient instrument here we be at the very beginning of we story -- here we stand in the very dawn of thing what lineage so noble as that of the smith what task so ancient and so honorable with such tool the first smith smite music out of labor and begin the conquest of thing to the accompaniment of joyous sound in those sound i seem to hear the whole burden of the age i think i will take another stroll down to the village it will take I past the smithy on slacken the bow i be in a company the other evening in which the talk turn upon the familiar theme of the government and its fitness for the job in hand the principal assailant be what i should call a strenuous person he seem to suggest that if the conduct of the war have be in the hand of earnest-minded person -- like himself for example -- the business would have be over long ago what can you expect he say the vein at the side of he forehead swell with strenuousness from man who only play at war why i be tell by a man who be dine with asquith not long ago that he be talk all the time about georgian poetry and that apparently he know more about the subject than anybody at the table fiddle while rome be burn i call it do you want he to hold a cabinet council over the dinner-table i ask the strenuous person kill I with a look of scorn but all the same so far from be shock to learn that mr asquith can talk about poetry in these day the fact if it be a fact increase my confidence in he competence for he task i should suffer no pain even if i hear that he take a hand of card after dinner and i hope he take care to get a game of golf at the week-end i like man who have great responsibility to carry they burden easily and to relax the bow as often as possible the bigger the job you have in hand the more necessary it be to cultivate the habit of detachment you want to walk away from the subject sometimes as the artist walk away from he canvas to get a better view of he work i never feel sure of a article until i have put it away forget it and read it again with a fresh mind disengage from the subject and see it objectively rather than subjectively it be the affliction of the journalist that he have to face the light before he have have time to withdraw to a critical distance and to see he work with the detachment of the public there be nothing more mistaken than the view that because a thing be serious you must be think about it seriously all the time if you do that you cease to be the master of you subject : the subject become the master of you that be what be the matter with the fanatic he be so obsess by he idea that he can not relate it to other idea and lose all sense of proportion and often all sense of sanity i have see more unrelieved seriousness in a lunatic asylum than anywhere else the key to success be to come to a task with a fresh mind that be the meaning of the very immoral advice give by a don to a friend of mine on the day before a examination what would you advise I to read to-night ask my friend anxious to make the most of the few remain hour if i be you say the don i should not read anything i should get drunk he do not mean that the business be so unimportant that it do not matter what he do he mean that it be so important that he must forget all about it and come to it afresh from the outside and he use the most violent illustration he could find to express he mean it be with the mind as with the soil if you want to get the best out of you land you must change the crop and sometimes even let the land lie fallow and if you want to get the best out of you mind on a given theme you must let it range and have plenty of diversion and the more remote the diversion be from the theme the better i know a very grave man whose day be spend in the most responsible work who go to see charlie chaplin once or twice every week and laugh like a schoolboy all the time i should not trust he work less on that account : i should trust it all the more i should know that he do not allow it to get the whip hand of he that he keep sane and healthy by run out to play as it be occasionally i think all solemn man ought to take sixpenny-worth of charlie chaplin occasionally and i be certain they ought to play more i believe that the real disease of germany be that it have never learn to play the bow be stretch all the time and the nation be afflict with a dreadful seriousness that suggest the madhouse by its lack of humor and gaiety the oppressiveness of life begin with the child germany be one of the two country in the world where the suicide of child be a familiar social fact year ago when i be in cologne i christen it the city of the elderly child and no one i think can have have any experience of germany without be strike by the premature gravity of the young if germany have have fewer professor and a decent sprinkling of cricket and football grounds perhaps thing might have be different i do not generally agree with copybook maxim but all work and no play do make jack -lrb- or rather han -rrb- a dull boy perhaps it be true that we play too much but i be quite sure that the german have play too little and if there must be a mistake on one side or the other let it be on the side of too much play on the intelligent golf ball i read the other day a article by my colleague arcturus which i thought be a little boastful it refer to a bull-dog now i can not tell what there be about a bull-dog that make people haughty but it be certain that i have never know a case in which the companionship of that animal have not have this effect the man who keep a bull-dog become after a time only fit for the company of a bull-dog he catch the August pride of the animal seem to think like a bulldog to talk in the brief scornful tone of a bulldog and even to look fat and formidable like a bull-dog that however be not a uncommon phenomenon among those who live with animal go to a fat stock show and look at the man around the cattle pen or recall the pork butcher you have know and tell I -- but possibly you sir who read these line be a pork butcher and resent the implication sir you resentment be just you be the exception sir -- a most notable exception but my object here be not merely to warn arcturus of the perilous company he be keep i refer to he bull-dog panegyric also to justify I in enlarge on my own private vanity if he be permit to write to the extent of a column on a bull-dog i can at least claim the same latitude in regard to a sensible subject like golf and i have this advantage over he that i have a real message i have a hint to offer that will mean money in pocket to you and first let I say that i have nothing to teach you in the way of play i be in that stage of the novitiate that seem sheer imbecility when i get a good stroke i stare after it as stout cortez stare at the pacific with a wild surmise but it be because i be a bad player that i feel i can be useful to you for most of my time on the link be spend in look for lose ball now i do not object to look for ball i rather enjoy it it be a healthy open-air occupation that keep the body exercise and the mind fallow there be some people who think the spectacle of a grown-up man -lrb- with a family -rrb- look in a open field for a ball that be not there be ridiculous they be mistaken it be really see from the philosophic angle a very noble spectacle it be the symbol of deathless hope it be part of the great discipline of the game it be that part of the game at which i do best there be not a spinney over the whole course that i do not know by heart there be not a bit of gorse that i have not probe and be probe by i must have spend hour in the ditch and i have upon I the scar leave by every hedgerow and the result be that while i be worthless as a golfer i think i may claim to be quite in the first class at find lose ball now all discovery hinge upon some sudden illumination i have up to a certain point be a sad failure in recover ball i watch they fall with the utmost care and be so sure of they that i feel that i could walk blindfold and pick they up but when i come to the spot the ball be not there this experience become so common that at last the conclusion force itself upon I that the golf ball have a sort of impish intelligence that could only be meet by a superior cunning i suspect that it deliberately hide itself and that so long as it be aware that you be hunting for it it take a fiendish delight in dodge you if say i one could only let the thing suppose it be not be look for it would be take off its guard i put the idea into operation and i rejoice to say it work like a charm the method be quite simple you lose the ball of course to begin with that be easy enough then you search for it and the longer you search the deeper grow the mystery of its vanish you companion come and help you to poke the hedge and stir up the ditch and you all agree that you have never know such a perfectly ridiculous thing before and have clearly prove that the ball be not anywhere in the neighborhood you take another out of the bag and proceed with the game so far everything be quite ordinary the game be over the ball be lose and you prepare to go but you decide to go home by a rather roundabout way that bring you by the spot that you have scour in vain you be not go to search for the ball that would simply put the creature up to some new artifice no you be just walk round that way accidentally what so natural as that you should have you eye on the ground and there sure enough lie the ball take completely unaware it be so ridiculously obvious that to say that it be lie there when you be look for it so industriously be absurd it simply could not have be there you suspect that if after you search instead of go on with the play you have hide behind the hedge and watch you would have see the creature come out from its hole i do not expect to have my theory that the golf-ball have a intelligence accept the mystery be explicable i be tell on the doctrine of the fresh eye you look for a thing so hard that you seem to lose the faculty of vision then you forget all about it and find it the experience apply to all the operation of the mind if i get stick in write a article i go and do a bit of physical work ride a bicycle or merely walk round the garden and the current flow again or you have a knotty problem to decide you think furiously about it all day and get more hopelessly undecided the longer you think then you go to bed and you wake in the morning with you mind make up hence the phrase i will sleep on it it be this freshness of the vision this faculty of passive illumination that wordsworth have in mind when he write : think you ` mid all this mighty sum of thing for ever speak that nothing of itself will come but we must still be seek and yet i can not quite get rid of my fancy that the golf ball do enjoy the game on a prisoner of war there be still a few apple on the topmost branch of the tree in the orchard they be there because david the labourer who use to come and lend we a hand in he odd hour -- chiefly when the moon be up -- be no longer available you may remember how david open he heart to I about enlist when he stand on the ladder pick the pear last year he do not like to go and he do not like to stay all the other chap have go and he do not feel comfortable like in be leave behind but there be he mother and he wife and he aunt jane and not a man to do a hand 's turn for 'em or to dig they garden if he go and there be the allotment -- that ` ud run to weed and well the allotment have run to weed i pass it to-day and look over the hedge and see the chickweed and the thistle in undisputed possession for david have go it will take a long time to turn he into a soldier we say when we see he leave he thatched roof last spring to join up and watch he shamble down the lane to the valley and the distant station the war will be over before he get into the trench i say cheerfully to he wife he mother and aunt jane as they sit later in the day mingle they tear in the parlor -- that apartment sacred to sunday funeral and wedding poor boy what 'll he do without he comfortable bed moan he mother but by may there come news that david be in france by June he be in the trench and woe sit heavy on the three woman to whom the world without david be a empty place then come silence the postman come up the lane on he bicycle to we straggle hamlet on the hillside twice a day and after david have go he visit to the cottage of the three woman have be frequent sometimes he put he bicycle at the mother 's gate sometimes at david 's gate less often at aunt jane 's gate for david be a industrious correspondent even though he letter be a laborious compromise between cross and hope you be well as it leave I at present but in August the postman cease to call long before he hour you could see the three woman watch for he come i think the postman get to dread turn the corner and face the expectant woman with empty hand he could not help feeling that somehow he be to blame at first he would stop and point out elaborately the reason for delay in the post then when this have become thin with time he adopt the expedient of ride past the cottage very hard with eye stare far ahead as though he be go to a fire or be the bearer of a important dispatch but at the end of a fortnight or so he come round the corner one morning more in the old style the woman observe the change and go out to meet he but they face fall as they look at the letter and see that the handwriting be not david 's and the contents be as bad as they could be the letter be from a lad in the valley who have join up with david he write from a hospital ask for news of he comrade whom he have see knock over in the advance in which he himself have be wound for the rest of the day it be observe the cottage door be never open nor do any one venture to break in on the misery of the woman inside the parson 's wife come up in she gig from the valley have hear the news but she do not call she only talk to the neighbor who have have the detail from the postman every one feel the news like a personal blow and even the widow wigley who live down in the valley be full of sympathy she have never quite get over she resentment at the funeral of david 's father she own husband have be carry to he grave on a hand-bier but at the funeral of david 's father there be a horse-drawn hearse and a carriage for the mourner they be always _ such _ people for show say mr wigley and the memory have rankle but now it be bury next day we see the mother and the wife set out down the lane for the village post-office and thereafter daily they go to await the arrival of letter return each day silent and hopeless at last in reply to inquiry which have be make at the war office there come the official statement that david have be report wound and miss we learn that this usually mean that the man be dead but the woman do not know this and curiously enough david 's mother who have be the most despairing of woman and seem to regard david as dead even before he start now discover a genius for hopefulness she have hear of a case from a neighbouring village of a man who have be report dead and who afterwards write from a prison camp in germany and she cling to this precedent with a confident tenacity that we do not try to weaken it be foolish of course we say she be pin she faith to a case in a thousand but the hope give the woman something to live for and the wound would heal the better for the illusion and after all she be right this morning we see the postman call at the cottage he hand a post card to the wife and it be evident that something wonderful and radiant have happen the woman fall on each other laugh happy no more go into the house to shut the door on the world they come out to share the great tiding with they neighbor david be alive david be a prisoner in germany he be wound but he be go on all right he can not write yet but he will yes there be the post card all right the english be not very good and the script be german but the fact that david be alive in hospital shone clear and indisputable it be as though he be raise from the dead cry the wife through she tear the joy of the old mother be touch with solemnity she be a great chapel-goer and she utterance be naturally color by the book with which she be most familiar my son be dead and be alive again she say simply he be lose and be find when i go out into the orchard and see the red-cheeked apple still cling to the topmost branch i think perhaps david will be able to lend I a hand with those tree next autumn after all on the world we live in in one of those charming article which he write in _ the new statesman _ mr j arthur thomson tell of the wonderful world of odour to which we be largely stranger no doubt in a earlier existence we rely much more upon we nose for we food we safety and all that concerned we and have a highly develop faculty of smell which have become more or less atrophied fee fie fo fum i smell the blood of a englishman say the giant in the story but that be long ago if we be leave to the testimony of we nose we could not tell a englishman from a hippopotamus to the bee on the other hand with its two or three thousand olfactory pore the world be primarily a world of smell if we could question that wonderful creature we should find that it think and talk of nothing but the odour of the field we should find that it have a range of experience in that realm beyond we wildest imagining we should find that there be more smell in heaven and earth than be dream of in we philosophy we talk of the world as if we sensation be the sum total of experience but the truth be that there be a infinity of world outside we comprehension world of vision and hearing and smell that be beyond we finite capacity some so microscopic as to escape we at one end of the scale some so vast and intangible as to escape we at the other end i go into the garden just now to pick some strawberry one of they tempt I forthwith by its ripe and luxuriant beauty i bit into it and find it hollow out in the center and in that luscious hollow be a colony of earwig for they that strawberry be the world and a very jolly world too -- abundance of food a soft bed to lie on and a chamber of exquisite perfume what i wonder be the thought of the little creature as they comfortable world be suddenly shatter by some vast inexplicable power beyond the scope of they vision and understanding i could not help idly wonder whether the shell of we comfortable world have be break by some power without which be as far beyond we apprehension as i be beyond the apprehension of the happy dweller in the strawberry and it be not only the world which be peculiar to the myriad creature of diverse instinct and faculty which be so strangely separate we ourselves all dwell in world of infinite variety i do not mean the social and professional world in which we move though here too the world be not one but many there be not much in common between the world as it appear to sarah ellen who run four loom in a lancashire weave shed during fifty-one week in the year and my lady broadacre who sun herself in mayfair but i be speak here of we individual world the world of we private thought and emotion my world be not you world nor yours mine we sit and talk with each other we work together and play together we exchange confidence and share we laughter and we experience but ultimately we can neither of we understand the world of the other -- that world which be the sum of a million factor of unthinkable diversity trifle light as air memory experience physical emotion the play of light and color and sound attachment and antipathy often so obscure that we can not even explain they to ourselves we may feel a collective emotion under the impulse of some powerful event or personality we may ebb and flow as a tide to the rhythm of a great melody or to the incantation of noble oratory the news of a great victory in these day would move we to we common center and bring all we separate world into a mighty chorus of thanksgiving but even in these common emotion there be infinite shades of difference and when they have pass we subside again into the world where we dwell alone most of we be doom to go through life without communicate the mystery of we experience alas for those who never sing but die with all they music in they it be the privilege of the artist in any medium to enrich the general life with the consciousness of the world that he alone have experience he give we new kingdom for we inheritance make we the sharer of he vision open out wider horizon and flood we life with richer glory i enter such a kingdom the other afternoon i turn out of the strand which be throng and throb with the news of the great advance -- it be the first day of the battle of the somme -- and enter the aldwych theater as if by magic i pass from the thrilling drama of the present into a realm full of sweet dream and health and quiet breathing -- into a sunlit world where the zephyr fan you cheek like a benediction and the brook tinkle through the gracious landscape and melody be on every bough and joy and peace be all about you -- the idyllic world where the marvellous child mozart reign like a enchanter what though the tale of _ the magic flute _ be foolish beyond word who care for the tale who think of the tale it be only the wand in the hand of the magician though it be but a broomstick it will open all the magic casement of earth and heaven it will surround we with the choir invisible and send we forth into green pasture and by the cool water-brook that be mozart 's vision of the world in he brief but immortal journey through it perhaps it be only a dream world but what a dream to live through and to he it be as real a world as that of mr gradgrind whose vision be shut in by what burn call the raise edge of a bawbee we must not think that we world be the only one there be world outside we experience call that a sunset say the lady to turner as she stand before the artist 's picture i never see a sunset like that no madam say turner do not you wish you have perhaps you world and mine be only mean because we be near-sighted perhaps we miss the vision not because the vision be not there but because we darken the window with dirty hanging i be tell you the other day i go into the law court to hear a case of some interest and i soon become more interested in the counsel than in the case they offer a curious contrast of method one be emphatic and dogmatic i be not ask you he seem to say to the judge and jury i be tell you the other be win and conciliatory he do not thrust he view down the jury 's throat he seem to offer they for they consideration and leave it at that he be not there to dictate to they but to hold he client 's case up to the light as it be just as a draper hold a length of silk up before he customer now as a matter of fact i think the dogmatic gentleman have the better case and the stronger argument but i notice next day that the verdict go against he he win he argument and lose he case that be what commonly happen with the dogmatic and argumentative man he shut up the mind to reason he change the ground from the issue itself to a matter of personal dignity you be no longer concern with whether the thing be right or wrong you be concern about show you opponent that you be not to be bully by he into believe what he want you to believe even johnson who be perhaps the most dogmatic person that ever live know that success in the argument be often fatal to success in the case dr taylor once commend a physician to he and say : i fight many battle for he as many people in the country dislike he but you should consider sir reply johnson that by every one of you victory he be a loser for every man of whom you get the better will be very angry and resolve not to employ he whereas if people get the better of you in argument about he they 'll think ` we 'll send for dr -- nevertheless ' but johnson fight not to convince but for love of the argumentative victory a great contemporary of he whom he never meet and whom if he have meet he would probably have insult -- benjamin franklin to wit -- preferred win the case to win the argument while still a boy he tell we he be fascinate by the socratic method and instead of express opinion ask lead question he cease to use word like certainly undoubtedly or anything that give the air of positiveness to a opinion and say i apprehend or i conceive a thing to be so and so this habit he say have be of great advantage to I when i have have occasion to inculcate my opinion and persuade man into measure that i have be engage from time to time in promote and as the chief end of conversation be to _ inform _ or to be _ inform _ to _ please _ or to _ persuade _ i wish well-meaning and sensible man would not lessen they power of do good by a positive assume manner that seldom fail to disgust tend to create opposition and to defeat most of those purpose for which speech be give we in fact if you wish to instruct other a positive dogmatical manner in advance you sentiment may occasion opposition and prevent a candid attention if you desire instruction and improvement from other you should not at the same time express yourself fix in you present opinion modest and sensible man who do not love disputation will leave you undisturbed in the possession of you error it be really i suppose we old friend compulsion again we hate prussianism in the realm of think as much as in the realm of action if i tell you you have get to believe so-and-so you disposition be to refuse to do anything of the sort it be the voluntary instinct that breathe in all of we that make falstaff refuse to give prince hal reason : i give thee reason though reason be as plenty as blackberry i would not give thee reason _ on compulsion _ -- i i be once talk to a member of parliament who be lament that he have fail to win the ear of the house he be puzzle by the failure he be a fluent speaker he know he subject with great thoroughness and he character be irreproachable and yet when he rise the house go out he be like a dinner-bell he could not understand it yet everybody else understand it quite well it be because he be always tell you and there be nothing the house of common dislike so much as a schoolmaster probably the most successful speaker judge by result who ever rise in the house of common be cobden he be one of the few man in history who have change a decision in parliament by a speech he do it because of he extraordinarily persuasive manner he keep the mind of he hearer receptive and disengaged he do not impress they with the fact that he be right and they be wrong they forget themselves when they see the subject in a clear white light and be prepare to judge it on its merit rather than by they prejudice one of the few persuasive speaker i have hear in the house of common in recent year be mr harold cox many of he opinion i detest but the engaging way in which he present they make you almost angry with yourself at disagree with he you feel indeed that you must be wrong and that such open-mindedness and such a friendly conciliatory manner as he show must somehow be the evidence of a right view of thing as a matter of fact of course he be really a very dogmatic gentleman at the bottom -- none more so as indeed franklin be but he have the art to conceal the emphasis of he opinion and so he make even those who disagree with he listen to he case almost with a desire to endorse it it be a great gift i wish i have get it on courage i be ask the other day to send to a new magazine a statement as to the event of the war which have make the deepest impression on I without hesitation i select the remarkable christmas demonstration in flander here be man who for week and month past have be engage in the task of stalk each other and kill each other and suddenly under the influence of a common memory they repudiate the whole gospel of war and declare the gospel of brotherhood next day they begin kill each other again as the obedient instrument of government they do not control and of motive they do not understand but the fact remain it be a beam of light in the darkness rich in meaning and hope but if i be ask to name the instance of individual action which have most impressed I i should find the task more difficult should i select something that show how war deprave or something that show how it ennoble if the latter i think i would choose that beautiful incident of the sailor on the _ formidable _ he have win by ballot a place in one of the boat the ship be go down but he be to be save one picture the scene : the boat be wait to take he to the shore and safety he look at the old comrade who have lose in the ballot and who stand there doom to death he feel the passion for life surge within he he see the cold dark sea wait to engulf its victim and in that great moment -- the greatest moment that can come to any man -- he make the triumphant choice he turn to one of he comrade you have get parent he say i have not and with that word -- so heroic in its simplicity -- he make the other take he place in the boat and sign he own death warrant i see he on the deck among he doomed fellow watch the disappear boat until the final plunge come and all be over the sea never take a braver man to its bosom greater love have no man than this can you read that story without some tumult within you -- without feeling that humanity itself be ennoble by this great act and that you be in some mysterious way better for the deed that be the splendid fruit of all such sublime sacrifice it enrich the whole human family it make we lift we head with pride that we be man -- that there be in we at we best this noble gift of valiant unselfishness this glorious prodigality that spend life itself for something greater than life if we have meet this nameless sailor we should have find he perhaps a very ordinary man with plenty of failing doubtless like the rest of we and without any idea that he have in he the priceless jewel beside which crown and coronet be empty bauble he be something greater than he know how many of we could pass such a test what should i do what would you do we neither of we know for we be as great a mystery to ourselves as we be to we neighbor bob acre say he find that a man may have a deal of valor in he without know it and it be equally true that a man may be more chicken-hearted than he himself suspect only the occasion discover of what stuff we be make -- whether we be hero or coward saint or sinner a blustering manner will not reveal the one any more than a long face will reveal the other the merit of this sailor 's heroism be that it be do with calculation -- in cold blood as it be with that two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage of which napoleon speak as the real thing many of we could do brave thing in hot blood with a sudden rush of the spirit who would fail if we have time as this man have to pause and think to reckon to doubt to grow cold and selfish the merit of he deed be that it be a act of physical courage base on the higher quality of moral courage nor because a man fail in the great moment be he necessarily all a coward mark twain be once talk to a friend of mine on the subject of courage in man and speak of a man whose name be associate with a book that have become a classic i know he well he say and i know he as a brave man yet he once do the most cowardly thing i have ever hear of any man he be in a shipwreck and as the ship be go down he snatch a lifebelt from a woman passenger and put it on himself he be save and she be drown and in spite of that frightful act i think he be not a coward i know there be not a day of he life afterwards when he would not willingly and in cold blood have give he life to recall that shameful act in this case the failure be not in moral courage but in physical courage he be demoralise by the peril and the physical coward come uppermost if he have have time to recover he moral balance he would have die a honorable death it be no uncommon thing for a man to have in he the element both of the hero and the coward you remember that delightful remark of mr disraelus one of the most characteristic of the many quaint saying attribute to that strange woman dizzy she say have wonderful moral courage but no physical courage i always have to pull the string of he shower bath it be a capital illustration of that conflict of the coward and the brave man that take place in most of we dizzy 's moral courage carry he to the bath but there he physical courage fail he he could not pull the string that administer the cold shock the bathroom be rich in such secret and life teem with they the true hero be he who unite the two quality the physical element be the more plentiful for one man who will count the cost of sacrifice and have count it pay the price with unfaltering heart there be many who will answer the sudden call to meet peril with swift defiance the courage that snatch a comrade from under the gun of the enemy or a child from the flame be happily not uncommon it be inspire by a impulse that take man out of themselves and by a certain spirit of challenge to fate that every one with a sport instinct love to take but the act of the sailor of the _ formidable _ be a much bigger thing here be no thrill of gallantry and no sport risk he deal in cold certainty : the boat and safety the ship and death he life or the other 's and he think of he comrade 's old parent at home and choose death it be a great end i wonder whether you or i would be capable of it i would give much to feel that i could answer in the affirmative -- that i could take my stand on the spiritual plane of that unknown sailor on spendthrift while every one i suppose agree that lady ida sitwell richly deserve she three month ' imprisonment there be many who will have a sneak pity for she and that not because she be a woman of family who will suffer peculiar torture from prison life on the contrary i have no doubt that a spell of imprisonment be just what she need in fact it be what most of we need especially most of those who live a life of luxurious idleness to be compel to get up early to clean you cell to wear plain clothes to live on plain food to observe regular hour and do regular duty -- this be no matter for tear but for thankfulness it be the sort of discipline that we ought to undergo periodically for we spiritual and even bodily health no the sympathy that will be feel for lady ida be the sympathy which be commonly feel for the spendthrift -- for the person who no matter what he income be congenitally incapable of make end meet the miser have no friend but the spendthrift have generally too many we avoid harpagon as though he be a leper but falstaff who like lady ida could find no cure for this intolerable consumption of the purse never lack friend and even justice shallow it will be remembered lend he a thousand crown there be no record of its have be repay though falstaff be once surprise in a moment of bitter humiliation into admit the debt and charle surface and micawber -- who can deny they a certain affection i have no doubt that mr micawber 's papa who live to bail mr micawber out many time until he die lament by a wide circle of friend love the fellow as you and i love he i should deem it a privilege to bail out micawber but elwe the miser -- ugh the very name chill the blood the difference i suppose proceeds from the idea that while the miser be the soul of selfishness the spendthrift be at bottom a good-natured fellow and a lover of he kind no doubt the vice of the spendthrift have a touch of generosity but it be often generosity at other people 's expense and be not seldom as essentially selfish as the vice of the miser it be rather like the generosity of the man who accord to sydney smith be so touch by a charity sermon that he pick he neighbor 's pocket of a guinea and put it in the plate i have no doubt that lady ida if she have get miss dobb 's money would have scatter it about with a very free hand and would have contribute to the collection plate quite handsomely but she be selfish none the less it be she form of selfishness to enjoy the luxury of spend money she have not get just as it be elwe 's form of selfishness to enjoy the luxury of save money that he have get the point be very well state by a famous miser whose son have since be in parliament -lrb- i will not say on which side -rrb- the old man have accumulate a vast fortune but in the scotch phrase would have grudge you the smoke off he porridge -lrb- he die by the way properly enough through walk home in the rain because he be too mean to take a cab -rrb- he be once ask why he be so anxious to increase he riches since he son would probably squander they and he reply if my son get as much pleasure out of squander my money as i have have out of save it i shall not mind both the hoarding and the spending you see be in he view equally a matter of mere selfish pleasure but i admit that the uncalculating spirit that land people in debt be a more engaging frailty than the calculate spirit of the miser i know a delightful man who seem to have no more knowledge of the relation of income and expenditure than a kitten if he get # 100 unexpectedly he do not look at it in relation to he whole need he do not remember rent rate tax baker butcher tailor no on the strength of it he will order a new piano in the morning buy he wife a sealskin jacket in the afternoon and by the next day be deeper in the mire than ever and wonder how he get there and there be jone 's young wife a charming woman who be drag she husband into debt with the same kittenish irresponsibility she will leave jone on the pavement with a remark that suggest that she be go into the shop to buy some pin and will come out with a request for # 10 for some perfectly lovely thing that have catch she eye and jone be elderly and still a little astonished at have win the affection of such a divinity have not the courage to say no to the people afflict with these loose spending habit i would commend the lesson of a little incident i saw in a tram on the embankment the other evening there enter and sit beside I a work man carry he kit in a handkerchief and wear a scarf round he neck a cloth cap and corduroy trousers -- obviously a labourer earn perhaps 25 a week he pay he fare and then he take from he pocket a packet tie up in a handkerchief he untie the knot and there come forth a neat pocket-book with pencil attach he open it and begin to write my curiosity be too much for my manners out of the tail of my eye i watch the motion of he finger and this be what he write : tram 1-1\/2 _ d _ in a flash i seem to see the whole orderly life of that poor labourer he have a anchorage in the toss sea of this troublesome world he have get hold of a lesson that lady ida sitwell ought to try and learn during the next three month it be this : watch you spending for it be the people who be more concerned about get money than about how they spend it who come to grief a very acute observer once tell I that the principal difference between the scotch people and the lancashire people be that the former thought most about how they spend and the latter most about how much they get and the difference he say be the difference between a thrifty and a unthrifty people i think that be true nothing be more common than to find people worse off as they get better off they have learn the art of get money and lose the art of spend it wisely they pay they way on # 200 a year and get hopelessly into debt on # 500 they be safe in a rowing boat but capsize in a sailing boat here be a axiom which i offer to all spendthrift : we can not command we incoming but we can control outgoing on a top-hat a few day ago i go to a christen to make vow on behalf of the offspring of a gallant young officer now at the front i conceive that the fitting thing on such a occasion be to wear a silk hat and accordingly i take out the article warm it before the fire and rub it with a hat pad until it be nice and shiny put it on my head and set out for the church but i soon regret the choice it have no support from any one else present and when later i get out of the tube and walk down the strand i find that i be a conspicuous person which above all thing i hate to be my hat i saw be observe eye be turn towards I with that mild curiosity with which one remark any innocent oddity or vanity of the street i become self-conscious and look around for companionship but as my eye travel along the crowded pavement i could see nothing but bowler and trilby and occasional straw ah here at last say i be one come but a nearer view only complete my discomfiture for it be one of those greasy-shiny hat which go with fray trousers and broken boot and which be the symbol of better day of hope that be dead and drink that dally of a social status that have go and of a suburban villa that have shrink to a cubicle in a rowton lodging-house i look at greasy-hat and greasy-hat look at I and in that momentary glance of fellowship we agree that we be out of it i put my silk hat away at night with the firm resolution that nothing short of a invitation to buckingham palace or some similar incredible disaster should make I drag it into the light again for the truth be that the war have give the top-hat a knock-out blow it have be totter on we brow for some time there be a very hot summer a few year ago which begin the revolution the tyranny of the top-hat become intolerable and quite respectable people begin to be see in the street with panama and straw but these be only concession to a irresponsible climate and the silk hat still hold its ancient sway as the crown and glory of we city civilisation and now it have topple down and be on the way perhaps to become as much a thing of the past as wig or knee-breeches it be almost as rare in the strand as it be in market street manchester cabinet minister and other sublime personage still wear it coachman still wear it and my friend greasy-hat still wear it but for the rest of we it be a splendor that be past a memory of the world before the deluge it may be that it will revive it would not be the first time that such a result of a great catastrophe be find to be only temporary i remember that pepy record in he diary that one result of the great plague be that the wig go out of fashion people be afraid to wear wig that might be make of the hair of those who have die of infection but the wig return again for more than a century though you may remember that in _ the rival _ there be a early hint of its final disappearance there be never probably a more crazy fashion and like most crazy fashion it begin as the alexandra limp of we youth begin in snobbery be it not a fact that a bald-headed king wear a wig to conceal he baldness which set all the flunkey-world wear wig to conceal they hair this aping of the great be always convert some defect or folly into a virtue when lady percy in _ henry iv _ be lament hotspur she say : -- he be indeed the glass wherein the noble youth do dress themselves he have no leg that practice not he gait and speak thick which nature make he blemish become the accent of the valiant for those that could speak low and tardily would turn they own perfection to abuse to seem like he in the case of the top-hat the disappearance be due to the psychology of the war the great tragedy have bring we down to the bed-rock of thing and have make we feel somehow that ornament be out of place and that the top-hat be a falsity in a world that have become a battlefield i do not think woman have share this feeling to the same extent i be tell there be never so many sealskin coat to be see as during last winter but perhaps the woman will say that man have be only too glad to use the war as a excuse for get rid of a incubus and they may be right we have better not make too great a virtue of what be after all a comfortable change let we enjoy it without boast we enjoyment may be short-lived we must not be surprise if this incredible hat return in triumph with peace it have survive the blast of many century and infinite change of fashion it be i suppose the most ancient survival in the dress that man wear there be in the froissart collection at the british museum a illumination -lrb- date from the fifteenth century -rrb- show the expedition of the french and english against the barbary corsair and there seat in the boat be man clothe in armor they have put they helmet aside and be wear top-hat and it may be that when macaulay 's new zealander century hence take he seat on that broken arch of london bridge to sketch the ruin of st paul 's he will sit under the shelter of a top-hat that have out-last all we greatness there must be some virtue in a thing that be so immortal if the doctrine of the survival of the fittest apply to dress it be the fittest thing we have trousers be a thing of yesterday with we but we top-hat carry we back to the war of the rose and beyond it be not its beauty that explain it i have never hear any one deny that it be ugly though custom may have blunt we sense of its ugliness it be not its utility i have never hear any one claim that this strange cylinder have that quality it be not its comfort it be stiff it be heavy it be unmanageable in a wind and ruin by a shower of rain it need as much attention as a peevish child or a pet dog it be not even cheap and when it be disreputable it be the most disreputable thing on earth what be the mystery of its strange persistence be it simply a habit that we can not throw off or be there a certain snobbishness about it that appeal to the flunkeyism of man that be perhaps the explanation that be perhaps why it have disappear when snobbishness be feel to be inconsistent with the world of stern reality and bitter sorrow in which we live we be humble and serious and out of humor with the pretentious vanity of we top-hat on lose one 's memory the case of the soldier in the keighley hospital who have lose he memory in the war and have be identify by rival family as a scotchman a yorkshireman and so on be one of the most singular personal incident of the war on the face of it it would seem impossible that a mother should not know she own son or a brother he brother yet in this case it be clear that some of the claimant be mistake the incident be not of course without precedent the most notorious case of the sort be that of arthur orton the impudent tichborne claimant whose strongest card in he imposture be that lady tichborne believe he to be she long-lost son in that case no doubt the maternal passion be the source of a credulity that blind the old lady to the flagrant evidence of the fraud but generally speak we memory of other face be extremely vague and elusive i have just come in from a walk with a friend of mine whom i have know intimately for many year yet for the life of I i could not at this moment tell you the color of he eye nor could i give a reasonable account of he nose or of the shape of he face i have a general sense of he appearance but no absolute knowledge of the detail and if he be to meet I to-morrow with a blank stare and a shaven upper lip i should pass he without a thought of recognition memory in fact be largely reciprocal and when one of the party have lose he power of response the key be go if the lock will not yield to the key you be satisfied that the key be the wrong one no matter how much it look like the right one i think i could tell my dog from a thousand other dog but if the creature be to lose he memory and to pass I in the street without answer my call i should pass on simply observe that he bear a remarkable likeness to my animal most of we i suppose have experience in a momentary and partial degree a sudden stoppage of the apparatus of memory you be ask let we say to spell parallelogram in a ordinary way you could do it on you head or in you sleep but the sudden demand give you a mental jerk that make the wretched word a hopeless chaos of r 's and l 's and the more you try to sort they out the less convincing do they seem or walk with a friend you meet at a turn in the street that excellent woman mr orpington-smith you know she as well as you know you own mother but the fact that you have get to introduce she by she name forthwith send she name fly into space the passionate attempt to capture it before it escape only make its escape more certain and you be reduce to the pitiful expedient of mumble something that be inaudible the worst experience of a lapse of memory that ever come to I be in the midst of a speech which i have to make before a large gathering in a london hall i have get to the middle of what i have to say when it seem to I that the whole machine of the mind suddenly cease to work it be as though a immense loneliness descend on I i see the audience before I but apart from vision i seem bereft of all my faculty if i have in that instant be ask for my name i be doubtful whether i could have get anywhere near it happily some one in a front row think i be pause for a word throw out a suggestion it be like magic i feel the machine of memory start again with a almost audible puff puff and i go on to the end quite comfortably the pause have seem terribly long to I but i be surprised afterwards to find that it have be so brief as to be generally unnoticed or regard as a artful way of emphasise a point i let it go at that but i know myself that in that moment i have lose my memory even distinguish and expert orator have be know to suffer from this absolute lapse of memory the rosebery incident -- be it in the chesterfield speech -- be perhaps the best know but i once hear mr redmond the calmest and most assure of speaker come to a _ impasse _ in the house of common that hold he up literally for minute we be creature of memory and when as in the keighley case memory be go personality itself have go nothing be leave but the empty envelope the more fundamental function of memory the habit of respiration of walk and physical movement of mastication and so on remain the keighley man still eat and walk with all the knowledge of a lifetime he probably preserve he taste for tobacco but these thing have nothing to do with personality that be the product of the myriad mental impression that you have store up in you pilgrimage there be not a moment in you life that be not charge with the significance of memory you can not hear the blackbird singing in the low bough in the evening without the secret music of summer eve long past be stir within you it be that response of the inner harp of memory that give the song its beauty and so everything we do and see and hear be touch with a thousand influence which we can not catalogue but which constitute we veritable self a old hymn tune or a old song a turn of phrase a scent in the garden a tone of voice a curve in the path -- everything come to we weight with its own treasure of memory bitter or sweet but always significant it be a mistake to suppose that memory be merely a capacity to remember fact in that respect there be the widest diversity of experience macaulay could recite _ paradise lose _ while rossettus be a little doubtful whether the sun go round the earth or the earth round the sun i once meet a american elocutionist who could recite ten of shakespeare 's play and he show I the wonderful system of mnemonic by which he achieve the miracle but he be a mere recording machine -- a dull fellow the true argosy of memory be not fact but a perfume compound of all the sunset we have ever see all the joy and friendship pleasure and sorrow we have ever know all the emotion we have feel all the brave and mean thing we have do all the broken hope we have suffer to have lose that argosy be to be dead no matter how healthy a appetite we retain on wear a fur-lined coat a friend of mine -- one of those people who talk about money with a air of familiarity that suggest that they have get a out-crop of the rand reef in they back-garden -- say to I the other day that i ought to buy a fur-lined coat there never be such a time as this for buy a fur-lined coat or a sealskin jacket say he what with the war and the sale and the tradesman 's need of cash they be simply be throw at you you could have they almost for the trouble of carry they away a trifle of fifteen or twenty pound would buy one a coat that would be cheap at sixty guinea and remember there be wear for twenty year in it and think of the saving in doctor 's bill -- for you simply can not catch cold if you wear a fur coat in short not to buy a fur coat at this moment be a act of gross improvidence a wrong to one 's family a a and then he look with the cold disapproval of a connoisseur at the coat i be wear and in the light of that glance i saw for the first time that it be yes certainly it be not what it have be now i be not go to pretend that i have a soul above fur-lined coat i have not i love they and by fur coat i do not mean those adorn with astrakhan collar which i abominate a man in a astrakhan coat be to I a suspicious character a stage baron one who be probably deep in treason stratagem and spoil the suspicion be unjust to the gentleman in the astrakhan coat of course most suspicion be unjust and if you ask I to give reason for this unreasoning hostility to astrakhan i do not know that i could find they perhaps it be the dislike i have for artificial curl perhaps it be that the astrakhan collar remind I of those unhappy pet dog who look as though they have be put in curl papers overnight and send out into the street by they owner as a poor jest yes i think it must be that sense of artificiality which be at the root of the dislike no doubt the curl be natural no doubt the woolly sheep of astrakhan do wear they coat in these little heaven-sent ringlet but well i do not like thee doctor fall but fur-lined coat with fine fur collar be quite another affair if i have the magic nib i could grow lyrical over they i could indeed in place-of this article i would write a ode to a fur-lined coat i would sing of the asian wild from whence it come of its wondrous line and its soft and silken texture of its generous warmth and its caress touch i would set up such a universal hunger for fur coat that the tradesman in oxford street and regent street would come and offer I a guinea a word to write advertisement for they and yet i shall not buy a fur-lined coat and i will tell you why a fur coat be not a article of clothing : it be a new way of life you can not say with reckless prodigality here i will have a fur coat and make a end of this gnawing passion the fur coat be not a end : it be a begin you have get to live up to it you have get to take the fur-coat point of view of you relation to society when chauncey depew as a boy buy a beautiful spotted dog at a fair and take it home the rain come down and the spot begin to run into stripe he take the dog back to the man of whom he have buy it and demand a explanation but you have a umbrella with that dog say the man no say the boy oh say the man there be a umbrella go with that dog and so it be with the fur-lined coat so many thing go with it it be in this respect like that grand piano to which you succumb in a moment of paternal weakness -- or after a lucky stroke in rubber the old furniture which have seem so unexceptionable before suddenly become dowdy in the presence of this princely affair you want new chair and rug and hanging to make the piano accord with its setting even the house fall under suspicion and perhaps you date all you difficulty from the day that you buy that grand piano and find that it have set you go on a new way of life just beyond you modest means if i buy a fur-lined coat i know that i should want to buy a motor-car to keep it company it be possible of course to wear a fur coat in a motor-bus but if you do you will assuredly have a sense that you be a little over-dressed a trifle conspicuous that the fellow-passenger be mentally remark that such a coat ought to have a carriage of its own it would provoke the comment that i hear the other night as two lady in evening dress leave a bus in a pour rain well say one of the other lady passenger -- a little enviously i thought but still pertinently -- if i could afford to wear such fine clothes i think i would take a cab yes decidedly the fur-lined coat would not be complete without the motor-car and then consider how it limit you freedom and raise the tariff against you the tip that would be gratefully receive if you be get into that modest coat that you have discard would be unworthy of the fur-lined standard that you have deliberately adopt the recipient would take it frigidly with a glance at the luxurious garment into which he have help you -- a glance that would cut you to the quick you friend would have to be fur-lined too and you dinner would no longer be the modest affair of old but would soar to the champagne standard it would not be possible to slip unnoticed into you favorite little restaurant in soho to take you simple chop or to go in quest of that wonderful restaurant of arne 's of which aldebaran keep the secret the modesty of arne 's would make you blush for you fur-lined coat the genteel thing say tony lumpkin 's friend be the genteel thing at any time if so be that a gentleman bee in a concatenation according-ly that be it the fur-lined coat be a genteel thing but you have to be in a concatenation according-ly and there be the rub it be not the coat but its trimming so to speak that give we pause when you put on the coat you insensibly put off you old way of life you set up a new standard and have get to adapt you coming and going you habit and you expenditure to it i once know a man who have a fur-lined coat present to he it be a disaster he could not live in a concatenation according-ly he lose he old friend without get new one and he end well he end confirm I in the conviction of the unwisdom of wear a fur-lined coat before you be able or disposed to mould you life to the fur-lined standard in praise of walk i start out the other day from keswick with a rucksack on my back a baddeley in my pocket and a companion by my side i like a companion when i go a-walking give I a companion by the way say sterne if it be only to remark how the shadow lengthen as the sun decline that be about enough you do not want a talkative person walking be a occupation in itself you may give yourself up to chatter at the beginning but when you be warm to the job you be dispose to silence drop perhaps one behind the other and reserve you talk for the inn table and the after-supper pipe a occasional joke a occasional stave of song a necessary consultation over the map -- that be enough for the way at the head of the lake we get in a boat and row across derwentwater to the tiny bay at the foot of catbell there we land shoulder we burden and set out over the mountain and the pass and for a week we enjoy the richest solitude this country can offer we follow no cut-and-dried program i love to draw up program for a walk tour but i love still better to break they for one of the joy of walk be the sense of freedom it give you you be tie to no time-table the slave of no road the tributary of no man if you like the road you follow it if you choose the pass that be yours also if you fancy -lrb- and you wind -rrb- be for the mountain top then over great gable and scawfell robinson and helvellyn be you way every short cut be for you and every track be the path of adventure the stream that tumble down the mountain side be you wine cup you kneel on the boulder bend you head and take such draught as only the healthy thirst of the mountain can give and then on you way again singing : -- bed in the bush with the star to see bread i dip in the river -- there be the life for a man like I there be the life for ever what liberty be there like this you have cut you mooring from the world you be far from telegraph and newspaper and all the frenzy of the life you have leave behind you you be alone with the lonely hill and the wide sky and the elemental thing that have be from the beginning and will outlast all the tortured drama of man the very sound of life -- the whistle of the curlew the bleating of the mountain sheep -- add to the sense of primeval solitude to these sound the crag have echo for a thousand and ten thousand year to these sound and to the rush of the wind and the water they will echo ten thousand year hence it be as though you have pass out of time into eternity where a thousand year be as one day there be no calendar for this dateless world the buzzard that you have startle from its pool in the gully and that circle round with wide-flapping wing have a lineage as ancient as the hill and the vision of the pike of langdale that burst on you as you reach the summit of esk hause be the same vision that burst on the first savage who adventure into these wild fastness of the mountain and then as the sun begin to slope to the west you remember that if you be among immortal thing you be only a mortal yourself that you be get footsore and that you need a night 's lodging and the comfort of a inn whither shall we turn the valley call we on every side newland wide vale we can reach or cheerful borrowdale or lonely ennerdale or -- yes to-night we will sup at wastdale at the jolly old inn that auld will ritson use to keep that inn sacred to the cragsman where on new year 's eve the gay company of climber foregather from they brave deed on the mountain and talk of hand-hold and foot-hold and sing the song of the rope the rope and join in the chorus as the landlord troll out : i be not a climber not a climber not a climber now my weight be go fourteen stone -- i be not a climber now we shall not find gaspard there to-night -- gaspard the gay and intrepid guide from the dauphiné beloved of all who know the lonely inn at wastdale he be away on the battle-field fight a sterner foe than the rock and precipice of great gable and scawfell but old joe the shepherd will be there -- old joe who have never be in a train or see a town and whose special glory be that he can pull uglier face than any man in cumberland he will not pull they for anybody -- only when he be in a good humor and for he crony in the back parlor to-night perchance we shall see he eye roll as he roar out the chorus of d'ye ken john peel yes wastdale shall be to-night 's halt and so over black sail and down the rough mountain side to the inn whose white-washed wall hail we from afar out of the gathering shadow of the valley to-morrow well to-morrow shall be as to-day we will shoulder we rucksack early and be early on the mountain for the first maxim in go a journey be the early start have the whip-hand of the day and then you may loiter as you choose if it be hot you may bathe in the chill water of those tarn that lie bare to the eye of heaven in the hollow of the hill -- tarn with name of beauty and water of such crystal purity as killarney know not and at night we will come through the cloud down the wild course of rosset ghyll and sup and sleep in the hotel hard by dungeon ghyll or perchance have the day well in hand we will push on by blea tarn and yewdale to coniston or by easedale tarn to grasmere and so to the swan at the foot of dunmail raise for we must call at the swan be it not the swan that wordsworth 's waggoner so triumphantly pass be it not the swan to which sir walter scott use to go for he beer when he be stay with wordsworth at rydal water and behind the swan be there not that fold in the hill where wordsworth 's michael build or try to build he sheepfold yes we will stay at the swan whatever befall and so the jolly day go by some wet some fine some a mixture of both but all delightful and we forget the day of the week know no news except the change in the weather and the track over the mountain meet none of we kind except a rare vagabond like ourselves -- with rope across he shoulder if he be a rock-man with rucksack on back if he be a tourist -- and with no goal save some far-off valley inn where we shall renew we strength and where the morrow 's uprising to deed shall be sweet i start to write in praise of walk and i find i have write in praise of lakeland but indeed the two chant of praise be a single harmony for i have write in vain if i have not show that the way to see the most exquisite cabinet of beauty in this land be by the humble path of the pedestrian he who ride through lakeland know nothing of its secret have taste of none of its magic on reward and riches we have all be so occupy with the war in europe that few of we i suppose have even hear of another war which have be rage in the law court for 150 day or so between two south african corporation over some question of property it seem to have be mark by a good deal of frightfulness in the closing scene mr hughe one of the counsel complain that he have be call a fool a liar a scoundrel and so on by he opponent and the judge lament that the case have be the occasion of so much barristerial bitterness but it be not the light which the case throw on the manners of counsel that interested I after all these thing be part of the game they have no more reality than the thump blow which the two mac exchange in the pantomime i have no doubt that after they memorable encounter in the bardell _ v _ pickwick case serjeant buzfuz and serjeant snubbin go out arm-in-arm and over they port in the temple -lrb- where the wine be good and astonishingly cheap -rrb- make excellent fun of the whole affair the wise juryman never take any notice of the passion and tear the heroics and the indignation of counsel he know that they be assume not to enlighten but to darken he mind i always recall in this connection the remark of a famous lawyer who rise to great eminence by the exercise of he emotion he be stand by the graveside of a depart friend and observe that one of the mourner a fellow -- lawyer be shed real tear what a waste of raw material he remark in a whisper to he neighbor those tear would be worth a guinea a drop before a jury what interested I in the case be the statement that the legal cost have be # 150000 and that mr upjohn kc alone have have a retainer of # 1000 and have be keep go with a refresher of # 100 a day i like that word refresher it have a fine bibulous smack about it or perhaps it be a reminiscence of the ring buzfuz feel a bit pump by the day 's round he have perspire he # 100 as it be and be doubtful whether he can come up to the scratch without a refresher and so he be take to he corner by he client and dose with another # 100 then all he ardor return he see the thing as clear as daylight -- the radiant innocence of the plaintiff the black perfidy of the defendant to-morrow evening the vision will have fade again but another # 100 will make it as plain as ever yes it be a good word -- refresher -- a candid word a honest word it put the relation on a sound business footing there be no sham sentiment about it give I another refresher say buzfuz and i 'll shed another pailful of tear for you and blacken both the defendant 's eye for he but as i read of these princely earnings i could not help thinking of what a irrational world this be in the matter of reward here be a couple of lawyer hurl epithet and case at each other at # 100 a day at the end a verdict be give for this side or that and outside the people concerned no one be a penny the better or worse and not many mile away hundred of thousand of man be live in the mud of rat-infested trench with the sky rain destruction upon they and death and mutilation the hourly incident of they life they have no retain fee and no refresher they reward be a shill a day and it would take they 20000 day to earn what one kc pocket each night could the mind conceive a more grotesque inversion of the law of service and reward you die for you country at a shill a day while at home snubbin kc be perspire for he client at # 100 a day this be old cheap and profitless stuff you say what be the good of draw these contrast we know all about they they be a part of the eternal inequality of thing service and reward never have have and never will have any relation to each other please do not remind we that charlie chaplin -lrb- or charle chaplin as he desire to be know -rrb- earn # 130000 a year by play the fool in front of a camera and that wordsworth do not earn enough to keep himself in shoe-lace out of poetry which have become a immortal possession of humanity and have to beg a noble nobody -lrb- the earl of lonsdale i think -rrb- to get he a job as a stamp distributor to keep he in bread and butter do not my dear sir be alarm i be not go to work that ancient theme off on you and yet i think it be necessary sometimes to remind ourselves of these thing it be especially necessary now when there be so much easy talk about equality of sacrifice and so much easy forgetfulness of the inequality of reward it be useful too to remind ourselves that riches have no necessary relation to service the genius for get money be a altogether different thing from the genius for service i suppose the guinness -lrb- to take a example -rrb- be the richest people in ireland and i suppose tom kettle be one of the poorest but who will dare apply the money test as the real measure of the value of these man to humanity -- the one fabulously rich by brew the black stuff as they call it in ireland the other glorious in he genius for spend himself without a thought of return on every noble cause and die freely for liberty in the full tide of he power which mean the more to the world perhaps one effect of the war will be to give we a saner standard of value in these thing -- will teach we to look behind the money and title to the motive that get the money and the title it be not the money and title we should distrust so much as the false implication attach to they and after all we exaggerate the importance of the material reward they must often be very much of a bear as the late lord salisbury once say a man do not sleep any better because he have a choice of forty bedroom in he house he can only take one ride even though he have fifty motor-car he can not get more joy out of the sunshine than you or i can the bird sing and the bud swell for all of we and in the great storehouse of natural delight there be no money take and no price on the goods mr rockefeller 's # 100 a minute -lrb- if that be he income -rrb- be poor consolation for he bad digestion and the late mr pierpoint morgan would probably have part with half he million to get rid of the excrescence that make he nose a unsightly joke we can not count we riches at the bank -- even on the material side much less on the spiritual as i come along the village this morning i see jim squire digging up he potato in the golden September light i hail he and inquire how the crop be turn out a wunnerful fine crop he say and thank the lord there be not a spot o ' disease in 'em and as he straighten he back pointed to the tuber strew about he and beam like the sun at he good fortune he look the very picture of autumn 's riches on taste i be in a feminine company the other day when the talk turn on war economy with the inevitable allusion to the substitution of margarine for butter i find it be generally agree that the substitution have be a success well say one i buy some butter the other day -- the sort we use to use -- and put it on the table with the margarine which we have learn to eat my husband take some think it be margarine make a wry face and say ` it will not do this margarine economy be beyond I we must return to butter even if we lose the war ' i explain to he that he be eat butter _ the _ butter and he say ` well i be hang ' now what do you think of that i say i think it show that taste be a matter of habit and that imagination play a larger part in we make-up than we suppose we say of this or that thing that it be a acquire taste as though the fact be unusual whereas the fact would seem to be that we dislike most thing until we have habituate ourselves to they as a youth i abominate the taste of tobacco it be only by a industrious apprenticeship to the herb that i overcome my natural dislike and get to be its obedient servant and even my taste here be unstable i need a certain tobacco to be happy and think there be no other tobacco like it but i discover that be all nonsense when the war tax send the price up i determine that my expenditure should not go up with it and i try a cheaper sort i find it distasteful at first but now i prefer it to my old brand just as the lady 's husband find that he prefer the new margarine to the old butter and it be not only gastronomic taste which seem so much the subject of habit that hat that be so absolute a thing last year be as dowdy and impossible to-day as if it have be the fashion of the babylonian it have always be so we have scarce worn cloth one year at the court say montaigne what time we mourn for we king henrie the second but certainly in every man 's opinion all manner of silk be already become so vile and abject that be any man see to wear they he be presently judge to be some countrie fellow or mechanical man and you remember that in utopia gold be hold of so small account by comparison with iron that it be use for the baser purpose of the household we be adaptable creature and easily make we taste conform to we environment and we custom there be certain savage tribe who wear ring through they nose when mr brown of toot see picture of they she remark to mr brown on the strange habit of these barbarous people and mr brown if he have a touch of humor in he point to the ring hang from mr brown 's ear and say : but my dear why be it barbarous to wear a ring in the nostril and civilised to wear ring in the ear the dilemma be not unlike that of the savage tribe whom the greek induce to give up cannibalism but when the cannibal who have piously eat they parent be ask instead to adopt the greek custom of burn the body they be horrify at the suggestion they would cease to eat they but burn they no i can imagine mr brown 's savage agree to take the ring out of they nose but refuse blankly to put they in they ear i have no doubt that the long-haired cavalier use to regard the short hair of the puritan as the limit in bad taste but the man who today dare to walk down the strand with hair streaming down he back be look at as a curiosity and a crank and we all join in that delightful addition to the litany which moody invent : from long-haired man and short-haired woman good lord deliver we but who shall say that we child will not reverse the prayer even in my own brief span i have see man 's face pass through every hirsute change under the protean influence of good taste i remember when to be really a student of good form a man wear long side-whisker of the dundreary type then mutton chop and a moustache be the thing then only a moustache now we have get back to the roman and the clean shave but where be the absolute good taste in all this or take trousers if you have live a hundred year ago and have dare to go about in trousers instead of knee-breeches you would have be write down a vulgar fellow even the great duke of wellington in 1814 be refuse admittance to almack 's because he present himself in trousers now we relegate knee-breeches to fancy dress ball and court function but sometimes the canon of good taste be astonishingly irrational who be it who set christendom wear black sad hopeless black as the symbol of mourn the roman lady who have never hear of the doctrine of the resurrection clothe themselves in white for mourn it be leave for the christian world which look beyond the grave to wear the habiliment of despair if i go to a funeral i be as conventional as anybody else for i have not the courage of a distinguished statesman whom i see at he brother 's funeral wear a blue overcoat check trousers and a gray waistcoat and carry a green umbrella i can give you he name if you doubt I -- a great name too and he would not deny the impeachment i be not prepare to endorse he idea of good taste but i hate black why should i wear black for the guest of god ask ruskin and there be no answer perhaps among the consequence of the war there will be a repudiation of this false code of taste on a hawthorn hedge as i turn into the lane that climb the hillside to the cottage under the high beech wood i be conscious of a sort of mild expectation that i could not explain it be late evening venus who look down with such calm splendor upon this troubled earth in these summer night have disappear but the moon have not yet rise the air be heavy with those rich odour which seem so much more pungent by night than by day -- those odour of summer eve that keat have fix for ever in the imagination : -- i can not see what flower be at my foot nor what soft incense hang upon the bough but in embalmed darkness guess each sweet wherewith the seasonable month endow the grass the thicket and the fruit-tree wild white hawthorn ah that be it i remember now a fortnight ago when i last come up this lane by night it be the flash of the white hawthorn in the starlight that burst upon I with such a sudden beauty i know the spot it be just beyond here where the tall hedgerow lean over the grass side-track and make a green arbor by the wayside i should come to it in a minute or two and catch once more that ecstasy of spring and when i reach the spot the white hawthorn have vanish the arbor be there but its glory have fade the two week i have spend in fleet street have strip it of its crown and the whole pageant of the year must pass before i could again experience that sudden delight of the hedgerow burst into foam i do not mind confess that i continue my way up the lane with something less than my former exhilaration partly no doubt this be due to the fact that the hill at this point begin its job of climb in earnest and be a stiff pull at the end of a long day 's work and a tiresome journey -- especially if you be carry a bag but the real reason of the slight shadow that have fall on my spirit be the vanish hawthorn poor sentimentalist you say to cherish these idle fancy in this stern world of blood and tear well perhaps it be this stern world of blood and tear that give these idle fancy they poignancy perhaps it be through those fancy that one feel the transitoriness of other thing the coming and the parting in the round of nature be so wonderfully mingled that we can never be quite sure whether the joy of the one triumph over the regret for the other it be always hail and farewell in one breath i hear the cuckoo call across the meadow to-day and already i notice a falter in he second note soon the second note will be silent altogether and the single call will sound over the valley like the curfew bell of spring who i think would not fix these fleeting moment of beauty if he could who would not keep the cuckoo 's twin shout float for ever over summer field and the blackbird for ever fluting he thanksgiving after summer shower who can see the daffodil nod they head in sprightly dance without share the mood of herrick 's immortal lament that that dance should be so brief : -- fair daffodil we weep to see you haste away so soon as yet the early-rising sun have not attain would its noon stay stay until the hasting day have run but to the evensong and have pray together we will go with you along yes i think herrick would have forgive I for that momentary lapse into regretfulness over the white hawthorn he would have understand you will see that he understand if you will recall the second stanza which if you be the person i take you for you will do without need to turn to a book it be the same sense of the transience of beauty that inspire the ode to a grecian urn on which pastoral beauty be fix in eternal rapture : -- ah happy happy bough i that can not shed you leaf nor ever bid the spring adieu and there we touch the paradox of this strange life we would keep the fleeting beauty of nature and yet we would not keep it the thought of those tree whose leaf be never shed and of that eternal spring to which we never bid adieu be pleasant to toy with but after all we would not have it so it be no more seriously tenable than the thought that little johnny there should remain for ever at the age of ten you may feel that you would like he to remain at the age of ten indeed you be a strange parent if you do not look back a little wistfully to the childhood of you child and wish you could see they as you once see they but you would not really have johnny stick at ten after five year of the experience you would wish little johnny dead for life and its beauty be a living thing and not a pretty fancy sculpture on a grecian urn and so with the pageant of nature if the pageant stop the wonder itself would stop i should have no sudden shock of delight at hear the first call of the cuckoo in spring or see my hawthorn hedge burst into snowy blossom i should no longer remark the jolly clatter of the rook in the February tree which form the prologue of spring nor look out for the come of the first primrose or the arrival of the first swallow i should cease it be true to have the pang of farewell but i should cease also to have the ecstasy of hail i should have my grecian urn but i should have lose the magic of the living world by the time i have reach the gate i have bury my regret for the vanish hawthorn i know that to-morrow i should find new miracle in the hedgerow -- the wild rose and the honeysuckle and after they the blackberry and after these again the bright-hued hip and haw and though the cuckoo 's note should fail he there would remain the thrush and after the thrush that constant little fellow in the red waistcoat would keep the song go through the dark winter day end of the project gutenberg ebook of pebble
