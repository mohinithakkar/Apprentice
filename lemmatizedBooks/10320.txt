by a nice dinner and flyaway have catch a nap which take she about as long as it take a fly to eat he breakfast then mr parlin suggest that they should visit the blind asylum be it where they make blind ask dotty o no reply mr parlin it be a school where blind child be teach what be they when they be blind uncle eddard they do not see my dear flyaway shut she eye just to give herself a idea of they condition and run against horace who save she from fall i be velly blind then holli say she and that be what be it i do not see query dotty -- i do not see how people that can not see can see to read so what be the use to go to school they read by the sense of feel the letter be raise say mr parlin but here we be at the institute they be in the pleasantest part of the city standing before some beautiful grounds which occupy a entire square and be enclose by a iron fence in front of the building grow tree and shrub and on each side be a play-ground for the child why that house have window cry dotty i do not see what people want of window when they can not see nor I needer echo katie what um want winner can not see out of they go up a flight of stone step and be meet at the door by a blind waiting-girl who usher they into the visitor ' parlor be _ she _ blind-eyed whisper flyaway gaze at she earnestly she eye be not shut up where be the _ see _ go to mr clifford send up she card and the superintendent who know she well come down to meet she he be also blind-eyed but the child do not suspect it they be much interested in the specimen of bead-work which be to be see in the show-case mr parlin buy some flower basket and other toy to carry home to susy and prudy horace say -- these bead be string on wire and it would be easy enough to do that with one 's eye shut but it always do puzzle I to see how blind people can tell one color from another with the end of they finger the superintendent smile that would be strange indeed if it be true say he but it be a mistake the color be put into separate box and that be the way the child distinguish they i suppose they be much happier for be busy say mr parlin it be a beautiful thing that they can be make useful so it be say the superintendent i be blind myself and i know how necessary employment be to my happiness the child look up at the noble face of the speaker with surprise be _ he _ blind why do he wear glass then whisper dotty grandma wear 'em because she can see a little and want to see more the superintendent be amuse as he could not see dotty have unconsciously suppose he hearing must be rather dull but on the contrary it be very quick and he have catch every word i suppose my child remark he playfully these spectacles of mine may be call the gravestone for my dead eye dotty do not understand this but she be very sorry she have speak so loud after look at the show-case as long as they like the visitor go across the hall into the little one ' school-room this be a very pleasant place furnish with nice desk and at one end be book-case contain blind book with raise letter horace soon discover that the old testament be in six volume each volume as large as a family bible in this cheerful room be twenty or thirty boy and girl they look very much like other child only they do not appear to notice that any one be enter and scarcely turn they head as the door softly open dotty have a great many new thought these unfortunate little one be very neatly dress yet they have never see themselves in the glass and how do they know whether they hair be rough or smooth or part in the middle how could they tell when they drop grease-spot on those nice clothes i do not see think dotty how they know when to go to bed o dear i should get up in the night and think 'twa morning only i should s ` pose 'twa night all the whole time and not any star either when my father speak to I i should think it be my mother and say ` yes be ' and p ` rhap i should think prudy be a beggar-man with a wig on and never see a flower nor a tree o dear while she be muse in this way and gaze about she with eager eye which see everything the child be read aloud from they odd-looking book it be strange to see they small finger fly so rapidly over the page horace say it be a touching sight i wonder go on dotty to herself if they should tease god very hard would he let they eye come again no i s ` pose not then she reflect further that perhaps they be glad to be blind she hope so the teacher now call out a class in geography and begin to ask question what can you tell I about the inhabitant of utah say she i know speak up a little boy with black hair and eye which would have be bright if the lid have not shut they out of sight -- i know utah be inhabit by a religious insect call mormon the superintendent and visitor know that he mean _ sect _ and they laugh at the mistake all but dotty and flyaway who do not consider it funny at all flyaway be seat in a chair busily engage in pick dirt out of the heel of she boot with a pin horace be much interested in the atlas and globe upon the surface of which the land rise up higher than the water and the desert be powdered with sand these blind child could travel all about the world with they finger as well as he could with eye and a pointer the teacher -- a kind-looking young lady -- be quite pleased when mr parlin say to she -- i see very little difference between this and the portland school for small child she wish and so do the teacher in the other three division to have the pupil almost forget they be blind she allow they to sing and recite poetry for the entertainment of they visitor some of they have very sweet voice and mr clifford listen with tear they singing recall to she mind the memory of beautiful thing as music always do and then she remember that through they whole life these child must grope in darkness she feel more sorrowful for they than they feel for themselves these dear little soul who would never see the sun be very happy and some of they really suppose it be delightful to be blind they teacher desire they to come forward if they choose and repeat sentence of they own compose some thing they say be very odd one bright little girl remark very gravely -- happy be the blind for they see no ghost this make she companion all laugh yes that be true thought dotty if people should come in here with ever so many pumpkin and candle inside these blind child would not know it they could not be frightened i wonder where they ever hear of ghost there must have be some naughty girl here like angeline chapter ii emily 's trial at three o'clock the little blind girl all go out to play in one yard and the little blind boy in the other goin ' out to take they air say katie then she and dotty follow the girl in respectful silence almost every one have a particular friend and it be wonderful to see how certain any two friend be to find one another by the sense of feeling and walk off together arm in arm it be strange too that they could move so fast without hit thing and fall down when i be blindfold think dotty it make I dizzy and i do not know where i be when i think anything be not there the next i know i come against it and make my nose bleed she be not aware that while the most of these child be blind there be other who have a little glimmering of eyesight the world be

indeed the little girl be rather proud of be the daughter of such a wicked man she have be pity so much for she misfortune that she have come to regard herself as quite a remarkable person she could not see the horror in dotty 's face but she could detect it in she voice so she go on well satisfied there be not any other little girl in this school that have have so much trouble as i have a lady

and be seldom away from she long at a time but have just now be devote herself to katie here be the ship all aboard chapter iii play ship now this ship be a old wagon-body and have never be in water deeper than a mud puddle a dozen little girl climb in with great bustle and confusion pretend they be walk a plank and climb up some step after they be fairly on board they wave they handkerchief for a good by to they friend on shore then octavium fire pea out of a little popgun twice and this be mean as a long farewell to the land now they be fairly out on the ocean and begin to rock back and forth as if toss by a heavy sea see how the wave rise say emily and throw up she hand with a undulating motion i can see they she cry a intent look come into she closed eye they be green with white bubble like soap suds and the sun shine on they so o ` tis as beautiful as flower booful as flower echo flyaway who be one of the passenger while dotty wonder how octavia know the difference between green and white she do not know and what sort of a picture she paint in she mind of the mysterious sea i be sure i can not tell now say miriam lake the prettiest of the child it be time to strike the bell so she strike a tea-bell with a stick eight time that be eight bell explain she to dotty and it mean four o'clock but jennie holiday where be the kitten why we be not half ready the child never think they could play ship without a kitten a gray and white one which they put into a cage just as jennie holiday do when she and rollo travel by themselves from new york to liverpool when the kitten have be bring they have get as far as long island sound and they say the kitten be send by a ship of war which have to be speak this be a funny way to play say miriam here we be at halifax and nobody have heave the log yet no say octavium so we can not tell how many knot a hour we be go _ i be _ go a great many knock cry katie whose exertion in rock from side to side have throw she overboard once we never 'll get to liverpool in this world say emily unless miss percival come and steer the ship it happen at that very moment that miss percival come into the yard with aunt marium if you will

capable of guide a vessel across the atlantic i have often try it say miss percival go on board but we sometimes have a shipwreck emily say she you may heave the log so emily rise and take a large spool of crochet-cotton which miss percival give she hold it above she head turn it slowly till a tatting shuttle which be fasten at the end of the thread fall to the ground this be suppose to be the log and octavium with one or two other girl pretend to tug with much force in order to draw it in for the ship be go so fast that the friction against the cord be very great knot have be make in the cotton over which emily run she quick finger ten knot a hour say she very good speed return the captain i do not think we shall be able to take a observation to-day as it be rather cloudy sailor take observation at noon if the sun be out by means of a sextant with which they measure the distance from the sun to the southern horizon in this way the captain can tell the exact latitude of the ship but miss percival make believe there be a storm come up so it be not possible to take a observation it be two bell say she : the wind be out there will be a fearful storm i would advise the passenger to turn into they berth the child lay down upon the floor there there say miriam lake who be play jennie holiday my poor little kitty be just as seasick she head keep go round and round _ my _ head have do it too chime in katie rolling herself into a ball it keep yock yound and yound i pitch about so in my berth say octavium who be rollo that next thing i shall be out on the floor hark how the water be pour in i be afraid the ship have spring a leak and if it have i must call the chambermaid mr clifford who stand look on be quite amuse at the idea of call the chambermaid to stop a leak in the ship man the pump say the captain the girl tug away at a pole in one end of the wagon move it up and down like a churn-dash i do hope this wind will go down sigh emily well it will say simple flyaway i _ hear _ it go it be head wind and a heavy sea remark the captain but never fear we shall weather the storm we be now on the southern coast of ireland i do not think add she in a different tone it be best to be shipwrecked child -- do you we will hurry into liverpool and then i think it likely you little visitor may enjoy keep house with you doll or have a nice swing i wish i could eat something say dotty with a solemn face but i be too sick so be i groan flyaway i could not eat noffin ' -- ` cept cake if you be in such a condition as that say the captain it be certainly high time we land and here come a pilot boat with a signal fly we will take the pilot on board add she draw in another little girl and look here we be now in liverpool we must go to the adelphus say octavium that be where rollo go and find he father and mother and thannie but the kitten do not ever get there -- do it miss percival the voyage be end and with it the fearful seasickness the child go to swing with they teacher to push they miss percival say aunt marium shake hand with that excellent young lady i wish you joy of you noble employment it be a bless thing to be able to give so much pleasure to these dear little child so it seem to I reply miss percival they be always grateful too for every little kindness they look very good and obedient say mr clifford in a low voice so they be sometimes i think they be better than child who have eye perhaps because they can not see to get into so much mischief add miss percival pinching emily 's cheek aunt ` rium say dotty in rapture _ do not _ they have good time here yelly good time say little flyaway clutch at she mother 's dress mamma i wish _ i _ be blind-eyed too you my darling baby mother hope that will never be but if you can not be blind-eyed yourself perhaps you may make some of these little one happy be there anything you would like to give away flyaway wink slowly try to think what she have at home that she no longer wish to keep yes mamma say she at last with a smile of satisfaction i have get a old hat o fie katie i dare say you would be very glad to part with that for i remember you cry the other day when i ask you to wear it you old hat would not be a pretty present then i can not fink of noffin ' else say katie shake she head at the same time have a guilty recollection of several beautiful toy and ` most a hunnerd bushel of canny that be to say a small box of confectionery she uncle edward have give she mr clifford have observe of late that she little daughter be not as generous as she could wish both katie and dotty be peculiarly liable to become selfish as they be much pet at home and have no younger brother or sister with whom to share they treasure mr clifford do not insist upon katie 's make any sacrifice the little one do not pity the blind child at all they seem so happy that she almost envy they so do miss dimple it be not after all very grievous to be blind she think if one could live at this institute and have such nice play aunt ` ria think i ought to give they something i s ` pose when i get home i mean to ask mamma and grandma to dress a beautiful doll and i 'll send it to emily she 'll keep it to remember I by and it will not cost any of _ my _ money if papa buy the head good by emily say she as she part from she i hope there will not any more bad thing happen to you but i s ` pose there will reply emily cheerfully mr parlin and horace be wait in the hall and the latter be impatiently watch the tall clock they have be in the greenhouse look at the flower and in the shop where the blind boy learn to make broom and brush well lady be you ready to go asked mr parlin take flyaway by the hand yes we lady be ready reply she so this be the end of they visit at the institute after they have go away the little blind girl say to one another -- what nice child those be which be the prettiest alice or katie for they always speak of people and thing exactly as if they could see they chapter iv a spoil dinner next morning dotty dimple and she father start for maine flyaway do not like this at all she cousin have be so pleasant and so entertaining that she wish to keep she always what _ for _ you can not stay dotty dimpwil o say dotty tear herself away from the little clinging arm i must go home and get ready for christmas no you musser persist katie we have get a santa claw in _ we _ chimley you musser go home it be not for santa claus at all darling it be for my papa and mamma 's wedding to stand up so they can be marry over again now kiss I and let I go she 's goin ' home to kismus pie remark katie as she take she mournful way with she mamma to the house where they be visit she do not know what a wedding might be but be sure it have pie in it there go a right smart little girl say horace with a sweep of he thumb towards the cleveland car if it be not for prudy i should like she better than any other cousin i have in the world she be a engaging child reply he mother and really seem to be outgrow she naughty way thus you see dotty dimple in come away from indiana have leave in the mind of she friend only golden opinion perhaps she be rather overrate everything have go well with she during she visit why should she not be pleasant and happy i be incline to think there be the same old naughtiness in she heart only just now it be asleep we shall see nothing remarkable occur on the homeward journey except that mr parlin buy some gold-fish in boston and carry they home as a present to mr read they travel one night in a sleeping-car and by that mean reach portland a day earlier than they be expect dotty hardly know whether to be glad or sorry for this there be a great deal to be say on both side of the question she have anticipate the pleasure of be meet at the depot by susy and prudy and now that be not to be think of but it would be delightful to give the family a surprise on the whole she be very well satisfied as they drive up to the new home however what be they astonishment to find it close there be not even a window open or any other sign that the house be inhabit dotty run to every door and shake it why papa papa do you s ` pose there be anybody dead the probability be alice that they have go away i will run over to mr prosser 's and see if she know anything about it mr prosser be the nearest neighbor on the leave she little daughter come to the door in tear have hurt herself against a trunk in the hall miss carrie say mr parlin can you tell I where mr parlin and the rest of the family be go yes caddy prosser the house be shut up add dotty and i be afraid they be dead i do not know where they be go nor anything sob carrie i do not know the trunk be in the entry and i come so fast i fall right over it i be very sorry you be hurt say mr parlin be you mother at home no sir she be not she trunk come but she do not there be no information to be obtain at the prosser ' so mr parlin go to mr lawrence 's the nearest neighbor on the right make the same inquiry but all he learn be that a carriage have be see stand at mr parlin 's door who have go away in it nobody could tell dotty pace the pavement with restless step she mind agitate by a thousand wild fancy : grandma read never go anywhere perhaps she be lock up in the house and zip too norah be at cape elizabeth she have walk out to see she friend bridget the girl with red hair and just as likely as not she do not ever mean to come back again mother and susy and prudy have go to willowbrook to grandpa parlin 's -- of course they have -- and leave grandma bead all alone in the house with nothing to eat how strange how unkind grandma she call out under mr read 's window there be no answer dotty fancy the white curtain move just a little but that be because a fly be balance himself on its fold grandma be not there or if she be she must be very sound asleep o dear dear and here be dotty and she father come home a day earlier than they be expect and instead of give the family a joyful surprise they have a surprise themselves only not a joyful one by any means how impolite it be in everybody how unkind to go away at first dotty have be alarm but now she indignation get the better of she fear when she _ do _ see prudy again -- the sister who pretend to love she so much -- she would not take the present out of she trunk for ever so long just to tease the naughty girl meanwhile she father do not appear to be at all disturbed perhaps they have go to the island or somewhere else not far away to spend the day it be now nearly two o'clock you may go to the preble house with I and take-your dinner and then i will unlock the house and find some one to stay with you till night would you like that or would you prefer to go at once to you aunt eastman 's you may have you choice dotty reflect about half a minute i will go to aunt eastman 's if you please papa this appear to she decidedly the most dignified course she would go to aunt eastman 's and she would not be in the least haste about come back again she would teach she sister especially prudy that it be best to be hospitable towards one 's friend when they have be away on a long journey she anger may seem very absurd but you must remember little friend that dotty dimple have now become a travel young lady she have see the world and she self-esteem have grow every day she have be away she heart be all aglow with love towards the dear one at home and it be very chilling to find the door lock in she face she do not stop to reflect that no unkindness have be intend as they drive to aunt eastman 's she father observe that she bright little face be very downcast but suppose she sadness arise from the disappointment there be depths of foolishness in child 's heart which even they parent can not fathom strange to say neither mr parlin nor dotty have think that the family might be visit at mr eastman 's but such be the case it be

susy parlin to get a plaster for my mother at this wicked speech dotty 's heart almost sink into she boot for she have never know before that lina would tell a deliberate lie lina live in a little grocery store she father be go away to-day -rrb- and she mother have just serve a customer with a pound of damp brown sugar say as she clip the string -- it be very cheap sweeten at that price we be go to rise on it to-morrow after that she stand a minute in front of the store and shake she head at jacob a little boy some three year old who be try to balance a patent washboard against a tree which grow out of the brick pavement it be a large scrawny tree which look as if it be oblige to live there but do not want to and have try in vain to get burn up in the portland fire from the lower branch of the tree depend a couple of dun-colored ham and a paint board with the word good family butter come in jacob you naughty boy say mr rosenberg this time shake he because she be afraid he would injure the patent wash-board then jacob who have be wait for the shake and would not stir without it go in at the side door cry for the family live in one end of the store mr rosenberg have a great many child and be oblige to work very hard at various employment just now she go to spread pumpkin-seed to dry under the stove she be not expect company and when mandoline enter with dotty she look up from she work with a frown who have you bring home with you this time mandoline rosenberg say she take off you hat and hang it over they tommatus but mind yer do not drop it into that dish of lard mother plead mandoline we want to go up chamber to see my pretty thing she mother send she a-purpose no she do not no such a thing you be a master hand to pick up child and fetch 'em home here and then crawl out of it by lie besides you have get to knit i must have those sock do by to-morrow noon mandy or i 'll know the reason why as mr rosenberg speak she push a waiter full of seed under the stove as if she hate the very sight of they and when she stand up again dotty observe that she dirty calico dress do not come anywhere near the top of she calf-skin shoe but mother say mandoline with a win smile this be dotty dimple the little girl that give I the needle-book this be partly true dotty have give mandoline a old needle-book but it have be in return for some maple sugar which the little jewess have pilfer from she father 's store dotty dimple be it say mr rosenberg with a sharp look at the little guest i do not know now any better than i do before that be a name for a doll-baby i should say alice parlin mother be it o well you may take she up stair out of my way but mind you must knit every minute you be go dotty be greatly abashed by this reception and would have rush out of the house but mandoline hold she fast you sha not go a step say she i 'll hide you hat so dotty under peril of go home bareheaded be oblige to creep up the rickety staircase with mandoline she liken she feeling on the occasion to those of a person whom the mayor be put in the lockup indeed the lock-up be dotty 's dream of all the horror and she have no doubt it be the mayor himself who always stand with he hand outstretch ready to thrust wicked people into it the chamber which the little girl enter be a unfinished one and from the rafter hang paper bag of dry herb for besides be a housekeeper and clerk mr rosenberg be something of a doctress withal and make bitters for she particular friend sit down here on the bed dotty dimple and look at my paper doll say lina produce from under a disjointed chair a old cigar box full of paper hero and heroine mandoline be a artist in he way and these figure be clothe in the most brilliant costume of silver and gold dotty be dazzle never before have it be she lot to see such magnificent doll -- doll which shine so in the sun every one of they a king or a queen and fit to wear a crown o lina sigh she in ecstasy where _ do _ you get you silver and gold tease for it reply the little jewess dotty know to she own sorrow that lina be capable of tease it be hard to keep so much as a apple or a peppermint away from she if she happen to set she heart on it i 'll give you twenty doll say lina if you 'll let I have you ring and it be not a very pretty ring either look like brass dotty lock she finger together you can not tease away my owny dony pearl lina if it _ be _ brass so you need not try mandoline call out mr rosenberg 's sharp voice from down stair be you at work o dear say lina saunter along to a old chest and take she knitting from the top of it that be always the way i think if you come mother would let I play dotty understand from this remark why lina have ask she to go home with she it be not because she wish to hear any of dotty 's brilliant story for she have not ask a single question about out west it be because she hope for a reprieve from the dreaded knit she be a real naughty little girl thought miss dimple and if she have not hide my hat i would go right home there be a heavy tread on the stair mr rosenberg be come up partly to see if she daughter be knit and partly to hang a paper bag on the long pole overhead mandoline be dreadfully afraid of she mother and in she eagerness to be find hard at work she rattle she needle very fast while she finger wander aimlessly about among the stitch mr rosenberg detect the cheat at once and as she be need the money for the sock she scold mandoline soundly and pelt she pretty little hand rat tat tat with a steel thimble dotty be a little startled and peep out at lina from the corner of she eye mr rosenberg scold so hard that the paper bag overhead seem to rattle and some yellow pollen drop out of one of they like shoot star dotty have never know that there be such cruel people in the world but let I tell you little reader every mother be not like the gentle low-voiced woman who take you in she lap and kindly reprove you when you have do wrong no there be very different mother hard-working ignorant one who do not know how to treat they child any more than you know how to build a brick house mr rosenberg be so severe and unreasonable that she little daughter through fear of she have learn to deceive still mr rosenberg love mandoline and would have be a better mother perhaps if she have only known how and have not have so much work to do presently she go down stair and leave the little girl together good say lina in a low voice she be go now we 'll play but you can not knit if you play lina tell I where you hide my hat 'cause i want to go home you sha not go home till after supper you little darling dotty dimple o but i must go for my mother do not know where i be say dotty in a dreary tone she have no longer any curiosity regard jewish supper all she want be the liberty to get away but it be always easier to fall into a trap than to get out of it mandoline would not produce the miss hat and it be no light matter for dotty to go down stair among the noisy quarrelsome child and beg the severe mr rosenberg to take she part if she do so perhaps the woman would pelt she with the steel thimble perhaps too she would say mandoline might keep the hat so dotty play synagogue and all the while the sun be drop down down the sky as if it have a leaden weight attach to it to make it go faster chapter vi a strange visit the same warfare of word continue to come up from the kitchen and presently the odor of sausage steal up too mrs rosenberg be prepare supper it seem to the impatient dotty that she be a long while about it but she work as fast as she could with so many child cling to she skirt and impede she movement supper mandoline call she at last in a shrill voice and the little girl go down the supper be palatable enough but very unwholesome and the table-cloth be dirty and wrinkled you do not seem to like my cooking say mr rosenberg with a displeased glance at dotty 's full plate yes be reply the little guest faintly but i have eat up my appetite at the same time she swallow a little oily gravy in desperation and look slyly to see if solly be watch she yes he be and so be all the rest of the family as if she have be a peculiar kind of animal just catch and cage i suppose they be dreadful nice folk at you house continue mr rosenberg i almost wonder you mother let you come here to play with my poor little girl mandy 's just as good as you be though -- you can tell she so -- and she be get a sight prettier eye dotty 's heart keep swell and swell till presently it seem as if there be not room enough in she whole body to hold it she think of the cheerful orderly tea-table at home she recall she mother 's gentle way she lovely face and long to kiss she cheek and whisper forgive I mamma 'll be just as patient with I think dotty she always be but if i once get home i 'll never make she patient any more i 'll never run away again not unless she _ ask _ I to -- i will not the child as fast as they finish they supper jump up and run away from the table -- all but solly who have some faint idea that it be not polite to do so before company he be a natural gentleman and it be unfortunate that just at this time he mother be oblige to send he to munjoy of a errand otherwise he would have make he sister give up dotty 's hat and perhaps would have walk home with the unhappy child himself as it be dotty do not seem to have a friend in the world it be now so dark that she hardly dare look out of door but even in the brightest daylight she could not have find she way home you have get to stay all night say mandoline be not that splendid mandoline do not mean to be cruel she have observe that she mother urge she own guest to stay and sometimes keep they almost by force this she suppose be true politeness more than that she be anxious for private reason to hold dotty so she might not have to knit so much she know too that she mother be proud to have such a well-bred little girl in the house so she would not give up dotty 's hat at eight o'clock dotty go to bed with mandoline in the unfinished chamber sorely against she will and mandoline tell she such dreadful story that she could not close she eye for fright this be the queerest house i be ever in think she and the queerest bed i s ` pose it be make of pin-feather for they stick into I awfully the bed be on the floor and be found upon woolsack and buffalo skin the sleep arrangement in this house be somewhat peculiar mr rosenberg be like the old woman in the shoe and she stow she numerous family away for the night in as little space as possible for instance the four youngest child sleep together in one trundle-bed two at the top and two at the bottom they foot come together in the middle but mandoline have leave the trundle bed and be lie on the floor with she guest the companion the trundle-bed -- little kosina -- be quite indignant at be desert and make a loud outcry in the hope of attract she mother 's attention i do not want to sleep alone say she i do not want to sleep _ alo-o-one _ at another time dotty would have laugh heartily it be so absurd for a child to be lonesome when there be three in the bed but dotty be too low-spirited even to smile mr rosenberg come up and box rosina 's ear and after that the trundle-bed subside at last when dotty suppose it must be midnight though it be only nine o'clock there come a loud knock at the side door she hide she face under the coverlet feeling sure it be either a wild indian or a highway robber do not be afraid say mandoline rousing herself it be somebody after beer and mother have lock up the store no it be mr parlin 's voice which speak dotty 's swollen heart give a great bind and then sink heavier than ever my little daughter alice have run away that be what he say be she in you house mr rosenberg yes reply mr rosenberg i expect its likely she be but she and my mandoline 's be abe and asleep two hour o papa i be wide awake cry little dotty with a eager shriek which pierce the rafter good night then say mr parlin coldly o but papa i want to go home what do my mamma say about I she say she have send you of a errand when you have finish you errand you may come home good night o not good night scream dotty almost fall down stair in she haste and fasten she dress as she run it be 'cause lina hide my hat and that be why -- by the way say mr parlin without pay the slightest attention to he half-frantic little daughter who be cling to he knee and plead with she whole soul mr rosenberg i be sorry to trouble you but if you will be kind enough to keep this little runaway girl till i send for she i shall be very much obliged o certainly mr parlin certainly sir reply the jewess smile very sweetly and try to pat dotty 's head which be in such violent motion that she only succeed in touch the end of she nose no one who have look at mr rosenberg at that moment would have suspect she of be a vixen she be sure mr parlin would pay she handsomely if she keep he daughter there for a day or two and the prospect of a little money always make the poor woman very amiable thank you madam say mr parlin gently disengage himself from dotty when you be tire of my little daughter will you please let I know goodnight mr rosenberg good-night alice and before dotty have time to scream again he be go for a moment she stand quite still gaze at the door-latch then rush out into the darkness call papa papa but mr rosenberg lay she strong hand upon she and bring she back so you mother do not say you might come i think it be queer hush hush do not go into fit child there be no bear in this house and nothing will hurt you mr rosenberg 's manner be much kinder than it have be before and with a child 's quick insight dotty perceive that she father 's come have work the change i want to go home i want to go home cry she with another passionate outburst o take I -- do they will not send for I never take I and i 'll give you -- o mr rosenberg i 'll give you -- for a little while there be quite a scene at the little grocery and it repent mandoline that she have ever hide dotty 's hat the trundle-bed wake up at both end and scream the black and tan dog who sleep under the counter in the store bark lustily the parrot in the blue cage call out quit that quit that and mr rosenberg be afraid a policeman would come in to inquire the cause of the uproar she patter about in a pair of she husband 's cotton-velvet slipper and tuck all she little one into bed again very much as if they have be clothes in a boiler which she be force down with a stick she be a woman who would be obey and dotty finding it of no use to hold out against fate go up stair at last and lay down beside mandoline on the pin-feather this steal visit have turn out quite quite different from she anticipation instead of a delightful supper of some mysterious jewish cookery she have be drink gall and wormwood that lina would not let she go -- that be the gall that she father make she stay -- this be the wormwood she be a tough piece sigh mr rosenberg as she lay she weary limb to repose i do not know one while but she would get away in spite of I i wonder what she father 'll pay I he seem to think this be a house of correction she mother will not be likely to let she stay more than one day i 'll have on the best table-cloth for breakfast and along in the forenoon i 'll fetch out some macaroni cake and lager beer that 'll coax she up i guess just then mr rosenberg down stair and dotty dimple up stair both fall asleep one dream of run away and be chase by a dog with a hat on he head who bark good-night as fiercely as a bite the other dream of money and brown sugar and all the while the rat be treat themselves to nibble of wood but nobody hear they be careful old rat you tooth have do mischief before now the night wear on to the wee small hour when a loud noise like a cannon startle mr rosenberg or be she dream the house be shake to its very foundation as if by a earthquake and the room be full of smoke she be just run for the child when the building fall together with a crash the roof be blow off into the street the window be shiver to atom and tongue of flame leap madly up from the ruin what do it mean she be so stunned by the shock that she scarcely care whether one of she child be spare or not she only think in she stupor that mr parlin would not pay she for dotty 's lodging if the child be blow to piece i know how it happen say she twitch at she own hair to arouse herself just as abraham always say the rat have be nibble match in the store they have burn a hole through the floor and set fire to that keg of gunpowder yes that be it chapter vii play prisoner i know how it happen too it come of eat sausage mr rosenberg after she be fairly awake feel so uncomfortable and oppressed that she go up stair to see if the child be safe really i do suppose those little human soul be precious to she after all there lay mandoline and dotty side by side on the buffalo skin and the jewish mother stand in she short night-dress with a tallow candle in she hand and gaze at they tenderly that horrible dream have stir the fountain of love in she heart they make a beautiful picture and there be no stain of evil in they young face it seem as if the angel of sleep fly away with load of naughtiness for he always leave sleep child look very innocent but alas he bring back next morning all he carry away for the little one wake up with just as bad heart as ever what sweet little creeter say mr rosenberg bend over and kiss they both just like seraphim right out of the cloud softly madam if a drop of tallow should fall on they from that candle they might take to themselves wing and fly away that be what cupid do in the fairy story and you be in fairy-land yourself mr rosenberg you be still half asleep she look at mandoline 's perfect little hand lie outside the patchwork quilt it do not seem now murmur the mother with a tear in she eye that i could ever whack they pretty finger with a thimble i do believe if i be not pester to death with everything under the sun to do i might be kind o ' half-way decent perhaps the poor woman tell the truth i think she do then as she stand there she breathe a little prayer without any word -- not for herself -- for she do not suppose god would hear _ that _ -- but for she child that she bang about every day of they life she be not really a jewess for she have no religion of any sort and never go to church but i be sure of one thing : little overworked mandoline would have love she mother better if she have know she ever pray for she at all in the morning mr rosenberg be just as hard and sharp as ever she could not stop to be pleasant dotty long to get away but she be a exile from she own dear home whither could she turn it be a cold morning and the child run down stair half dress and shiver dotty spread out she stiff red finger before the cooking-stove like the stick of a fan o hum think she drearily i wish i could see the red coal in we grate my mamma would not let I go to the table with such hair as this prudy would say 'twa ` harum scarum ' but i can not brush it with a tooth-comb ` thout any glass -- so there dotty 's curly hair look quite as respectable as mandoline 's mr rosenberg be far too busy to attend to she child 's head they might be rough on the outside and full of mischief inside but she could not stop to inquire what a dreadful nice breakfast remark judith rub she hand and accidentally hit little jacob who forthwith spill some molasses on the clean table-cloth and have he ear box in consequence it be very evident that this meal be a much better one than usual -- a sort of festival in honor of dotty dimple : dutch cheese and pickle mince-pie and gingerbread pepper-box and green and yellow dish be mix up together as if they have be stir about with a spoon dotty have not intend to eat a mouthful but after she light supper of the night before she be really hungry and in spite of she best resolve the fish-hash and corncake gradually disappear from she plate after breakfast she feel more resigned and armed herself to meet she fate mr rosenberg graciously allow mandoline to lay aside she tedious knitting and give she undivided attention to she guest dotty have no heart for play seem as if i should choke in this house say she let 's go out and breathe the air inside the house be rather stifle from a mixture of odor and soon the grocery begin to fill with loud-talking man and boy but not the least of dotty 's trouble be the black and tan dog who seem to have just such a temper as mr rosenberg and would certainly have scold if he have have the gift of speech the two little girl go out to walk but it be not a pleasant street where the grocery stand and dotty hurry on to a better part of the town they flutter about for two or three hour as aimless as a couple of white butterfly just as they be turn to go back to the dismal little grocery which dotty thought be more like a lock-up than ever they meet mr and mr parlin ride out in a carriage -lrb- illustration : dotty and the black-and-tan dog -rrb- dotty feel a sudden tumult of joy and shame but the joy be uppermost she rush headlong across the street swing she arm and startling the horse who suppose she be some new and improved kind of windmill dress up in a little girl 's clothes o my darling mamma my darling mamma to she surprise the horse do not stop he only prick up he ear and look with displeasure at the windmill but keep along as before mamma mamma i say she mother never even look at she but turn she gaze to the blacken tree the heap of ruin along the

play thief this day be the longest one to be find in the almanac it be longer than all the line of railroad from maine to indiana and back again dotty shut she lip together and suffer in silence but

remember she have be happy once but that be age ago it be not likely she should ever smile again and as for laughter she know that be over with she forever susy and prudy be at home make book-mark and cologne mat _ they _ could smile for they have not run away i should not think my mamma would care if i go in at the back door think dotty meekly if she lock I out i can lie down on the step and

face be once set towards home lina turn on she heel and slowly walk away dotty call after she : -- there lina now you have tell a awful story you say you would go to my house and tell my mother i would run away again and now you do not dare go so you have tell a awful wicked story with this parting thrust at she tormentor dotty turn again to the misery of she own thought she home be already in sight but the uncertainty as to she reception there make she little foot falter in they course she head sink lower and lower till she chin snuggle into the hollow of she neck and she eye peer out keenly from under she hat to make sure no one be watch there be a door-yard on one side of the house she touch the gate-latch as gently as if it have be a loaded gun and creep noiselessly along to the side door here she pause she heart throb loudly but in spite of that she could hear norah walk about and rattle the cover of the stove as she put in coal dotty 's courage fail what if norah should make believe she do not know she and shut the door in she face i can not see norah and hear she say ` what strange little girl be this it _ look _ like we alice but it can not be any such a child ' no i can not see anybody i have finish my visit i have a right to come home but p ` rhap they will not think so i feel 's if i be not half so good as tea-grounds or coffee-grounds or potato-skin continue

leave out in order to admit coal through this window creep dotty regardless of she white stocking and crimson dress when she have fairly get she head through the opening and be no longer afraid of be see she breathe more freely here i be not a bit of I out but i must go on my tipsy-toe or they 'll hear I and think it be a _ buggler _ there be quite a steep hill to walk over and she find it anything but a path of rose once or twice she stumble and fall upon she hand and knee seem to I say she draw out she foot which have sink above the ankle in coal -- seem to I i have as many foot as a caterpillar but she keep on down the hill of difficulty till she reach solid ground it be not a very cheerful apartment that be certain the light have much difficulty in get in at the little window and when it do fight its way through it be not good for much it be a gloomy light and look as if it have have a hard time dotty go up to the furnace for comfort it be a tall black thing do its best to give warmth and cheer to the room up stair but it be of no use to the cellar it be like some brilliant people who shine in society but be dull and stupid at home dotty open the furnace door and try to warm she cold finger why my hand be as black as a _ sip _ sigh she as if she could have expect anything else there do not seem to be one ray of hope in she little dark soul she have no tear to shed -- she seldom have -- but when she be in trouble she be always in the lowest depths pretty well for I to make believe i be a thief and be go to steal ` who be this strange little girl ' say he ` it _ look _ like -- ' she hear voice near the cellar door what if norah should come down after butter dotty be not prepare for that she could not hide in the keg of lard of course and what _ should _ she

she loneliness long to be near the dear people of the family even if she could not see they edward say she mother -- what music there be in she voice -- if you be go after that dear child you would better take a shawl to wrap she in for it be snow fast and be sure to tell she we love she dearly every one of we and do not believe she will ever run away again o be she papa go after she do they

you want to get I away it be not polite to tell hint norah my mamma say so but as dotty begin to see that she really be not wanted she conclude to go though she must have it seem that she go of she own accord and not because of norah 's hint do you think it be a buggler when i open the cellar-door last night norah no i can not say as i do -- not when i look at you reply norah gravely 'cause i be go into the parlor to ask mother if _ she _ think i be a buggler i believe i will not help you any more now norah p ` rhap i 'll come out by and by so dotty skip away but it never occur to she that she have be troublesome she merely think it very strange norah do not appreciate she service i s ` pose she know mother 'll help she if i do not say she to herself dotty 's goodness run on with a ceaseless flow till two o'clock when that event take place which the child regard as the most important one of the day -- that be dinner after the silent blessing mr parlin turn to he youngest

then the bright fireplace with a marble mantel and a pair of gilt bellows hang on a brass nail it be a very neat and cheerful room but they could not understand why there should be any more memory in it than there be in any other part of the house we old people live very much in the past say grandma read prudence if thee 'll pick up this stitch for I i will tell thee what i be think of when thee and alice come in so say she hold out the little red mitten she be knit and at the same time take the spectacles off she nose and offer they to prudy prudy laugh why grandma my eye be as good as can

with she crocheting of violet and white worsted and dotty with nothing at all to do but play with the tong mr knowle be a very large fleshy woman who live near my father 's house when i be a little girl some people be very much afraid of she and think she a witch she sister 's husband mr palmer get very angry with she and declare she bewitch he cattle do she grandma ask dotty no indeed my dear
