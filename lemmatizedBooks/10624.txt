produce by suzanne shell dave morgan and pg distribute proofreader three john silence story algernon blackwood to mlw the original of john silence and my companion in many adventure contents case i : a psychical invasion case ii : ancient sorcery case iii : the nemesis of fire case i : a psychical invasion i and what be it make you think i could be of use in this particular case ask dr john silence look across somewhat sceptically at the swedish lady in the chair face he you sympathetic heart and you knowledge of occultism -- oh please -- that dreadful word he interrupt hold up a finger with a gesture of impatience well then she laugh you wonderful clairvoyant gift and you trained psychic knowledge of the process by which a personality may be disintegrate and destroy -- these strange study you have be experiment with all these year -- if it be only a case of multiple personality i must really cry off interrupted the doctor again hastily a bored expression in he eye it be not that now please be serious for i want you help she say and if i choose my word poorly you must be patient with my ignorance the case i know will interest you and no one else could deal with it so well in fact no ordinary professional man could deal with it at all for i know of no treatment nor medicine that can restore a lose sense of humor you begin to interest I with you ` case ' he reply and make himself comfortable to listen mr sivendson draw a sigh of contentment as she watch he go to the tube and hear he tell the servant he be not to be disturbed i believe you have read my thought already she say you intuitive knowledge of what go on in other people 's mind be positively uncanny she friend shake he head and smile as he draw he chair up to a convenient position and prepare to listen attentively to what she have to say he close he eye as he always do when he wish to absorb the real meaning of a recital that might be inadequately express for by this method he find it easier to set himself in tune with the living thought that lay behind the broken word by he friend john silence be regard as a eccentric because he be rich by accident and by choice -- a doctor that a man of independent means should devote he time to doctoring chiefly doctoring folk who could not pay pass they comprehension entirely the native nobility of a soul whose first desire be to help those who could not help themselves puzzle they after that it irritated they and greatly to he own satisfaction they leave he to he own device dr silence be a free-lance though among doctor have neither consulting-room bookkeeper nor professional manner he take no fee be at heart a genuine philanthropist yet at the same time do no harm to he fellow-practitioner because he only accept unremunerative case and case that interest he for some very special reason he argue that the rich could pay and the very poor could avail themselves of organised charity but that a very large class of ill-paid self-respecting worker often follower of the art could not afford the price of a week 's comfort merely to be tell to travel and it be these he desire to help : case often require special and patient study -- thing no doctor can give for a guinea and that no one would dream of expect he to give but there be another side to he personality and practice and one with which we be now more directly concern for the case that especially appeal to he be of no ordinary kind but rather of that intangible elusive and difficult nature best describe as psychical affliction and though he would have be the last person himself to approve of the title it be beyond question that he be know more or less generally as the psychic doctor in order to grapple with case of this peculiar kind he have submit himself to a long and severe training at once physical mental and spiritual what precisely this training have be or where undergo no one seem to know -- for he never speak of it as indeed he betray no single other characteristic of the charlatan -- but the fact that it have involve a total disappearance from the world for five year and that after he return and begin he singular practice no one ever dream of apply to he the so easily acquire epithet of quack speak much for the seriousness of he strange quest and also for the genuineness of he attainment for the modern psychical researcher he feel the calm tolerance of the man who know there be a trace of pity in he voice -- contempt he never show -- when he speak of they method this classification of result be uninspired work at best he say once to I when i have be he confidential assistant for some year it lead nowhere and after a hundred year will lead nowhere it be play with the wrong end of a rather dangerous toy far better it would be to examine the cause and then the result would so easily slip into place and explain themselves for the source be accessible and open to all who have the courage to lead the life that alone make practical investigation safe and possible and towards the question of clairvoyance too he attitude be significantly sane for he know how extremely rare the genuine power be and that what be commonly call clairvoyance be nothing more than a keen power of visualise it connote a slightly increase sensibility nothing more he would say the true clairvoyant deplore he power recognize that it add a new horror to life and be in the nature of a affliction and you will find this always to be the real test thus it be that john silence this singularly develop doctor be able to select he case with a clear knowledge of the difference between mere hysterical delusion and the kind of psychical affliction that claim he special power it be never necessary for he to resort to the cheap mystery of divination for as i have hear he observe after the solution of some peculiarly intricate problem -- system of divination from geomancy down to read by tea-leaf be merely so many method of obscure the outer vision in order that the inner vision may become open once the method be master no system be necessary at all and the word be significant of the method of this remarkable man the keynote of whose power lay perhaps more than anything else in the knowledge first that thought can act at a distance and secondly that thought be dynamic and can accomplish material result learn how to _ think _ he would have express it and you have learn to tap power at its source to look at -- he be now past forty -- he be sparely build with speak brown eye in which shine the light of knowledge and self-confidence while at the same time they make one think of that wondrous gentleness see most often in the eye of animal a close beard conceal the mouth without disguise the grim determination of lip and jaw and the face somehow convey a impression of transparency almost of light so delicately be the feature refine away on the fine forehead be that indefinable touch of peace that come from identify the mind with what be permanent in the soul and let the impermanent slip by without power to wind or distress while from he manner -- so gentle quiet sympathetic -- few could have guess the strength of purpose that burn within like a great flame i think i should describe it as a psychical case continue the swedish lady obviously try to explain herself very intelligently and just the kind you like i mean a case where the cause be hide deep down in some spiritual distress and -- but the symptom first please my dear svenska he interrupt with a strangely compelling seriousness of manner and you deduction afterwards she turn round sharply on the edge of she chair and look he in the face lower she voice to prevent she emotion betray itself too obviously in my opinion there be only one symptom she half whisper as though tell something disagreeable -- fear -- simply fear physical fear i think not though how can i say i think it be a horror in the psychical region it be no ordinary delusion the man be quite sane but he live in mortal terror of something -- i do not know what you mean by he ` psychical region ' say the doctor with a smile though i suppose you wish I to understand that he spiritual and not he mental process be affect anyhow try and tell I briefly and pointedly what you know about the man he symptom he need for help my peculiar help that be and all that seem vital in the case i promise to listen devotedly i be try she continue earnestly but must do so in my own word and trust to you intelligence to disentangle as i go along he be a young author and live in a tiny house off putney heath somewhere he write humorous story -- quite a genre of he own : pender -- you must have hear the name -- felix pender oh the man have a great gift and marry on the strength of it he future seem assure i say ` have ' for quite suddenly he talent utterly fail he worse it become transform into its opposite he can no longer write a line in the old way that be bring he success -- dr silence open he eye for a second and look at she he still write then the force have not go he ask briefly and then close he eye again to listen he work like a fury she go on but produce nothing -- she hesitate a moment -- nothing that he can use or sell he earnings have practically cease and he make a precarious living by book-reviewing and odd job -- very odd some of they yet i be certain he talent have not really desert he finally but be merely -- again mr sivendson hesitate for the appropriate word in abeyance he suggest without open he eye obliterate she go on after a moment to weigh the word merely obliterate by something else -- by some one else i wish i know all i can say be that he be haunt and temporarily he sense of humor be shroud -- go -- replace by something dreadful that write other thing unless something competent be do he will simply starve to death yet he be afraid to go to a doctor for fear of be pronounced insane and anyhow a man can hardly ask a doctor to take a guinea to restore a vanish sense of humor can he have he try any one at all -- not doctor yet he try some clergyman and religious people but they know so little and have so little intelligent sympathy and most of they be so busy balance on they own little pedestal -- john silence stop she tirade with a gesture and how be it that you know so much about he he ask gently i know mr pender well -- i know she before she marry he -- and be she a cause perhaps not in the least she be devote a woman very well educate though without be really intelligent and with so little sense of humor herself that she always laugh at the wrong place but she have nothing to do with the cause of he distress and indeed have chiefly guess it from observe he rather than from what little he have tell she and he you know be a really lovable fellow hard-working patient -- altogether worth save dr silence open he eye and go over to ring for tea he do not know very much more about the case of the humorist than when he first sit down to listen but he realize that no amount of word from he swedish friend would help to reveal the real fact a personal interview with the author himself could alone do that all humorist be worth save he say with a smile as she pour out tea we can not afford to lose a single one in these strenuous day i will go and see you friend at the first opportunity she thank he elaborately effusively with many word and he with much difficulty keep the conversation thenceforward strictly to the teapot and as a result of this conversation and a little more he have gather by means best know to himself and he secretary he be whiz in he motor-car one afternoon a few day later up the putney hill to have he first interview with felix pender the humorous writer who be the victim of some mysterious malady in he psychical region that have obliterate he sense of the comic and threaten to wreck he life and destroy he talent and he desire to help be probably of equal strength with he desire to know and to investigate the motor stop with a deep purr sound as though a great black panther lay conceal within its hood and the doctor -- the psychic doctor as he be sometimes call -- step out through the gathering fog and walk across the tiny garden that hold a blacken fir tree and a stunt laurel shrubbery the house be very small and it be some time before any one answer the bell then suddenly a light appear in the hall and he see a pretty little woman standing on the top step beg he to come in she be dress in gray and the gaslight fall on a mass of deliberately brush light hair stuff dusty bird and a shabby array of african spear hang on the wall behind she a hat-rack with a bronze plate full of very large card lead he eye swiftly to a dark staircase beyond mr pender have round eye like a child 's and she greet he with a effusiveness that barely conceal she emotion yet strive to appear naturally cordial evidently she have be look out for he arrival and have outrun the servant girl she be a little breathless i hope you have not be keep wait -- i think it be _ most _ good of you to come -- she begin and then stop sharp when she see he face in the gaslight there be something in dr silence 's look that do not encourage mere talk he be in earnest now if ever man be good evening mr pender he say with a quiet smile that win confidence yet deprecate unnecessary word the fog delay I a little i be glad to see you they go into a dingy sitting-room at the back of the house neatly furnished but depressing book stand in a row upon the mantelpiece the fire have evidently just be light it smoke in great puff into the room mr sivendson say she think you might be able to come venture the little woman again look up engagingly into he face and betray anxiety and eagerness in every gesture but i hardly dare to believe it i think it be really too good of you my husband 's case be so peculiar that -- well you know i be quite sure any _ ordinary _ doctor would say at once the asylum -- be not he in then ask dr silence gently in the asylum she gasp oh dear no -- not yet in the house i mean he laugh she give a great sigh he 'll be back any minute now she reply obviously relieve to see he laugh but the fact be we do not expect you so early -- i mean my husband hardly think you would come at all i be always delighted to come -- when i be really wanted and can be of help he say quickly and perhaps it be all for the best that you husband be out for now that we be alone you can tell I something about he difficulty so far you know i have hear very little she voice tremble as she thank he and when he come and take a chair close beside she she actually have difficulty in find word with which to begin in the first place she begin timidly and then continue with a nervous incoherent rush of word he will be simply delighted that you have really come because he say you be the only person he would consent to see at all -- the only doctor i mean but of course he do not know how frightened i be or how much i have notice he pretend with I that it be just a nervous breakdown and i be sure he do not realize all the odd thing i have notice he do but the main thing i suppose -- yes the main thing mr pender he say encouragingly notice she hesitation -- be that he think we be not alone in the house that be the chief thing tell I more fact -- just fact it begin last summer when i come back from ireland he have be here alone for six week and i think he look tired and queer -- ragged and scatter about the face if you know what i mean and he manner wear out he say he have be write hard but he inspiration have somehow fail he and he be dissatisfy with he work he sense of humor be leave he or change into something else he say there be something in the house he declare that -- she emphasise the word -- prevent he feeling funny something in the house that prevent he feeling funny repeat the doctor ah now we be get to the heart of it yes she resume vaguely that be what he keep say and what be it he _ do _ that you think strange he ask sympathetically be brief or he may be here before you finish very small thing but significant it seem to I he change he workroom from the library as we call it to the sitting-room he say all he character become wrong and terrible in the library they alter so that he feel like write tragedy -- vile debased tragedy the tragedy of broken soul but now he say the same of the sitting-room and he be go back to the library ah you see there be so little i can tell you she go on with increase speed and countless gesture i mean it be only very small thing he do and say that be queer what frighten I be that he assume there be some one else in the house all the time -- some one i never see he do not actually say so but on the stair i have see he stand aside to let some one pass i have see he open a door to let some one in or out and often in we bedroom he put chair about as though for some one else to sit in oh -- oh yes and once or twice she cry -- once or twice -- she pause and look about she with a startled air yes once or twice she resume hurriedly as though she hear a sound that alarm she i have hear he run -- come in and out of the room breathless as if something be after he -- the door open while she be still speak cut she word off in the middle and a man come into the room he be dark and clean-shaven sallow rather with the eye of imagination and dark hair grow scantily about the temple he be dress in a shabby tweed suit and wear a untidy flannel collar at the neck the dominant expression of he face be startle -- hunt a expression that might any moment leap into the dreadful stare of terror and announce a total loss of self-control the moment he see he visitor a smile spread over he worn feature and he advance to shake hand i hope you would come mr sivendson say you might be able to find time he say simply he voice be thin and needy i be very glad to see you dr silence it be ` doctor ' be it not well i be entitle to the description laugh the other but i rarely get it you know i do not practice as a regular thing that be i only take case that specially interest I or -- he do not finish the sentence for the man exchange a glance of sympathy that render it unnecessary i have hear of you great kindness it be my hobby say the other quickly and my privilege i trust you will still think so when you have hear what i have to tell you continue the author a little wearily he lead the way across the hall into the little smoking-room where they could talk freely and undisturbed in the smoking-room the door shut and privacy about they fender 's attitude change somewhat and he manner become very grave the doctor sit opposite where he could watch he face already he see it look more haggard evidently it cost he much to refer to he trouble at all what i have be in my belief a profound spiritual affliction he begin quite bluntly look straight into the other 's eye i see that at once dr silence say yes you see that of course my atmosphere must convey that much to any one with psychic perception besides which i feel sure from all i have hear that you be really a soul-doctor be you not more than a healer merely of the body you think of I too highly return the other though i prefer case as you know in which the spirit be disturbed first the body afterwards i understand yes well i have experience a curious disturbance in -- not in my physical region primarily i mean my nerve be all right and my body be all right i have no delusion exactly but my spirit be tortured by a calamitous fear which first come upon I in a strange manner john silence lean forward a moment and take the speaker 's hand and hold it in he own for a few brief seconds close he eye as he do so he be not feel he pulse or do any of the thing that doctor ordinarily do he be merely absorb into himself the main note of the man 's mental condition so as to get completely he own point of view and thus be able to treat he case with true sympathy a very close observer might perhaps have notice that a slight tremor run through he frame after he have hold the hand for a few seconds tell I quite frankly mr pender he say soothingly release the hand and with deep attention in he manner tell I all the step that lead to the beginning of this invasion i mean tell I what the particular drug be and why you take it and how it affect you -- then you know it begin with a drug cry the author with undisguised astonishment i only know from what i observe in you and in its effect upon myself you be in a surprising psychical condition certain portion of you atmosphere be vibrate at a far greater rate than other this be the effect of a drug but of no ordinary drug allow I to finish please if the higher rate of vibration spread all over you will become of course permanently cognisant of a much larger world than the one you know normally if on the other hand the rapid portion sink back to the usual rate you will lose these occasional increase perception you now have you amaze I exclaim the author for you word exactly describe what i have be feel -- i mention this only in pass and to give you confidence before you approach the account of you real affliction continue the doctor all perception as you know be the result of vibration and clairvoyance simply mean become sensitive to a increase scale of vibration the awakening of the inner sens we hear so much about mean no more than that you partial clairvoyance be easily explain the only thing that puzzle I be how you manage to procure the drug for it be not easy to get in pure form and no adulterated tincture could have give you the terrific impetus i see you have acquire but please proceed now and tell I you story in you own way this _ cannabis indica _ the author go on come into my possession last autumn while my wife be away i need not explain how i get it for that have no importance but it be the genuine fluid extract and i could not resist the temptation to make a experiment one of its effect as you know be to induce torrential laughter -- yes : sometimes -- i be a writer of humorous tale and i wish to increase my own sense of laughter -- to see the ludicrous from a abnormal point of view i wish to study it a bit if possible and -- tell I i take a experimental dose i starve for six hour to hasten the effect lock myself into this room and give order not to be disturbed then i swallow the stuff and wait and the effect i wait one hour two three four five hour nothing happen no laughter come but only a great weariness instead nothing in the room or in my thought come within a hundred mile of a humorous aspect always a most uncertain drug interrupt the doctor we make very small use of it on that account at two o'clock in the morning i feel so hungry and tired that i decide to give up the experiment and wait no longer i drink some milk and go upstairs to bed i feel flat and disappointed i fall asleep at once and must have sleep for about a hour when i awake suddenly with a great noise in my ear it be the noise of my own laughter i be simply shake with merriment at first i be bewildered and think i have be laugh in dream but a moment later i remember the drug and be delighted to think that after all i have get a effect it have be work all along only i have miscalculate the time the only unpleasant thing _ then _ be a odd feeling that i have not wake naturally but have be waken by some one else -- deliberately this come to I as a certainty in the middle of my noisy laughter and distressed I any impression who it could have be ask the doctor now listen with close attention to every word very much on the alert pender hesitate and try to smile he brush he hair from he forehead with a nervous gesture you must tell I all you impression even you fancy they be quite as important as you certainty i have a vague idea that it be some one connect with my forget dream some one who have be at I in my sleep some one of great strength and great ability -- of great force -- quite a unusual personality -- and i be certain too -- a woman a good woman ask john silence quietly pender start a little at the question and he sallow face flush it seem to surprise he but he shake he head quickly with a indefinable look of horror evil he answer briefly appallingly evil and yet mingle with the sheer wickedness of it be also a certain perverseness -- the perversity of the unbalanced mind he hesitate a moment and look up sharply at he interlocutor a shade of suspicion show itself in he eye no laugh the doctor you need not fear that i be merely humor you or think you mad far from it you story interest I exceedingly and you furnish I unconsciously with a number of clue as you tell it you see i possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic byway i be shake with such violent laughter continue the narrator reassure in a moment though with no clear idea what be amusing I that i have the greatest difficulty in get up for the match and be afraid i should frighten the servant overhead with my explosion when the gas be light i find the room empty of course and the door lock as usual then i half dress and go out on to the landing my hilarity better under control and proceed to go downstairs i wish to record my sensation i stuff a handkerchief into my mouth so as not to scream aloud and communicate my hysteric to the entire household and the presence of this -- this -- it be hang about I all the time say pender but for the moment it seem to have withdraw probably too my laughter kill all other emotion and how long do you take get downstairs i be just come to that i see you know all my ` symptom ' in advance as it be for of course i think i should never get to the bottom each step seem to take five minute and cross the narrow hall at the foot of the stair -- well i could have swear it be half a hour 's journey have not my watch certify that it be a few seconds yet i walk fast and try to push on it be no good i walk apparently without advance and at that rate it would have take I a week to get down putney hill a experimental dose radically alter the scale of time and space sometimes -- but when at last i get into my study and light the gas the change come horridly and sudden as a flash of lightning it be like a douche of icy water and in the middle of this storm of laughter -- yes what ask the doctor lean forward and peer into he eye -- i be overwhelm with terror say pender lower he reedy voice at the mere recollection of it he pause a moment and mop he forehead the scared hunt look in he eye now dominate the whole face yet all the time the corner of he mouth hint of possible laughter as though the recollection of that merriment still amuse he the combination of fear and laughter in he face be very curious and lend great conviction to he story it also lend a bizarre expression of horror to he gesture terror be it repeat the doctor soothingly yes terror for though the thing that wake I seem to have go the memory of it still frighten I and i collapse into a chair then i lock the door and try to reason with myself but the drug make my movement so prolong that it take I five minute to reach the door and another five to get back to the chair again the laughter too keep bubble up inside I -- great wholesome laughter that shake I like gust of wind -- so that even my terror almost make I laugh oh but i may tell you dr silence it be altogether vile that mixture of fear and laughter altogether vile then all at once the thing in the room again present they funny side to I and set I off laugh more furiously than ever the bookcase be ludicrous the arm-chair a perfect clown the way the clock look at I on the mantelpiece too comic for word the arrangement of papers and inkstand on the desk tickle I till i roared and shake and hold my side and the tear stream down my cheek and that footstool oh that absurd footstool he lay back in he chair laugh to himself and hold up he hand at the thought of it and at the sight of he dr silence laugh too go on please he say i quite understand i know something myself of the hashish laughter the author pull himself together and resume he face grow quickly grave again so you see side by side with this extravagant apparently causeless merriment there be also a extravagant apparently causeless terror the drug produce the laughter i know but what bring in the terror i could not imagine everywhere behind the fun lay the fear it be terror mask by cap and bell and i become the playground for two oppose emotion arm and fight to the death gradually then the impression grow in I that this fear be cause by the invasion -- so you call it just now -- of the ` person ' who have waken I : she be utterly evil inimical to my soul or at least to all in I that wish for good there i stand sweating and tremble laugh at everything in the room yet all the while with this white terror master my heart and this creature be put -- put she -- he hesitate again use he handkerchief freely put what -- put idea into my mind he go on glance nervously about the room actually tap my thought-stream so as to switch off the usual current and inject she own how mad that sound i know it but it be true it be the only way i can express it moreover while the operation terrify I the skill with which it be accomplish fill I afresh with laughter at the clumsiness of man by comparison we ignorant bungling method of teach the mind of other of inculcate idea and so on overwhelmed I with laughter when i understand this superior and diabolical method yet my laughter seem hollow and ghastly and idea of evil and tragedy tread close upon the heel of the comic oh doctor i tell you again it be unnerving john silence sit with he head thrust forward to catch every word of the story which the other continue to pour out in nervous jerky sentence and lowered voice you see nothing -- no one -- all this time he ask not with my eye there be no visual hallucination but in my mind there begin to grow the vivid picture of a woman -- large dark-skinned with white tooth and masculine feature and one eye -- the leave -- so droop as to appear almost close oh such a face -- a face you would recognize again pender laugh dreadfully i wish i could forget it he whisper i only wish i could forget it then he sit forward in he chair suddenly and grasp the doctor 's hand with a emotional gesture i _ must _ tell you how grateful i be for you patience and sympathy he cry with a tremor in he voice and -- that you do not think I mad i have tell no one else a quarter of all this and the mere freedom of speech -- the relief of share my affliction with another -- have help I already more than i can possibly say dr silence press he hand and look steadily into the frightened eye he voice be very gentle when he reply you case you know be very singular but of absorb interest to I he say for it threaten not you physical existence but the temple of you psychical existence -- the inner life you mind would not be permanently affect here and now in this world but in the existence after the body be leave behind you might wake up with you spirit so twisted so distorted so befouled that you would be _ spiritually insane _ -- a far more radical condition than merely be insane here there come a strange hush over the room and between the two man sit there face one another do you really mean -- good lord stammer the author as soon as he could find he tongue what i mean in detail will keep till a little later and i need only say now that i should not have speak in this way unless i be quite positive of be able to help you oh there be no doubt as to that believe I in the first place i be very familiar with the workings of this extraordinary drug this drug which have have the chance effect of open you up to the force of another region and in the second i have a firm belief in the reality of supersensuous occurrence as well as considerable knowledge of psychic process acquire by long and painful experiment the rest be or should be merely sympathetic treatment and practical application the hashish have partially open another world to you by increase you rate of psychical vibration and thus render you abnormally sensitive ancient force attach to this house have attack you for the moment i be only puzzle as to they precise nature for be they of a ordinary character i should myself be psychic enough to feel they yet i be conscious of feel nothing as yet but now please continue mr pender and tell I the rest of you wonderful story and when you have finish i will talk about the means of cure pender shift he chair a little closer to the friendly doctor and then go on in the same nervous voice with he narrative after make some note of my impression i finally get upstairs again to bed it be four o'clock in the morning i laugh all the way up -- at the grotesque banister the droll physiognomy of the staircase window the burlesque grouping of the furniture and the memory of that outrageous footstool in the room below but nothing more happen to alarm or disturb I and i wake late in the morning after a dreamless sleep none the worse for my experiment except for a slight headache and a coldness of the extremity due to lowered circulation fear go too ask the doctor i seem to have forget it or at least ascribe it to mere nervousness its reality have go anyhow for the time and all that day i write and write and write my sense of laughter seem wonderfully quicken and my character act without effort out of the heart of true humor i be exceedingly please with this result of my experiment but when the stenographer have take she departure and i come to read over the page she have type out i recall she sudden glance of surprise and the odd way she have look up at I while i be dictate i be amaze at what i read and could hardly believe i have utter it and why it be so distorted the word indeed be mine so far as i could remember but the meaning seem strange it frighten I the sense be so altered at the very place where my character be intend to tickle the rib only curious emotion of sinister amusement result dreadful innuendo have manage to creep into the phrase there be laughter of a kind but it be bizarre horrible distressing and my attempt at analysis only increase my dismay the story as it read then make I shudder for by virtue of these slight change it have come somehow to hold the soul of horror of horror disguise as merriment the framework of humor be there if you understand I but the character have turn sinister and they laughter be evil can you show I this write the author shake he head i destroy it he whisper but in the end though of course much perturb about it i persuade myself that it be due to some after-effect of the drug a sort of reaction that give a twist to my mind and make I read macabre interpretation into word and situation that do not properly hold they and meanwhile do the presence of this person leave you no that stay more or less when my mind be actively employ i forget it but when idle dream or do nothing in particular there she be beside I influence my mind horribly -- in what way precisely interrupt the doctor evil scheming thought come to I vision of crime hateful picture of wickedness and the kind of bad imagination that so far have be foreign indeed impossible to my normal nature -- the pressure of the dark power upon the personality murmur the doctor make a quick note eh i do not quite catch -- pray go on i be merely make note you shall know they purport fully later even when my wife return i be still aware of this presence in the house it associate itself with my inner personality in most intimate fashion and outwardly i always feel oddly constrain to be polite and respectful towards it -- to open door provide chair and hold myself carefully deferential when it be about it become very compelling at last and if i fail in any little particular i seem to know that it pursue I about the house from one room to another haunting my very soul in its inmost abode it certainly come before my wife so far as my attention be concerned but let I first finish the story of my experimental dose for i take it again the third night and undergo a very similar experience delay like the first in come and then carry I off my foot when it do come with a rush of this false demon-laughter this time however there be a reversal of the change scale of space and time it shorten instead of lengthen so that i dress and get downstairs in about twenty seconds and the couple of hour i stay and work in the study pass literally like a period of ten minute that be often true of a overdose interject the doctor and you may go a mile in a few minute or a few yard in a quarter of a hour it be quite incomprehensible to those who have never experience it and be a curious proof that time and space be merely form of think this time pender go on talk more and more rapidly in he excitement another extraordinary effect come to I and i experience a curious change of the sens so that i perceive external thing through one large main sense-channel instead of through the five division know as sight smell touch and so forth you will i know understand I when i tell you that i _ hear _ sight and _ see _ sound no language can make this comprehensible of course and i can only say for instance that the striking of the clock i see as a visible picture in the air before I i see the sound of the tinkling bell and in precisely the same way i hear the color in the room especially the color of those book in the shelf behind you those red binding i hear in deep sound and the yellow cover of the french binding next to they make a shrill piercing note not unlike the chattering of starling that brown bookcase mutter and those green curtain opposite keep up a constant sort of ripple sound like the lower note of a wood-horn but i only be conscious of these sound when i look steadily at the different object and think about they the room you understand be not full of a chorus of note but when i concentrate my mind upon a color i hear as well as saw it that be a known though rarely obtain effect of _ cannabis indica _ observe the doctor and it provoke laughter again do it only the muttering of the cupboard-bookcase make I laugh it be so like a great animal try to get itself notice and make I think of a perform bear -- which be full of a kind of pathetic humor you know but this mingling of the sens produce no confusion in my brain on the contrary i be unusually clear-headed and experience a intensification of consciousness and feel marvellously alive and keen-minded moreover when i take up a pencil in obedience to a impulse to sketch -- a talent not normally mine -- i find that i could draw nothing but head nothing in fact but one head -- always the same -- the head of a dark-skinned woman with huge and terrible feature and a very drooping leave eye and so well draw too that i be amaze as you may imagine -- and the expression of the face -- pender hesitate a moment for word cast about with he hand in the air and hunch he shoulder a perceptible shudder run over he what i can only describe as -- _ blackness _ he reply in a low tone the face of a dark and evil soul you destroy that too query the doctor sharply no i have keep the drawing he say with a laugh and rise to get they from a drawer in the writing-desk behind he here be all that remain of the picture you see he add push a number of loose sheet under the doctor 's eye nothing but a few scrawly line that be all i find the next morning i have really draw no head at all -- nothing but those line and blot and wriggle the picture be entirely subjective and exist only in my mind which construct they out of a few wild stroke of the pen like the altered scale of space and time it be a complete delusion these all pass of course with the passing of the drug 's effect but the other thing do not pass i mean the presence of that dark soul remain with I it be here still it be real i do not know how i can escape from it it be attach to the house not to you personally you must leave the house yes only i can not afford to leave the house for my work be my sole means of support and -- well you see since this change i can not even write they be horrible these mirthless tale i now write with they mockery of laughter they diabolical suggestion horrible i shall go mad if this continue he screw he face up and look about the room as though he expect to see some haunting shape this influence in this house induce by my experiment have kill in a flash in a sudden stroke the source of my humor and though i still go on write funny tale -- i have a certain name you know -- my inspiration have dry up and much of what i write i have to burn -- yes doctor to burn before any one see it as utterly alien to you own mind and personality utterly as though some one else have write it -- ah and shocking he pass he hand over he eye a moment and let the breath escape softly through he tooth yet most damnably clever in the consummate way the vile suggestion be insinuate under cover of a kind of high drollery my stenographer leave I of course -- and i have be afraid to take another -- john silence get up and begin to walk about the room leisurely without speak he appear to be examine the picture on the wall and read the name of the book lie about presently he pause on the hearthrug with he back to the fire and turn to look he patient quietly in the eye pender 's face be gray and draw the hunt expression dominate it the long recital have tell upon he thank you mr pender he say a curious glow show about he fine quiet face thank you for the sincerity and frankness of you account but i think now there be nothing further i need ask you he indulge in a long scrutiny of the author 's haggard feature draw purposely the man 's eye to he own and then meet they with a look of power and confidence calculate to inspire even the feeblest soul with courage and to begin with he add smile pleasantly let I assure you without delay that you need have no alarm for you be no more insane or deluded than i myself be -- pender heave a deep sigh and try to return the smile -- and this be simply a case so far as i can judge at present of a very singular psychical invasion and a very sinister one too if you perhaps understand what i mean -- it be a odd expression you use it before you know say the author wearily yet eagerly listen to every word of the diagnosis and deeply touch by the intelligent sympathy which do not at once indicate the lunatic asylum possibly return the other and a odd affliction too you 'll allow yet one not unknown to the nation of antiquity nor to those modern perhaps who recognize the freedom of action under certain pathogenic condition between this world and another and you think ask pender hastily that it be all primarily due to the _ cannabis _ there be nothing radically amiss with myself -- nothing incurable or -- due entirely to the overdose dr silence reply emphatically to the drug 's direct action upon you psychical be it render you ultra-sensitive and make you respond to a increase rate of vibration and let I tell you mr pender that you experiment might have have result far more dire it have bring you into touch with a somewhat singular class of invisible but of one i think chiefly human in character you might however just as easily have be draw out of human range altogether and the result of such a contingency would have be exceedingly terrible indeed you would not now be here to tell the tale i need not alarm you on that score but mention it as a warning you will not misunderstand or underrate after what you have be through you look puzzle you do not quite gather what i be drive at and it be not to be expect that you should for you i suppose be the nominal christian with the nominal christian 's lofty standard of ethic and he utter ignorance of spiritual possibility beyond a somewhat childish understanding of ` spiritual wickedness in high place ' you probably have no conception of what be possible once you break-down the slender gulf that be mercifully fix between you and that outer world but my study and training have take I far outside these orthodox trip and i have make experiment that i could scarcely speak to you about in language that would be intelligible to you he pause a moment to note the breathless interest of pender 's face and manner every word he utter be calculate he know exactly the value and effect of the emotion he desire to waken in the heart of the afflict be before he and from certain knowledge i have gain through various experience he continue calmly i can diagnose you case as i say before to be one of psychical invasion and the nature of this -- er -- invasion stammer the bewildered writer of humorous tale there be no reason why i should not say at once that i do not yet quite know reply dr silence i may first have to make one or two experiment -- on I gasp pender catch he breath not exactly the doctor say with a grave smile but with you assistance perhaps i shall want to test the condition of the house -- to ascertain impossible the character of the force of this strange personality that have be haunt you -- at present you have no idea exactly who -- what -- why -- ask the other in a wild flurry of interest dread and amazement i have a very good idea but no proof rather return the doctor the effect of the drug in alter the scale of time and space and merge the sens have nothing primarily to do with the invasion they come to any one who be fool enough to take a experimental dose it be the other feature of you case that be unusual you see you be now in touch with certain violent emotion desire purpose still active in this house that be produce in the past by some powerful and evil personality that live here how long ago or why they still persist so forcibly i can not positively say but i should judge that they be merely force act automatically with the momentum of they terrific original impetus not direct by a living be a conscious will you mean possibly not -- but none the less dangerous on that account and more difficult to deal with i can not explain to you in a few minute the nature of such thing for you have not make the study that would enable you to follow I but i have reason to believe that on the dissolution at death of a human be its force may still persist and continue to act in a blind unconscious fashion as a rule they speedily dissipate themselves but in the case of a very powerful personality they may last a long time and in some case -- of which i incline to think this be one -- these force may coalesce with certain non-human entity who thus continue they life indefinitely and increase they strength to a unbelievable degree if the original personality be evil the being attract to the left-over force will also be evil in this case i think there have be a unusual and dreadful aggrandisement of the thought and purpose leave behind long ago by a woman of consummate wickedness and great personal power of character and intellect now do you begin to see what i be drive at a little pender stare fixedly at he companion plain horror show in he eye but he find nothing to say and the doctor continue -- in you case predispose by the action of the drug you have experience the rush of these force in undiluted strength they wholly obliterate in you the sense of humor fancy imagination -- all that make for cheerfulness and hope they seek though perhaps automatically only to oust you own thought and establish themselves in they place you be the victim of a psychical invasion at the same time you have become clairvoyant in the true sense you be also a clairvoyant victim pender mop he face and sigh he leave he chair and go over to the fireplace to warm himself you must think I a quack to talk like this or a madman laugh dr silence but never mind that i have come to help you and i can help you if you will do what i tell you it be very simple : you must leave this house at once oh never mind the difficulty we will deal with those together i can place another house at you disposal or i would take the lease here off you hand and later have it pull down you case interest I greatly and i mean to see you through so that you have no anxiety and can drop back into you old groove of work tomorrow the drug have provide you and therefore I with a shortcut to a very interesting experience i be grateful to you the author poke the fire vigorously emotion rise in he like a tide he glance towards the door nervously there be no need to alarm you wife or to tell she the detail of we conversation pursue the other quietly let she know that you will soon be in possession again of you sense of humor and you health and explain that i be lend you another house for six month meanwhile i may have the right to use this house for a night or two for my experiment be that understand between we i can only thank you from the bottom of my heart stammer pender unable to find word to express he gratitude then he hesitate for a moment search the doctor 's face anxiously and you experiment with the house he say at length of the simplest character my dear mr pender although i be myself a artificially train psychic and consequently aware of the presence of discarnate entity as a rule i have so far feel nothing here at all this make I sure that the force act here be of a unusual description what i propose to do be to make a experiment with a view of draw out this evil coax it from its lair so to speak in order that it may _ exhaust itself through I _ and become dissipate for ever i have already be inoculate he add i consider myself to be immune heaven above gasp the author collapse on to a chair hell beneath might be a more appropriate exclamation the doctor laugh but seriously mr pender this be what i propose to do -- with you permission of course of course cry the other you have my permission and my best wish for success i can see no possible objection but -- but what i pray to heaven you will not undertake this experiment alone will you oh dear no not alone you will take a companion with good nerve and reliable in case of disaster will not you i shall bring two companion the doctor say ah that be better i feel easier i be sure you must have among you acquaintance man who -- i shall not think of bring man mr pender the other look up sharply no or woman either or child i do not understand who will you bring then animal explain the doctor unable to prevent a smile at he companion 's expression of surprise -- two animal a cat and a dog pender stare as if he eye would drop out upon the floor and then lead the way without another word into the adjoining room where he wife be await they for tea ii a few day later the humorist and he wife with mind greatly relieved move into a small furnished house place at they free disposal in another part of london and john silence intent upon he approach experiment make ready to spend a night in the empty house on the top of putney hill only two room be prepare for occupation : the study on the ground floor and the bedroom immediately above it all other door be to be lock and no servant be to be leave in the house the motor have order to call for he at nine o'clock the follow morning and meanwhile he secretary have instruction to look up the past history and association of the place and learn everything he could concern the character of former occupant recent or remote the animal by whose sensitiveness he intend to test any unusual condition in the atmosphere of the building dr silence select with care and judgment he believe -lrb- and have already make curious experiment to prove it -rrb- that animal be more often and more truly clairvoyant than human being many of they he feel convinced possess power of perception far superior to that mere keenness of the sens common to all dweller in the wild where the sens grow specially alert they have what he term animal clairvoyance and from he experiment with horse dog cat and even bird he have draw certain deduction which however need not be refer to in detail here cat in particular he believe be almost continuously conscious of a larger field of vision too detailed even for a photographic camera and quite beyond the reach of normal human organ he have further observe that while dog be usually terrify in the presence of such phenomenon cat on the other hand be soothe and satisfy they welcome manifestation as something belong peculiarly to they own region he select he animal therefore with wisdom so that they might afford a differ test each in its own way and that one should not merely communicate its own excitement to the other he take a dog and a cat the cat he choose now full grow have live with he since kittenhood a kittenhood of perplexing sweetness and audacious mischief wayward it be and fanciful ever play its own mysterious game in the corner of the room jump at invisible nothing leap sideways into the air and fall with tiny moccasined foot on to another part of the carpet yet with a air of dignified earnestness which show that the performance be necessary to its own well-being and not do merely to impress a stupid human audience in the middle of elaborate wash it would look up startle as though to stare at the approach of some invisible cock its little head sideways and put out a velvet pad to inspect cautiously then it would get absent-minded and stare with equal intentness in another direction -lrb- just to confuse the onlooker -rrb- and suddenly go on furiously wash its body again but in quite a new place except for a white patch on its breast it be coal black and its name be -- smoke smoke describe its temperament as well as its appearance its movement its individuality its pose as a little furry mass of conceal mystery its elfin-like elusiveness all combine to justify its name and a subtle painter might have picture it as a wisp of float smoke the fire below betray itself at two point only -- the glowing eye all its force run to intelligence -- secret intelligence the wordless incalculable intuition of the cat it be indeed _ the _ cat for the business in hand the selection of the dog be not so simple for the doctor own many but after much deliberation he choose a collie call flame from he yellow coat true it be a trifle old and stiff in the joint and even begin to grow deaf but on the other hand it be a very particular friend of smoke 's and have father it from kittenhood upward so that a subtle understanding exist between they it be this that turn the balance in its favor this and its courage moreover though good-tempered it be a terrible fighter and its anger when provoke by a righteous cause be a fury of fire and irresistible it have come to he quite young straight from the shepherd with the air of the hill yet in its nostril and be then little more than skin and bone and tooth for a collie it be sturdily build its nose blunter than most its yellow hair stiff rather than silky and it have full eye unlike the slit eye of its breed only its master could touch it for it ignore stranger and despise they patting -- when any dare to pat it there be something patriarchal about the old beast he be in earnest and go through life with tremendous energy and big thing in view as though he have the reputation of he whole race to uphold and to watch he fight against odds be to understand why he be terrible in he relation with smoke he be always absurdly gentle also he be fatherly and at the same time betray a certain diffidence or shyness he recognize that smoke call for strong yet respectful management the cat 's circuitous method puzzle he and he elaborate pretence perhaps shock the dog 's liking for direct undisguised action yet while he fail to comprehend these tortuous feline mystery he be never contemptuous or condescending and he preside over the safety of he furry black friend somewhat as a father loving but intuitive might superintend the vagary of a wayward and talented child and in return smoke reward he with exhibition of fascinating and audacious mischief and these brief description of they character be necessary for the proper understanding of what subsequently take place with smoke sleeping in the fold of he fur coat and the collie lie watchful on the seat opposite john silence go down in he motor after dinner on the night of November 15th and the fog be so dense that they be oblige to travel at quarter speed the entire way \* \* \* \* \* it be after ten o'clock when he dismiss the motor and enter the dingy little house with the latchkey provide by pender he find the hall gas turn low and a fire in the study book and food have also be place ready by the servant accord to instruction coil of fog rush in after he through the open door and fill the hall and passage with its cold discomfort the first thing dr silence do be to lock up smoke in the study with a saucer of milk before the fire and then make a search of the house with flame the dog run cheerfully behind he all the way while he try the door of the other room to make sure they be lock he nose about into corner and make little excursion on he own account he manner be expectant he know there must be something unusual about the proceeding because it be contrary to the habit of he whole life not to be asleep at this hour on the mat in front of the fire he keep look up into he master 's face as door after door be try with a expression of intelligent sympathy but at the same time a certain air of disapproval yet everything he master do be good in he eye and he betray as little impatience as possible with all this unnecessary journey to and fro if the doctor be please to play this sort of game at such a hour of the night it be surely not for he to object so he play it too and be very busy and earnest about it into the bargain after a uneventful search they come down again to the study and here dr silence discover smoke wash he face calmly in front of the fire the saucer of milk be lick dry and clean the preliminary examination that cat always make in new surroundings have evidently be satisfactorily conclude he draw a arm-chair up to the fire stir the coal into a blaze arrange the table and lamp to he satisfaction for reading and then prepared surreptitiously to watch the animal he wish to observe they carefully without they be aware of it now in spite of they respective age it be the regular custom of these two to play together every night before sleep smoke always make the advance begin with grave impudence to pat the dog 's tail and flame play cumbrously with condescension it be he duty rather than pleasure he be glad when it be over and sometimes he be very determine and refuse to play at all and this night be one of the occasion on which he be firm the doctor look cautiously over the top of he book watch the cat begin the performance it start by gaze with a innocent expression at the dog where he lay with nose on paw and eye wide open in the middle of the floor then it get up and make as though it mean to walk to the door go deliberately and very softly flame 's eye follow it until it be beyond the range of sight and then the cat turn sharply and begin pat he tail tentatively with one paw the tail move slightly in reply and smoke change paw and tap it again the dog however do not rise to play as be he wont and the cat fall to parting it briskly with both paw flame still lay motionless this puzzle and bore the cat and it go round and stare hard into its friend 's face to see what be the matter perhaps some inarticulate message flash from the dog 's eye into its own little brain make it understand that the program for the night have better not begin with play perhaps it only realize that its friend be immovable but whatever the reason its usual persistence thenceforward desert it and it make no further attempt at persuasion smoke yield at once to the dog 's mood it sit down where it be and begin to wash but the wash the doctor note be by no mean its real purpose it only use it to mask something else it stop at the most busy and furious moment and begin to stare about the room its thought wander absurdly it peer intently at the curtain at the shadowy corner at empty space above leave its body in curiously awkward position for whole minute together then it turn sharply and stare with a sudden signal of intelligence at the dog and flame at once rise somewhat stiffly to he foot and begin to wander aimlessly and restlessly to and fro about the floor smoke follow he padding quietly at he heel between they they make what seem to be a deliberate search of the room and here as he watch they note carefully every detail of the performance over the top of he book yet make no effort to interfere it seem to the doctor that the first beginning of a faint distress betray themselves in the collie and in the cat the stirring of a vague excitement he observe they closely the fog be thick in the air and the tobacco smoke from he pipe add to its density the furniture at the far end stand mistily and where the shadow congregate in hang cloud under the ceiling it be difficult to see clearly at all the lamplight only reach to a level of five foot from the floor above which come layer of comparative darkness so that the room appear twice as lofty as it actually be by means of the lamp and the fire however the carpet be everywhere clearly visible the animal make they silent tour of the floor sometimes the dog lead sometimes the cat occasionally they look at one another as though exchange signal and once or twice in spite of the limited space he lose sight of one or other among the fog and the shadow they curiosity it appear to he be something more than the excitement lurk in the unknown territory of a strange room yet so far it be impossible to test this and he purposely keep he mind quietly receptive lest the smallest mental excitement on he part should communicate itself to the animal and thus destroy the value of they independent behavior they make a very thorough journey leave no piece of furniture unexamined or unsmelt flame lead the way walk slowly with lowered head and smoke follow demurely at he heel make a transparent pretence of not be interested yet miss nothing and at length they return the old collie first and come to rest on the mat before the fire flame rest he muzzle on he master 's knee smile beatifically while he pat the yellow head and speak he name and smoke come a little later pretend he come by chance look from the empty saucer to he face lap up the milk when it be give he to the last drop and then spring upon he knee and curl round for the sleep it have fully earn and intend to enjoy silence descend upon the room only the breathing of the dog upon the mat come through the deep stillness like the pulse of time mark the minute and the steady drip drip of the fog outside upon the window-ledge dismally testify to the inclemency of the night beyond and the soft crashing of the coal as the fire settle down into the grate become less and less audible as the fire sink and the flame resign they fierceness it be now well after eleven o'clock and dr silence devoted himself again to he book he read the word on the print page and take in they meaning superficially yet without start into life the correlation of thought and suggestion that should accompany interesting reading underneath all the while he mental energy be absorb in watch listen wait for what might come he be not over-sanguine himself yet he do not wish to be take by surprise moreover the animal he sensitive barometer have incontinently go to sleep after read a dozen page however he realize that he mind be really occupy in review the feature of pender 's extraordinary story and that it be no longer necessary to steady he imagination by study the dull paragraph detail in the page before he he lay down he book accordingly and allow he thought to dwell upon the feature of the case speculation as to the meaning however he rigorously suppress know that such thought would act upon he imagination like wind upon the glowing ember of a fire as the night wear on the silence grow deeper and deeper and only at rare interval he hear the sound of wheel on the main road a hundred yard away where the horse go at a walk pace owe to the density of the fog the echo of pedestrian footstep no longer reach he the clamor of occasional voice no longer come down the side street the night muffle by fog shroud by veil of ultimate mystery hang about the haunt villa like a doom nothing in the house stir stillness in a thick blanket lay over the upper storey only the mist in the room grow more dense he think and the damp cold more penetrate certainly from time to time he shiver the collie now deep in slumber move occasionally -- grunt sigh or twitch he leg in dream smoke lay on he knee a pool of warm black fur only the closest observation detect the movement of he sleek side it be difficult to distinguish exactly where he head and body join in that circle of glisten hair only a black satin nose and a tiny tip of pink tongue betray the secret dr silence watch he and feel comfortable the collie 's breathing be soothing the fire be well build and would burn for another two hour without attention he be not conscious of the least nervousness he particularly wish to remain in he ordinary and normal state of mind and to force nothing if sleep come naturally he would let it come -- and even welcome it the coldness of the room when the fire die down later would be sure to wake he again and it would then be time enough to carry these sleep barometer up to bed from various psychic premonition he know quite well that the night would not pass without adventure but he do not wish to force its arrival and he wish to remain normal and let the animal remain normal so that when it come it would be unattended by excitement or by any strain of the attention many experiment have make he wise and for the rest he have no fear accordingly after a time he do fall asleep as he have expect and the last thing he remember before oblivion slip up over he eye like soft wool be the picture of flame stretch all four leg at once and sigh noisily as he seek a more comfortable position for he paw and muzzle upon the mat \* \* \* \* \* it be a good deal later when he become aware that a weight lay upon he chest and that something be pencil over he face and mouth a soft touch on the cheek wake he something be pat he he sit up with a jerk and find himself stare straight into a pair of brilliant eye half green half black smoke 's face lay level with he own and the cat have climb up with its front paw upon he chest the lamp have burn low and the fire be nearly out yet dr silence saw in a moment that the cat be in a excited state it knead with its front paw into he chest shift from one to the other he feel they prod against he it lift a leg very carefully and pat he cheek gingerly its fur he see be stand ridgewise upon its back the ear be flatten back somewhat the tail be switch sharply the cat of course have waken he with a purpose and the instant he realize this he set it upon the arm of the chair and spring up with a quick turn to face the empty room behind he by some curious instinct he arm of they own accord assume a attitude of defense in front of he as though to ward off something that threaten he safety yet nothing be visible only shape of fog hang about rather heavily in the air move slightly to and fro he mind be now fully alert and the last vestige of sleep go he turn the lamp higher and peer about he two thing he become aware of at once : one that smoke while excite be _ pleasurably _ excite the other that the collie be no longer visible upon the mat at he foot he have creep away to the corner of the wall farthest from the window and lay watch the room with wide-open eye in which lurk plainly something of alarm something in the dog 's behavior instantly strike dr silence as unusual and call he by name he move across to pat he flame get up wag he tail and come over slowly to the rug utter a low sound that be half growl half whine he be evidently perturb about something and he master be proceed to administer comfort when he attention be suddenly draw to the antic of he other four-footed companion the cat and what he see fill he with something like amazement smoke have jump down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupy the middle of the carpet where with tail erect and leg stiff as ramrod it be steadily pacing backwards and forwards in a narrow space utter as it do so those curious little guttural sound of pleasure that only a animal of the feline species know how to make expressive of supreme happiness its stiffened leg and arch back make it appear larger than usual and the black visage wear a smile of beatific joy its eye blaze magnificently it be in a ecstasy at the end of every few pace it turn sharply and stalk back again along the same line padding softly and purr like a roll of little muffle drum it behave precisely as though it be rub against the ankle of some one who remain invisible a thrill run down the doctor 's spine as he stand and stare he experiment be grow interesting at last he call the collie 's attention to he friend 's performance to see whether he too be aware of anything stand there upon the carpet and the dog 's behavior be significant and corroborative he come as far as he master 's knee and then stop dead refusing to investigate closely in vain dr silence urge he he wag he tail whine a little and stand in a half-crouching attitude stare alternately at the cat and at he master 's face he be apparently both puzzle and alarm and the whine go deeper and deeper down into he throat till it change into a ugly snarl of awaken anger then the doctor call to he in a tone of command he have never know to be disregard but still the dog though spring up in response decline to move nearer he make tentative motion prance a little like a dog about to take to water pretend to bark and run to and fro on the carpet so far there be no actual fear in he manner but he be uneasy and anxious and nothing would induce he to go within touch distance of the walk cat once he make a complete circuit but always carefully out of reach and in the end he return to he master 's leg and rub vigorously against he flame do not like the performance at all : that much be quite clear for several minute john silence watch the performance of the cat with profound attention and without interfere then he call to the animal by name smoke you mysterious beastie what in the world be you about he say in a coax tone the cat look up at he for a moment smile in its ecstasy blinking its eye but too happy to pause he speak to it again he call to it several time and each time it turn upon he its blaze eye drunk with inner delight opening and shut its lip its body large and rigid with excitement yet it never for one instant pause in its short journey to and fro he note exactly what it do : it walk he see the same number of pace each time some six or seven step and then it turn sharply and retrace they by the pattern of the great rose in the carpet he measure it it keep to the same direction and the same line it behave precisely as though it be rub against something solid undoubtedly there be something standing there on that strip of carpet something invisible to the doctor something that alarm the dog yet cause the cat unspeakable pleasure smokie he call again smokie you black mystery what be it excite you so again the cat look up at he for a brief second and then continue its sentry-walk blissfully happy intensely preoccupy and for a instant as he watch it the doctor be aware that a faint uneasiness stir in the depths of he own be focus itself for the moment upon this curious behavior of the uncanny creature before he there rise in he quite a new realisation of the mystery connect with the whole feline tribe but especially with that common member of it the domestic cat -- they hide life they strange aloofness they incalculable subtlety how utterly remote from anything that human being understand lay the source of they elusive activity as he watch the indescribable bearing of the little creature mince along the strip of carpet under he eye coquet with the power of darkness welcome maybe some fearsome visitor there stir in he heart a feeling strangely akin to awe its indifference to human kind its serene superiority to the obvious strike he forcibly with fresh meaning so remote so inaccessible seem the secret purpose of its real life so alien to the blundering honesty of other animal its absolute poise of bear bring into he mind the opium-eater 's word that no dignity be perfect which do not at some point ally itself with the mysterious and he become suddenly aware that the presence of the dog in this foggy haunted room on the top of putney hill be uncommonly welcome to he he be glad to feel that flame 's dependable personality be with he the savage growl at he heel be a pleasant sound he be glad to hear it that march cat make he uneasy finding that smoke pay no further attention to he word the doctor decide upon action would it rub against he leg too he would take it by surprise and see he step quickly forward and place himself upon the exact strip of carpet where it walk but no cat be ever take by surprise the moment he occupy the space of the intruder set he foot on the weave rose midway in the line of travel smoke suddenly stop purr and sit down if lift up its face with the most innocent stare imaginable of its green eye he could have swear it laugh it be a perfect child again in a single second it have resume its simple domestic manner and it gaze at he in such a way that he almost feel smoke be the normal being and _ he _ be the eccentric behavior that be be watch it be consummate the manner in which it bring about this change so easily and so quickly superb little actor he laugh in spite of himself and stoop to stroke the shine black back but in a flash as he touch its fur the cat turn and spit at he viciously striking at he hand with one paw then with a hurry scutter of foot it shoot like a shadow across the floor and a moment later be calmly sit over by the window-curtain wash its face as though nothing interested it in the whole world but the cleanness of its cheek and whisker john silence straighten himself up and draw a long breath he realize that the performance be temporarily at a end the collie meanwhile who have watch the whole proceeding with marked disapproval have now lie down again upon the mat by the fire no longer growl it seem to the doctor just as though something that have enter the room while he sleep alarming the dog yet bring happiness to the cat have now go out again leave all as it be before whatever it be that excite its blissful attention have retreat for the moment he realize this intuitively smoke evidently realize it too for presently he deign to march back to the fireplace and jump upon he master 's knee dr silence patient and determine settle down once more to he book the animal soon sleep the fire blaze cheerfully and the cold fog from outside pour into the room through every available chink and crannie for a long time silence and peace reign in the room and dr silence avail himself of the quietness to make careful note of what have happen he enter for future use in other case a exhaustive analysis of what he have observe especially with regard to the effect upon the two animal it be impossible here nor would it be intelligible to the reader unversed in the knowledge of the region know to a scientifically train psychic like dr silence to detail these observation but to he it be clear up to a certain point -- for the rest he must still wait and watch so far at least he realize that while he sleep in the chair -- that be while he will be dormant -- the room have suffer intrusion from what he recognize as a intensely active force and might later be force to acknowledge as something more than merely a blind force namely a distinct personality so far it have affect himself scarcely at all but have act directly upon the simpler organism of the animal it stimulate keenly the centre of the cat 's psychic being induce a state of instant happiness -lrb- intensify its consciousness probably in the same way a drug or stimulant intensify that of a human being -rrb- whereas it alarm the less sensitive dog cause it to feel a vague apprehension and distress he own sudden action and exhibition of energy have serve to disperse it temporarily yet he feel convinced -- the indication be not lack even while he sit there make note -- that it still remain near to he conditionally if not spatially and be as it be gather force for a second attack and further he intuitively understand that the relation between the two animal have undergo a subtle change : that the cat have become immeasurably superior confident sure of itself in its own peculiar region whereas flame have be weaken by a attack he could not comprehend and know not how to reply to though not yet afraid he be defiant -- ready to act against a fear that he feel to be approach he be no longer fatherly and protective towards the cat smoke hold the key to the situation and both he and the cat know it thus as the minute pass john silence sit and wait keenly on the alert wonder how soon the attack would be renew and at what point it would be divert from the animal and direct upon himself the book lay on the floor beside he he note be complete with one hand on the cat 's fur and the dog 's front paw rest against he foot the three of they doze comfortably before the hot fire while the night wear on and the silence deepen towards midnight it be well after one o'clock in the morning when dr silence turn the lamp out and light the candle preparatory to go up to bed then smoke suddenly wake with a loud sharp purr and sit up it neither stretch wash nor turn : it listen and the doctor watch it realize that a certain indefinable change have come about that very moment in the room a swift readjustment of the force within the four wall have take place -- a new disposition of they personal equation the balance be destroy the former harmony go smoke most sensitive of barometer have be the first to feel it but the dog be not slow to follow suit for on look down he note that flame be no longer asleep he be lie with eye wide open and that same instant he sit up on he great haunch and begin to growl dr silence be in the act of take the match to re-light the lamp when a audible movement in the room behind he make he pause smoke leap down from he knee and move forward a few pace across the carpet then it stop and stare fixedly and the doctor stand up on the rug to watch as he rise the sound be repeat and he discover that it be not in the room as he first think but outside and that it come from more direction than one there be a rush sweeping noise against the window-pane and simultaneously a sound of something brushing against the door -- out in the hall smoke advance sedately across the carpet twitch he tail and sit down within a foot of the door the influence that have destroy the harmonious condition of the room have apparently move in advance of its cause clearly something be about to happen for the first time that night john silence hesitate the thought of that dark narrow hall-way choke with fog and destitute of human comfort be unpleasant he become aware of a faint creep of he flesh he know of course that the actual opening of the door be not necessary to the invasion of the room that be about to take place since neither door nor window nor any other solid barrier could interpose a obstacle to what be seek entrance yet the opening of the door would be significant and symbolic and he distinctly shrink from it but for a moment only smoke turn with a show of impatience recall he to he purpose and he move past the sit watch creature and deliberately open the door to its full width what subsequently happen happen in the feeble and flickering light of the solitary candle on the mantlepiece through the open door he see the hall dimly light and thick with fog nothing of course be visible -- nothing but the hat-stand the african spear in dark line upon the wall and the high-backed wooden chair standing grotesquely underneath on the oilcloth floor for one instant the fog seem to move and thicken oddly but he set that down to the score of the imagination the door have open upon nothing yet smoke apparently think otherwise and the deep growl of the collie from the mat at the back of the room seem to confirm he judgment for proud and self-possessed the cat have again rise to he foot and have advance to the door be now usher some one slowly into the room nothing could have be more evident he pace from side to side bow he little head with great _ empressement _ and hold he stiffened tail aloft like a flag-staff he turn this way and that mince to and fro and show sign of supreme satisfaction he be in he element he welcome the intrusion and apparently reckon that he companion the doctor and the dog would welcome it likewise the intruder have return for a second attack dr silence move slowly backwards and take up he position on the hearthrug key himself up to a condition of concentrated attention he note that flame stand beside he face the room with body motionless and head move swiftly from side to side with a curious sway movement he eye be wide open he back rigid he neck and jaw thrust forward he leg tense and ready to leap savage ready for attack or defense yet dreadfully puzzle and perhaps already a little cowed he stand and stare the hair on he spine and side positively bristle outwards as though a wind play through it in the dim firelight he look like a great yellow-haired wolf silent eye shoot dark fire exceedingly formidable it be flame the terrible smoke meanwhile advance from the door towards the middle of the room adopt the very slow pace of a invisible companion a few foot away it stop and begin to smile and blink its eye there be something deliberately coax in its attitude as it stand there undecided on the carpet clearly wish to effect some sort of introduction between the intruder and its canine friend and ally it assume its most winning manners purr smile look persuasively from one to the other and make quick tentative step first in one direction and then in the other there have always exist such perfect understanding between they in everything surely flame would appreciate smoke 's intention now and acquiesce but the old collie make no advance he bare he tooth lift he lip till the gum show and stand stockstill with fix eye and heave side the doctor move a little farther back watch intently the smallest movement and it be just then he divine suddenly from the cat 's behavior and attitude that it be not only a single companion it have usher into the room but _ several _ it keep cross over from one to the other look up at each in turn it seek to win over the dog to friendliness with they all the original intruder have come back with reinforcement and at the same time he further realize that the intruder be something more than a blindly act force impersonal though destructive it be a personality and moreover a great personality and it be accompany for the purpose of assistance by a host of other personality minor in degree but similar in kind he brace himself in the corner against the mantelpiece and wait he whole be rouse to defense for he be now fully aware that the attack have spread to include himself as well as the animal and he must be on the alert he strain he eye through the foggy atmosphere try in vain to see what the cat and dog see but the candlelight throw a uncertain and flickering light across the room and he eye discern nothing on the floor smoke move softly in front of he like a black shadow he eye gleam as he turn he head still try with many insinuate gesture and much purr to bring about the introduction he desire but it be all in vain flame stand rivet to one spot motionless as a figure carve in stone some minute pass during which only the cat move and then there come a sharp change flame begin to back towards the wall he move he head from side to side as he go sometimes turn to snap at something almost behind he they be advance upon he try to surround he he distress become very mark from now onward and it seem to the doctor that he anger merge into genuine terror and become overwhelm by it the savage growl sound perilously like a whine and more than once he try to dive past he master 's leg as though hunting for a way of escape he be try to avoid something that everywhere block the way this terror of the indomitable fighter impress the doctor enormously yet also painfully stir he impatience for he have never before see the dog show sign of give in and it distressed he to witness it he know however that he be not give in easily and understand that it be really impossible for he to gauge the animal 's sensation properly at all what flame feel and see must be terrible indeed to turn he all at once into a coward he face something that make he afraid of more than he life merely the doctor speak a few quick word of encouragement to he and stroke the bristling hair but without much success the collie seem already beyond the reach of comfort such as that and the collapse of the old dog follow indeed very speedily after this and smoke meanwhile remain behind watch the advance but not join in it sit pleased and expectant consider that all be go well and as it wish it be knead on the carpet with its front paw -- slowly laboriously as though its foot be dip in treacle the sound its claw make as they catch in the thread be distinctly audible it be still smile blinking purr suddenly the collie utter a poignant short bark and leap heavily to one side he bared tooth trace a line of whiteness through the gloom the next instant he dash past he master 's leg almost upset he balance and shoot out into the room where he go blunder wildly against wall and furniture but that bark be significant the doctor have hear it before and know what it mean : for it be the cry of the fighter against odds and it mean that the old beast have find he courage again possibly it be only the courage of despair but at any rate the fighting would be terrific and dr silence understand too that he dare not interfere flame must fight he own enemy in he own way but the cat too have hear that dreadful bark and it too have understand this be more than it have bargain for across the dim shadow of that haunt room there must have pass some secret signal of distress between the animal smoke stand up and look swiftly about he he utter a piteous meow and trot smartly away into the greater darkness by the window what he object be only those endowed with the spirit-like intelligence of cat might know but at any rate he have at last range himself on the side of he friend and the little beast mean business at the same moment the collie manage to gain the door the doctor see he rush through into the hall like a flash of yellow light he shoot across the oilcloth and tear up the stair but in another second he appear again fly down the step and landing at the bottom in a tumble heap whining cringe terrify the doctor see he slink back into the room again and crawl round by the wall towards the cat be then even the staircase occupy do _ they _ stand also in the hall be the whole house crowd from floor to ceiling the thought come to add to the keen distress he feel at the sight of the collie 's discomfiture and indeed he own personal distress have increase in a marked degree during the past minute and continue to increase steadily to the climax he recognize that the drain on he own vitality grow steadily and that the attack be now direct against himself even more than against the defeat dog and the too much deceive cat it all seem so rapid and uncalculated after that -- the event that take place in this little modern room at the top of putney hill between midnight and sunrise -- that dr silence be hardly able to follow and remember it all it come about with such uncanny swiftness and terror the light be so uncertain the movement of the black cat so difficult to follow on the dark carpet and the doctor himself so weary and take by surprise -- that he find it almost impossible to observe accurately or to recall afterwards precisely what it be he have see or in what order the incident have take place he never could understand what defect of vision on he part make it seem as though the cat have duplicated itself at first and then increase indefinitely so that there be at least a dozen of they dart silently about the floor leap softly on to chair and table pass like shadow from the open door to the end of the room all black as sin with brilliant green eye flash fire in all direction it be like the reflection from a score of mirror place round the wall at different angle nor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seem to have alter grow much larger and why it extend away behind he where ordinarily the wall should have be the snarl of the enraged and terrify collie sound sometimes so far away the ceiling seem to have raise itself so much higher than before and much of the furniture have change in appearance and shift marvellously it be all so confused and confusing as though the little room he know have become merged and transform into the dimension of quite another chamber that come to he with its host of cat and its strange distance in a sort of vision but these change come about a little later and at a time when he attention be so concentrated upon the proceedings of smoke and the collie that he only observe they as it be subconsciously and the excitement the flicker candlelight the distress he feel for the collie and the distort atmosphere of fog be the poorest possible ally to careful observation at first he be only aware that the dog be repeat he short dangerous bark from time to time snap viciously at the empty air a foot or so from the ground once indeed he spring upward and forwards work furiously with tooth and paw and with a noise like wolf fight but only to dash back the next minute against the wall behind he then after lie still for a bit he rise to a crouching position as though to spring again snarl horribly and make short half-circle with lowered head and smoke all the while meow piteously by the window as though try to draw the attack upon himself then it be that the rush of the whole dreadful business seem to turn aside from the dog and direct itself upon he own person the collie have make another spring and fall back with a crash into the corner where he make noise enough in he savage rage to waken the dead before he fall to whine and then finally lay still and directly afterwards the doctor 's own distress become intolerably acute he have make a half movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that be denser than mere fog seem to drop down over the scene drape room wall animal and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also about he own mind other form move silently across the field of vision form that he recognize from previous experiment and welcome not unholy thought begin to crowd into he brain sinister suggestion of evil present themselves seductively ice seem to settle about he heart and he mind tremble he begin to lose memory -- memory of he identity of where he be of what he ought to do the very foundation of he strength be shake he will seem paralyse and it be then that the room fill with this horde of cat all dark as the night all silent all with lamp eye of green fire the dimension of the place altered and shift he be in a much larger space the whining of the dog sound far away and all about he the cat fly busily to and fro silently play they tear rush game of evil weave the pattern of they dark purpose upon the floor he strive hard to collect himself and remember the word of power he have make use of before in similar dread position where he dangerous practice have sometimes lead but he could recall nothing consecutively a mist lay over he mind and memory he feel dazed and he force scatter the deep within be too trouble for healing power to come out of they it be glamour of course he realize afterwards the strong glamour throw upon he imagination by some powerful personality behind the veil but at the time he be not sufficiently aware of this and as with all true glamour be unable to grasp where the true end and the false begin he be catch momentarily in the same vortex that have seek to lure the cat to destruction through its delight and threaten utterly to overwhelm the dog through its terror there come a sound in the chimney behind he like wind booming and tear its way down the window rattle the candle flicker and go out the glacial atmosphere close round he with the cold of death and a great rush sound sweep by overhead as though the ceiling have lift to a great height he hear the door shut far away it sound he feel lose shelterless in the depths of he soul yet still he hold out and resist while the climax of the fight come nearer and nearer he have step into the stream of force awaken by pender and he know that he must withstand they to the end or come to a conclusion that it be not good for a man to come to something from the region of utter cold be upon he and then quite suddenly through the confused mist about he there slowly rise up the personality that have be all the time direct the battle some force enter he be that shake he as the tempest shake a leaf and close against he eye -- clean level with he face -- he find himself stare into the wreck of a vast dark countenance a countenance that be terrible even in its ruin for ruin it be and terrible it be and the mark of spiritual evil be brand everywhere upon its broken feature eye face and hair rise level with he own and for a space of time he never could properly measure or determine these two a man and a woman look straight into each other 's visage and down into each other 's heart and john silence the soul with the good unselfish motive hold he own against the dark discarnate woman whose motive be pure evil and whose soul be on the side of the dark power it be the climax that touch the depth of power within he and begin to restore he slowly to he own he be conscious of course of effort and yet it seem no superhuman one for he have recognize the character of he opponent 's power and he call upon the good within he to meet and overcome it the inner force stir and tremble in response to he call they do not at first come readily as be they habit for under the spell of glamour they have already be diabolically lull into inactivity but come they eventually do rise out of the inner spiritual nature he have learn with so much time and pain to awaken to life and power and confidence come with they he begin to breathe deeply and regularly and at the same time to absorb into himself the force oppose to he and to _ turn they to he own account _ by cease to resist and allow the deadly stream to pour into he unopposed he use the very power supply by he adversary and thus enormously increase he own for this spiritual alchemy he have learn he understand that force ultimately be everywhere one and the same it be the motive behind that make it good or evil and he motive be entirely unselfish he know -- provide he be not first rob of self-control -- how vicariously to absorb these evil radiation into himself and change they magically into he own good purpose and since he motive be pure and he soul fearless they could not work he harm thus he stand in the main stream of evil unwittingly attract by pender deflect its course upon himself and after pass through the purify filter of he own unselfishness these energy could only add to he store of experience of knowledge and therefore of power and as he self-control return to he he gradually accomplish this purpose even though tremble while he do so yet the struggle be severe and in spite of the freezing chill of the air the perspiration pour down he face then by slow degree the dark and dreadful countenance fade the glamour pass from he soul the normal proportion return to wall and ceiling the form melt back into the fog and the whirl of rush shadow-cat disappear whence they come and with the return of the consciousness of he own identity john silence be restore to the full control of he own will-power in a deep modulate voice he begin to utter certain rhythmical sound that slowly roll through the air like a rise sea fill the room with powerful vibratory activity that whelm all irregularity of lesser vibration in its own swell tone he make certain sigil gesture and movement at the same time for several minute he continue to utter these word until at length the grow volume dominate the whole room and master the manifestation of all that oppose it for just as he understand the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil force by raise they into higher channel so he know from long study the occult use of sound and its direct effect upon the plastic region wherein the power of spiritual evil work they fall purpose harmony be restore first of all to he own soul and thence to the room and all its occupant and after himself the first to recognize it be the old dog lie in he corner flame begin suddenly utter sound of pleasure that something between a growl and a grunt that dog make upon be restore to they master 's confidence dr silence hear the thumping of the collie 's tail against the floor and the grunt and the thump touch the depth of affection in the man 's heart and give he some inkling of what agony the dumb creature have suffer next from the shadow by the window a somewhat shrill purr announce the restoration of the cat to its normal state smoke be advance across the carpet he seem very pleased with himself and smile with a expression of supreme innocence he be no shadow-cat but real and full of he usual and perfect self-possession he march along pick he way delicately but with a stately dignity that suggest he ancestry with the majesty of egypt he eye no longer glare they shine steadily before he they radiate not excitement but knowledge clearly he be anxious to make amends for the mischief to which he have unwittingly lend himself owe to he subtle and electric constitution still utter he sharp high purring he march up to he master and rub vigorously against he leg then he stand on he hind foot and paw he knee and stare beseechingly up into he face he turn he head towards the corner where the collie still lay thump he tail feebly and pathetically john silence understand he bent down and stroke the creature 's living fur note the line of bright blue spark that follow the motion of he hand down its back and then they advance together towards the corner where the dog be smoke go first and put he nose gently against he friend 's muzzle purr while he rub and utter little soft sound of affection in he throat the doctor light the candle and bring it over he see the collie lie on its side against the wall it be utterly exhaust and foam still hang about its jaw its tail and eye respond to the sound of its name but it be evidently very weak and overcome smoke continue to rub against its cheek and nose and eye sometimes even stand on its body and knead into the thick yellow hair flame reply from time to time by little lick of the tongue most of they curiously misdirect but dr silence feel intuitively that something disastrous have happen and he heart be wring he stroke the dear body feeling it over for bruise or broken bone but find none he feed it with what remain of the sandwich and milk but the creature clumsily upset the saucer and lose the sandwich between its paw so that the doctor have to feed it with he own hand and all the while smoke meow piteously then john silence begin to understand he go across to the farther side of the room and call aloud to it flame old man come at any other time the dog would have be upon he in a instant bark and leap to the shoulder and even now he get up though heavily and awkwardly to he foot he start to run wag he tail more briskly he collide first with a chair and then run straight into a table smoke trot close at he side try he very best to guide he but it be useless dr silence have to lift he up into he own arm and carry he like a baby for he be blind iii it be a week later when john silence call to see the author in he new house and find he well on the way to recovery and already busy again with he write the haunt look have leave he eye and he seem cheerful and confident humor restore laugh the doctor as soon as they be comfortably settle in the room overlook the park i have have no trouble since i leave that dreadful place return pender gratefully and thanks to you -- the doctor stop he with a gesture never mind that he say we 'll discuss you new plan afterwards and my scheme for relieve you of the house and help you settle elsewhere of course it must be pull down for it be not fit for any sensitive person to live in and any other tenant might be afflict in the same way you be although personally i think the evil have exhaust itself by now he tell the astonished author something of he experience in it with the animal i do not pretend to understand pender say when the account be finish but i and my wife be intensely relieve to be free of it all only i must say i should like to know something of the former history of the house when we take it six month ago i hear no word against it dr silence draw a typewritten paper from he pocket i can satisfy you curiosity to some extent he say run he eye over the sheet and then replace they in he coat for by my secretary 's investigation i have be able to check certain information obtain in the hypnotic trance by a ` sensitive ' who help I in such case the former occupant who haunt you appear to have be a woman of singularly atrocious life and character who finally suffer death by hang after a series of crime that appal the whole of england and only come to light by the merest chance she come to she end in the year 1798 for it be not this particular house she live in but a much larger one that then stand upon the site it now occupy and be then of course not in london but in the country she be a person of intellect possess of a powerful train will and of consummate audacity and i be convinced avail herself of the resource of the lower magic to attain she end this go far to explain the virulence of the attack upon yourself and why she be still able to carry on after death the evil practice that form she main purpose during life you think that after death a soul can still consciously direct -- gasp the author i think as i tell you before that the force of a powerful personality may still persist after death in the line of they original momentum reply the doctor and that strong thought and purpose can still react upon suitably prepared brain long after they originator have pass away if you know anything of magic he pursue you would know that thought be dynamic and that it may call into existence form and picture that may well exist for hundred of year for not far remove from the region of we human life be another region where float the waste and drift of all the century the limbo of the shell of the dead a densely populated region cram with horror and abomination of all description and sometimes galvanise into active life again by the will of a trained manipulator a mind verse in the practice of lower magic that this woman understand its vile commerce i be persuade and the force she set go during she life have simply be accumulate ever since and would have continue to do so have they not be draw down upon yourself and afterwards discharge and satisfy through I anything might have bring down the attack for besides drug there be certain violent emotion certain mood of the soul certain spiritual fever if i may so call they which directly open the inner be to a cognisance of this astral region i have mention in you case it happen to be a peculiarly potent drug that do it but now tell I he add after a pause hand to the perplexed author a pencil draw he have make of the dark countenance that have appear to he during the night on putney hill -- tell I if you recognize this face pender look at the draw closely greatly astonish he shudder a little as he look undoubtedly he say it be the face i keep try to draw -- dark with the great mouth and jaw and the drooping eye that be the woman dr silence then produce from he pocket-book a old-fashioned woodcut of the same person which he secretary have unearth from the record of the newgate calendar the woodcut and the pencil drawing be two different aspect of the same dreadful visage the man compare they for some moment in silence it make I thank god for the limitation of we sens say pender quietly with a sigh continuous clairvoyance must be a sore affliction it be indeed return john silence significantly and if all the people nowadays who claim to be clairvoyant be really so the statistics of suicide and lunacy would be considerably higher than they be it be little wonder he add that you sense of humor be cloud with the mind-force of that dead monster try to use you brain for they dissemination you have have a interesting adventure mr felix pender and let I add a fortunate escape the author be about to renew he thanks when there come a sound of scratch at the door and the doctor spring up quickly it be time for I to go i leave my dog on the step but i suppose -- before he have time to open the door it have yield to the pressure behind it and fly wide open to admit a great yellow-haired collie the dog wag he tail and contort he whole body with delight tear across the floor and try to leap up upon he owner 's breast and there be laughter and happiness in the old eye for they be clear again as the day case ii : ancient sorcery i there be it would appear certain wholly unremarkable person with none of the characteristic that invite adventure who yet once or twice in the course of they smooth life undergo a experience so strange that the world catch its breath -- and look the other way and it be case of this kind perhaps more than any other that fall into the wide-spread net of john silence the psychic doctor and appeal to he deep humanity to he patience and to he great quality of spiritual sympathy lead often to the revelation of problem of the strangest complexity and of the profoundest possible human interest matter that seem almost too curious and fantastic for belief he love to trace to they hidden source to unravel a tangle in the very soul of thing -- and to release a suffer human soul in the process -- be with he a veritable passion and the knot he untie be indeed after pass strange the world of course ask for some plausible basis to which it can attach credence -- something it can at least pretend to explain the adventurous type it can understand : such people carry about with they a adequate explanation of they exciting life and they character obviously drive they into the circumstance which produce the adventure it expect nothing else from they and be satisfied but dull ordinary folk have no right to out-of-the-way experience and the world have be lead to expect otherwise be disappoint with they not to say shocked its complacent judgment have be rudely disturbed such a thing happen to _ that _ man it cry -- a commonplace person like that it be too absurd there must be something wrong yet there could be no question that something do actually happen to little arthur vezin something of the curious nature he describe to dr silence outwardly or inwardly it happen beyond a doubt and in spite of the jeer of he few friend who hear the tale and observe wisely that such a thing might perhaps have come to iszard that crack-brained iszard or to that odd fish minskus but it could never have happen to commonplace little vezin who be fore-ordained to live and die accord to scale but whatever he method of death be vezin certainly do not live accord to scale so far as this particular event in he otherwise uneventful life be concerned and to hear he recount it and watch he pale delicate feature change and hear he voice grow softer and more hushed as he proceed be to know the conviction that he halt word perhaps fail sometimes to convey he live the thing over again each time he tell it he whole personality become muffle in the recital it subdue he more than ever so that the tale become a lengthy apology for a experience that he deprecate he appear to excuse himself and ask you pardon for have dare to take part in so fantastic a episode for little vezin be a timid gentle sensitive soul rarely able to assert himself tender to man and beast and almost constitutionally unable to say no or to claim many thing that should rightly have be he he whole scheme of life seem utterly remote from anything more exciting than miss a train or lose a umbrella on a omnibus and when this curious event come upon he he be already more year beyond forty than he friend suspect or he care to admit john silence who hear he speak of he experience more than once say that he sometimes leave out certain detail and put in other yet they be all obviously true the whole scene be unforgettably cinematograph on to he mind none of the detail be imagine or invent and when he tell the story with they all complete the effect be undeniable he appealing brown eye shine and much of the charming personality usually so carefully repress come forward and reveal itself he modesty be always there of course but in the tell he forget the present and allow himself to appear almost vividly as he live again in the past of he adventure he be on the way home when it happen cross northern france from some mountain trip or other where he bury himself solitary-wise every summer he have nothing but a unregistered bag in the rack and the train be jam to suffocation most of the passenger be unredeemed holiday english he dislike they not because they be he fellow-countryman but because they be noisy and obtrusive obliterate with they big limb and tweed clothing all the quieter tint of the day that bring he satisfaction and enable he to melt into insignificance and forget that he be anybody these english clash about he like a brass band make he feel vaguely that he ought to be more self-assertive and obstreperous and that he do not claim insistently enough all kind of thing that he do not want and that be really valueless such as corner seat window up or down and so forth so that he feel uncomfortable in the train and wish the journey be over and he be back again live with he unmarried sister in surbiton and when the train stop for ten panting minute at the little station in northern france and he get out to stretch he leg on the platform and see to he dismay a further batch of the british isle debouch from another train it suddenly seem impossible to he to continue the journey even _ he _ flabby soul revolt and the idea of stay a night in the little town and go on next day by a slower emptier train flash into he mind the guard be already shout _ en voiture _ and the corridor of he compartment be already pack when the thought come to he and for once he act with decision and rush to snatch he bag find the corridor and step impassable he tap at the window -lrb- for he have a corner seat -rrb- and beg the frenchman who sit opposite to hand he luggage out to he explain in he wretched french that he intend to break the journey there and this elderly frenchman he declare give he a look half of warn half of reproach that to he die day he could never forget hand the bag through the window of the move train and at the same time pour into he ear a long sentence speak rapidly and low of which he be able to comprehend only the last few word : _  cause du sommeil et  cause des chat _ in reply to dr silence whose singular psychic acuteness at once seize upon this frenchman as a vital point in the adventure vezin admit that the man have impressed he favourably from the begin though without be able to explain why they have sit face one another during the four hour of the journey and though no conversation have pass between they -- vezin be timid about he stuttering french -- he confess that he eye be be continually draw to he face almost he feel to rudeness and that each by a dozen nameless little politeness and attention have evince the desire to be kind the man like each other and they personality do not clash or would not have clash have they chance to come to term of acquaintance the frenchman indeed seem to have exercise a silent protective influence over the insignificant little englishman and without word or gesture betray that he wish he well and would gladly have be of service to he and this sentence that he hurl at you after the bag ask john silence smile that peculiarly sympathetic smile that always melt the prejudice of he patient be you unable to follow it exactly it be so quick and low and vehement explain vezin in he small voice that i miss practically the whole of it i only catch the few word at the very end because he speak they so clearly and he face be bent down out of the carriage window so near to mine ' _  cause du sommeil et  cause des chat ' _ repeat dr silence as though half speak to himself that be it exactly say vezin which i take it mean something like ` because of sleep and because of the cat ' do not it certainly that be how i should translate it the doctor observe shortly evidently not wish to interrupt more than necessary and the rest of the sentence -- all the first part i could not understand i mean -- be a warning not to do something -- not to stop in the town or at some particular place in the town perhaps that be the impression it make on I then of course the train rush off and leave vezin standing on the platform alone and rather forlorn the little town climb in straggle fashion up a sharp hill rise out of the plain at the back of the station and be crown by the twin tower of the ruin cathedral peeping over the summit from the station itself it look uninteresting and modern but the fact be that the mediaeval position lay out of sight just beyond the crest and once he reach the top and enter the old street he step clean out of modern life into a bygone century the noise and bustle of the crowded train seem day away the spirit of this silent hill-town remote from tourist and motor-car dream its own quiet life under the autumn sun rise up and cast its spell upon he long before he recognize this spell he act under it he walk softly almost on tiptoe down the wind narrow street where the gable all but meet over he head and he enter the doorway of the solitary inn with a deprecate and modest demeanor that be in itself a apology for intrude upon the place and disturb its dream at first however vezin say he notice very little of all this the attempt at analysis come much later what strike he then be only the delightful contrast of the silence and peace after the dust and noisy rattle of the train he feel soothed and stroke like a cat like a cat you say interrupted john silence quickly catch he up yes at the very start i feel that he laugh apologetically i feel as though the warmth and the stillness and the comfort make I purr it seem to be the general mood of the whole place -- then the inn a rambling ancient house the atmosphere of the old coaching day still about it apparently do not welcome he too warmly he feel he be only tolerate he say but it be cheap and comfortable and the delicious cup of afternoon tea he order at once make he feel really very pleased with himself for leave the train in this bold original way for to he it have seem bold and original he feel something of a dog he room too soothe he with its dark panelling and low irregular ceiling and the long sloping passage that lead to it seem the natural pathway to a real chamber of sleep -- a little dim cubby hole out of the world where noise could not enter it look upon the courtyard at the back it be all very charming and make he think of himself as dress in very soft velvet somehow and the floor seem pad the wall provide with cushion the sound of the street could not penetrate there it be a atmosphere of absolute rest that surround he on engage the two-franc room he have interview the only person who seem to be about that sleepy afternoon a elderly waiter with dundreary whisker and a drowsy courtesy who have amble lazily towards he across the stone yard but on come downstairs again for a little promenade in the town before dinner he encounter the proprietress herself she be a large woman whose hand foot and feature seem to swim towards he out of a sea of person they emerge so to speak but she have great dark vivacious eye that counteract the bulk of she body and betray the fact that in reality she be both vigorous and alert when he first catch sight of she she be knit in a low chair against the sunlight of the wall and something at once make he see she as a great tabby cat doze yet awake heavily sleepy and yet at the same time prepare for instantaneous action a great mouser on the watch occur to he she take he in with a single comprehensive glance that be polite without be cordial she neck he notice be extraordinarily supple in spite of its proportion for it turn so easily to follow he and the head it carry bow so very flexibly but when she look at I you know say vezin with that little apologetic smile in he brown eye and that faintly deprecate gesture of the shoulder that be characteristic of he the odd notion come to I that really she have intend to make quite a different movement and that with a single bind she could have leap at I across the width of that stone yard and pounce upon I like some huge cat upon a mouse he laugh a little soft laugh and dr silence make a note in he book without interrupt while vezin proceed in a tone as though he fear he have already tell too much and more than we could believe very soft yet very active she be for all she size and mass and i feel she know what i be do even after i have pass and be behind she back she speak to I and she voice be smooth and run she ask if i have my luggage and be comfortable in my room and then add that dinner be at seven o'clock and that they be very early people in this little country town clearly she intend to convey that late hour be not encouraged evidently she contrived by voice and manner to give he the impression that here he would be manage that everything would be arrange and plan for he and that he have nothing to do but fall into the groove and obey no decide action or sharp personal effort would be look for from he it be the very reverse of the train he walk quietly out into the street feeling soothe and peaceful he realize that he be in a _ milieu _ that suit he and stroke he the right way it be so much easier to be obedient he begin to purr again and to feel that all the town purr with he about the street of that little town he meander gently fall deeper and deeper into the spirit of repose that characterise it with no special aim he wander up and down and to and fro the September sunshine fall slantingly over the roof down wind alleyway fringe with tumble gable and open casement he catch fairylike glimpse of the great plain below and of the meadow and yellow copse lie like a dream-map in the haze the spell of the past hold very potently here he feel the street be full of picturesquely garb man and woman all busy enough go they respective way but no one take any notice of he or turn to stare at he obviously english appearance he be even able to forget that with he tourist appearance he be a false note in a charming picture and he melt more and more into the scene feeling delightfully insignificant and unimportant and unselfconscious it be like become part of a softly color dream which he do not even realize to be a dream on the eastern side the hill fall away more sharply and the plain below run off rather suddenly into a sea of gather shadow in which the little patch of woodland look like island and the stubble field like deep water here he stroll along the old rampart of ancient fortification that once have be formidable but now be only vision-like with they charming mingling of broken gray wall and wayward vine and ivy from the broad coping on which he sit for a moment level with the round top of clip plane tree he see the esplanade far below lie in shadow here and there a yellow sunbeam creep in and lay upon the fall yellow leaf and from the height he look down and see that the townsfolk be walk to and fro in the cool of the evening he could just hear the sound of they slow footfall and the murmur of they voice float up to he through the gap between the tree the figure look like shadow as he catch glimpse of they quiet movement far below he sit there for some time ponder bath in the wave of murmur and half-lost echo that rise to he ear muffle by the leaf of the plane tree the whole town and the little hill out of which it grow as naturally as a ancient wood seem to he like a be lie there half asleep on the plain and croon to itself as it doze and presently as he sit lazily melting into its dream a sound of horn and string and wood instrument rise to he ear and the town band begin to play at the far end of the crowded terrace below to the accompaniment of a very soft deep-throated drum vezin be very sensitive to music know about it intelligently and have even venture unknown to he friend upon the composition of quiet melody with low-running chord which he play to himself with the soft pedal when no one be about and this music float up through the tree from a invisible and doubtless very picturesque band of the townspeople wholly charm he he recognize nothing that they play and it sound as though they be simply improvise without a conductor no definitely marked time run through the piece which end and begin oddly after the fashion of wind through a aeolian harp it be part of the place and scene just as the die sunlight and faintly breathe wind be part of the scene and hour and the mellow note of old-fashioned plaintive horn pierce here and there by the sharper string all half smother by the continuous booming of the deep drum touch he soul with a curiously potent spell that be almost too engrossing to be quite pleasant there be a certain queer sense of bewitchment in it all the music seem to he oddly unartificial it make he think of tree sweep by the wind of night breeze singing among wire and chimney-stack or in the rigging of invisible ship or -- and the simile leap up in he thought with a sudden sharpness of suggestion -- a chorus of animal of wild creature somewhere in desolate place of the world cry and singing as animal will to the moon he could fancy he hear the wail half-human cry of cat upon the tile at night rise and fall with weird interval of sound and this music muffle by distance and the tree make he think of a queer company of these creature on some roof far away in the sky utter they solemn music to one another and the moon in chorus it be he feel at the time a singular image to occur to he yet it express he sensation pictorially better than anything else the instrument play such impossibly odd interval and the crescendo and diminuendo be so very suggestive of cat-land on the tile at night rise swiftly drop without warn to deep note again and all in such strange confusion of discord and accord but at the same time a plaintive sweetness result on the whole and the discord of these half-broken instrument be so singular that they do not distress he musical soul like fiddle out of tune he listen a long time wholly surrender himself as he character be and then stroll homewards in the dusk as the air grow chilly there be nothing to alarm put in dr silence briefly absolutely nothing say vezin but you know it be all so fantastical and charming that my imagination be profoundly impressed perhaps too he continue gently explanatory it be this stir of my imagination that cause other impression for as i walk back the spell of the place begin to steal over I in a dozen way though all intelligible way but there be other thing i could not account for in the least even then incident you mean hardly incident i think a lot of vivid sensation crowd themselves upon my mind and i could trace they to no cause it be just after sunset and the tumbled old building trace magical outline against a opalescent sky of gold and red the dusk be run down the twisted street all round the hill the plain press in like a dim sea its level rise with the darkness the spell of this kind of scene you know can be very move and it be so that night yet i feel that what come to I have nothing directly to do with the mystery and wonder of the scene not merely the subtle transformation of the spirit that come with beauty put in the doctor notice he hesitation exactly vezin go on duly encouraged and no longer so fearful of we smile at he expense the impression come from somewhere else for instance down the busy main street where man and woman be bustling home from work shopping at stall and barrow idly gossip in group and all the rest of it i see that i arouse no interest and that no one turn to stare at I as a foreigner and stranger i be utterly ignore and my presence among they excite no special interest or attention and then quite suddenly it dawn upon I with conviction that all the time this indifference and inattention be merely feigned everybody as a matter of fact be watch I closely every movement i make be know and observe ignore I be all a pretence -- a elaborate pretence he pause a moment and look at we to see if we be smile and then continue reassure -- it be useless to ask I how i notice this because i simply can not explain it but the discovery give I something of a shock before i get back to the inn however another curious thing rise up strongly in my mind and force my recognition of it as true and this too i may as well say at once be equally inexplicable to I i mean i can only give you the fact as fact it be to I the little man leave he chair and stand on the mat before the fire he diffidence lessen from now onwards as he lose himself again in the magic of the old adventure he eye shine a little already as he talk well he go on he soft voice rise somewhat with he excitement i be in a shop when it come to I first -- though the idea must have be at work for a long time subconsciously to appear in so complete a form all at once i be buy sock i think he laugh and struggle with my dreadful french when it strike I that the woman in the shop do not care two pin whether i buy anything or not she be indifferent whether she make a sale or do not make a sale she be only pretend to sell this sound a very small and fanciful incident to build upon what follow but really it be not small i mean it be the spark that light the line of powder and run along to the big blaze in my mind for the whole town i suddenly realize be something other than i so far see it the real activity and interest of the people be elsewhere and otherwise than appear they true life lay somewhere out of sight behind the scene they busy-ness be but the outward semblance that mask they actual purpose they buy and sell and eat and drink and walk about the street yet all the while the main stream of they existence lay somewhere beyond my ken underground in secret place in the shop and at the stall they do not care whether i purchase they article or not at the inn they be indifferent to my staying or go they life lay remote from my own spring from hide mysterious source course out of sight unknown it be all a great elaborate pretence assume possibly for my benefit or possibly for purpose of they own but the main current of they energy run elsewhere i almost feel as a unwelcome foreign substance might be expect to feel when it have find its way into the human system and the whole body organise itself to eject it or to absorb it the town be do this very thing to I this bizarre notion present itself forcibly to my mind as i walk home to the inn and i begin busily to wonder wherein the true life of this town could lie and what be the actual interest and activity of its hidden life and now that my eye be partly open i notice other thing too that puzzle I first of which i think be the extraordinary silence of the whole place positively the town be muffle although the street be pave with cobble the people move about silently softly with padded foot like cat nothing make noise all be hushed subdue mute the very voice be quiet low-pitched like purr nothing clamorous vehement or emphatic seem able to live in the drowsy atmosphere of soft dream that soothe this little hill-town into its sleep it be like the woman at the inn -- a outward repose screening intense inner activity and purpose yet there be no sign of lethargy or sluggishness anywhere about it the people be active and alert only a magical and uncanny softness lay over they all like a spell vezin pass he hand across he eye for a moment as though the memory have become very vivid he voice have run off into a whisper so that we hear the last part with difficulty he be tell a true thing obviously yet something that he both like and hate tell i go back to the inn he continue presently in a louder voice and dine i feel a new strange world about I my old world of reality recede here whether i like it or no be something new and incomprehensible i regret have leave the train so impulsively a adventure be upon I and i loathe adventure as foreign to my nature moreover this be the beginning apparently of a adventure somewhere deep within I in a region i could not check or measure and a feeling of alarm mingle itself with my wonder -- alarm for the stability of what i have for forty year recognize as my ` personality ' i go upstairs to bed my mind teem with thought that be unusual to I and of rather a haunting description by way of relief i keep thinking of that nice prosaic noisy train and all those wholesome blustering passenger i almost wish i be with they again but my dream take I elsewhere i dream of cat and soft-moving creature and the silence of life in a dim muffle world beyond the sens ii vezin stay on from day to day indefinitely much longer than he have intend he feel in a kind of dazed somnolent condition he do nothing in particular but the place fascinate he and he could not decide to leave decision be always very difficult for he and he sometimes wonder how he have ever bring himself to the point of leave the train it seem as though some one else must have arrange it for he and once or twice he thought run to the swarthy frenchman who have sit opposite if only he could have understand that long sentence end so strangely with _  cause du sommeil et  cause des chat _ he wonder what it all mean meanwhile the hushed softness of the town hold he prisoner and he seek in he muddle gentle way to find out where the mystery lay and what it be all about but he limited french and he constitutional hatred of active investigation make it hard for he to buttonhole anybody and ask question he be content to observe and watch and remain negative the weather hold on calm and hazy and this just suit he he wander about the town till he know every street and alley the people suffer he to come and go without let or hindrance though it become clearer to he every day that he be never free himself from observation the town watch he as a cat watch a mouse and he get no nearer to find out what they be all so busy with or where the main stream of they activity lay this remain hide the people be as soft and mysterious as cat but that he be continually under observation become more evident from day to day for instance when he stroll to the end of the town and enter a little green public garden beneath the rampart and seat himself upon one of the empty bench in the sun he be quite alone -- at first not another seat be occupy the little park be empty the path desert yet within ten minute of he come there must have be fully twenty person scatter about he some stroll aimlessly along the gravel walk stare at the flower and other seat on the wooden bench enjoy the sun like himself none of they appear to take any notice of he yet he understand quite well they have all come there to watch they keep he under close observation in the street they have seem busy enough hurry upon various errand yet these be suddenly all forget and they have nothing to do but loll and laze in the sun they duty unremembered five minute after he leave the garden be again desert the seat vacant but in the crowded street it be the same thing again he be never alone he be ever in they thought by degree too he begin to see how it be he be so cleverly watch yet without the appearance of it the people do nothing _ directly _ they behave _ obliquely _ he laugh in he mind as the thought thus clothe itself in word but the phrase exactly describe it they look at he from angle which naturally should have lead they sight in another direction altogether they movement be oblique too so far as these concerned himself the straight direct thing be not they way evidently they do nothing obviously if he enter a shop to buy the woman walk instantly away and busy herself with something at the farther end of the counter though answer at once when he speak show that she know he be there and that this be only she way of attend to he it be the fashion of the cat she follow even in the dining-room of the inn the be-whiskered and courteous waiter lithe and silent in all he movement never seem able to come straight to he table for a order or a dish he come by zigzag indirectly vaguely so that he appear to be go to another table altogether and only turn suddenly at the last moment and be there beside he vezin smile curiously to himself as he describe how he begin to realize these thing other tourist there be none in the hostel but he recall the figure of one or two old man inhabitant who take they _ djeuner _ and dinner there and remember how fantastically they enter the room in similar fashion first they pause in the doorway peer about the room and then after a temporary inspection they come in as it be sideways keep close to the wall so that he wonder which table they be make for and at the last minute make almost a little quick run to they particular seat and again he think of the way and method of cat other small incident too impressed he as all part of this queer soft town with its muffle indirect life for the way some of the people appear and disappear with extraordinary swiftness puzzle he exceedingly it may have be all perfectly natural he know yet he could not make it out how the alley swallow they up and shoot they forth in a second of time when there be no visible doorway or opening near enough to explain the phenomenon once he follow two elderly woman who he feel have be particularly examine he from across the street -- quite near the inn this be -- and see they turn the corner a few foot only in front of he yet when he sharply follow on they heel he see nothing but a utterly desert alley stretch in front of he with no sign of a living thing and the only opening through which they could have escape be a porch some fifty yard away which not the swiftest human runner could have reach in time and in just such sudden fashion people appear when he never expect they once when he hear a great noise of fight go on behind a low wall and hurry up to see what be go on what should he see but a group of girl and woman engage in vociferous conversation which instantly hush itself to the normal whispering note of the town when he head appear over the wall and even then none of they turn to look at he directly but slink off with the most unaccountable rapidity into door and shed across the yard and they voice he think have sound so like so strangely like the angry snarling of fight animal almost of cat the whole spirit of the town however continue to evade he as something elusive protean screen from the outer world and at the same time intensely genuinely vital and since he now form part of its life this concealment puzzle and irritated he more -- it begin rather to frighten he out of the mist that slowly gather about he ordinary surface thought there rise again the idea that the inhabitant be wait for he to declare himself to take a attitude to do this or to do that and that when he have do so they in they turn would at length make some direct response accept or reject he yet the vital matter concern which he decision be await come no nearer to he once or twice he purposely follow little procession or group of the citizen in order to find out if possible on what purpose they be bent but they always discover he in time and dwindle away each individual go he or she own way it be always the same : he never could learn what they main interest be the cathedral be ever empty the old church of st martin at the other end of the town desert they shop because they have to and not because they wish to the booth stand neglect the stall unvisit the little _ cafs _ desolate yet the street be always full the townsfolk ever on the bustle can it be he think to himself yet with a deprecate laugh that he should have dare to think anything so odd can it be that these people be people of the twilight that they live only at night they real life and come out honestly only with the dusk that during the day they make a sham though brave pretence and after the sun be down they true life begin have they the soul of night-thing and be the whole bless town in the hand of the cat the fancy somehow electrify he with little shock of shrink and dismay yet though he affect to laugh he know that he be begin to feel more than uneasy and that strange force be tug with a thousand invisible cord at the very center of he be something utterly remote from he ordinary life something that have not wake for year begin faintly to stir in he soul send feeler abroad into he brain and heart shaping queer thought and penetrate even into certain of he minor action something exceedingly vital to himself to he soul hang in the balance and always when he return to the inn about the hour of sunset he see the figure of the townsfolk steal through the dusk from they shop door move sentry-wise to and fro at the corner of the street yet always vanish silently like shadow at he near approach and as the inn invariably close its door at ten o'clock he have never yet find the opportunity he rather half-heartedly seek to see for himself what account the town could give of itself at night -- _  cause du sommeil et  cause des chat _ -- the word now ring in he ear more and more often though still as yet without any definite meaning moreover something make he sleep like the dead iii it be i think on the fifth day -- though in this detail he story sometimes vary -- that he make a definite discovery which increase he alarm and bring he up to a rather sharp climax before that he have already notice that a change be go forward and certain subtle transformation be bring about in he character which modify several of he minor habit and he have affect to ignore they here however be something he could no longer ignore and it startle he at the best of time he be never very positive always negative rather compliant and acquiescent yet when necessity arise he be capable of reasonably vigorous action and could take a strongish decision the discovery he now make that bring he up with such a sharp turn be that this power have positively dwindle to nothing he find it impossible to make up he mind for on this fifth day he realize that he have stay long enough in the town and that for reason he could only vaguely define to himself it be wiser _ and safer _ that he should leave and he find that he could not leave this be difficult to describe in word and it be more by gesture and the expression of he face that he convey to dr silence the state of impotence he have reach all this spy and watch he say have as it be spin a net about he foot so that he be trap and powerless to escape he feel like a fly that have blunder into the intricacy of a great web he be catch imprison and could not get away it be a distressing sensation a numbness have creep over he will till it have become almost incapable of decision the mere thought of vigorous action -- action towards escape -- begin to terrify he all the current of he life have turn inwards upon himself strive to bring to the surface something that lay bury almost beyond reach determine to force he recognition of something he have long forget -- forget year upon year century almost ago it seem as though a window deep within he be would presently open and reveal a entirely new world yet somehow a world that be not unfamiliar beyond that again he fancy a great curtain hang and when that too roll up he would see still farther into this region and at last understand something of the secret life of these extraordinary people be this why they wait and watch he ask himself with rather a shake heart for the time when i shall join they -- or refuse to join they do the decision rest with I after all and not with they and it be at this point that the sinister character of the adventure first really declare itself and he become genuinely alarm the stability of he rather fluid little personality be at stake he feel and something in he heart turn coward why otherwise should he have suddenly take to walk stealthily silently make as little sound as possible for ever look behind he why else should he have move almost on tiptoe about the passage of the practically desert inn and when he be abroad have find himself deliberately take advantage of what cover present itself and why if he be not afraid should the wisdom of stay indoors after sundown have suddenly occur to he as eminently desirable why indeed and when john silence gently press he for a explanation of these thing he admit apologetically that he have none to give it be simply that i fear something might happen to I unless i keep a sharp look-out i feel afraid it be instinctive be all he could say i get the impression that the whole town be after I -- want I for something and that if it get I i should lose myself or at least the self i know in some unfamiliar state of consciousness but i be not a psychologist you know he add meekly and i can not define it better than that it be while lounge in the courtyard half a hour before the evening meal that vezin make this discovery and he at once go upstairs to he quiet room at the end of the wind passage to think it over alone in the yard it be empty enough true but there be always the possibility that the big woman whom he dread would come out of some door with she pretence of knit to sit and watch he this have happen several time and he could not endure the sight of she he still remember he original fancy bizarre though it be that she would spring upon he the moment he back be turn and land with one single crush leap upon he neck of course it be nonsense but then it haunt he and once a idea begin to do that it cease to be nonsense it have clothe itself in reality he go upstairs accordingly it be dusk and the oil lamp have not yet be light in the passage he stumble over the uneven surface of the ancient flooring pass the dim outline of door along the corridor -- door that he have never once see open -- room that seem never occupy he move as he habit now be stealthily and on tiptoe half-way down the last passage to he own chamber there be a sharp turn and it be just here while grope round the wall with outstretched hand that he finger touch something that be not wall -- something that move it be soft and warm in texture indescribably fragrant and about the height of he shoulder and he immediately think of a furry sweet-smelling kitten the next minute he know it be something quite different instead of investigate however -- he nerve must have be too overwrought for that he say -- he shrink back as closely as possible against the wall on the other side the thing whatever it be slipped past he with a sound of rustling and retreat with light footstep down the passage behind he be go a breath of warm scented air be waft to he nostril vezin catch he breath for a instant and pause stockstill half lean against the wall -- and then almost run down the remain distance and enter he room with a rush lock the door hurriedly behind he yet it be not fear that make he run : it be excitement pleasurable excitement he nerve be tingle and a delicious glow make itself feel all over he body in a flash it come to he that this be just what he have feel twenty-five year ago as a boy when he be in love for the first time warm current of life run all over he and mount to he brain in a whirl of soft delight he mood be suddenly become tender melting love the room be quite dark and he collapse upon the sofa by the window wonder what have happen to he and what it all mean but the only thing he understand clearly in that instant be that something in he have swiftly magically change : he no longer wish to leave or to argue with himself about leave the encounter in the passage-way have change all that the strange perfume of it still hang about he bemuse he heart and mind for he know that it be a girl who have pass he a girl 's face that he finger have brush in the darkness and he feel in some extraordinary way as though he have be actually kiss by she kiss full upon the lip tremble he sit upon the sofa by the window and struggle to collect he thought he be utterly unable to understand how the mere passing of a girl in the darkness of a narrow passage-way could communicate so electric a thrill to he whole be that he still shake with the sweetness of it yet there it be and he find it as useless to deny as to attempt analysis some ancient fire have enter he vein and now run course through he blood and that he be forty-five instead of twenty do not matter one little jot out of all the inner turmoil and confusion emerge the one salient fact that the mere atmosphere the merest casual touch of this girl unseen unknown in the darkness have be sufficient to stir dormant fire in the center of he heart and rouse he whole be from a state of feeble sluggishness to one of tear and tumultuous excitement after a time however the number of vezin 's year begin to assert they cumulative power he grow calmer and when a knock come at length upon he door and he hear the waiter 's voice suggest that dinner be nearly over he pull himself together and slowly make he way downstairs into the dining-room every one look up as he enter for he be very late but he take he customary seat in the far corner and begin to eat the trepidation be still in he nerve but the fact that he have pass through the courtyard and hall without catch sight of a petticoat serve to calm he a little he eat so fast that he have almost catch up with the current stage of the table d'hte when a slight commotion in the room draw he attention he chair be so place that the door and the greater portion of the long _ salle  manger _ be behind he yet it be not necessary to turn round to know that the same person he have pass in the dark passage have now come into the room he feel the presence long before he hear or see any one then he become aware that the old man the only other guest be rise one by one in they place and exchange greeting with some one who pass among they from table to table and when at length he turn with he heart beat furiously to ascertain for himself he see the form of a young girl lithe and slim move down the center of the room and make straight for he own table in the corner she move wonderfully with sinuous grace like a young panther and she approach fill he with such delicious bewilderment that he be utterly unable to tell at first what she face be like or discover what it be about the whole presentment of the creature that fill he anew with trepidation and delight ah ma ` mselle est de retor he hear the old waiter murmur at he side and he be just able to take in that she be the daughter of the proprietress when she be upon he and he hear she voice she be address he something of red lip he see and laugh white tooth and stray wisp of fine dark hair about the temple but all the rest be a dream in which he own emotion rise like a thick cloud before he eye and prevent he see accurately or know exactly what he do he be aware that she greet he with a charming little bow that she beautiful large eye look searchingly into he own that the perfume he have notice in the dark passage again assail he nostril and that she be bend a little towards he and lean with one hand on the table at this side she be quite close to he -- that be the chief thing he know -- explain that she have be ask after the comfort of she mother 's guest and now be introduce herself to the latest arrival -- himself m ` sieur have already be here a few day he hear the waiter say and then she own voice sweet as singing reply -- ah but m ` sieur be not go to leave we just yet i hope my mother be too old to look after the comfort of we guest properly but now i be here i will remedy all that she laugh deliciously m ` sieur shall be well look after vezin struggle with he emotion and desire to be polite half rise to acknowledge the pretty speech and to stammer some sort of reply but as he do so he hand by chance touch she own that be rest upon the table and a shock that be for all the world like a shock of electricity pass from she skin into he body he soul waver and shake deep within he he catch she eye fix upon he own with a look of most curious intentness and the next moment he know that he have sit down wordless again on he chair that the girl be already half-way across the room and that he be try to eat he salad with a dessert-spoon and a knife longing for she return and yet dread it he gulp down the remainder of he dinner and then go at once to he bedroom to be alone with he thought this time the passage be light and he suffer no exciting contretemps yet the wind corridor be dim with shadow and the last portion from the bend of the wall onward seem longer than he have ever know it it run downhill like the pathway on a mountain side and as he tiptoe softly down it he feel that by rights it ought to have lead he clean out of the house into the heart of a great forest the world be singing with he strange fancy fill he brain and once in the room with the door securely lock he do not light the candle but sit by the open window think long long thought that come unbidden in troops to he mind iv this part of the story he tell to dr silence without special coax it be true yet with much stammer embarrassment he could not in the least understand he say how the girl have manage to affect he so profoundly and even before he have set eye upon she for she mere proximity in the darkness have be sufficient to set he on fire he know nothing of enchantment and for year have be a stranger to anything approach tender relation with any member of the opposite sex for he be encase in shyness and realize he overwhelming defect only too well yet this bewitching young creature come to he deliberately she manner be unmistakable and she seek he out on every possible occasion chaste and sweet she be undoubtedly yet frankly invite and she win he utterly with the first glance of she shine eye even if she have not already do so in the dark merely by the magic of she invisible presence you feel she be altogether wholesome and good query the doctor you have no reaction of any sort -- for instance of alarm vezin look up sharply with one of he inimitable little apologetic smile it be some time before he reply the mere memory of the adventure have suffuse he shy face with blush and he brown eye seek the floor again before he answer i do not think i can quite say that he explain presently i acknowledge certain qualm sit up in my room afterwards a conviction grow upon I that there be something about she -- how shall i express it -- well something unholy it be not impurity in any sense physical or mental that i mean but something quite indefinable that give I a vague sensation of the creep she draw I and at the same time repel I more than -- than -- he hesitate blush furiously and unable to finish the sentence nothing like it have ever come to I before or since he conclude with lame confusion i suppose it be as you suggest just now something of a enchantment at any rate it be strong enough to make I feel that i would stay in that awful little haunted town for year if only i could see she every day hear she voice watch she wonderful movement and sometimes perhaps touch she hand can you explain to I what you feel be the source of she power john silence ask look purposely anywhere but at the narrator i be surprise that you should ask I such a question answer vezin with the nearest approach to dignity he could manage i think no man can describe to another convincingly wherein lie the magic of the woman who ensnare he i certainly can not i can only say this slip of a girl bewitch I and the mere knowledge that she be live and sleep in the same house fill I with a extraordinary sense of delight but there be one thing i can tell you he go on earnestly he eye aglow namely that she seem to sum up and synthesise in herself all the strange hidden force that operate so mysteriously in the town and its inhabitant she have the silken movement of the panther go smoothly silently to and fro and the same indirect oblique method as the townsfolk screening like they secret purpose of she own -- purpose that i be sure have _ I _ for they objective she keep I to my terror and delight ceaselessly under observation yet so carelessly so consummately that another man less sensitive if i may say so -- he make a deprecating gesture -- or less prepare by what have go before would never have notice it at all she be always still always reposeful yet she seem to be everywhere at once so that i never could escape from she i be continually meet the stare and laughter of she great eye in the corner of the room in the passage calmly look at I through the window or in the busiest part of the public street they intimacy it seem grow very rapidly after this first encounter which have so violently disturb the little man 's equilibrium he be naturally very prim and prim folk live mostly in so small a world that anything violently unusual may shake they clean out of it and they therefore instinctively distrust originality but vezin begin to forget he primness after awhile the girl be always modestly behave and as she mother 's representative she naturally have to do with the guest in the hotel it be not out of the way that a spirit of camaraderie should spring up besides she be young she be charmingly pretty she be french and -- she obviously like he at the same time there be something indescribable -- a certain indefinable atmosphere of other place other time -- that make he try hard to remain on he guard and sometimes make he catch he breath with a sudden start it be all rather like a delirious dream half delight half dread he confide in a whisper to dr silence and more than once he hardly know quite what he be do or say as though he be drive forward by impulse he scarcely recognize as he own and though the thought of leave present itself again and again to he mind it be each time with less insistence so that he stay on from day to day become more and more a part of the sleepy life of this dreamy mediaeval town lose more and more of he recognisable personality soon he feel the curtain within would roll up with a awful rush and he would find himself suddenly admit into the secret purpose of the hidden life that lay behind it all only by that time he would have become transform into a entirely different be and meanwhile he notice various little sign of the intention to make he stay attractive to he : flower in he bedroom a more comfortable arm-chair in the corner and even special little extra dish on he private table in the dining-room conversation too with mademoiselle ils become more and more frequent and pleasant and although they seldom travel beyond the weather or the detail of the town the girl he notice be never in a hurry to bring they to a end and often contrived to interject little odd sentence that he never properly understand yet feel to be significant and it be these stray remark full of a meaning that evade he that point to some hidden purpose of she own and make he feel uneasy they all have to do he feel sure with reason for he stay on in the town indefinitely and have m ` sieur not even yet come to a decision she say softly in he ear sit beside he in the sunny yard before _ djeuner _ the acquaintance have progress with significant rapidity because if it be so difficult we must all try together to help he the question startle he follow upon he own thought it be speak with a pretty laugh and a stray bit of hair across one eye as she turn and peer at he half roguishly possibly he do not quite understand the french of it for she near presence always confuse he small knowledge of the language distressingly yet the word and she manner and something else that lay behind it all in she mind frighten he it give such point to he feeling that the town be wait for he to make he mind up on some important matter at the same time she voice and the fact that she be there so close beside he in she soft dark dress thrill he inexpressibly it be true i find it difficult to leave he stammer lose he way deliciously in the depths of she eye and especially now that mademoiselle ils have come he be surprise at the success of he sentence and quite delighted with the little gallantry of it but at the same time he could have bite he tongue off for have say it then after all you like we little town or you would not be please to stay on she say ignore the compliment i be enchant with it and enchant with you he cry feeling that he tongue be somehow slip beyond the control of he brain and he be on the verge of say all manner of other thing of the wildest description when the girl spring lightly up from she chair beside he and make to go it be _ soupe  l'onion _ to-day she cry laugh back at he through the sunlight and i must go and see about it otherwise you know m ` sieur will not enjoy he dinner and then perhaps he will leave we he watch she cross the courtyard move with all the grace and lightness of the feline race and she simple black dress clothe she he think exactly like the fur of the same supple species she turn once to laugh at he from the porch with the glass door and then stop a moment to speak to she mother who sit knit as usual in she corner seat just inside the hall-way but how be it then that the moment he eye fall upon this ungainly woman the pair of they appear suddenly as other than they be whence come that transform dignity and sense of power that envelop they both as by magic what be it about that massive woman that make she appear instantly regal and set she on a throne in some dark and dreadful scenery wield a sceptre over the red glare of some tempestuous orgy and why do this slender stripling of a girl graceful as a willow lithe as a young leopard assume suddenly a air of sinister majesty and move with flame and smoke about she head and the darkness of night beneath she foot vezin catch he breath and sit there transfix then almost simultaneously with its appearance the queer notion vanish again and the sunlight of day catch they both and he hear she laughing to she mother about the _ soupe  l'onion _ and see she glancing back at he over she dear little shoulder with a smile that make he think of a dew-kissed rise bend lightly before summer air and indeed the onion soup be particularly excellent that day because he see another cover lay at he small table and with flutter heart hear the waiter murmur by way of explanation that ma ` mselle ils would honor m ` sieur to-day at _ djeuner _ as she custom sometimes be with she mother 's guest so actually she sit by he all through that delirious meal talk quietly to he in easy french see that he be well look after mix the salad-dressing and even help he with she own hand and later in the afternoon while he be smoking in the courtyard longing for a sight of she as soon as she duty be do she come again to he side and when he rise to meet she she stand face he a moment full of a perplexing sweet shyness before she speak -- my mother think you ought to know more of the beauty of we little town and _ i _ think so too would m ` sieur like I to be he guide perhaps i can show he everything for we family have live here for many generation she have he by the hand indeed before he could find a single word to express he pleasure and lead he all unresist out into the street yet in such a way that it seem perfectly natural she should do so and without the faintest suggestion of boldness or immodesty she face glow with the pleasure and interest of it and with she short dress and tumble hair she look every bit the charming child of seventeen that she be innocent and playful proud of she native town and alive beyond she year to the sense of its ancient beauty so they go over the town together and she show he what she consider its chief interest : the tumble-down old house where she forebear have live the sombre aristocratic-looking mansion where she mother 's family dwelt for century and the ancient market-place where several hundred year before the witch have be burn by the score she keep up a lively run stream of talk about it all of which he understand not a fiftieth part as he trudge along by she side cursing he forty-five year and feel all the yearning of he early manhood revive and jeer at he and as she talk england and surbiton seem very far away indeed almost in another age of the world 's history she voice touch something immeasurably old in he something that sleep deep it lull the surface part of he consciousness to sleep allow what be far more ancient to awaken like the town with its elaborate pretence of modern active life the upper layer of he be become dull soothed muffle and what lay underneath begin to stir in its sleep that big curtain sway a little to and fro presently it might lift altogether he begin to understand a little better at last the mood of the town be reproduce itself in he in proportion as he ordinary external self become muffle that inner secret life that be far more real and vital assert itself and this girl be surely the high-priestess of it all the chief instrument of its accomplishment new thought with new interpretation flood he mind as she walk beside he through the wind street while the picturesque old gabled town softly color in the sunset have never appear to he so wholly wonderful and seductive and only one curious incident come to disturb and puzzle he slight in itself but utterly inexplicable bring white terror into the child 's face and a scream to she laughing lip he have merely pointed to a column of blue smoke that rise from the burning autumn leave and make a picture against the red roof and have then run to the wall and call she to he side to watch the flame shoot here and there through the heap of rubbish yet at the sight of it as though take by surprise she face have alter dreadfully and she have turn and run like the wind call out wild sentence to he as she run of which he have not understand a single word except that the fire apparently frighten she and she want to get quickly away from it and to get he away too yet five minute later she be as calm and happy again as though nothing have happen to alarm or waken troubled thought in she and they have both forget the incident they be lean over the ruin rampart together listen to the weird music of the

little soul could hold yet i come here wholly by chance -- he hear himself say no she cry with passion you come here because i call to you i have call to you for year and you come with the whole force of the past behind you you have to come for i own you and i claim you she rise again and move closer look at he with a certain insolence in the face -- the insolence of power the sun have set behind the tower of the old cathedral and the darkness rise up from the plain and envelop they the music of the band have cease the leaf of the plane tree hang motionless but the chill of the autumn evening rise about they and make vezin shiver there be no sound but the sound of they voice and the occasional soft rustle of the girl 's dress he could hear the blood rush in he ear he scarcely realize where he be or what he be do some terrible magic of the imagination draw he deeply down into the tomb of he own be tell he in no unfaltering voice that she word shadow forth the truth and this simple little french maid speak beside he with so strange authority he see curiously alter into quite another be as he stare into she eye the picture in he mind grow and live dress itself vividly to he inner vision with a degree of reality he be compel to acknowledge as once before he see she tall and stately move through wild and broken scenery of forest and mountain cavern the glare of flame behind she head and cloud of shift smoke about she foot dark leave encircle she hair fly loosely in the wind and she limb shine through the merest rag of clothing other be about she too and ardent eye on all side cast delirious glance upon she but she own eye be always for one only one whom she hold by the hand for she be lead the dance in some tempestuous orgy to the music of chant voice and the dance she lead circle about a great and awful figure on a throne brooding over the scene through lurid vapor while innumerable other wild face and form crowd furiously about she in the dance but the one she hold by the hand he know to be himself and the monstrous shape upon the throne he know to be she mother the vision rise within he rush to he down the long year of bury time cry aloud to he with the voice of memory reawaken and then the scene fade away and he see the clear circle of the girl 's eye gaze steadfastly into he own and she become once more the pretty little daughter of the innkeeper and he find he voice again and you he whisper tremblingly -- you child of vision and enchantment how be it that you so bewitch I that i love you even before i see she draw herself up beside he with a air of rare dignity the call of the past she say and besides she add proudly in the real life i be a princess -- a princess he cry -- and my mother be a queen at this little vezin utterly lose he head delight tear at he heart and sweep he into sheer ecstasy to hear that sweet singing voice and to see those adorable little lip utter such thing upset he balance beyond all hope of control he take she in he arm and cover she unresisting face with kiss but even while he do so and while the hot passion sweep he he feel that she be soft and loathsome and that she answering kiss stain he very soul and when presently she have free herself and vanish into the darkness he stand there lean against the wall in a state of collapse creep with horror from the touch of she yielding body and inwardly rage at the weakness that he already dimly realize must prove he undoing and from the shadow of the old building into which she disappear there rise in the stillness of the night a singular long-drawn cry which at first he take for laughter but which later he be sure he recognize as the almost human wail of a cat v for a long time vezin lean there against the wall alone with he surge thought and emotion he understand at length that he have do the one thing necessary to call down upon he the whole force of this ancient past for in those passionate kiss he have acknowledge the tie of olden day and have revive it and the memory of that soft impalpable caress in the darkness of the inn corridor come back to he with a shudder the girl have first master he and then lead he to the one act that be necessary for she purpose he have be waylay after the lapse of century -- catch and conquer dimly he realize this and seek to make plan for he escape but for the moment at any rate he be powerless to manage he thought or will for the sweet fantastic madness of the whole adventure mount to he brain like a spell and he glory in the feeling that he be utterly enchanted and move in a world so much larger and wilder than the one he have ever be accustom to the moon pale and enormous be just rise over the sea-like plain when at last he rise to go she slanting ray draw all the house into new perspective so that they roof already glisten with dew seem to stretch much higher into the sky than usual and they gable and quaint old tower lay far away in its purple reach the cathedral appear unreal in a silver mist he move softly keep to the shadow but the street be all desert and very silent the door be close the shutter fasten not a soul be astir the hush of night lay over everything it be like a town of the dead a churchyard with gigantic and grotesque tombstone wonder where all the busy life of the day have so utterly disappear to he make he way to a back door that enter the inn by means of the stable think thus to reach he room unobserved he reach the courtyard safely and cross it by keep close to the shadow of the wall he sidle down it mince along on tiptoe just as the old man do when they enter the _ salle  manger _ he be horrify to find himself do this instinctively a strange impulse come to he catch he somehow in the center of he body -- a impulse to drop upon all fours and run swiftly and silently he glance upward and the idea come to he to leap up upon he window-sill overhead instead of go round by the stair this occur to he as the easiest and most natural way it be like the beginning of some horrible transformation of himself into something else he be fearfully string up the moon be higher now and the shadow very dark along the side of the street where he move he keep among the deepest of they and reach the porch with the glass door but here there be light the inmate unfortunately be still about hope to slip across the hall unobserved and reach the stair he open the door carefully and steal in then he see that the hall be not empty a large dark thing lay against the wall on he left at first he think it must be household article then it move and he think it be a immense cat distort in some way by the play of light and shadow then it rise straight up before he and he see that it be the proprietress what she have be do in this position he could only venture a dreadful guess but the moment she stand up and face he he be aware of some terrible dignity clothing she about that instantly recall the girl 's strange say that she be a queen huge and sinister she stand there under the little oil lamp alone with he in the empty hall awe stir in he heart and the root of some ancient fear he feel that he must bow to she and make some kind of obeisance the impulse be fierce and irresistible as of long habit he glance quickly about he there be no one there then he deliberately incline he head toward she he bow enfin m ` sieur s ` est donc dcid c'est bien alors j' en suis contente she word come to he sonorously as through a great open space then the great figure come suddenly across the flag hall at he and seize he tremble hand some overpowering force move with she and catch he on pourrait faire un p ` tit tour ensemble n'est - ce pas nous y allons cette nuit et il faut s ` exercer un peu d'avance pour celum ils ils vien donc ici vien vite and she whirl he round in the opening step of some dance that seem oddly and horribly familiar they make no sound on the stone this strangely assorted couple it be all soft and stealthy and presently when the air seem to thicken like smoke and a red glare as of flame shot through it he be aware that some one else have join they and that he hand the mother have release be now tightly hold by the daughter ils have come in answer to the call and he see she with leaf of vervain twine in she dark hair clothe in tattered vestige of some curious garment beautiful as the night and horribly odiously loathsomely seductive to the sabbath to the sabbath they cry on to the witch ' sabbath up and down that narrow hall they dance the woman on each side of he to the wildest measure he have ever imagine yet which he dimly dreadfully remembered till the lamp on the wall flicker and go out and they be leave in total darkness and the devil wake in he heart with a thousand vile suggestion and make he afraid suddenly they release he hand and he hear the voice of the mother cry that it be time and they must go which way they go he do not pause to see he only realize that he be free and he blunder through the darkness till he find the stair and then tear up they to he room as though all hell be at he heel he fling himself on the sofa with he face in he hand and groan swiftly review a dozen way of immediate escape all equally impossible he finally decide that the only thing to do for the moment be to sit quiet and wait he must see what be go to happen at least in the privacy of he own bedroom he would be fairly safe the door be lock he cross over and softly open the window which give upon the courtyard and also permit a partial view of the hall through the glass door as he do so the hum and murmur of a great activity reach he ear from the street beyond -- the sound of footstep and voice muffle by distance he lean out cautiously and listen the moonlight be clear and strong now but he own window be in shadow the silver disc be still behind the house it come to he irresistibly that the inhabitant of the town who a little while before have all be invisible behind closed door be now issue forth busy upon some secret and unholy errand he listen intently at first everything about he be silent but soon he become aware of movement go on in the house itself rustling and cheeping come to he across that still moonlit yard a concourse of live being send the hum of they activity into the night thing be on the move everywhere a bite pungent odour rise through the air come he know not whence presently he eye become glue to the window of the opposite wall where the moonshine fall in a soft blaze the roof overhead and behind he be reflect clearly in the pane of glass and he see the outline of dark body move with long footstep over the tile and along the cope they pass swiftly and silently shape like immense cat in a endless procession across the picture glass and then appear to leap down to a lower level where he lose sight of they he just catch the soft thud of they leap sometimes they shadow fall upon the white wall opposite and then he could not make out whether they be the shadow of human being or of cat they seem to change swiftly from one to the other the transformation look horribly real for they leap like human being yet change swiftly in the air immediately afterwards and drop like animal the yard too beneath he be now alive with the creep movement of dark form all stealthily draw towards the porch with the glass door they keep so closely to the wall that he could not determine they actual shape but when he see that they pass on to the great congregation that be gather in the hall he understand that these be the creature whose leap shadow he have first see reflect in the windowpane opposite they be come from all part of the town reach the appoint meeting-place across the roof and tile and spring from level to level till they come to the yard then a new sound catch he ear and he see that the window all about he be be softly open and that to each window come a face a moment later figure begin drop hurriedly down into the yard and these figure as they lower themselves down from the window be human he see but once safely in the yard they fall upon all fours and change in the swiftest possible second into -- cat -- huge silent cat they run in stream to join the main body in the hall beyond so after all the room in the house have not be empty and unoccupied moreover what he see no longer fill he with amazement for he remember it all it be familiar it have all happen before just so hundred of time and he himself have take part in it and know the wild madness of it all the outline of the old building change the yard grow larger and he seem to be stare down upon it from a much greater height through smoky vapor and as he look half remember the old pain of long ago fierce and sweet furiously assail he and the blood stir horribly as he hear the call of the dance again in he heart and taste the ancient magic of ils whirling by he side suddenly he start back a great lithe cat have leap softly up from the shadow below on to the sill close to he face and be stare fixedly at he with the eye of a human come it seem to say come with we to the dance change as of old transform yourself swiftly and come only too well he understand the creature 's soundless call it be go again in a flash with scarcely a sound of its padded foot on the stone and then other drop by the score down the side of the house past he very eye all change as they fall and dart away rapidly softly towards the gathering point and again he feel the dreadful desire to do likewise to murmur the old incantation and then drop upon hand and knee and run swiftly for the great fly leap into the air oh how the passion of it rise within he like a flood twist he very entrails send he heart 's desire flame forth into the night for the old old dance of the sorcerer at the witch ' sabbath the whirl of the star be about he once more he meet the magic of the moon the power of the wind rush from precipice and forest leap from cliff to cliff across the valley tear he away he hear the cry of the dancer and they wild laughter and with this savage girl in he embrace he dance furiously about the dim throne where sit the figure with the sceptre of majesty then suddenly all become hushed and still and the fever die down a little in he heart the calm moonlight flood a courtyard empty and desert they have start the procession be off into the sky and he be leave behind -- alone vezin tiptoe softly across the room and unlock the door the murmur from the street grow momentarily as he advance meet he ear he make he way with the utmost caution down the corridor at the head of the stair he pause and listen below he the hall where they have gather be dark and still but through open door and window on the far side of the building come the sound of a great throng move farther and farther into the distance he make he way down the creak wooden stair dread yet longing to meet some straggler who should point the way but find no one across the dark hall so lately throng with live move thing and out through the open front door into the street he could not believe that he be really leave behind really forget that he have be purposely permit to escape it perplex he nervously he peer about he and up and down the street then see nothing advance slowly down the pavement the whole town as he go show itself empty and desert as though a great wind have blow everything alive out of it the door and window of the house stand open to the night nothing stir moonlight and silence lay over all the night lay about he like a cloak the air soft and cool caress he cheek like the touch of a great furry paw he gain confidence and begin to walk quickly though still keep to the shadowed side nowhere could he discover the faintest sign of the great unholy exodus he know have just take place the moon sail high over all in a sky cloudless and serene hardly realize where he be go he cross the open market-place and so come to the rampart whence he know a pathway descend to the high road and along which he could make good he escape to one of the other little town that lay to the northward and so to the railway but first he pause and gaze out over the scene at he foot where the great plain lay like a silver map of some dream country the still beauty of it enter he heart increase he sense of bewilderment and unreality no air stir the leaf of the plane tree stand motionless the near detail be define with the sharpness of day against dark shadow and in the distance the field and wood melt away into haze and shimmering mistiness but the breath catch in he throat and he stand stockstill as though transfix when he gaze pass from the horizon and fall upon the near prospect in the depth of the valley at he foot the whole lower slope of the hill that lay hide from the brightness of the moon be aglow and through the glare he see countless move form shift thick and fast between the opening of the tree while overhead like leaf drive by the wind he discern fly shape that hover darkly one moment against the sky and then settle down with cry and weird singing through the branch into the region that be aflame spellbound he stand and stare for a time that he could not measure and then move by one of the terrible impulse that seem to control the whole adventure he climb swiftly upon the top of the broad coping and balance a moment where the valley gape at he foot but in that very instant as he stand hover a sudden movement among the shadow of the house catch he eye and he turn to see the outline of a large animal dart swiftly across the open space behind he and land with a fly leap upon the top of the wall a little lower down it run like the wind to he foot and then rise up beside he upon the rampart a shiver seem to run through the moonlight and he sight tremble for a second he heart pulsed fearfully ils stand beside he peer into he face some dark substance he see stain the girl 's face and skin shine in the moonlight as she stretch she hand towards he she be dress in wretched tattered garment that yet become she mightily rue and vervain twine about she temple she eye glitter with unholy light he only just control the wild impulse to take she in he arm and leap with she from they giddy perch into the valley below see she cry point with a arm on which the rag flutter in the rise wind towards the forest aglow in the distance see where they await we the wood be alive already the great one be there and the dance will soon begin the salve be here anoint yourself and come though a moment before the sky be clear and cloudless yet even while she speak the face of the moon grow dark and the wind begin to toss in the crest of the plane tree at he foot stray gust bring the sound of hoarse singing and cry from the lower slope of the hill and the pungent odour he have already notice about the courtyard of the inn rise about he in the air transform transform she cry again she voice rise like a song rub well you skin before you fly come come with I to the sabbath to the madness of its furious delight to the sweet abandonment of its evil worship see the great one be there and the terrible sacrament prepare the throne be occupy anoint and come anoint and come she grow to the height of a tree beside he leap upon the wall with flaming eye and hair strew upon the night he too begin to change swiftly she hand touch the skin of he face and neck streak he with the burning salve that send the old magic into he blood with the power before which fade all that be good a wild roar come up to he ear from the heart of the wood and the girl when she hear it leap upon the wall in the frenzy of she wicked joy satan be there she scream rush upon he and strive to draw he with she to the edge of the wall satan have come the sacrament call we come with you dear apostate soul and we will worship and dance till the moon die and the world be forget just save himself from the dreadful plunge vezin struggle to release himself from she grasp while the passion tear at he rein and all but master he he shriek aloud not know what he say and then he shriek again it be the old impulse the old awful habit instinctively find voice for though it seem to he that he merely shriek nonsense the word he utter really have meaning in they and be intelligible it be the ancient call and it be hear below it be answer the wind whistle at the skirt of he coat as the air round he darken with many fly form crowd upward out of the valley the cry of hoarse voice smite upon he ear come closer stroke of wind buffet he tear he this way and that along the crumble top of the stone wall and ils cling to he with she long shine arm smooth and bare hold he fast about the neck but not ils alone for a dozen of they surround he drop out of the air the pungent odour of the anointed body stifle he exciting he to the old madness of the sabbath the dance of the witch and sorcerer do honor to the personify evil of the world anoint and away anoint and away they cry in wild chorus about he to the dance that never die to the sweet and fearful fantasy of evil another moment and he would have yield and go for he will turn soft and the flood of passionate memory all but overwhelm he when -- so can a small thing after the whole course of a adventure -- he catch he foot upon a loose stone in the edge of the wall and then fall with a sudden crash on to the ground below but he fall towards the house in the open space of dust and cobblestone and fortunately not into the gaping depth of the valley on the farther side and they too come in a tumble heap about he like fly upon a piece of food but as they fall he be release for a moment from the power of they touch and in that brief instant of freedom there flash into he mind the sudden intuition that save he before he could regain he foot he see they scrabble awkwardly back upon the wall as though bat-like they could only fly by drop from a height and have no hold upon he in the open then see they perch there in a row like cat upon a roof all dark and singularly shapeless they eye like lamp the sudden memory come back to he of ils 's terror at the sight of fire quick as a flash he find he match and light the dead leaf that lay under the wall dry and withered they catch fire at once and the wind carry the flame in a long line down the length of the wall lick upward as it run and with shriek and wailing the crowded row of form upon the top melt away into the air on the other side and be go with a great rush and whir of they body down into the heart of the haunt valley leave vezin breathless and shake in the middle of the desert ground ils he call feebly ils for he heart ache to think that she be really go to the great dance without he and that he have lose the opportunity of its fearful joy yet at the same time he relief be so great and he be so dazed and troubled in mind with the whole thing that he hardly know what he be say and only cry aloud in the fierce storm of he emotion the fire under the wall run its course and the moonlight come out again soft and clear from its temporary eclipse with one last shudder look at the ruin rampart and a feeling of horrid wonder for the haunt valley beyond where the shape still crowd and fly he turn he face towards the town and slowly make he way in the direction of the hotel and as he go a great wail of cry and a sound of howl follow he from the gleaming forest below grow fainter and fainter with the burst of wind as he disappear between the house vi it may seem rather abrupt to you this sudden tame ending say arthur vezin glance with flush face and timid eye at dr silence sit there with he notebook but the fact be -- er -- from that moment my memory seem to have fail rather i have no distinct recollection of how i get home or what precisely i do it appear i never go back to the inn at all i only dimly recollect race down a long white road in the moonlight past wood and village still and desert and then the dawn come up and i see the tower of a biggish town and so come to a station but long before that i remember pause somewhere on the road and look back to where the hill-town of my adventure stand up in the moonlight and think how exactly like a great monstrous cat it lay there upon the plain its huge front paw lie down the two main street and the twin and broken tower of the cathedral mark its torn ear against the sky that picture stay in my mind with the utmost vividness to this day another thing remain in my mind from that escape -- namely the sudden sharp reminder that i have not pay my bill and the decision i make stand there on the dusty highroad that the small baggage i have leave behind would more than settle for my indebtedness for the rest i can only tell you that i get coffee and bread at a caf on the outskirts of this town i have come to and soon after find my way to the station and catch a train later in the day that same evening i reach london and how long altogether ask john silence quietly do you think you stay in the town of the adventure vezin look up sheepishly i be come to that he resume with apologetic wriggling of he body in london i find that i be a whole week out in my reckoning of time i have stay over a week in the town and it ought to have be September 15th -- instead of which it be only September 10th so that in reality you have only stay a night or two in the inn query the doctor vezin hesitate before reply he shuffle upon the mat i must have gain time somewhere he say at length -- somewhere or somehow i certainly have a week to my credit i can not explain it i can only give you the fact and this happen to you last year since when you have never be back to the place last autumn yes murmur vezin and i have never dare to go back i think i never want to and tell I ask dr silence at length when he see that the little man have evidently come to the end of he word and have nothing more to say have you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft practice during the middle age or be at all interested in the subject never declare vezin emphatically i have never give a think to such matter so far as i know -- or to the question of reincarnation perhaps never -- before my adventure but i have since he reply significantly there be however something still on the man 's mind that he wish to relieve himself of by confession yet could only with difficulty bring himself to mention and it be only after the sympathetic tactfulness of the doctor have provide numerous opening that he at length avail himself of one of they and stammer that he would like to show he the mark he still have on he neck where he say the girl have touch he with she anointed hand he take off he collar after infinite fumble hesitation and lower he shirt a little for the doctor to see and there on the surface of the skin lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extend a little way down the back towards the spine it certainly indicate exactly the position a arm might have take in the act of embrace and on the other side of the neck slightly higher up be a similar mark though not quite so clearly define that be where she hold I that night on the rampart he whisper a strange light come and go in he eye \* \* \* \* \* it be some week later when i again find occasion to consult john silence concern another extraordinary case that have come under my notice and we fall to discuss vezin 's story since hear it the doctor have make investigation on he own account and one of he secretary have discover that vezin 's ancestor have actually live for generation in the very town where the adventure come to he two of they both woman have be try and convict as witch and have be burn alive at the stake moreover it have not be difficult to prove that the very inn where vezin stay be build about 1700 upon the spot where the funeral pyre stand and the execution take place the town be a sort of headquarters for all the sorcerer and witch of the entire region and after conviction they be burnt there literally by score it seem strange continue the doctor that vezin should have remain ignorant of all this but on the other hand it be not the kind of history that successive generation would have be anxious to keep alive or to repeat to they child therefore i be incline to think he still know nothing about it the whole adventure seem to have be a very vivid revival of the memory of a earlier life cause by come directly into contact with the living force still intense enough to hang about the place and by a most singular chance too with the very soul who have take part with he in the event of that particular life for the mother and daughter who impress he so strangely must have be lead actor with himself in the scene and practice of witchcraft which at that period dominate the imagination of the whole country one have only to read the history of the time to know that these witch claim the power of transform themselves into various animal both for the purpose of disguise and also to convey themselves swiftly to the scene of they imaginary orgy lycanthropy or the power to change themselves into wolf be everywhere believe in and the ability to transform themselves into cat by rub they body with a special salve or ointment provide by satan himself find equal credence the witchcraft trial abound in evidence of such universal belief dr silence quote chapter and verse from many writer on the subject and show how every detail of vezin 's adventure have a basis in the practice of those dark day but that the entire affair take place subjectively in the man 's own consciousness i have no doubt he go on in reply to my question for my secretary who have be to the town to investigate discover he signature in the visitor ' book and prove by it that he have arrive on September 8th and leave suddenly without pay he bill he leave two day later and they still be in possession of he dirty brown bag and some tourist clothes i pay a few franc in settlement of he debt and have send he luggage on to he the daughter be absent from home but the proprietress a large woman very much as he describe she tell my secretary that he have seem a very strange absent-minded kind of gentleman and after he disappearance she have fear for a long time that he have meet with a violent end in the neighbouring forest where he use to roam about alone i should like to have obtain a personal interview with the daughter so as to ascertain how much be subjective and how much actually take place with she as vezin tell it for she dread of fire and the sight of burning must of course have be the intuitive memory of she former painful death at the stake and have thus explain why he fancy more than once that he see she through smoke and flame and that mark on he skin for instance i inquire merely the mark produce by hysterical brooding he reply like the stigma of the _ religieus _ and the bruise which appear on the body of hypnotised subject who have be tell to expect they this be very common and easily explain only it seem curious that these mark should have remain so long in vezin 's case usually they disappear quickly obviously he be still think about it all brooding and live it all over again i venture probably and this make I fear that the end of he trouble be not yet we shall hear of he again it be a case alas i can do little to alleviate dr silence speak gravely and with sadness in he voice and what do you make of the frenchman in the train i ask further -- the man who warn he against the place _  cause du sommeil et  cause des chat _ surely a very singular incident a very singular incident indeed he make answer slowly and one i can only explain on the basis of a highly improbable coincidence -- namely that the man be one who have himself stay in the town and undergo there a similar experience i should like to find this man and ask he but the crystal be useless here for i have no slightest clue to go upon and i can only conclude that some singular psychic affinity some force still active in he be out of the same past life draw he thus to the personality of vezin and enable he to fear what might happen to he and thus to warn he as he do yes he presently continue half talk to himself i suspect in this case that vezin be sweep into the vortex of force arise out of the intense activity of a past life and that he live over again a scene in which he have often play a lead part century before for strong action set up force that be so slow to exhaust themselves they may be say in a sense never to die in this case they be not vital enough to render the illusion complete so that the little man find himself catch in a very distressing confusion of the present and the past yet he be sufficiently sensitive to recognize that it be true and to fight against the degradation of return even in memory to a former and lower state of development ah yes he continue cross the floor to gaze at the darken sky and seemingly quite oblivious of my presence subliminal up-rush of memory like this can be exceedingly painful and sometimes exceedingly dangerous i only trust that this gentle soul may soon escape from this obsession of a passionate and tempestuous past but i doubt it i doubt it he voice be hush with sadness as he speak and when he turn back into the room again there be a expression of profound yearning upon he face the yearning of a soul whose desire to help be sometimes greater than he power case iii : the nemesis of fire i by some means which i never could fathom john silence always contrived to keep the compartment to himself and as the train have a clear run of two hour before the first stop there be ample time to go over the preliminary fact of the case he have telephone to I that very morning and even through the disguise of the mile of wire the thrill of incalculable adventure have sound in he voice as if it be a ordinary country visit he call in reply to my question and do not forget to bring you gun with blank cartridge i suppose for i know he rigid principle with regard to the taking of life and guess that the gun be merely for some obvious purpose of disguise then he thank I for come mention the train snap down the receiver and leave I vibrate with the excitement of anticipation to do my packing for the honor of accompany dr john silence on one of he big case be what many would have consider a empty honor -- and risky certainly the adventure hold all manner of possibility and i arrive at waterloo with the feeling of a man who be about to embark on some dangerous and peculiar mission in which the danger he expect to run will not be the ordinary danger to life and limb but of some secret character difficult to name and still more difficult to cope with the manor house have a high sound he tell I as we sit with we foot up and talk but i believe it be little more than a overgrown farmhouse in the desolate heather country beyond d -- and its owner colonel wragge a retired soldier with a taste for book live there practically alone i understand with a elderly invalid sister so you need not look forward to a lively visit unless the case provide some excitement of its own which be likely by way of reply he hand I a letter marked private it be date a week ago and sign yours faithfully horace wragge he hear of I you see through captain anderson the doctor explain modestly as though he fame be not almost world-wide you remember that indian obsession case -- i read the letter why it should have be marked private be difficult to understand it be very brief direct and to the point it refer by way of introduction to captain anderson and then state quite simply that the writer need help of a peculiar kind and ask for a personal interview -- a morning interview since it be impossible for he to be absent from the house at night the letter be dignified even to the point of abruptness and it be difficult to explain how it manage to convey to I the impression of a strong man shake and perplexed perhaps the restraint of the wording and the mystery of the affair have something to do with it and the reference to the anderson case the horror of which lay still vivid in my memory may have touch the sense of something rather ominous and alarming but whatever the cause there be no doubt that a impression of serious peril rise somehow out of that white paper with the few line of firm writing and the spirit of a deep uneasiness run between the word and reach the mind without any visible form of expression and when you see he -- i ask return the letter as the train rush clatter noisily through clapham junction i have not see he be the reply the man 's mind be charge to the brim when he write that full of vivid mental picture notice the restraint of it for the main character of he case psychometry could be depend upon and the scrap of paper he hand have touch be sufficient to give to another mind -- a sensitive and sympathetic mind -- clear mental picture of what be go on i think i have a very sound general idea of he problem so there may be excitement after all john silence wait a moment before he reply something very serious be amiss there he say gravely at length some one -- not himself i gather -- have be meddle with a rather dangerous kind of gunpowder so -- yes there may be excitement as you put it and my duty i ask with a decidedly grow interest remember i be you ` assistant ' behave like a intelligent confidential secretary observe everything without seem to say nothing -- nothing that mean anything be present at all interview i may ask a good deal of you for if my impression be correct this be -- he break off suddenly but i will not tell you my impression yet he resume after a moment 's thought just watch and listen as the case proceed form you own impression and cultivate you intuition we come as ordinary visitor of course he add a twinkle show for a instant in he eye hence the gun though disappointed not to hear more i recognize the wisdom of he word and know how valueless my impression would be once the powerful suggestion of have hear he own lay behind they i likewise reflect that intuition join to a sense of humor be of more use to a man than double the quantity of mere brain as such before put the letter away however he hand it back tell I to place it against my forehead for a few moment and then describe any picture that come spontaneously into my mind do not deliberately look for anything just imagine you see the inside of the eyelid and wait for picture that rise against its dark screen i follow he instruction make my mind as nearly blank as possible but no vision come i see nothing but the line of light that pass to and fro like the change of a kaleidoscope across the blackness a momentary sensation of warmth come and go curiously you see -- what he ask presently nothing i be oblige to admit disappointedly nothing but the usual flash of light one always see only perhaps they be more vivid than usual he say nothing by way of comment or reply and they group themselves now and then i continue with painful candor for i long to see the picture he have speak of group themselves into globe and round ball of fire and the line that flash about sometimes look like triangle and cross -- almost like geometrical figure nothing more i open my eye again and give he back the letter it make my head hot i say feeling somehow unworthy for not see anything of interest but the look in he eye arrest my attention at once that sensation of heat be important he say significantly it be certainly real and rather uncomfortable i reply hope he would expand and explain there be a distinct feeling of warmth -- internal warmth somewhere -- oppressive in a sense that be interesting he remark put the letter back in he pocket and settle himself in the corner with newspaper and book he vouchsafe nothing more and i know the uselessness of try to make he talk follow he example i settle likewise with magazine into my corner but when i close my eye again to look for the flash light and the sensation of heat i find nothing but the usual phantasmagoria of the day 's event -- face scene memory -- and in due course i fall asleep and then see nothing at all of any kind when we leave the train after six hour ' travel at a little wayside station standing without tree in a world of sand and heather the late October shadow have already drop they sombre veil upon the landscape and the sun dip almost out of sight behind the moorland hill in a high dogcart behind a fast horse we be soon rattle across the undulating stretch of a open and bleak country the keen air sting we cheek and the scent of pine and bracken strong about we bare hill be faintly visible against the horizon and the coachman point to a bank of distant shadow on we leave where he tell we the sea lay occasional stone farmhouse stand back from the road among straggle fir tree and large black barn that seem to shift past we with a movement of they own in the gloom be the only sign of humanity and civilisation that we see until at the end of a brace five mile the light of the lodge gate flare before we and we plunge into a thick grove of pine tree that conceal the manor house up to the moment of actual arrival colonel wragge himself meet we in the hall he be the typical army officer who have see service real service and find himself in the process he be tall and well build broad in the shoulder but lean as a greyhound with grave eye rather stern and a moustache turn gray i judge he to be about sixty year of age but he movement show a suppleness of strength and agility that contradict the year the face be full of character and resolution the face of a man to be depend upon and the straight gray eye it seem to I wear a veil of perplexed anxiety that he make no attempt to disguise the whole appearance of the man at once clothe the adventure with gravity and importance a matter that give such a man cause for serious alarm i feel must be something real and of genuine moment he speech and manner as he welcome we be like he letter simple and sincere he have a nature as direct and undeviating as a bullet thus he show plainly he surprise that dr silence have not come alone my confidential secretary mr hubbard the doctor say introduce I and the steady gaze and powerful shake of the hand i then receive be well calculate i remember think to drive home the impression that here be a man who be not to be trifle with and whose perplexity must spring from some very real and tangible cause and quite obviously he be relieve that we have come he welcome be unmistakably genuine he lead we at once into a room half library half smoking-room that open out of the low-ceilinged hall the manor house give the impression of a rambling and glorified farmhouse solid ancient comfortable and wholly unpretentious and so it be only the heat of the place strike I as unnatural this room with the blaze fire may have seem uncomfortably warm after the long drive through the night air yet it seem to I that the hall itself and the whole atmosphere of the house breathe a warmth that hardly belong to well-filled grate or the pipe of hot air and water it be not the heat of the greenhouse it be a oppressive heat that somehow get into the head and mind it stir a curious sense of uneasiness in I and i catch myself think of the sensation of warmth that have emanate from the letter in the train i hear he thank dr silence for have come there be no preamble and the exchange of civility be of the briefest description evidently here be a man who like my companion love action rather than talk he manner be straightforward and direct i see he in a flash : puzzle worried harass into a state of alarm by something he could not comprehend force to deal with thing he would have prefer to despise yet face it all with dogged seriousness and make no attempt to conceal that he feel secretly ashamed of he incompetence so i can not offer you much entertainment beyond that of my own company and the queer business that have be go on here and be still go on he say with a slight inclination of the head towards I by way of include I in he confidence i think colonel wragge reply john silence impressively that we shall none of we find the time hang heavy i gather we shall have we hand full the two man look at one another for the space of some seconds and there be a indefinable quality in they silence which for the first time make I admit a swift question into my mind and i wonder a little at my rashness in come with so little reflection into a big case of this incalculable doctor but no answer suggest itself and to withdraw be of course inconceivable the gate have close behind I now and the spirit of the adventure be already besiege my mind with its advance guard of a thousand little hope and fear explain that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anything serious as no reference be ever make before he sister he lead the way upstairs and show we personally to we room and it be just as i be finish dress that a knock come at my door and dr silence enter he be always what be call a serious man so that even in moment of comedy you feel he never lose sight of the profound gravity of life but as he come across the room to I i catch the expression of he face and understand in a flash that he be now in he most grave and earnest mood he look almost troubled i stop fumble with my black tie and stare it be serious he say speaking in a low voice more so even than i imagine colonel wragge 's control over he thought conceal a great deal in my psychometrising of the letter i look in to warn you to keep yourself well in hand -- generally speak haunt house i ask conscious of a distinct shiver down my back but he smile gravely at the question haunt house of life more likely he reply and a look come into he eye which i have only see there when a human soul be in the toil and he be thick in the fight of rescue he be stir in the deep colonel wragge -- or the sister i ask hurriedly for the gong be sound neither directly he say from the door something far older something very very remote indeed this thing have to do with the age unless i be mistaken greatly the age on which the mist of memory have long lain undisturbed he come across the floor very quickly with a finger on he lip look at I with a peculiar searchingness of gaze be you aware yet of anything -- odd here he ask in a whisper anything you can not quite define for instance tell I hubbard for i want to know all you impression they may help I i shake my head avoid he gaze for there be something in the eye that scare I a little but he be so in earnest that i set my mind keenly search nothing yet i reply truthfully wish i could confess to a real emotion nothing but the strange heat of the place he give a little jump forward in my direction the heat again that be it he exclaim as though glad of my corroboration and how would you describe it perhaps he ask quickly with a hand on the door knob it do not seem like ordinary physical heat i say casting about in my thought for a definition more a mental heat he interrupt a glowing of thought and desire a sort of feverish warmth of the spirit be not that it i admit that he have exactly describe my sensation good he say as he open the door and with a indescribable gesture that combine a warn to be ready with a sign of praise for my correct intuition he be go i hurry after he and find the two man wait for I in front of the fire i ought to warn you we host be say as i come in that my sister whom you will meet at dinner be not aware of the real object of you visit she be under the impression that we be interested in the same line of study -- folklore -- and that you research have lead to my seek acquaintance she come to dinner in she chair you know it will be a great pleasure to she to meet you both we have few visitor so that on enter the dining-room we be prepare to find miss wragge already at she place seat in a sort of bath-chair she be a vivacious and charming old lady with smile expression and bright eye and she chat all through dinner with unfailing spontaneity she have that face unlined and fresh that some people carry through life from the cradle to the grave she smooth plump cheek be all pink and white and she hair still dark be divide into two glossy and sleek half on either side of a careful parting she wear gold-rimmed glass and at she throat be a large scarab of green jasper that make a very handsome brooch she brother and dr silence talk little so that most of the conversation be carry on between herself and I and she tell I a great deal about the history of the old house most of which i fear i listen to with but half a ear and when cromwell stay here she babble on he occupy the very room upstairs that use to be mine but my brother think it safer for I to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire and this sentence have stay in my memory only because of the sudden way she brother interrupt she and instantly lead the conversation on to another topic the pass reference to fire seem to have disturb he and thenceforward he direct the talk himself it be difficult to believe that this lively and animated old lady sit beside I and take so eager a interest in the affair of life be practically we understand without the use of she lower limb and that she whole existence for year have be pass between the sofa the bed and the bath-chair in which she chat so naturally at the dinner table she make no allusion to she affliction until the dessert be reach and then touch a bell she make we a witty little speech about leave we like time on noiseless foot and be wheel out of the room by the butler and carry off to she apartment at the other end of the house and the rest of we be not long in follow suit for dr silence and myself be quite as eager to learn the nature of we errand as we host be to impart it to we he lead we down a long flagged passage to a room at the very end of the house a room provide with double door and window i see heavily shutter book line the wall on every side and a large desk in the bow window be pile up with volume some open some shut some show scrap of paper stick between the leaf and all smother in a general cataract of untidy foolscap and loose-half sheet my study and workroom explain colonel wragge with a delightful touch of innocent pride as though he be a very serious scholar he place arm-chair for we round the fire here he add significantly we shall be safe from interruption and can talk securely during dinner the manner of the doctor have be all that be natural and spontaneous though it be impossible for I know he as i do not to be aware that he be subconsciously very keenly alert and already receive upon the ultra-sensitive surface of he mind various and vivid impression and there be now something in the gravity of he face as well as in the significant tone of colonel wragge 's speech and something too in the fact that we three be shut away in this private chamber about to listen to thing probably strange and certainly mysterious -- something in all this that touch my imagination sharply and send a undeniable thrill along my nerve take the chair indicate by my host i light my cigar and wait for the opening of the attack fully conscious that we be now too far go in the adventure to admit of withdrawal and wonder a little anxiously where it be go to lead what i expect precisely it be hard to say nothing definite perhaps only the sudden change be dramatic a few hour before the prosaic atmosphere of piccadilly be about I and now i be sit in a secret chamber of this remote old building wait to hear a account of thing that hold possibly the genuine heart of terror i thought of the dreary moor and hill outside and the dark pine copse sough in the wind of night i remember my companion 's singular word up in my bedroom before dinner and then i turn and note carefully the stern countenance of the colonel as he face we and light he big black cigar before speak the threshold of a adventure i reflect as i wait for the first word be always the most thrilling moment -- until the climax come but colonel wragge hesitate -- mentally -- a long time before he begin he talk briefly of we journey the weather the country and other comparatively trivial topic while he seek about in he mind for a appropriate entry into the subject that be uppermost in the thought of all of we the fact be he find it a difficult matter to speak of at all and it be dr silence who finally show he the way over the hedge mr hubbard will take a few note when you be ready -- you will not object he suggest i can give my undivided attention in this way by all means turn to reach some of the loose sheet on the write table and glancing at I he still hesitate a little i think the fact be he say apologetically i wonder if it be quite fair to trouble you so soon the daylight might suit you better to hear what i have to tell you sleep i mean might be less disturbed perhaps i appreciate you thoughtfulness john silence reply with he gentle smile take command as it be from that moment but really we be both quite immune there be nothing i think that could prevent either of we sleep except -- a outbreak of fire or some such very physical disturbance colonel wragge raise he eye and look fixedly at he this reference to a outbreak of fire i feel sure be make with a purpose it certainly have the desire effect of remove from we host 's manner the last sign of hesitancy forgive I he say of course i know nothing of you method in matter of this kind -- so perhaps you would like I to begin at once and give you a outline of the situation dr silence bow he agreement i can then take my precaution accordingly he add calmly the soldier look up for a moment as though he do not quite gather the meaning of these word but he make no further comment and turn at once to tackle a subject on which he evidently talk with diffidence and unwillingness it be all so utterly out of my line of thing he begin puff out cloud of cigar smoke between he word and there be so little to tell with any real evidence behind it that it be almost impossible to make a consecutive story for you it be the total cumulative effect that be so -- so disquieting he choose he word with care as though determine not to travel one hair 's breadth beyond the truth i come into this place twenty year ago when my elder brother die he continue but could not afford to live here then my sister whom you meet at dinner keep house for he till the end and during all these year while i be see service abroad she have a eye to the place -- for we never get a satisfactory tenant -- and see that it be not allow to go to ruin i myself take possession however only a year ago my brother he go on after a perceptible pause spend much of he time away too he be a great traveller and fill the house with stuff he bring home from all over the world the laundry -- a small detach building beyond the servant ' quarter -- he turn into a regular little museum the curio and thing i have clear away -- they collect dust and be always get break -- but the laundry-house you shall see tomorrow colonel wragge speak with such deliberation and with so many pause that this begin take he a long time but at this point he come to a full stop altogether evidently there be something he wish to say that cost he considerable effort at length he look up steadily into my companion 's face may i ask you -- that be if you will not think it strange he say and a sort of hush come over he voice and manner whether you have notice anything at all unusual -- anything queer since you come into the house dr silence answer without a moment 's hesitation i have he say there be a curious sensation of heat in the place ah exclaim the other with a slight start you _ have _ notice it this unaccountable heat -- but its cause i gather be not in the house itself -- but outside i be astonish to hear the doctor add colonel wragge rise from he chair and turn to unhook a frame map that hang upon the wall i get the impression that the movement be make with the deliberate purpose of conceal he face you diagnosis i believe be amazingly accurate he say after a moment turn round with the map in he hand though of course i can have no idea how you should guess -- john silence shrug he shoulder expressively merely my impression he say if you pay attention to impression and do not allow they to be confuse by deduction of the intellect you will often find they surprisingly uncannily accurate colonel wragge resume he seat and lay the map upon he knee he face be very thoughtful as he plunge abruptly again into he story on come into possession he say look we alternately in the face i find a crop of story of the most extraordinary and impossible kind i have ever hear -- story which at first i treat with amuse indifference but later be force to regard seriously if only to keep my servant these story i think i trace to the fact of my brother 's death -- and in a way i think so still he lean forward and hand the map to dr silence it be a old plan of the estate he explain but accurate enough for we purpose and i wish you would note the position of the plantation mark upon it especially those near the house that one indicate the spot with he finger be call the twelve acre plantation it be just there on the side nearest the house that my brother and the head keeper meet they death he speak as a man force to recognize fact that he deplore and would have prefer to leave untouched -- thing he personally would rather have treat with ridicule if possible it make he word peculiarly dignified and impressive and i listen with a increase uneasiness as to the sort of help the doctor would look to I for later it seem as though i be a spectator of some drama of mystery in which any moment i might be summon to play a part it be twenty year ago continue the colonel but there be much talk about it at the time unfortunately and you may perhaps have hear of the affair stride the keeper be a passionate hot-tempered man but i regret to say so be my brother and quarrel between they seem to have be frequent i do not recall the affair say the doctor may i ask what be the cause of death something in he voice make I prick up my ear for the reply the keeper it be say from suffocation and at the inquest the doctor aver that both man have be dead the same length of time when find and you brother ask john silence notice the omission and listen intently equally mysterious say we host speaking in a low voice with effort but there be one distressing feature i think i ought to mention for those who see the face -- i do not see it myself -- and though stride carry a gun its chamber be undischarged -- he stammer and hesitate with confusion again that sense of terror move between he word he stick yes say the chief listener sympathetically my brother 's face they say look as though it have be scorch it have be sweep as it be by something that burn -- blast it be i be tell quite dreadful the body be find lie side by side face downward both point away from the wood as though they have be in the act of run and not more than a dozen yard from its edge dr silence make no comment he appear to be study the map attentively i do not see the face myself repeat the other he manner somehow express the sense of awe he contrived to keep out of he voice but my sister unfortunately do and she present state i believe to be entirely due to the shock it give to she nerve she never can be bring to refer to it naturally and i be even incline to think that the memory have mercifully be permit to vanish from she mind but she speak of it at the time as a face sweep by flame -- blast john silence look up from he contemplation of the map but with the air of one who wish to listen not to speak and presently colonel wragge go on with he account he stand on the mat he broad shoulder hide most of the mantelpiece they all centre about this particular plantation these story that be to be expect for the people here be as superstitious as irish peasantry and though i make one or two example among they to stop the foolish talk it have no effect and new version come to my ear every week you may imagine how little good dismissal do when i tell you that the servant dismiss themselves it be not the house servant but the man who work on the estate outside the keeper give notice one after another none of they with any reason i could accept the forester refuse to enter the wood and the beater to beat in it word fly all over the countryside that twelve acre plantation be a place to be avoid day or night there come a point the colonel go on now well in he swing when i feel compel to make investigation on my own account i could not kill the thing by ignore it so i collect and analyze the story at first hand for this twelve acre wood you will see by the map come rather near home its lower end if you will look almost touch the end of the back lawn as i will show you tomorrow and its dense growth of pine form the chief protection the house enjoy from the east wind that blow up from the sea and in olden day before my brother interfere with it and frighten all the game away it be one of the best pheasant covert on the whole estate and what form if i may ask do this interference take ask dr silence in detail i can not tell you for i do not know -- except that i understand it be the subject of he frequent difference with the head keeper but during the last two year of he life when he give up travel and settle down here he take a special interest in this wood and for some unaccountable reason begin to build a low stone wall around it this wall be never finish but you shall see the ruin tomorrow in the daylight and the result of you investigation -- these story i mean the doctor break in anxious to keep he to the main issue yes i be come to that he say slowly but the wood first for this wood out of which they grow like mushroom have nothing in any way peculiar about it it be very thickly grow and rise to a clearer part in the center a sort of mound where there be a circle of large boulder -- old druid stone i be tell at another place there be a small pond there be nothing distinctive about it that i could mention -- just a ordinary pine-wood a very ordinary pine-wood -- only the tree be a bit twisted in the trunk some of 'em and very dense nothing more and the story well none of they have anything to do with my poor brother or the keeper as you might have expect and they be all odd -- such odd thing i mean to invent or imagine i never could make out how these people get such notion into they head he pause a moment to relight he cigar there be no regular path through it he resume puff vigorously but the field round it be constantly use and one of the gardener whose cottage lie over that way declare he often see move light in it at night and luminous shape like globe of fire over the top of the tree skim and float and make a soft hiss sound -- most of 'em say that in fact -- and another man see shape flit in and out among the tree thing that be neither man nor animal and all faintly luminous no one ever pretend to see human form -- always queer huge thing they could not properly describe sometimes the whole wood be light up and one fellow -- he be still here and you shall see he -- have a most circumstantial yarn about have see great star lie on the ground round the edge of the wood at regular interval -- what kind of star put in john silence sharply in a sudden way that make I start oh i do not know quite ordinary star i think he say only very large and apparently blaze as though the ground be alight he be too terrify to go close and examine and he have never see they since he stoop and stir the fire into a welcome blaze -- welcome for its blaze of light rather than for its heat in the room there be already a strange pervade sensation of warmth that be oppressive in its effect and far from comforting of course he go on straighten up again on the mat this be all commonplace enough -- this see light and figure at night most of these fellow drink and imagination and terror between they may account for almost anything but other see thing in broad daylight one of the woodman a sober respectable man take the shortcut home to he midday meal and swear he be follow the whole length of the wood by something that never show itself but dodge from tree to tree always keep out of sight yet solid enough to make the branch sway and the twig snap on the ground and it make a noise he declare -- but really -- the speaker stop and give a short laugh -- it be too absurd -- _ please _ insist the doctor for it be these small detail that give I the best clue always -- it make a crackling noise he say like a bonfire those be he very word : like the crackling of a bonfire finish the soldier with a repetition of he short laugh most interesting dr silence observe gravely please omit nothing yes he go on and it be soon after that the fire begin -- the fire in the wood they start mysteriously burn in the patch of coarse white grass that cover the more open part of the plantation no one ever actually see they start but many myself among the number have see they burn and smoulder they be always small and circular in shape and for all the world like a picnic fire the head keeper have a dozen explanation from spark fly out of the house chimney to the sunlight focus through a dewdrop but none of they i must admit convince I as be in the least likely or probable they be most singular i consider most singular these mysterious fire and i be glad to say that they come only at rather long interval and never seem to spread but the keeper have other queer story as well and about thing that be verifiable he declare that no life ever willingly enter the plantation more that no life exist in it at all no bird nested in the tree or fly into they shade he set countless trap but never catch so much as a rabbit or a weasel animal avoid it and more than once he have pick up dead creature round the edge that bear no obvious sign of how they have meet they death moreover he tell I one extraordinary tale about he retriever chase some invisible creature across the field one day when he be out with he gun the dog suddenly point at something in the field at he foot and then give chase yelp like a mad thing it follow its imaginary quarry to the border of the wood and then go in -- a thing he have never know it to do before the moment it cross the edge -- it be darkish in there even in daylight -- it begin fight in the most frenzied and terrific fashion it make he afraid to interfere he say and at last when the dog come out hang its tail down and pant he find something like white hair stick to its jaw and bring it to show I i tell you these detail because -- they be important believe I the doctor stop he and you have it still this hair he ask it disappear in the oddest way the colonel explain it be curious look stuff something like asbestos and i send it to be analyze by the local chemist but either the man get wind of its origin or else he do not like the look of it for some reason because he return it to I and say it be neither animal vegetable nor mineral so far as he could make out and he do not wish to have anything to do with it i put it away in paper but a week later on open the package -- it be go oh the story be simply endless i could tell you hundred all on the same line and personal experience of you own colonel wragge ask john silence earnestly he manner show the greatest possible interest and sympathy the soldier give a almost imperceptible start he look distinctly uncomfortable nothing i think he say slowly nothing -- er -- i should like to rely on i mean nothing i have the right to speak of perhaps -- yet he mouth close with a snap dr silence after wait a little to see if he would add to he reply do not seek to press he on the point well he resume presently and as though he would speak contemptuously yet dare not this sort of thing have go on at interval ever since it spread like wildfire of course mysterious chatter of this kind and people begin trespassing all over the estate come to see the wood and make themselves a general nuisance notice of man-trap and spring-gun only seem to increase they persistence and -- think of it he snort some local research society actually write and ask permission for one of they member to spend a night in the wood bolder fool who do not write for leave come and take away bit of bark from the tree and give they to clairvoyant who invent in they turn a further batch of tale there be simply no end to it all most distressing and annoying i can well believe interpose the doctor then suddenly the phenomenon cease as mysteriously as they have begin and the interest flag the tale stop people get interested in something else it all seem to die out this be last July i can tell you exactly for i have keep a diary more or less of what happen ah but now quite recently within the past three week it have all revive again with a rush -- with a kind of furious attack so to speak it have really become unbearable you may imagine what it mean and the general state of affair when i say that the possibility of leave have occur to I incendiarism suggest dr silence half under he breath but not so low that colonel wragge do not hear he by jove sir you take the very word out of my mouth exclaim the astonished man glance from the doctor to I and from I to the doctor and rattle the money in he pocket as though some explanation of my friend 's divine power be to be find that way it be only that you be think very vividly the doctor say quietly and you thought form picture in my mind before you utter they it be merely a little elementary thought-reading he intention i saw be not to perplex the good man but to impress he with he power so as to ensure obedience later good lord i have no idea -- he do not finish the sentence and dive again abruptly into he narrative i do not see anything myself i must admit but the story of independent eye-witness be to the effect that line of light like stream of thin fire move through the wood and sometimes be see to shoot out precisely as flame might shoot out -- in the direction of this house there he explain in a louder voice that make I jump point with a thick finger to the map where the westerly fringe of the plantation come up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of the house -- where it link on to those dark patch which be laurel shrubbery run right up to the back premise -- that be where these light be see they pass from the wood to the shrubbery and in this way reach the house itself like silent rocket one man describe they rapid as lightning and exceedingly bright and this evidence you speak of they actually reach the side of the house they have leave a mark of scorch on the wall -- the wall of the laundry building at the other end you shall see 'em tomorrow he point to the map to indicate the spot and then straighten himself and glare about the room as though he have say something no one could believe and expect contradiction scorch -- just as the face be the doctor murmur look significantly at I scorch -- yes repeat the colonel fail to catch the rest of the sentence in he excitement there be a prolonged silence in the room in which i hear the gurgling of the oil in the lamp and the click of the coal and the heavy breathing of we host the most unwelcome sensation be creep about my spine and i wonder whether my companion would scorn I utterly if i ask to sleep on the sofa in he room it be eleven o'clock i saw by the clock on the mantelpiece we have cross the divide line and be now well in the movement of the adventure the fight between my interest and my dread become acute but even if turn back have be possible i think the interest would have easily gain the day i have enemy of course i hear the colonel 's rough voice break into the pause presently and have discharge a number of servant -- it be not that put in john silence briefly you think not in a sense i be glad and yet -- there be some thing that can be meet and deal with -- he leave the sentence unfinished and look down at the floor with a expression of grim severity that betray a momentary glimpse of character this fight man loathe and abhor the thought of a enemy he could not see and come to grip with presently he move over and sit down in the chair between we something like a sigh escape he dr silence say nothing my sister of course be keep in ignorance as far as possible of all this he say disconnectedly and as if talk to himself but even if she know she would find matter-of-fact explanation i only wish i could i be sure they exist there come then a interval in the conversation that be very significant it do not seem a real pause or the silence real silence for both man continue to think so rapidly and strongly that one almost imagine they thought clothe themselves in word in the air of the room i be more than a little key up with the strange excitement of all i have hear but what stimulate my nerve more than anything else be the obvious fact that the doctor be clearly upon the trail of discovery in he mind at that moment i believe he have already solve the nature of this perplexing psychical problem he face be like a mask and he employ the absolute minimum of gesture and word all he energy be direct inwards and by those incalculable method and process he have master with such infinite patience and study i feel sure he be already in touch with the force behind these singular phenomenon and lay he deep plan for bring they into the open and then effectively deal with they colonel wragge meanwhile grow more and more fidgety from time to time he turn towards my companion as though about to speak yet always change he mind at the last moment once he go over and open the door suddenly apparently to see if any one be listen at the keyhole for he disappear a moment between the two door and i then hear he open the outer one he stand there for some seconds and make a noise as though he be sniff the air like a dog then he close both door cautiously and come back to the fireplace a strange excitement seem grow upon he evidently he be try to make up he mind to say something that he find it difficult to say and john silence as i rightly judge be wait patiently for he to choose he own opportunity and he own way of say it at last he turn and face we square he great shoulder and stiffen perceptibly dr silence look up sympathetically you own experience help I most he observe quietly the fact be the colonel say speak very low this past week there have be outbreak of fire in the house itself three separate outbreak -- and all -- in my sister 's room yes the doctor say as if this be just what he have expect to hear utterly unaccountable -- all of they add the other and then sit down i begin to understand something of the reason of he excitement he be realize at last that the natural explanation he have hold to all along be become impossible and he hate it it make he angry fortunately he go on she be out each time and do not know but i have make she sleep now in a room on the ground floor a wise precaution the doctor say simply he ask one or two question the fire have start in the curtain -- once by the window and once by the bed the third time smoke have be discover by the maid come from the cupboard and it be find that miss wragge 's clothes hang on the hook be smoulder the doctor listen attentively but make no comment and now can you tell I he say presently what you own feeling about it be -- you general impression it sound foolish to say so reply the soldier after a moment 's hesitation but i feel exactly as i have often feel on active service in my indian campaign : just as if the house and all in it be in a state of siege as though a conceal enemy be encamp about we -- in ambush somewhere he utter a soft nervous laugh as if the next sign of smoke would precipitate a panic -- a dreadful panic the picture come before I of the night shadow the house and the twist pine tree he have describe crowd about it conceal some powerful enemy and glancing at the resolute face and figure of the old soldier force at length to he confession i understand something of all he have be through before he seek the assistance of john silence and tomorrow unless i be mistaken be full moon say the doctor suddenly watch the other 's face for the effect of he apparently careless word colonel wragge give a uncontrollable start and he face for the first time show unmistakable pallor what in the world -- he begin he lip quiver only that i be begin to see light in this extraordinary affair return the other calmly and if my theory be correct each month when the moon be at the full should witness a increase in the activity of the phenomenon i do not see the connection colonel wragge answer almost savagely but i be bind to say my diary bear you out he wear the most puzzle expression i have ever see upon a honest face but he abhor this additional corroboration of a explanation that perplex he i confess he repeat i can not see the connection why should you say the doctor with he first laugh that evening he get up and hang the map upon the wall again but i do -- because these thing be my special study -- and let I add that i have yet to come across a problem that be not natural and have not a natural explanation it be merely a question of how much one know -- and admit colonel wragge eye he with a new and curious respect in he face but he feeling be soothe moreover the doctor 's laugh and change of manner come as a relief to all and break the spell of grave suspense that have hold we so long we all rise and stretch we limb and take little walk about the room i be glad dr silence if you will allow I to say so that you be here he say simply very glad indeed and now i fear i have keep you both up very late with a glance to include I for you must be tired and ready for you bed i have tell you all there be to tell he add and tomorrow you must feel perfectly free to take any step you think necessary the end be abrupt yet natural for there be nothing more to say and neither of these man talk for mere talking 's sake out in the cold and chilly hall he light we candle and take we upstairs the house be at rest and still every one asleep we move softly through the window on the stair we see the moonlight fall across the lawn throw deep shadow the nearer pine tree be just visible in the distance a wall of impenetrable blackness we host come for a moment to we room to see that we have everything he point to a coil of strong rope lie beside the window fasten to the wall by means of a iron ring evidently it have be recently put in i do not think we shall need it dr silence say with a smile i trust not reply we host gravely i sleep quite close to you across the landing he whisper point to he door and if you -- if you want anything in the night you will know where to find I he wish we pleasant dream and disappear down the passage into he room shade the candle with he big muscular hand from the draught john silence stop I a moment before i go you know what it be i ask with a excitement that even overcome my weariness yes he say i be almost sure and you not the smallest notion he look disappointed but not half as disappointed as i feel egypt he whisper egypt ii nothing happen to disturb I in the night -- nothing that be except a nightmare in which colonel wragge chase I amid thin streak of fire and he sister always prevent my escape by suddenly rise up out of the ground in she chair -- dead the deep baying of dog wake I once just before the dawn it must have be for i see the window frame against the sky there be a flash of lightning too i think as i turn over in bed and it be warm for October oppressively warm it be after eleven o'clock when we host suggest go out with the gun these we understand be a somewhat thin disguise for we true purpose personally i be glad to be in the open air for the atmosphere of the house be heavy with presentiment the sense of impend disaster hang over all fear stalk the passage and lurk in the corner of every room it be a house haunt but really haunt not by some vague shadow of the dead but by a definite though incalculable influence that be actively alive and dangerous at the least smell of smoke the entire household quiver a odour of burn i be convince would paralyse all the inmate for the servant though professedly ignorant by the master 's unspoken order yet share the common dread and the hideous uncertainty join with this display of so spiteful and calculate a spirit of malignity provide a kind of black doom that drape not only the wall but also the mind of the people live within they only the bright and cheerful vision of old miss wragge be push about the house in she noiseless chair chat and nod briskly to every one she meet prevent we from give way entirely to the depression which govern the majority the sight of she be like a gleam of sunshine through the depths of some ill-omened wood and just as we go out i see she be wheel along by she attendant into the sunshine of the back lawn and catch she cheery smile as she turn she head and wish we good sport the morning be October at its best sunshine glisten on the dew-drenched grass and on leaf turn golden-red the dainty messenger of come hoar-frost be already in the air a search for permanent winter quarter from the wide moor that everywhere sweep up against the sky like a purple sea splash by the occasional gray of rocky cleft there steal down the cool and perfumed wind of the west and the keen taste of the sea run through all like a master-flavour bear over the space perhaps by the seagull that cry and circle high in the air but we host take little interest in this sparkling beauty and have no thought of show off the scenery of he property he mind be otherwise intent and for that matter so be we own those bleak moor and hill stretch unbroken for hour he say with a sweep of the hand and over there some four mile point in another direction lie s -- bay a long swampy inlet of the sea haunt by myriad of seabird on the other side of the house be the plantation and pine-wood i think we would get the dog and go first to the twelve acre wood i tell you about last night it be quite near we find the dog in the stable and i recall the deep baying of the night when a fine bloodhound and two great danes leap out to greet we singular companion for gun i think to myself as we strike out across the field and the great creature bound and run beside we nose to grind the conversation be scanty john silence 's grave face do not encourage talk he wear the expression i know well -- that look of earnest solicitude which mean that he whole be be deeply absorb and preoccupy frightened i have never see he but anxious often -- it always move I to witness it -- and he be anxious now on the way back you shall see the laundry building colonel wragge observe shortly for he too find little to say we shall attract less attention then yet not all the crisp beauty of the morning seem able to dispel the feeling of uneasy dread that gather increasingly about we mind as we go in a very few minute a clump of pine tree conceal the house from view and we find ourselves on the outskirts of a densely grow plantation of conifer colonel wragge stop abruptly and produce a map from he pocket explain once more very briefly its position with regard to the house he show how it run up almost to the wall of the laundry building -- though at the moment beyond we actual view -- and point to the window of he sister 's bedroom where the fire have be the room now empty look straight on to the wood then glance nervously about he and call the dog to heel he propose that we should enter the plantation and make as thorough examination of it as we think worth while the dog he add might perhaps be persuade to accompany we a little way -- and he point to where they cower at he foot -- but he doubt it neither voice nor whip will get they very far i be afraid he say i know by experience if you have no objection reply dr silence with decision and speak almost for the first time we will make we examination alone -- mr hubbard and myself it will be best so he tone be absolutely final and the colonel acquiesce so politely that even a less intuitive man than myself must have see that he be genuinely relieve you doubtless have good reason he say merely that i wish to obtain my impression uncoloured this delicate clue i be work on might be so easily blur by the thought-current of another mind with strongly preconceived idea perfectly i understand rejoin the soldier though with a expression of countenance that plainly contradict he word then i will wait here with the dog and we 'll have a look at the laundry on we way home i turn once to look back as we clamber over the low stone wall build by the late owner and see he straight soldierly figure standing in the sunlit field watch we with a curiously intent look on he face there be something to I incongruous yet distinctly pathetic in the man 's effort to meet all far-fetched explanation of the mystery with contempt and at the same time in he stolid unswerving investigation of it all he nod at I and make a gesture of farewell with he hand that picture of he stand in the sunshine with he big dog steadily watch we remain with I to this day dr silence lead the way in among the twisted trunk plant closely together in serried rank and i follow sharp at he heel the moment we be out of sight he turn and put down he gun against the root of a big tree and i do likewise we shall hardly want these cumbersome weapon of murder he observe with a pass smile you be sure of you clue then i ask at once burst with curiosity yet fear to betray it lest he should think I unworthy he own method be so absolutely simple and untheatrical i be sure of my clue he answer gravely and i think we have come just in time you shall know in due course for the present -- be content to follow and observe and think steadily the support of you mind will help I he voice have that quiet mastery in it which lead man to face death with a sort of happiness and pride i would have follow he anywhere at that moment at the same time he word convey a sense of dread seriousness i catch the thrill of he confidence but also in this broad light of day i feel the measure of alarm that lay behind you still have no strong impression he ask nothing happen in the night for instance no vivid dreaming he look closely for my answer i be aware i sleep almost a unbroken sleep i be tremendously tired you know and but for the oppressive heat -- good you still notice the heat then he say to himself rather than expect a answer and the lightning he add that lightning out of a clear sky -- that flash -- do you notice _ that _ i answer truly that i think i have see a flash during a moment of wakefulness and he then draw my attention to certain fact before move on you remember the sensation of warmth when you put the letter to you forehead in the train the heat generally in the house last evening and as you now mention in the night you hear too the colonel 's story about the appearance of fire in this wood and in the house itself and the way he brother and the gamekeeper come to they death twenty year ago i nod wonder what in the world it all mean and you get no clue from these fact he ask a trifle surprised i search every corner of my mind and imagination for some inkling of he meaning but be oblige to admit that i understand nothing so far never mind you will later and now he add we will go over the wood and see what we can find he word explain to I something of he method we be to keep we mind alert and report to each other the least fancy that cross the picture-gallery of we thought then just as we start he turn again to I with a final warning and for you safety he say earnestly imagine _ now _ -- and for that matter imagine always until we leave this place -- imagine with the utmost keenness that you be surround by a shell that protect you picture yourself inside a protective envelope and build it up with the most intense imagination you can evoke pour the whole force of you thought and will into it believe vividly all through this adventure that such a shell construct of you thought will and imagination surround you completely and that nothing can pierce it to attack he speak with dramatic conviction gaze hard at I as though to enforce he meaning and then move forward and begin to pick he way over the rough tussocky ground into the wood and meanwhile know the efficacy of he prescription i adopt it to the best of my ability the tree at once close about we like the night they branch meet overhead in a continuous tangle they stem creep closer and closer the brambly undergrowth thicken and multiply we tear we trousers scratch we hand and we eye fill with fine dust that make it most difficult to avoid the clinging prickly network of branch and creeper coarse white grass that catch we foot like string grow here and there in patch it crown the lump of peaty growth that stick up like human head fantastically dress thrust up at we out of the ground with crest of dead hair we stumble and flounder among they it be hard go and i could well conceive it impossible to find a way at all in the night-time we jump when possible from tussock to tussock and it seem as though we be spring among head on a battlefield and that this dead white grass conceal eye that turn to stare as we pass here and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spot of white light dazzling the sight but only make the surround gloom deeper by contrast and on two occasion we pass dark circular place in the grass where fire have eat they mark and leave a ring of ash dr silence point to they but without comment and without pause and the sight of they wake in I a singular realisation of the dread that lay so far only just out of sight in this adventure it be exhausting work and heavy go we keep close together the warmth too be extraordinary yet it do not seem the warmth of the body due to violent exertion but rather a inner heat of the mind that lay glowing hand of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind of steady blaze when my companion find himself too far in advance he wait for I to come up the place have evidently be untouch by hand of man keeper forester or sportsman for many a year and my thought as we advance painfully be not unlike the state of the wood itself -- dark confused full of a haunting wonder and the shadow of fear by this time all sign of the open field behind we be hide no single gleam penetrate we might have be grope in the heart of some primeval forest then suddenly the bramble and tussock and stringlike grass come to a end the tree open out and the ground begin to slope upward towards a large central mound we have reach the middle of the plantation and before we stand the broken druid stone we host have mention we walk easily up the little hill between the sparser stem and rest upon one of the ivy-covered boulder look round upon a comparatively open space as large perhaps as a small london square thinking of the ceremony and sacrifice this rough circle of prehistoric monolith might have witness i look up into my companion 's face with a unspoken question but he read my thought and shake he head we mystery have nothing to do with these dead symbol he say but with something perhaps even more ancient and of another country altogether egypt i say half under my breath hopelessly puzzle but recall he word in my bedroom he nod mentally i still flounder but he seem intensely preoccupy and it be no time for ask question so while he word circle unintelligibly in my mind i look round at the scene before I glad of the opportunity to recover breath and some measure of composure but hardly have i time to notice the twisted and contorted shape of many of the pine tree close at hand when dr silence lean over and touch I on the shoulder he point down the slope and the look i saw in he eye key up every nerve in my body to its utmost pitch a thin almost imperceptible column of blue smoke be rise among the tree some twenty yard away at the foot of the mound it curl up and up and disappear from sight among the tangled branch overhead it be scarcely thicker than the smoke from a small brand of burn wood protect yourself imagine you shell strongly whisper the doctor sharply and follow I closely he rise at once and move swiftly down the slope towards the smoke and i follow afraid to remain alone i hear the soft crunching of we step on the pine needle over he shoulder i watch the thin blue spiral without once take my eye off it i hardly know how to describe the peculiar sense of vague horror inspire in I by the sight of that streak of smoke pencil its way upward among the dark tree and the sensation of increase heat as we approach be phenomenal it be like walk towards a glowing yet invisible fire as we draw nearer he pace slacken then he stop and point and i see a small circle of burnt grass upon the ground the tussock be blacken and smoulder and from the center rise this line of smoke pale blue steady then i notice a movement of the atmosphere beside we as if the warm air be rise and the cooler air rush in to take its place : a little center of wind in the stillness overhead the bough stir and tremble where the smoke disappear otherwise not a tree sigh not a sound make itself hear the wood be still as a graveyard a horrible idea come to I that the course of nature be about to change without warn have change a little already that the sky would drop or the surface of the earth crash inwards like a broken bubble something certainly reach up to the citadel of my reason cause its throne to shake john silence move forward again i could not see he face but he attitude be plainly one of resolution of muscle and mind ready for vigorous action we be within ten foot of the blacken circle when the smoke of a sudden cease to rise and vanish the tail of the column disappear in the air above and at the same instant it seem to I that the sensation of heat pass from my face and the motion of the wind be go the calm spirit of the fresh October day resume command side by side we advance and examine the place the grass be smoulder the ground still hot the circle of burn earth be a foot to a foot and a half in diameter it look like a ordinary picnic fireplace i bent down cautiously to look but in a second i spring back with a involuntary cry of alarm for as the doctor stamp on the ash to prevent they spread a sound of hiss rise from the spot as though he have kick a living creature this hiss be faintly audible in the air it move past we away towards the thicker portion of the wood in the direction of we field and in a second dr silence have leave the fire and start in pursuit and then begin the most extraordinary hunt of invisibility i can ever conceive he go fast even at the beginning and of course it be perfectly obvious that he be follow something to judge by the poise of he head he keep he eye steadily at a certain level -- just above the height of a man -- and the consequence be he stumble a good deal over the roughness of the ground the hissing sound have stop there be no sound of any kind and what he see to follow be utterly beyond I i only know that in mortal dread of be leave behind and with a bite curiosity to see whatever there be to be see i follow as quickly as i could and even then barely succeed in keep up with he and as we go the whole mad jumble of the colonel 's story run through my brain touch a sense of frightened laughter that be only hold in check by the sight of this earnest hurry figure before I for john silence at work inspire I with a kind of awe he look so diminutive among these giant twisted tree while yet i know that he purpose and he knowledge be so great and even in hurry he be dignified the fancy that we be play some queer exaggerate game together meet the fact that we be two man dance upon the brink of some possible tragedy and the mingling of the two emotion in my mind be both grotesque and terrifying he never turn in he mad chase but push rapidly on while i panted after he like a figure in some unreasoning nightmare and as i run it come upon I that he have be aware all the time in he quiet internal way of many thing that he have keep for he own secret consideration he have be watch wait planning from the very moment we enter the shade of the wood by some inner concentrated process of mind dynamic if not actually magical he have be in direct contact with the source of the whole adventure the very essence of the real mystery and now the force be move to a climax something be about to happen something important something possibly dreadful every nerve every sense every significant gesture of the plunge figure before I proclaim the fact just as surely as the sky the wind and the face of the earth tell the bird the time to migrate and warn the animal that danger lurk and they must move in a few moment we reach the foot of the mound and enter the tangled undergrowth that lay between we and the sunlight of the field here the difficulty of fast travel increase a hundredfold there be bramble to dodge low bough to dive under and countless tree trunk close up to make a direct path impossible yet dr silence never seem to falter or hesitate he go diving jump dodge duck but ever in the same main direction follow a clean trail twice i trip and fall and both time when i pick myself up again i see he ahead of I still force a way like a dog after its quarry and sometimes like a dog he stop and point -- human point it be psychic point and each time he stop to point i hear that faint high hiss in the air beyond we the instinct of a infallible dowser possess he and he make no mistake at length abruptly i catch up with he and find that we stand at the edge of the shallow pond colonel wragge have mention in he account the night before it be long and narrow fill with dark brown water in which the tree be dimly reflect not a ripple stir its surface watch he cry out as i come up it be go to cross it be bind to betray itself the water be its natural enemy and we shall see the direction and even as he speak a thin line like the track of a water-spider shot swiftly across the shiny surface there be a ghost of steam in the air above and immediately i become aware of a odour of burn dr silence turn and shoot a glance at I that make I think of lightning i begin to shake all over quick he cry with excitement to the trail again we must run around it be go to the house the alarm in he voice quite terrify I without a false step i dash round the slippery bank and dive again at he heel into the sea of bush and tree trunk we be now in the thick of the very dense belt that run around the outer edge of the plantation and the field be near yet so dark be the tangle that it be some time before the first shaft of white sunlight become visible the doctor now run in zigzag he be follow something that dodge and double quite wonderfully yet have begin i fancy to move more slowly than before quick he cry in the light we shall lose it i still see nothing hear nothing catch no suggestion of a trail yet this man guide by some interior divine that seem infallible make no false turn though how he fail to crash headlong into the tree have remain a mystery to I ever since and then with a sudden rush we find ourselves on the skirt of the wood with the open field lie in bright sunshine before we eye too late i hear he cry a note of anguish in he voice it be out -- and by god it be make for the house i see the colonel standing in the field with he dog where we have leave he he be bend double peer into the wood where he hear we run and he straighten up like a bent whip release john silence dash pass call he to follow we shall lose the trail in the light i hear he cry as he run but quick we may yet get there in time that wild rush across the open field with the dog at we heel leap and bark and the elderly colonel behind we run as though for he life shall i ever forget it though i have only vague idea of the meaning of it all i put my best foot forward and be the youngest of the three i reach the house a easy first i draw up panting and turn to wait for the other but as i turn something move a little distance away catch my eye and in that moment i swear i experience the most overwhelming and singular shock of surprise and terror i have ever know or can conceive as possible for the front door be open and the waist of the house be narrow i could see through the hall into the dining-room beyond and so out on to the back lawn and there i see no less a sight than the figure of miss wragge -- run even at that distance it be plain that she have see I and be come fast towards I run with the frantic gait of a terror-stricken woman she have recover the use of she leg she face be a livid gray as of death itself but the general expression be one of laughter for she mouth be gaping and she eye always bright shone with the light of a wild merriment that seem the merriment of a child yet be singularly ghastly and that very second as she flee past I into she brother 's arm behind i smell again most unmistakably the odour of burning and to this day the smell of smoke and fire can come very near to turn I sick with the memory of what i have see fast on she heel too come the terrify attendant more mistress of herself and able to speak -- which the old lady could not do -- but with a face almost if not quite as fearful we be down by the bush in the sun -- she gasp and scream in reply to colonel wragge 's distract questioning -- i be wheeling the chair as usual when she shriek and leap -- i do not know exactly -- i be too frightened to see -- oh my god she jump clean out of the chair -- _ and run _ there be a blast of hot air from the wood and she hide she face and jump she do not make a sound -- she do not cry out or make a sound she just run but the nightmare horror of it all reach the breaking point a few minute later and while i be still stand in the hall temporarily bereft of speech and movement for while the doctor the colonel and the attendant be half-way up the staircase help the faint woman to the privacy of she room and all in a confused group of dark figure there sound a voice behind I and i turn to see the butler he face drip with perspiration he eye start out of he head the laundry 's on fire he cry the laundry building 's a-caught i remember he odd expression a-caught and want to laugh but find my face rigid and inflexible the devil 's about again s ` help I gawd he cry in a voice thin with terror run about in circle and then the group on the stair scatter as at the sound of a shot and the colonel and dr silence come down three step at a time leave the afflict miss wragge to the care of she single attendant we be out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner of the house the colonel lead silence and i at he heel and the portly butler puff some distance in the rear get more and more mixed in he address to god and the devil and the moment we pass the stable and come into view of the laundry building we see a wicked-looking volume of smoke pour out of the narrow window and the frightened women-servant and groom run hither and thither call aloud as they run the arrival of the master restore order instantly and this retired soldier poor thinker perhaps but capable man of action have the matter in hand from the start he issue order like a martinet and almost before i could realize it there be streaming bucket on the scene and a line of man and woman form between the building and the stable pump inside i hear john silence cry and the colonel follow he through the door while i be just quick enough at they heel to hear he add the smoke 's the worst part of it there be no fire yet i think and true enough there be no fire the interior be thick with smoke but it speedily clear and not a single bucket be use upon the floor or wall the air be stifle the heat fearful there be precious little to burn in here it be all stone the colonel exclaim cough but the doctor be point to the wooden cover of the great cauldron in which the clothes be wash and we see that these be smoulder and char and when we sprinkle half a bucket of water on they the surround brick hiss and fizz and send up cloud of steam through the open door and window this pass out with the rest of the smoke and we three stand there on the brick floor stare at the spot and wonder each in we own fashion how in the name of natural law the place could have catch fire or smoke at all and each be silent -- myself from sheer incapacity and befuddlement the colonel from the quiet pluck that face all thing yet speak little and john silence from the intense mental grapple with this latest manifestation of a profound problem that call for concentration of thought rather than for any word there be really nothing to say the fact be indisputable colonel wragge be the first to utter my sister he say briefly and move off in the yard i hear he send the frightened servant about they business in a excellently matter-of-fact voice scold some one roundly for make such a big fire and let the flue get over-heated and pay no heed to the stammering reply that no fire have be light there for several day then he dispatch a groom on horseback for the local doctor then dr silence turn and look at I the absolute control he possess not only over the outward expression of emotion by gesture change of color light in the eye and so forth but also as i well know over its very birth in he heart the masklike face of the dead he could assume at will make it extremely difficult to know at any given moment what be at work in he inner consciousness but now when he turn and look at I there be no sphinx-expression there but rather the keen triumphant face of a man who have solve a dangerous and complicated problem and see he way to a clean victory _ now _ do you guess he ask quietly as though it be the simplest matter in the world and ignorance be impossible i could only stare stupidly and remain silent he glance down at the char cauldron-lid and trace a figure in the air with he finger but i be too excited or too mortified or still too dazed perhaps to see what it be he outline or what it be he mean to convey i could only go on stare and shake my puzzle head a fire-elemental he cry a fire-elemental of the most powerful and malignant kind -- a what thunder the voice of colonel wragge behind we have return suddenly and overhear it be a fire-elemental repeat dr silence more calmly but with a note of triumph in he voice he could not keep out and a fire-elemental enrage the light begin to dawn in my mind at last but the colonel -- who have never hear the term before and be besides feeling considerably work up for a plain man with all this mystery he know not how to grapple with -- the colonel stand with the most dumfoundered look ever see on a human countenance and continue to roar and stammer and stare and why he begin savage with the desire to find something visible he could fight -- why in the name of all the blaze -- and then stop as john silence move up and take he arm there my dear colonel wragge he say gently you touch the heart of the whole thing you ask ` why ' that be precisely we problem he hold the soldier 's eye firmly with he own and that too i think we shall soon know come and let we talk over a plan of action -- that room with the double door perhaps the word action calm he a little and he lead the way without further speech back into the house and down the long stone passage to the room where we have hear he story on the night of we arrival i understand from the doctor 's glance that my presence would not make the interview easier for we host and i go upstairs to my own room -- shake but in the solitude of my room the vivid memory of the last hour revive so mercilessly that i begin to feel i should never in my whole life lose the dreadful picture of miss wragge running -- that dreadful human climax after all the non-human mystery in the wood -- and i be not sorry when a servant knock at my door and say that colonel wragge would be glad if i would join they in the little smoking-room i think it be better you should be present be all colonel wragge say as i enter the room i take the chair with my back to the window there be still a hour before lunch though i imagine that the usual division of the day hardly find a place in the thought of any one of we the atmosphere of the room be what i might call electric the colonel be positively bristle he stand with he back to the fire finger a unlit black cigar he face flush he be obviously rouse and ready for action he hate this mystery it be poisonous to he nature and he long to meet something face to face -- something he could gauge and fight dr silence i notice at once be sit before the map of the estate which be spread upon a table i know by he expression the state of he mind he be in the thick of it all know it delighted in it and be work at high pressure he recognize my presence with a lift eyelid and the flash of the eye contrast with he stillness and composure tell I volume i be about to explain to we host briefly what seem to I afoot in all this business he say without look up when he ask that you should join we so that we can all work together and while signify my assent i catch myself wonder what quality it be in the calm speech of this undemonstrative man that be so full of power so charge with the strange virile personality behind it and that seem to inspire we with he own confidence as by a process of radiation mr hubbard he go on gravely turn to the soldier know something of my method and in more than one -- er -- interesting situation have prove of assistance what we want now -- and here he suddenly get up and take he place on the mat beside the colonel and look hard at he -- be man who have self-control who be sure of themselves whose mind at the critical moment will emit positive force instead of the wavering and uncertain current due to negative feeling -- due for instance to fear he look at we each in turn colonel wragge move he foot farther apart and square he shoulder and i feel guilty but say nothing conscious that my latent store of courage be be deliberately haul to the front he be wind I up like a clock so that in what be yet to come continue we leader each of we will contribute he share of power and ensure success for my plan i be not afraid of anything i can _ see _ say the colonel bluntly i be ready i hear myself say as it be automatically for anything and then add feel the declaration be lamely insufficient and everything dr silence leave the mat and begin walk to and fro about the room both hand plunge deep into the pocket of he shooting-jacket tremendous vitality stream from he i never take my eye off the small move figure small yes -- and yet somehow make I think of a giant plot the destruction of world and he manner be gentle as always soothing almost and he word utter quietly without emphasis or emotion most of what he say be address though not too obviously to the colonel the violence of this sudden attack he say softly pacing to and fro beneath the bookcase at the end of the room be due of course partly to the fact that tonight the moon be at the full -- here he glance at I for a moment -- and partly to the fact that we have all be so deliberately concentrate upon the matter we think we investigation have stir it into unusual activity i mean that the intelligent force behind these manifestation have realize that some one be busy about its destruction and it be now on the defensive : more it be aggressive but ` it ' -- what be ` it ' begin the soldier fume what in the name of all that be dreadful _ be _ a fire-elemental i can not give you at this moment reply dr silence turn to he but undisturbed by the interruption a lecture on the nature and history of magic but can only say that a elemental be the active force behind the element -- whether earth air water _ or fire _ -- it be impersonal in its essential nature but can be focus personify ensoul so to say by those who know how -- by magician if you will -- for certain purpose of they own much in the same way that steam and electricity can be harness by the practical man of this century alone these blind elemental energy can accomplish little but govern and direct by the train will of a powerful manipulator they may become potent activity for good or evil they be the basis of all magic and it be the motive behind they that constitute the magic ` black ' or ` white ' they can be the vehicle of curse or of blessing for a curse be nothing more than the thought of a violent will perpetuate and in such case -- case like this -- the conscious directing will of the mind that be use the elemental stand always behind the phenomenon -- you think that my brother -- break in the colonel aghast have nothing whatever to do with it -- directly the fire-elemental that have here be torment you and you household be send upon its mission long before you or you family or you ancestor or even the nation you belong to -- unless i be much mistaken -- be even in existence we will come to that a little later after the experiment i propose to make we shall be more positive at present i can only say we have to deal now not only with the phenomenon of attack fire merely but with the vindictive and enraged intelligence that be direct it from behind the scene -- vindictive and enraged -- he repeat the word that explain -- begin colonel wragge seek furiously for word he could not find quickly enough much say john silence with a gesture to restrain he he stop a moment in the middle of he walk and a deep silence come down over the little room through the window the sunlight seem less bright the long line of dark hill less friendly make I think of a vast wave towering to heaven and about to break and overwhelm we something formidable have creep into the world about we for undoubtedly there be a disquieting thought hold terror as well as awe in the picture he word conjure up : the conception of a human will reach its deathless hand spiteful and destructive down through the age to strike the living and afflict the innocent but what be its object burst out the soldier unable to restrain himself longer in the silence why do it come from that plantation and why should it attack we or any one in particular question begin to pour from he in a stream all in good time the doctor answer quietly have let he run on for several minute but i must first discover positively what or who it be that direct this particular fire-elemental and to do that we must first -- he speak with slow deliberation -- seek to capture -- to confine by visibility -- to limit its sphere in a concrete form good heaven almighty exclaim the soldier mix he word in he unfeigned surprise quite so pursued the other calmly for in so do i think we can release it from the purpose that bind it restore it to its normal condition of latent fire and also -- he lower he voice perceptibly -- also discover the face and form of the be that ensoul it the man behind the gun cry the colonel begin to understand something and lean forward so as not to miss a single syllable i mean that in the last resort before it return to the womb of potential fire it will probably assume the face and figure of its director of the man of magical knowledge who originally bind it with he incantation and send it forth upon its mission of century the soldier sit down and gasp openly in he face breathing hard but it be a very subdue voice that frame the question and how do you propose to make it visible how capture and confine it what d'ye mean dr john silence by furnish it with the material for a form by the process of materialisation simply once limit by dimension it will become slow heavy visible we can then dissipate it invisible fire you see be dangerous and incalculable lock up in a form we can perhaps manage it we must betray it -- to its death and this material we ask in the same breath although i think i have already guess not pleasant but effective come the quiet reply the exhalation of freshly spill blood not human blood cry colonel wragge start up from he chair with a voice like a explosion i think he eye would start from they socket the face of dr silence relax in spite of himself and he spontaneous little laugh bring a welcome though momentary relief the day of human sacrifice i hope will never come again he explain animal blood will answer the purpose and we can make the experiment as pleasant as possible only the blood must be freshly spill and strong with the vital emanation that attract this peculiar class of elemental creature perhaps -- perhaps if some pig on the estate be ready for the market -- he turn to hide a smile but the pass touch of comedy find no echo in the mind of we host who do not understand how to change quickly from one emotion to another clearly he be debate many thing laboriously in he honest brain but in the end the earnestness and scientific disinterestedness of the doctor whose influence over he be already very great win the day and he presently look up more calmly and observe shortly that he think perhaps the matter could be arrange there be other and pleasanter method dr silence go on to explain but they require time and preparation and thing have go much too far in my opinion to admit of delay and the process need cause you no distress : we sit round the bowl and await result nothing more the emanation of blood -- which as levus say be the first incarnation of the universal fluid -- furnish the material out of which the creature of discarnate life spirit if you prefer can fashion themselves a temporary appearance the process be old and lie at the root of all blood sacrifice it be know to the priest of baal and it be know to the modern ecstasy dancer who cut themselves to produce objective phantom who dance with they and the least gifted clairvoyant could tell you that the form to be see in the vicinity of slaughter-house or hover above the desert battlefield be -- well simply beyond all description i do not mean he add notice the uneasy fidget of he host that anything in we laundry-experiment need appear to terrify we for this case seem a comparatively simple one and it be only the vindictive character of the intelligence direct this fire-elemental that cause anxiety and make for personal danger it be curious say the colonel with a sudden rush of word draw a deep breath and as though speaking of thing distasteful to he that during my year among the hill tribe of northern indium i come across -- personally come across -- instance of the sacrifice of blood to certain deity be stop suddenly and all manner of disaster happen until they be resume fire break out in the hut and even on the clothes of the native -- and -- and i admit i have read in the course of my study -- he make a gesture toward he book and heavily laden table -- of the yezidi of syrium evoke phantom by means of cut they body with knife during they whirling dance -- enormous globe of fire which turn into monstrous and terrible form -- and i remember a account somewhere too how the emaciated form and pallid countenance of the spectre that appear to the emperor julian claim to be the true immortal and tell he to renew the sacrifice of blood ` for the fume of which since the establishment of christianity they have be pine ' -- that these be in reality the phantom evoke by the rite of blood both dr silence and myself listen in amazement for this sudden speech be so unexpected and betray so much more knowledge than we have either of we suspect in the old soldier then perhaps you have read too say the doctor how the cosmic deity of savage race elemental in they nature have be keep alive through many age by these blood rite no he answer that be new to I in any case dr silence add i be glad you be not wholly unfamiliar with the subject for you will now bring more sympathy and therefore more help to we experiment for of course in this case we only want the blood to tempt the creature from its lair and enclose it in a form -- i quite understand and i only hesitate just now he go on he word come much more slowly as though he feel he have already say too much because i wish to be quite sure it be no mere curiosity but a actual sense of necessity that dictate this horrible experiment it be you safety and that of you household and of you sister that be at stake reply the doctor once i have _ see _ i hope to discover whence this elemental come and what its real purpose be colonel wragge signify he assent with a bow and the moon will help we the other say for it will be full in the early hour of the morning and this kind of elemental-being be always most active at the period of full moon hence you see the clue furnish by you diary so it be finally settle colonel wragge would provide the material for the experiment and we be to meet at midnight how he would contrive at that hour -- but that be he business i only know we both realize that he would keep he word and whether a pig die at midnight or at noon be after all perhaps only a question of the sleep and personal comfort of the executioner tonight then in the laundry say dr silence finally to clinch the plan we three alone -- and at midnight when the household be asleep and we shall be free from disturbance he exchange significant glance with we host who at that moment be call away by the announcement that the family doctor have arrive and be ready to see he in he sister 's room for the remainder of the afternoon john silence disappear i have my suspicion that he make a secret visit to the plantation and also to the laundry building but in any case we see nothing of he and he keep strictly to himself he be prepare for the night i feel sure but the nature of he preparation i could only guess there be movement in he room i hear and a odour like incense hang about the door and know that he regard rite as the vehicle of energy my guess be probably not far wrong colonel wragge too remain absent the greater part of the afternoon and deeply afflict have scarcely leave he sister 's bedside but in response to my inquiry when we meet for a moment at tea-time he tell I that although she have moment of attempt speech she talk be quite incoherent and hysterical and she be still quite unable to explain the nature of what she have see the doctor he say fear she have recover the use of she limb only to lose that of she memory and perhaps even of she mind then the recovery of she leg i trust may be permanent at any rate i venture find it difficult to know what sympathy to offer and he reply with a curious short laugh oh yes about that there can be no doubt whatever and it be due merely to the chance of my overhear a fragment of conversation -- unwillingly of course -- that a little further light be throw upon the state in which the old lady actually lay for as i come out of my room it happen that colonel wragge and the doctor be go downstairs together and they word float up to my ear before i could make my presence know by so much as a cough then you must find a way the doctor be say with decision for i can not insist too strongly upon that -- and at all cost she must be keep quiet these attempt to go out must be prevent -- if necessary by force this desire to visit some wood or other she keep talk about be of course hysterical in nature it can not be permit for a moment it shall not be permit i hear the soldier reply as they reach the hall below it have impress she mind for some reason -- the doctor go on by way evidently of soothing explanation and then the distance make it impossible for I to hear more at dinner dr silence be still absent on the public plea of a headache and though food be send to he room i be incline to believe he do not touch it but spend the entire time fasting we retire early desiring that the household should do likewise and i must confess that at ten o'clock when i bid my host a temporary good-night and seek my room to make what mental preparation i could i realize in no very pleasant fashion that it be a singular and formidable assignation this midnight meeting in the laundry building and that there be moment in every adventure of life when a wise man and one who know he own limitation owe it to he dignity to withdraw discreetly and but for the character of we leader i probably should have then and there offer the best excuse i could think of and have allow myself quietly to fall asleep and wait for a exciting story in the morning of what have happen but with a man like john silence such a lapse be out of the question and i sit before my fire count the minute and do everything i could think of to fortify my resolution and fasten my will at the point where i could be reasonably sure that my self-control would hold against all attack of man devil or elemental iii at a quarter before midnight clothe in a heavy ulster and with slippered foot i creep cautiously from my room and steal down the passage to the top of the stair outside the doctor 's door i wait a moment to listen all be still the house in utter darkness no gleam of light beneath any door only down the length of the corridor from the direction of the sick-room come faint sound of laughter and incoherent talk that be not thing to reassure a mind already half a-tremble and i make haste to reach the hall and let myself out through the front door into the night the air be keen and frosty perfumed with night smell and exquisitely fresh all the million candle of the sky be alight and a faint breeze rise and fall with far-away sighing in the top of the pine tree my blood leap for a moment in the spaciousness of the night for the splendid star bring courage but the next instant as i turn the corner of the house move stealthily down the gravel drive my spirit sink again ominously for yonder over the funereal plume of the twelve acre plantation i see the broken yellow disc of the half-moon just rise in the east stare down like some vast be come to watch upon the progress of we doom see through the distort vapor of the earth 's atmosphere she face look weirdly unfamiliar she usual expression of benignant vacancy somehow a-twist i slip along by the shadow of the wall keep my eye upon the ground the laundry-house as already describe stand detach from the other office with laurel shrubbery crowd thickly behind it and the kitchen-garden so close on the other side that the strong smell of soil and grow thing come across almost heavily the shadow of the haunt plantation hugely lengthen by the rise moon behind they reach to the very wall and cover the stone tile of the roof with a dark pall so keenly be my sens alert at this moment that i believe i could fill a chapter with the endless small detail of the impression i receive -- shadow odour shape sound -- in the space of the few seconds i stand and wait before the closed wooden door then i become aware of some one move towards I through the moonlight and the figure of john silence without overcoat and barehead come quickly and without noise to join I he eye i see at once be wonderfully bright and so marked be the shine pallor of he face that i could hardly tell when he pass from the moonlight into the shade he pass without a word beckon I to follow and then push the door open and go in the chill air of the place meet we like that of a underground vault and the brick floor and whitewashed wall streak with damp and smoke throw back the cold in we face directly opposite gape the black throat of the huge open fireplace the ash of wood fire still pile and scatter about the hearth and on either side of the project chimney-column be the deep recess hold the big twin cauldron for boil clothes upon the lid of these cauldron stand the two little oil lamp shaded red which give all the light there be and immediately in front of the fireplace there be a small circular table with three chair set about it overhead the narrow slit window high up the wall point to a dim network of wooden rafter half lose among the shadow and then come the dark vault of the roof cheerless and unalluring for all the red light it certainly be remind I of some unused conventicle bare of pew or pulpit ugly and severe and i be forcibly strike by the contrast between the normal use to which the place be ordinarily put and the strange and medieval purpose which have bring we under its roof tonight possibly a involuntary shudder run over I for my companion turn with a confident look to reassure I and he be so completely master of himself that i at once absorb from he abundance and feel the chink of my fail courage begin to close up to meet he eye in the presence of danger be like find a mental railing that guide and support think along the giddy edge of alarm i be quite ready i whisper turn to listen for approach footstep he nod still keep he eye on mine we whisper sound hollow as they echo overhead among the rafter i be glad you be here he say not all would have the courage keep you thought control and imagine the protective shell round you -- round you inner be i be all right i repeat cursing my chatter tooth he take my hand and shake it and the contact seem to shake into I something of he supreme confidence the eye and hand of a strong man can touch the soul i think he guess my thought for a pass smile flash about the corner of he mouth you will feel more comfortable he say in a low tone when the chain be complete the colonel we can count on of course remember though he add warningly he may perhaps become control -- possess -- when the thing come because he will not know how to resist and to explain the business to such a man -- he shrug he shoulder expressively but it will only be temporary and i will see that no harm come to he he glance round at the arrangement with approval red light he say indicate the shaded lamp have the lowest rate of vibration materialisation be dissipate by strong light -- will not form or hold together -- in rapid vibration i be not sure that i approve altogether of this dim light for in complete darkness there be something protective -- the knowledge that one can not be see probably -- which a half-light destroy but i remember the warn to keep my thought steady and forbore to give they expression there be a step outside and the figure of colonel wragge stand in the doorway though enter on tiptoe he make considerable noise and clatter for he free movement be impede by the burden he carry and we see a large yellowish bowl hold out at arm ' length from he body the mouth cover with a white cloth he face i note be rigidly compose he too be master of himself and as i thought of this old soldier move through the long series of alarm wear with watch and wearied with assault unenlightened yet undismayed even down to the dreadful shock of he sister 's terror and still show the dog pluck that persist in the face of defeat i understand what dr silence mean when he describe he as a man to be count on i think there be nothing beyond this rigidity of he stern feature and a certain greyness of the complexion to betray the turmoil of the emotion that be doubtless go on within and the quality of these two man each in he own way so keyed I up that by the time the door be shut and we have exchange silent greeting all the latent courage i possess be well to the fore and i feel as sure of myself as i know i ever could feel colonel wragge set the bowl carefully in the center of the table midnight he say shortly glance at he watch and we all three move to we chair there in the middle of that cold and silent place we sit with the vile bowl before we and a thin hardly perceptible steam rise through the damp air from the surface of the white cloth and disappear upward the moment it pass beyond the zone of red light and enter the deep shadow throw forward by the project wall of chimney the doctor have indicate we respective place and i find myself seat with my back to the door and opposite the black hearth the colonel be on my left and dr silence on my right both half face I the latter more in shadow than the former we thus divide the little table into even section and sit back in we chair we await event in silence for something like a hour i do not think there be even the faintest sound within those four wall and under the canopy of that vaulted roof we slipper make no scratch on the gritty floor and we breathing be suppress almost to nothing even the rustle of we clothes as we shift from time to time upon we seat be inaudible silence smother we absolutely -- the silence of night of listen the silence of a haunt expectancy the very gurgling of the lamp be too soft to be hear and if light itself have sound i do not think we should have notice the silvery tread of the moonlight as it enter the high narrow window and throw upon the floor the slender trace of its pallid footstep colonel wragge and the doctor and myself too for that matter sit thus like figure of stone without speech and without gesture my eye pass in ceaseless journey from the bowl to they face and from they face to the bowl they might have be mask however for all the sign of life they give and the light steam from the horrid contents beneath the white cloth have long cease to be visible then presently as the moon rise higher the wind rise with it it sigh like the lightest of pass wing over the roof it creep most softly round the wall it make the brick floor like ice beneath we foot with it i see mentally the desolate moorland flow like a sea about the old house the treeless expanse of lonely hill the nearer copse sombre and mysterious in the night the plantation too in particular i saw and imagine i hear the mournful whispering that must now be a-stirring among its tree-top as the breeze play down between the twisted stem in the depth of the room behind we the shaft of moonlight meet and cross in a grow network it be after a hour of this wear and unbroken attention and i should judge about one o'clock in the morning when the baying of the dog in the stableyard first begin and i see john silence move suddenly in he chair and sit up in a attitude of attention every force in my be instantly leap into the keenest vigilance colonel wragge move too though slowly and without raise he eye from the table before he the doctor stretch he arm out and take the white cloth from the bowl it be perhaps imagination that persuade I the red glare of the lamp grow fainter and the air over the table before we thicken i have be expect something for so long that the movement of my companion and the lifting of the cloth may easily have cause the momentary delusion that something hover in the air before my face touch the skin of my cheek with a silken run but it be certainly not a delusion that the colonel look up at the same moment and glance over he shoulder as though he eye follow the movement of something to and fro about the room and that he then button he overcoat more tightly about he and he eye seek my own face first and then the doctor 's and it be no delusion that he face seem somehow to have turn dark become spread as it be with a shadowy blackness i see he lip tighten and he expression grow hard and stern and it come to I then with a rush that of course this man have tell we but a part of the experience he have be through in the house and that there be much more he have never be able to bring himself to reveal at all i feel sure of it the way he turn and stare about he betray a familiarity with other thing than those he have describe to we it be not merely a sight of fire he look for it be a sight of something alive intelligent something able to evade he search it be _ a person _ it be the watch for the ancient be who seek to obsess he and the way in which dr silence answer he look -- though it be only by a glance of subtlest sympathy -- confirm my impression we may be ready now i hear he say in a whisper and i understand that he word be intend as a steadying warning and brace myself mentally to the utmost of my power yet long before colonel wragge have turn to stare about the room and long before the doctor have confirm my impression that thing be at last begin to stir i have become aware in most singular fashion that the place hold more than we three self with the rising of the wind this increase to we number have first take place the baying of the hound almost seem to have signal it i can not say how it may be possible to realize that a empty place have suddenly become -- not empty when the new arrival be nothing that appeal to any one of the sens for this recognition of a invisible as of the change in the balance of personal force in a human group be indefinable and beyond proof yet it be unmistakable and i know perfectly well at what give moment the atmosphere within these four wall become charge with the presence of other live being besides ourselves and on reflection i be convince that both my companion know it too watch the light say the doctor under he breath and then i know too that it be no fancy of my own that have turn the air darker and the way he turn to examine the face of we host send a electric thrill of wonder and expectancy shiver along every nerve in my body yet it be no kind of terror that i experienced but rather a sort of mental dizziness and a sensation as of be suspend in some remote and dreadful altitude where thing might happen indeed be about to happen that have never before happen within the ken of man horror may have form a ingredient but it be not chiefly horror and in no sense ghostly horror uncommon thought keep beat on my brain like tiny hammer soft yet persistent seek admission they unbidden tide begin to wash along the far fringe of my mind the current of unwonted sensation to rise over the remote frontier of my consciousness i be aware of thought and the fantasy of thought that i never know before exist portion of my be stir that have never stir before and thing ancient and inexplicable rise to the surface and beckon I to follow i feel as though i be about to fly off at some immense tangent into a outer space hitherto unknown even in dream and so singular be the result produce upon I that i be uncommonly glad to anchor my mind as well as my eye upon the masterful personality of the doctor at my side for there i realize i could draw always upon the force of sanity and safety with a vigorous effort of will i return to the scene before I and try to focus my attention with steadier thought upon the table and upon the silent figure seat round it and then i see that certain change have come about in the place where we sit the patch of moonlight on the floor i note have become curiously shaded the face of my companion opposite be not so clearly visible as before and the forehead and cheek of colonel wragge be glisten with perspiration i realize further that a extraordinary change have come about in the temperature of the atmosphere the increase warmth have a painful effect not alone on colonel wragge but upon all of we it be oppressive and unnatural we gasp figuratively as well as actually you be the first to feel it say dr silence in low tone look across at he you be in more intimate touch of course -- the colonel be tremble and appear to be in considerable distress he knee shake so that the shuffling of he slippered foot become audible he incline he head to show that he have hear but make no other reply i think even then he be sore put to it to keep himself in hand i know what he be struggle against as dr silence have warn I he be about to be obsess and be savagely though vainly resist but meanwhile a curious and whirling sense of exhilaration begin to come over I the increase heat be delightful bring a sensation of intense activity of thought pour through the mind at high speed of vivid picture in the brain of fierce desire and lightning energy alive in every part of the body i be conscious of no physical distress such as the colonel feel but only of a vague feeling that it might all grow suddenly too intense -- that i might be consume -- that my personality as well as my body might become resolve into the flame of pure spirit i begin to live at a speed too intense to last it be as if a thousand ecstasy besiege I -- steady whisper the voice of john silence in my ear and i look up with a start to see that the colonel have rise from he chair the doctor rise too i follow suit and for the first time see down into the bowl to my amazement and horror i see that the contents be trouble the blood be astir with movement the rest of the experiment be witness by we stand it come too with a curious suddenness there be no more dream for I at any rate i shall never forget the figure of colonel wragge standing there beside I upright and unshaken squarely plant on he foot look about he puzzle beyond belief yet full of a fight anger frame by the white wall the red glow of the lamp upon he streaming cheek he eye glowing against the deathly pallor of he skin breathing hard and make convulsive effort of hand and body to keep himself under control he whole be rouse to the point of savage fighting yet with nothing visible to get at anywhere -- he stand there immovable against odds and the strange contrast of the pale skin and the burning face i have never see before or wish to see again but what have leave a even sharper impression on my memory be the blackness that then begin crawl over he face obliterate the feature conceal they human outline and hide he inch by inch from view this be my first realisation that the process of materialisation be at work he visage become shroud i move from one side to the other to keep he in view and it be only then i understand that properly speak the blackness be not upon the countenance of colonel wragge but that something have insert itself between I and he thus screen he face with the effect of a dark veil something that apparently rise through the floor be pass slowly into the air above the table and above the bowl the blood in the bowl moreover be considerably less than before and with this change in the air before we there come at the same time a further change i think in the face of the soldier one-half be turn towards the red lamp while the other catch the pale illumination of the moonlight fall aslant from the high window so that it be difficult to estimate this change with accuracy of detail but it seem to I that while the feature -- eye nose mouth -- remain the same the life inform they have undergo some profound transformation the signature of a new power have creep into the face and leave its trace there -- a expression dark and in some unexplained way terrible then suddenly he open he mouth and speak and the sound of this changed voice deep and musical though it be make I cold and set my heart beat with uncomfortable rapidity the be as he have dread be already in control of he brain use he mouth i see a blackness like the blackness of egypt before my face say the tone of this unknown voice that seem half he own and half another 's and out of this darkness they come they come i give a dreadful start the doctor turn to look at I for a instant and then turn to center he attention upon the figure of we host and i understand in some intuitive fashion that he be there to watch over the strangest contest man ever see -- to watch over and if necessary to protect he be be control -- possess he whisper to I through the shadow he face wear a wonderful expression half triumph half admiration even as colonel wragge speak it seem to I that this visible darkness begin to increase pour up thickly out of the ground by the hearth rise up in sheet and veil shroud we eye and face it steal up from below -- a awful blackness that seem to drink in all the radiation of light in the building leave nothing but the ghost of a radiance in they place then out of this rise sea of shadow issue a pale and spectral light that gradually spread itself about we and from the heart of this light i see the shape of fire crowd and gather and these be not human shape or the shape of anything i recognize as alive in the world but outline of fire that trace globe triangle cross and the luminous body of various geometrical figure they grow bright fade and then grow bright again with a effect almost of pulsation they pass swiftly to and fro through the air rise and fall and particularly in the immediate neighborhood of the colonel often gather about he head and shoulder and even appear to settle upon he like giant insect of flame they be accompany moreover by a faint sound of hiss -- the same sound we have hear that afternoon in the plantation the fire-elemental that precede they master the doctor say in a undertone be ready and while this weird display of the shape of fire alternately flash and fade and the hiss echo faintly among the dim rafter overhead we hear the awful voice issue at interval from the lip of the afflict soldier it be a voice of power splendid in some way i can not describe and with a certain sense of majesty in its cadence and as i listen to it with quickly beat heart i could fancy it be some ancient voice of time itself echo down immense corridor of stone from the depths of vast temple from the very heart of mountain tomb i have see my divine father osiri thunder the great tone i have scatter the gloom of the night i have burst through the earth and be one with the starry deity something grand come into the soldier 's face he be stare fixedly before he as though see nothing watch whisper dr silence in my ear and he whisper seem to come from very far away again the mouth open and the awesome voice issue forth thoth it boom have loosen the bandage of set which fetter my mouth i have take my place in the great wind of heaven i hear the little wind of night with its mournful voice of age sigh round the wall and over the roof listen come from the doctor at my side and the thunder of the voice continue -- i have hide myself with you o ye star that never diminish i remember my name -- in -- the -- house -- of -- fire the voice cease and the sound die away something about the face and figure of colonel wragge relax i think the terrible look pass from he face the be that obsess he be go the great ritual say dr silence aside to I very low the book of the dead now it be leave he soon the blood will fashion it a body colonel wragge who have stand absolutely motionless all this time suddenly sway so that i think he be go to fall -- and but for the quick support of the doctor 's arm he probably would have fall for he stagger as in the beginning of collapse i be drunk with the wine of osiri he cry -- and it be half with he own voice this time -- but horus the eternal watcher be about my path -- for -- safety the voice dwindle and fail die away into something almost like a cry of distress now watch closely say dr silence speak loud for after the cry will come the fire i begin to tremble involuntarily a awful change have come without warn into the air my leg grow weak as paper beneath my weight and i have to support myself by lean on the table colonel wragge i saw be also lean forward with a kind of droop the shape of fire have vanish all but he face be light by the red lamp and the pale shift moonlight rise behind he like mist we be both gaze at the bowl now almost empty the colonel stoop so low i fear every minute he would lose he balance and drop into it and the shadow that have so long be in process of form now at length begin to assume material outline in the air before we then john silence move forward quickly he take he place between we and the shadow erect formidable absolute master of the situation i see he stand there he face calm and almost smile and fire in he eye he protective influence be astounding and incalculable even the abhorrent dread i feel at the sight of the creature grow into life and substance before we lessen in some way so that i be able to keep my eye fix on the air above the bowl without too vivid a terror but as it take shape rise out of nothing as it be and grow momentarily more define in outline a period of utter and wonderful silence settle down upon the building and all it contain a hush of age like the sudden center of peace at the heart of the travel cyclone descend through the night and out of this hush as out of the emanation of the steam blood issue the form of the ancient be who have first send the elemental of fire upon its mission it grow and darken and solidify before we eye it rise from just beyond the table so that the lower portion remain invisible but i see the outline limn itself upon the air as though slowly reveal by the rising of a curtain it apparently have not then quite concentrated to the normal proportion but be spread out on all side into space huge though rapidly condense for i see the colossal shoulder the neck the lower portion of the dark jaw the terrible mouth and then the tooth and lip -- and as the veil seem to lift further upon the tremendous face -- i see the nose and cheek bone in another moment i should have look straight into the eye -- but what dr silence do at that moment be so unexpected and take I so by surprise that i have never yet properly understand its nature and he have never yet see fit to explain in detail to I he utter some sound that have a note of command in it -- and in so do step forward and intervene between I and the face the figure just near completeness he therefore hide from my sight -- and i have always think purposely hide from my sight the fire he cry out the fire beware there be a sudden roar as of flame from the very mouth of the pit and for the space of a single second all grow light as day a blind flash pass across my face and there be heat for a instant that seem to shrivel skin and flesh and bone then come step and i hear colonel wragge utter a great cry wilder than any human cry i have ever know the heat suck all the breath out of my lung with a rush and the blaze of light as it vanish sweep my vision with it into envelop darkness when i recover the use of my sens a few moment later i see that colonel wragge with a face of death its whiteness strangely stain have move closer to I dr silence stand beside he a expression of triumph and success in he eye the next minute the soldier try to clutch I with he hand then he reel staggered and unable to save himself fall with a great crash upon the brick floor after the sheet of flame a wind rage round the building as though it would lift the roof off but then pass as suddenly as it come and in the intense calm that follow i see that the form have vanish and the doctor be stoop over colonel wragge upon the floor try to lift he to a sit position light he say quietly more light take the shades off colonel wragge sit up and the glare of the unshaded lamp fall upon he face it be gray and draw still run heat and there be a look in the eye and about the corner of the mouth that seem in this short space of time to have add year to its age at the same time the expression of effort and anxiety have leave it it show relief go he say look up at the doctor in a dazed fashion and struggle to he foot thank god it be go at last he stare round the laundry as though to find out where he be do it control I -- take possession of I do i talk nonsense he ask bluntly after the heat come i remember nothing -- you 'll feel yourself again in a few minute the doctor say to my infinite horror i see that he be surreptitiously wipe sundry dark stain from the face we experiment have be a success and -- he give I a swift glance to hide the bowl standing between I and we host while i hurriedly stuff it down under the lid of the nearest cauldron -- and none of we the worse for it he finish and fire he ask still daze there 'll be no more fire it be dissipate -- partly at any rate reply dr silence cautiously and the man behind the gun he go on only half realize what he be say i think have you discover _ that _ a form materialise say the doctor briefly i know for certain now what the direct intelligence be behind it all colonel wragge pull himself together and get upon he foot the word convey no clear meaning to he yet but he memory be return gradually and he be try to piece together the fragment into a connected whole he shiver a little for the place have grow suddenly chilly the air be empty again lifeless you feel all right again now dr silence say in the tone of a man state a fact rather than ask a question thanks to you -- both yes he draw a deep breath and mop he face and even attempt a smile he make I think of a man come from the battlefield with the stain of fight still upon he but scornful of he wound then he turn gravely towards the doctor with a question in he eye memory have return and he be himself again precisely what i expect the doctor say calmly a fire-elemental send upon its mission in the day of thebe century before christ and tonight for the first time all these thousand of year release from the spell that originally bind it we stare at he in amazement colonel wragge open he lip for word that refuse to shape themselves and if we dig he continue significantly point to the floor where the blackness have pour up we shall find some underground connection -- a tunnel most likely -- lead to the twelve acre wood it be make by -- you predecessor a tunnel make by my brother gasp the soldier then my sister should know -- she live here with he -- he stop suddenly john silence incline he head slowly i think so he say quietly you brother no doubt be as much torment as you have be he continue after a pause in which colonel wragge seem deeply preoccupy with he thought and try to find peace by bury it in the wood and surround the wood then like a large magic circle with the enchantment of the old formula so the star the man see blaze -- but bury what ask the soldier faintly step backwards towards the support of the wall dr silence regard we both intently for a moment before he reply i think he weigh in he mind whether to tell we now or when the investigation be absolutely complete the mummy he say softly after a moment the mummy that you brother take from its rest place of century and bring home -- here colonel wragge drop down upon the nearest chair hang breathlessly on every word he be far too amaze for speech the mummy of some important person -- a priest most likely -- protect from disturbance and desecration by the ceremonial magic of the time for they understand how to attach to the mummy to lock up with it in the tomb a elemental force that would direct itself even after age upon any one who dare to molest it in this case it be a elemental of fire dr silence cross the floor and turn out the lamp one by one he have nothing more to say for the moment follow he example i fold the table together and take up the chair and we host still daze and silent mechanically obey he and move to the door we remove all trace of the experiment take the empty bowl back to the house conceal beneath a ulster the air be cool and fragrant as we walk to the house the star begin to fade overhead and a fresh wind of early morning blow up out of the east where the sky be already hint of the coming day it be after five o'clock stealthily we enter the front hall and lock the door and as we go on tiptoe upstairs to we room the colonel peer at we over he candle as he nod good-night whisper that if we be ready the digging should be begin that very day then i see he steal along to he sister 's room and disappear iv but not even the mysterious reference to the mummy or the prospect of a revelation by digging be able to hinder the reaction that follow the intense excitement of the past twelve hour and i sleep the sleep of the dead dreamless and undisturbed a touch on the shoulder wake I and i see dr silence standing beside the bed dress to go out come he say it be tea-time you have sleep the best part of a dozen hour i spring up and make a hurry toilet while my companion sit and talk he look fresh and rest and he manner be even quieter than usual colonel wragge have provide spade and pickax we be go out to unearth this mummy at once he say and there be no reason we should not get away by the morning train i be ready to go tonight if you be i say honestly but dr silence shake he head i must see this through to the end he say gravely and in a tone that make I think he still anticipate serious thing perhaps he go on talk while i dress this case be really typical of all story of mummy-haunting and none of they be case to trifle with he explain for the mummy of important people -- king priest magician -- be lay away with profoundly significant ceremonial and be very effectively protect as you have see against desecration and especially against destruction the general belief he go on anticipate my question hold of course that the perpetuity of the mummy guarantee that of its ka -- the owner 's spirit -- but it be not improbable that the magical embalming be also use to retard reincarnation the preservation of the body prevent the return of the spirit to the toil and discipline of earth-life and in any case they know how to attach powerful guardian-force to keep off trespasser and any one who dare to remove the mummy or especially to unwind it -- well he add with mean you have see -- and you will see i catch he face in the mirror while i struggle with my collar it be deeply serious there could be no question that he speak of what he believe and know the traveller-brother who bring it here must have be haunt too he continue for he try to banish it by burial in the wood make a magic circle to enclose it something of genuine ceremonial he must have know for the star the man saw be of course the remains of the still flaming pentagram he trace at interval in the circle only he do not know enough or possibly be ignorant that the mummy 's guardian be a fire-force fire can not be enclose by fire though as you see it can be release by it then that awful figure in the laundry i ask thrill to find he so communicative undoubtedly the actual ka of the mummy operating always behind its agent the elemental and most likely thousand of year old and miss wragge -- i ventured once more ah miss wragge he repeat with increase gravity miss wragge -- a knock at the door bring a servant with word that tea be ready and the colonel have send to ask if we be come down the thread be break dr silence move to the door and sign to I to follow but he manner tell I that in any case no real answer would have be forthcoming to my question and the place to dig in i ask unable to restrain my curiosity will you find it by some process of divination or -- he pause at the door and look back at I and with that he leave I to finish my dress it be grow dark when the three of we silently make we way to the twelve acre plantation the sky be overcast and a black wind come out of the east gloom hang about the old house and the air seem full of sighing we find the tool ready lay at the edge of the wood and each shoulder he piece we follow we leader at once in among the tree he go straight forward for some twenty yard and then stop at he foot lay the blacken circle of one of the burn place it be just discernible against the surround white grass there be three of these he say and they all lie in a line with one another any one of they will tap the tunnel that connect the laundry -- the former museum -- with the chamber where the mummy now lie bury he at once clear away the burnt grass and begin to dig we all begin to dig while i use the pick the other shovel vigorously no one speak colonel wragge work the hardest of the three the soil be light and sandy and there be only a few snake-like root and occasional loose stone to delay we the pick make short work of these and meanwhile the darkness settle about we and the bite wind sweep roar through the tree overhead then quite suddenly without a cry colonel wragge disappear up to he neck the tunnel cry the doctor help to drag he out red breathless and cover with sand and perspiration now let I lead the way and he slip down nimbly into the hole so that a moment later we hear he voice muffle by sand and distance rise up to we hubbard you come next and then colonel wragge -- if he wish we hear i 'll follow you of course he say look at I as i scramble in the hole be bigger now and i get down on all-fours in a channel not much bigger than a large sewer-pipe and find myself in total darkness a minute later a heavy thud follow by a cataract of loose sand announce the arrival of the colonel catch hold of my heel call dr silence and colonel wragge can take yours in this slow laborious fashion we worm we way along a tunnel that have be roughly dig out of the shift sand and be shore up clumsily by means of wooden pillar and post any moment it seem to I we might be bury alive we could not see a inch before we eye but have to grope we way feel the pillar and the wall it be difficult to breathe and the colonel behind I make but slow progress for the cramped position of we body be very severe we have travel in this way for ten minute and go perhaps as much as ten yard when i lose my grasp of the doctor 's heel ah i hear he voice sound above I somewhere he be stand up in a clear space and the next moment i be stand beside he colonel wragge come heavily after and he too rise up and stand then dr silence produce he candle and we hear preparation for striking match yet even before there be light a indefinable sensation of awe come over we all in this hole in the sand some three foot under ground we stand side by side cramped and huddle strike suddenly with a over whelming apprehension of something ancient something formidable something incalculably wonderful that touch in each one of we a sense of the sublime and the terrible even before we could see a inch before we face i know not how to express in language this singular emotion that catch we here in utter darkness touch no sense directly it seem yet with the recognition that before we in the blackness of this underground night there lay something that be mighty with the mightiness of long past age i feel colonel wragge press in closely to my side and i understand the pressure and welcome it no human touch to I at least have ever be more eloquent then the match flare a thousand shadow flee on black wing and i see john silence fumble with the candle he face light up grotesquely by the flickering light below it i have dread this light yet when it come there be apparently nothing to explain the profound sensation of dread that precede it we stand in a small vaulted chamber in the sand the side and roof shore with bar of wood and the ground lay roughly with what seem to be tile it be six foot high so that we could all stand comfortably and may have be ten foot long by eight foot wide upon the wooden pillar at the side i see that egyptian hieroglyphic have be rudely trace by burn dr silence light three candle and hand one to each of we he place a fourth in the sand against the wall on he right and another to mark the entrance to the tunnel we stand and stare about we instinctively hold we breath empty by god exclaim colonel wragge he voice tremble with excitement and then as he eye rest on the ground he add and footstep -- look -- footstep in the sand dr silence say nothing he stoop down and begin to make a search of the chamber and as he move my eye follow he crouching figure and note the queer distorted shadow that pour over the wall and ceiling after he here and there thin trickle of loose sand run fizz down the side the atmosphere heavily charge with faint yet pungent odour lay utterly still and the flame of the candle might have be paint on the air for all the movement they betray and as i watch it be almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly that i be only stand upright with difficulty in this little sand-hole of a modern garden in the south of england for it seem to I that i stand as in vision at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn temple far far down the river of time the illusion be powerful and persist granite column that rise to heaven pile themselves about I majestically uprear and a roof like the sky itself spread above a line of colossal figure that move in shadowy procession along endless and stupendous aisle this huge and splendid fantasy bear i know not whence possess I so vividly that i be actually oblige to concentrate my attention upon the small stoop figure of the doctor as he grope about the wall in order to keep the eye of imagination on the scene before I but the limited space render a long search out of the question and he footstep instead of shuffling through loose sand presently strike something of a different quality that give forth a hollow and resounding echo he stoop to examine more closely he be stand exactly in the center of the little chamber when this happen and he at once begin scrape away the sand with he foot in less than a minute a smooth surface become visible -- the surface of a wooden cover the next thing i saw be that he have raise it and be peer down into a space below instantly a strong odour of nitre and bitumen mingle with the strange perfume of unknown and powdered aromatic rise up from the uncovered space and fill the vault sting the throat and make the eye water and smart the mummy whisper dr silence look up into we face over he candle and as he say the word i feel the soldier lurch against I and hear he breathing in my very ear the mummy he repeat under he breath as we press forward to look it be difficult to say exactly why the sight should have stir in I so prodigious a emotion of wonder and veneration for i have have not a little to do with mummy have unwound score of they and even experiment magically with not a few but there be something in the sight of that gray and silent figure lie in its modern box of lead and wood at the bottom of this sandy grave swathe in the bandage of century and wrap in the perfumed linen that the priest of egypt have pray over with they mighty enchantment thousand of year before -- something in the sight of it lie there and breathe its own spice-laden atmosphere even in the darkness of its exile in this remote land something that pierce to the very core of my be and touch that root of awe which slumber in every man near the birth of tear and the passion of true worship i remember turn quickly from the colonel lest he should see my emotion yet fail to understand its cause turn and clutch john silence by the arm and then fall tremble to see that he too have lower he head and be hide he face in he hand a kind of whirling storm come over I rise out of i know not what utter deep of memory and in a whiteness of vision i hear the magical old chaunting from the book of the dead and see the god pass by in dim procession the mighty immemorial being who be yet themselves only the personify attribute of the true god the god with the eye of fire the god with the face of smoke i saw again anubi the dog-faced deity and the child of horus eternal watcher of the age as they swathe osiri the first mummy of the world in the scented and mystic band and i taste again something of the ecstasy of the justified soul as it embark in the golden boat of ra and journey onward to rest in the field of the bless and then as dr silence with infinite reverence stoop and touch the still face so dreadfully stare with its paint eye there rise again to we nostril wave upon wave of this perfume of thousand of year and time flee backwards like a thing of naught show I in haunt panorama the most wonderful dream of the whole world a gentle hissing become audible in the air and the doctor move quickly backwards it come close to we face and then seem to play about the wall and ceiling the last of the fire -- still wait for its full accomplishment he mutter but i hear both word and hiss as thing far away for i be still busy with the journey of the soul through the seven hall of death listen for echo of the grandest ritual ever know to man the earthen plate cover with hieroglyphic still lay beside the mummy and round it carefully arrange at the point of the compass stand the four jar with the head of the hawk the jackal the cynocephalus and man the jar in which be place the hair the nail paring the heart and other special portion of the body even the amulet the mirror the blue clay statue of the ka and the lamp with seven wick be there only the sacred scarabaeus be miss not only have it be tear from its ancient resting-place i hear dr silence say in a solemn voice as he look at colonel wragge with fix gaze but it have be partially unwound -- he point to the wrapping of the breast -- and -- the scarabaeus have be remove from the throat the hiss that be like the hissing of a invisible flame have cease only from time to time we hear it as though it pass backwards and forwards in the tunnel and we stand look into each other 's face without speak presently colonel wragge make a great effort and brace himself i hear the sound catch in he throat before the word actually become audible my sister he say very low and then there follow a long pause break at length by john silence it must be replace he say significantly i know nothing the soldier say force himself to speak the word he hate say absolutely nothing it must be return repeat the other if it be not now too late for i fear -- i fear -- colonel wragge make a movement of assent with he head it shall be he say the place be still as the grave i do not know what it be then that make we all three turn round with so sudden a start for there be no sound audible to my ear at least the doctor be on the point of replace the lid over the mummy when he straighten up as if he have be shoot there be something come say colonel wragge under he breath and the doctor 's eye peer down the small opening of the tunnel show I the true direction a distant shuffling noise become distinctly audible come from a point about half-way down the tunnel we have so laboriously penetrate it be the sand fall in i say though i know it be foolish no say the colonel calmly in a voice that seem to have the ring of iron i have hear it for some time past it be something alive -- and it be come nearer he stare about he with a look of resolution that make he face almost noble the horror in he heart be overmaster yet he stand there prepare for anything that might come there be no other way out john silence say he lean the lid against the sand and wait i know by the masklike expression of he face the pallor and the steadiness of the eye that he anticipate something that might be very terrible -- appalling the colonel and myself stand on either side of the opening i still hold my candle and be ashamed of the way it shake drip the grease all over I but the soldier have set he into the sand just behind he foot thought of be bury alive of be smother like rat in a trap of be catch and do to death by some invisible and merciless force we could not grapple with rush into my mind then i thought of fire -- of suffocation -- of be roasted alive the perspiration begin to pour from my face steady come the voice of dr silence to I through the vault for five minute that seem fifty we stand wait look from each other 's face to the mummy and from the mummy to the hole and all the time the shuffling sound soft and stealthy come gradually nearer the tension for I at least be very near the breaking point when at last the cause of the disturbance reach the edge it be hide for a moment just behind the broken rim of soil a jet of sand shake by the close vibration trickle down on to the ground i have never in my life see anything fall with such laborious leisure the next second utter a cry of curious quality it come into view and it be far more distressingly horrible than anything i have anticipate for the sight of some egyptian monster some god of the tomb or even of some demon of fire i think i be already half prepared but when instead i see the white visage of miss wragge frame in that round opening of sand follow by she body crawl on all four she eye bulge and reflect the yellow glare of the candle my first instinct be to turn and run like a frantic animal seek a way of escape but dr silence who seem no whit surprise catch my arm and steady I and we both see the colonel then drop upon he knee and come thus to a level with he sister for more than a whole minute as though strike in stone the two face gaze silently at each other : hers for all the dreadful emotion in it more like a gargoyle than anything human and he white and blank with a expression that be beyond either astonishment or alarm she look up he look down it be a picture in a nightmare and the candle stick in the sand close to the hole throw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights then john
