than from those contest and dissension which would certainly arise concern the form of government to be institute over the whole and over the part of this extensive country rely however on the purity of they intention the justice of they cause and the integrity and intelligence of the people under a overrule providence which have so signally protect this country from the first the representative of this nation then consist of little more than half its present number not only break to piece the chain which be forge and the rod of iron that be lift up but frankly cut asunder the tie which have bind they and launch into a ocean of uncertainty the zeal and ardor of the people during the revolutionary war supply the place of government command a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society the confederation which be early feel to be necessary be prepare from the model of the batavian and helvetic confederacy the only example which remain with any detail and precision in history and certainly the only one which the people at large have ever consider but reflect on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day it be then certainly foresee by some who assist in congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable negligence of its regulation inattention to its recommendation if not disobedience to its authority not only in individual but in state soon appear with they melancholy consequence -- universal languor jealousy and rivalry of state decline of navigation and commerce discouragement of necessary manufacture universal fall in the value of land and they produce contempt of public and private faith loss of consideration and credit with foreign nation and at length in discontent animosity combination partial convention and insurrection threaten some great national calamity in this dangerous crisis the people of america be not abandon by they usual good sense presence of mind resolution or integrity measure be pursue to concert a plan to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty the public disquisition discussion and deliberation issue in the present happy constitution of government employ in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transaction i first see the constitution of the united state in a foreign country irritated by no literary altercation animated by no public debate heat by no party animosity i read it with great satisfaction as the result of good head prompt by good heart as a experiment better adapt to the genius character situation and relation of this nation and country than any which have ever be propose or suggest in its general principle and great outline it be conformable to such a system of government as i have ever most esteemed and in some state my own native state in particular have contribute to establish claim a right of suffrage in common with my fellow-citizen in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which be to rule I and my posterity as well as they and theirs i do not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasion in public and in private it be not then nor have be since any objection to it in my mind that the executive and senate be not more permanent nor have i ever entertain a thought of promote any alteration in it but such as the people themselves in the course of they experience should see and feel to be necessary or expedient and by they representative in congress and the state legislature accord to the constitution itself adopt and ordain return to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten year i have the honor to be elect to a station under the new order of thing and i have repeatedly lay myself under the most serious obligation to support the constitution the operation of it have equal the most sanguine expectation of its friend and from a habitual attention to it satisfaction in its administration and delight in its effect upon the peace order prosperity and happiness of the nation i have acquire a habitual attachment to it and veneration for it what other form of government indeed can so well deserve we esteem and love there may be little solidity in a ancient idea that congregation of man into city and nation be the most please object in the sight of superior intelligence but this be very certain that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle present by any nation more please more noble majestic or August than a assembly like that which have so often be see in this and the other chamber of congress of a government in which the executive authority as well as that of all the branch of the legislature be exercise by citizen select at regular period by they neighbor to make and execute law for the general good can anything essential anything more than mere ornament and decoration be add to this by robe and diamond can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descend from accident or institution establish in remote antiquity than when it spring fresh from the heart and judgment of a honest and enlighten people for it be the people only that be represent it be they power and majesty that be reflect and only for they good in every legitimate government under whatever form it may appear the existence of such a government as ours for any length of time be a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people and what object or consideration more please than this can be present to the human mind if national pride be ever justifiable or excusable it be when it spring not from power or riches grandeur or glory but from conviction of national innocence information and benevolence in the midst of these please idea we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to we liberty if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of we free fair virtuous and independent election if a election be to be determine by a majority of a single vote and that can be procure by a party through artifice or corruption the government may be the choice of a party for its own end not of the nation for the national good if that solitary suffrage can be obtain by foreign nation by flattery or menace by fraud or violence by terror intrigue or venality the government may not be the choice of the american people but of foreign nation it may be foreign nation who govern we and not we the people who govern ourselves and candid man will acknowledge that in such case choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance such be the amiable and interesting system of government -lrb- and such be some of the abuse to which it may be expose -rrb- which the people of america have exhibit to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nation for eight year under the administration of a citizen who by a long course of great action regulate by prudence justice temperance and fortitude conduct a people inspire with the same virtue and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace to increase wealth and unexampled prosperity have merit the gratitude of he fellow-citizen command the highest praise of foreign nation and secure immortal glory with posterity in that retirement which be he voluntary

of the future fortune of this country which be open from year to year he name may be still a rampart and the knowledge that he live a bulwark against all open or secret enemy of he country 's peace this example have be recommend to the imitation of he successor by both house of congress and by the voice of the legislature and the people throughout the nation on this subject it might become I better to be silent or to speak with diffidence but as something may be expect the occasion i hope will be admit as a apology if i venture to say that if a preference upon principle of a free republican government form upon long and serious reflection after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth if a attachment to the constitution of the united state and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be alter by the judgment and wish of the people express in the mode prescribe in it if a respectful attention to the constitution of the individual state and a constant

foundation -- the affection of the people it be with extreme regret that i shall be oblige to turn you thought to other circumstance which admonish we that some of these felicity may not be last but if the tide of we prosperity be full and a reflux commence a vigilant circumspection become we that we may meet we reverse with fortitude and extricate ourselves from they consequence with all the skill we possess and all the effort in we power in give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to they consideration such measure as appear to I to be necessary or expedient accord to my constitutional duty the cause and the object of the present extraordinary session will be explain after the president of the united state receive information that the french government have express serious discontent at some proceedings of the government of these state say to affect the interest of france he think it expedient to send to that country a new minister fully instruct to enter on such amicable discussion and to give such candid explanation as might happily remove the discontent and suspicion of the french government and vindicate the conduct of the united state for this purpose he select from among he fellow-citizen a character whose integrity talent experience and service have place he in the rank of the most esteemed and respect in the nation the direct object of he mission be express in he letter of credence to the french republic be to maintain that good understanding which from the commencement of the alliance have subsist between the two nation and to efface unfavorable impression banish suspicion and restore that cordiality which be at once the evidence and pledge of a friendly union and he instruction be to the same effect faithfully to represent the disposition of the government and people of the united state -lrb- they disposition be one -rrb- to remove jealousy and obviate complaint by shew that they be groundless to restore that mutual confidence which have be so unfortunately and injuriously impaired and to explain the relative interest of both country and the real sentiment of he own a minister thus specially commission it be expect would have prove the instrument of restore mutual confidence between the two republic the first step of the french government correspond with that expectation a few day before he arrival at paris the french minister of foreign relation inform the american minister then resident at pari of the formality to be observe by himself in take leave and by he successor preparatory to he reception these formality they observe and on the 9th of December present officially to the minister of foreign relation the one a copy of he letter of recall the other a copy of he letter of credence these be lay before the executive directory two day afterwards the minister of foreign relation inform the recall american minister that the executive directory have determine not to receive another minister plenipotentiary from the united state until after the redress of grievance demand of the american government and which the french republic have a right to expect from it the american minister immediately endeavor to ascertain whether by refuse to receive he it be intend that he should retire from the territory of the french republic and verbal answer be give that such be the intention of the directory for he own justification he desire a write answer but obtain none until toward the last of January when receive notice in write to quit the territory of the republic he proceed to amsterdam where he propose to wait for instruction from this government during he residence at paris card of hospitality be refuse he and he be threaten with be subject to the jurisdiction of the minister of police but with become firmness he insist on the protection of the law of nation due to he as the known minister of a foreign power you will derive further information from he dispatch which will be lay before you as it be often necessary that nation should treat for the mutual advantage of they affair and especially to accommodate and terminate difference and as they can treat only by minister the right of embassy be well know and establish by the law and usage of nation the refusal on the part of france to receive we minister be then the denial of a right but the refusal to receive he until we have accede to they demand without discussion and without investigation be to treat we neither as ally nor as friend nor as a sovereign state with this conduct of the french government it will be proper to take into view the public audience give to the late minister of the united state on he take leave of the executive directory the speech of the president disclose sentiment more alarming than the refusal of a minister because more dangerous to we independence and union and at the same time studiously mark with indignity toward the government of the united state it evince a disposition to separate the people of the united state from the government to persuade they that they have different affection principle and interest from those of they fellow-citizen whom they themselves have choose to manage they common concern and thus to produce division fatal to we peace such attempt ought to be repel with a decision which shall convince france and the world that we be not a degraded people humiliate under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority fit to be the miserable instrument of foreign influence and regardless of national honor character and interest i should have be happy to have throw a veil over these transaction if it have be possible to conceal they but they have pass on the great theater of the world in the face of all europe and america and with such circumstance of publicity and solemnity that they can not be disguise and will not soon be forget they have inflict a wound in the american breast it be my sincere desire however that it may be heal it be my sincere desire and in this i presume i concur with you and with we constituent to preserve peace and friendship with all nation and believe that neither the honor nor the interest of the united state absolutely forbid the repetition of advance for secure these desirable object with france i shall institute a fresh attempt at negotiation and shall not fail to promote and accelerate a accommodation on term compatible with the rights duty interest and honor of the nation if we have commit error and these can be demonstrate we shall be willing to correct they if we have do injury we shall be willing on conviction to redress they and equal measure of justice we have a right to expect from france and every other nation the diplomatic intercourse between the united state and france be at present suspend the government have no means of obtain official information from that country nevertheless there be reason to believe that the executive directory pass a decree on the 2d of march last contravene in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778 injurious to we lawful commerce and endanger the life of we citizen a copy of this decree will be lay before you while we be endeavor to adjust all we difference with france by amicable negotiation the progress of the war in europe the depredation on we commerce the personal injury to we citizen and the general complexion of affair render it my indispensable duty to recommend to you consideration effectual measure of defense the commerce of the united state have become a interesting object of attention whether we consider it in relation to the wealth and finances or the strength and resource of the nation with a seacoast of near 2000 mile in extent open a wide field for fishery navigation and commerce a great portion of we citizen naturally apply they industry and enterprise to these object any serious and permanent injury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorder to prevent it from be undermine and destroy it be essential that it receive a adequate protection the naval establishment must occur to every man who consider the injury commit on we commerce the insult offer to we citizen and the description of vessel by which these abuse have be practice as the suffering of we mercantile and seafaring citizen can not be ascribe to the omission of duty demandable consider the neutral situation of we country they be to be attribute to the hope of impunity arise from a suppose inability on we part to afford protection to resist the consequence of such impression on the mind of foreign nation and to guard against the degradation and servility which they must finally stamp on the american character be a important duty of government a naval power next to the militia be the natural defense of the united state the experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that a moderate naval force such as would be easily within the present ability of the union would have be sufficient to have baffle many formidable transportation of troops from one state to another which be then practice we seacoast from they great extent be more easily annoyed and more easily defend by a naval force than any other with all the material we country abound in skill we naval architect and navigator be equal to any and commander and seaman will not be want but although the establishment of a permanent system of naval defense appear to be requisite i be sensible it can not be form so speedily and extensively as the present crisis demand hitherto i have think proper to prevent the sailing of armed vessel except on voyage to the east indy where general usage and the danger from pirate appear to render the permission proper yet the restriction have originate solely from a wish to prevent collision with the power at war contravene the act of congress of June 1794 and not from any doubt entertain by I of the policy and propriety of permit we vessel to employ means of defense while engage in a lawful foreign commerce it remain for congress to prescribe such regulation as will enable we seafaring citizen to defend themselves against violation of the law of nation and at the same time restrain they from commit act of hostility against the power at war in addition to this voluntary provision for defense by individual citizen it appear to I necessary to equip the frigate and provide other vessel of inferior force to take under convoy such merchant vessel as shall remain unarmed the greater part of the cruiser whose depredation have be most injurious have be build and some of they partially equip in the united state although a effectual remedy may be attend with difficulty yet i have think it my duty to present the subject generally to you consideration if a mode can be devise by the wisdom of congress to prevent the resource of the united state from be convert into the means of annoy we trade a great evil will be prevent with the same view i think it proper to mention that some of we citizen resident abroad have fit out privateer and other have voluntarily take the command or enter on board of they and commit spoliation on the commerce of the united state such unnatural and iniquitous practice can be restrain only by severe punishment but besides a protection of we commerce on the sea i think it highly necessary to protect it at home where it be collect in we most important port the distance of the united state from europe and the well-known promptitude ardor and courage of the people in defense of they country happily diminish the probability of invasion nevertheless to guard against sudden and predatory incursion the situation of some of we principal seaport demand you consideration and as we country be vulnerable in other interest besides those of its commerce you will seriously deliberate whether the means of general defense ought not to be increase by a addition to the regular artillery and cavalry and by arrangement for form a provisional army with the same view and as a measure which even in a time of universal peace ought not to be neglect i recommend to you consideration a revision of the law for organize arm and discipline the militia to render that natural and safe defense of the country efficacious although it be very true that we ought not to involve ourselves in the political system of europe but to keep ourselves always distinct and separate from it if we can yet to effect this separation early punctual and continual information of the current chain of event and of the political project in contemplation be no less necessary than if we be directly concern in they it be necessary in order to the discovery of the effort make to draw we into the vortex in season to make preparation against they however we may consider ourselves the maritime and commercial power of the world will consider the united state of america as form a weight in that balance of power in europe which never can be forget or neglect it would not only be against we interest but it would be do wrong to one-half of europe at least if we should voluntarily throw ourselves into either scale it be a natural policy for a nation that study to be neutral to consult with other nation engage in the same study and pursuit at the same time that measure might be pursue with this view we treaty with prussium and sweden one of which be expire and the other near expire might be renew _ gentleman of the house of representative _ : it be particularly you province to consider the state of the public finances and to adopt such measure respect they as exigency shall be find to require the preservation of public credit the regular extinguishment of the public debt and a provision of fund to defray any extraordinary expense will of course call for you serious attention although the imposition of new burthen can not be in itself agreeable yet there be no ground to doubt that the american people will expect from you such measure as they actual engagement they present security and future interest demand _ gentleman of the senate and gentleman of the house of representative _ : the present situation of we country impose a obligation on all the department of government to adopt a explicit and decide conduct in my situation a exposition of the principle by which my administration will be govern ought not to be omit it be impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world what have be before observe that endeavor have be employ to foster and establish a division between the government and people of the united state to investigate the cause which have encourage this attempt be not necessary but to repel by decide and unite council insinuation so derogatory to the honor and aggression so dangerous to the constitution union and even independence of the nation be a indispensable duty it must not be permit to be doubt whether the people of the united state will support the government establish by they voluntary consent and appoint by they free choice or whether by surrender themselves to the direction of foreign and domestic faction in opposition to they own government they will forfeit the honorable station they have hitherto maintain for myself have never be indifferent to what concern the interest of my country devote the best part of my life to obtain and support its independence and constantly witness the patriotism fidelity and perseverance of my fellow-citizen on the most try occasion it be not for I to hesitate or abandon a cause in which my heart have be so long engage convinced that the conduct of the government have be just and impartial to foreign nation that those internal regulation which have be establish by law for the preservation of peace be in they nature proper and that they have be fairly execute nothing will ever be do by I to impair the national engagement to innovate upon principle which have be so deliberately and uprightly establish or to surrender in any manner the rights of the government to enable I to maintain this declaration i rely under god with entire confidence on the firm and enlighten support of the national legislature and upon the virtue and patriotism of my fellow-citizen john adams address of the senate to john adams president of the united state sir : the senate of the united state request you to accept they acknowledgment for the comprehensive and interesting detail you have give in you speech to both house of congress on the exist state of the union while we

honor and dignity be in a great measure constitutionally deposit with the executive we observe with singular satisfaction the vigilance firmness and promptitude exhibit by you in this critical state of we public affair and from thence derive a evidence and pledge of the rectitude and integrity of you administration and we be sensible it be a object of primary importance that each branch of the government should adopt a language and system of conduct which shall be cool just and dispassionate but firm explicit and decide we be equally desirous with you to preserve peace and friendship with all nation and be happy to be inform that neither the honor nor interest of the united state forbid advance for secure those desirable object by amicable negotiation with the french republic this method of adjust national difference be not only the most mild but the most rational and humane and with government dispose to be just can seldom fail of success when fairly candidly and sincerely use if we have commit error and can be make sensible of they we agree with you in opinion that we ought to correct they and compensate the injury which may have be consequent thereon and we trust the french republic will be actuate by the same just and benevolent principle of national policy we do therefore most sincerely approve of you determination to promote and accelerate a accommodation of we

that effectual measure of defense will tend to inspire that national self-respect and confidence at _ home _ which be the unfailing source of respectability _ abroad _ to check aggression and prevent war while we be endeavor to adjust we difference with the french republic by amicable negotiation the progress of the war in europe the depredation on we commerce the personal injury to we citizen and the general complexion of affair prove to we you vigilant care in recommend to we attention effectual measure of defense those which you recommend whether they relate to external defense by permit we citizen to arm for the purpose of repelling aggression on they commercial rights and by provide sea convoy or to internal defense by increase the establishment of artillery and cavalry by form a provisional army by revise the militia law and fortify more completely we port and harbor will meet we consideration under the influence of the same just regard for the security interest and honor of we country which dictate you recommendation practice so unnatural and iniquitous as those you state of we own citizen convert they property and personal exertion into the means of annoy we trade and injure they fellow-citizen deserve legal severity commensurate with they turpitude although the senate believe that the prosperity and happiness of we country do not depend on general and extensive political connection with european nation yet we can never lose sight of the propriety as well as necessity of enable the executive by sufficient and liberal supplies to maintain and even extend we foreign intercourse as exigency may require repose full confidence in the executive in whom the constitution have place the power of negotiation we learn with sincere concern that attempt be in operation to alienate the affection of we fellow-citizen from they government attempt so wicked wherever they exist can not fail to excite we utmost abhorrence a government choose by the people for they own safety and happiness and calculate to secure both can not lose they affection so long as its administration pursue the principle upon which it be erect and you resolution to observe a conduct

to the world that although the united state love peace they will be independent that they be sincere in they declaration to be just to the french and all other nation and expect the same in return if a sense of justice a love of moderation and peace shall influence they council which we sincerely hope we shall have just grounds to expect peace and amity between the united state and all nation will be preserve but if we be so unfortunate as to experience injury from any foreign power and the ordinary method by which difference be amicably adjust between nation shall be reject the determination

the senate _ : i lay before you for you consideration and advice a treaty of perpetual peace and friendship between the united state of america and the bey and subject of tripolus of barbary conclude at tripolus on the 4th day of November 1796 john adams united state _ may 31 1797 _ _ gentleman of the senate _ : i nominate general charle cotesworth pinckney of south carolina francis dana chief justice of the state of massachusett and general john marshall of virginium to be jointly and severally envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the french republic after mature deliberation on the critical situation of we relation with france which have long engage my most serious attention i have determine on these nomination of person to negotiate with the french republic to dissipate umbrage to remove prejudice to rectify error and adjust all difference by a treaty between the two power it be in the present critical and singular circumstance of great importance to engage the confidence of the great portion of the union in the character employ and the measure which may be adopt i have therefore think it expedient to nominate person of talent and integrity long know and intrust in the three great division of the union and at the same time to provide against the case of death absence indisposition or other impediment to invest any one or more of they with full power john adams united state _ June 12 1797 _ _ gentleman of the senate and gentleman of the house of representative _ : i have receive information from the commissioner appoint on the part of the united state pursuant to the third article of we treaty with spain that the running and mark of the boundary line between the colony of east and west florida and the territory of the united state have be delay by the officer of he catholic majesty and that they have declare they intention to maintain he jurisdiction and to suspend the withdraw he troops from the military post they occupy within the territory of the united state until the two government shall by negotiation have settle the meaning of the second article respect the withdraw of the troops garrison or settlement of either party in the territory of the other -- that be whether when the spanish garrison withdraw they be to leave the work stand or to demolish they -- and until by a additional article to the treaty the real property of the inhabitant shall be secure and likewise until the spanish officer be sure the indian will be pacific the two first question if to be determine by negotiation might be make subject of discussion for year and as no limitation of time can be prescribe to the other a certainty in the opinion of the spanish officer that the indian will be pacific it will be impossible to suffer it to remain a obstacle to the fulfillment of the treaty on the part of spain to remove the first difficulty i have determine to leave it to the discretion of the officer of he catholic majesty when they withdraw he troops from the fort within the territory of the united state either to leave the work stand or to demolish they and to remove the second i shall cause a assurance to be publish and to be particularly communicate to the minister of he catholic majesty and to the governor of louisiana that the settler or occupant of the land in question shall not be disturb in they possession by the troops of the united state but on the contrary that they shall be protect in all they lawful claim and to prevent or remove every doubt on this point it merit the consideration of congress whether it will not be expedient immediately to pass a law give positive assurance to those inhabitant who by fair and regular grant or by occupancy have obtain legal title or equitable claim to land in that country prior to the final ratification of the treaty between the united state and spain on the 25th of April 1796 this country be render peculiarly valuable by its inhabitant who be represent to amount to nearly 4000 generally well affect and much attach to the united state and zealous for the establishment of a government under they authority i therefore recommend to you consideration the expediency of erect a government in the district of the natchez similar to that establish for the territory northwest of the river ohio but with certain modification relative to title or claim of land whether of individual or company or to claim of jurisdiction of any individual state john adams united state _ June 22 1797 _ _ gentleman of the house of representative _ : immediately after i have receive you resolution of the 10th of June request a report respect the depredation commit on the commerce of the united state since the 1st of October 1796 specify the name of the vessel take where bind to or from species of lade the value -lrb- when it can be ascertain -rrb- of the vessel and cargo take and by what power capture particularize those which have be actually condemn together with the proper document to ascertain the same i direct a collection to be make of all such information as should be find in the possession of the government in consequence of which the secretary of state have make the report and the collection of document which accompany this message and be now lay before the house of representative in compliance with they desire john adams united state _ June 23 1797 _ _ gentleman of the senate and of the house of representative _ : the dey of algier have manifest a predilection for american-built vessel and in consequence have desire that two vessel might be construct and equip as cruiser accord to the choice and taste of captain o'brien the cost of two such vessel build with live oak and cedar and copper with gun and all other equipment complete be estimate at $ 45000 the expense of navigate they to algier may perhaps be compensate by the freight of the store with which they may be load on account of we stipulation by treaty with the dey a compliance with the dey 's request appear to I to be of serious importance he will repay the whole expense of building and equip the two vessel and as he have advance the price of we peace with tripolus and become pledge for that of tuni the united state seem to be under peculiar obligation to provide this accommodation and i trust that congress will authorize the advance of money necessary for that purpose it also appear to be of importance to place at algier a person as consul in whose integrity and ability much confidence may be place to whom a considerable latitude of discretion should be allow for the interest of the united state in relation to they commerce that country be so remote as to render it impracticable for the consul to ask and receive instruction in sudden emergency he may sometimes find it necessary to make instant engagement for money or its equivalent to prevent greater expense or more serious evil we can hardly hope to escape occasion of discontent proceeding from the regency or arise from the misconduct or even the misfortune of we commercial vessel navigate in the mediterranean sea and unless the cause of discontent be speedily remove the resentment of the regency may be exert with precipitation on we defenseless citizen and they property and thus occasion a tenfold expense to the united state for these reason it appear to I to be expedient to vest the consul at algier with a degree of discretionary power which can be requisite in no other situation and to encourage a person deserving the public confidence to accept so expensive and responsible a situation it appear indispensable to allow he a handsome salary i should confer on such a consul a superintend power over the consulate for the state of tuni and tripolus especially in respect to pecuniary engagement which should not be make without he approbation while the present salary of $ 2000 a year appear adequate to the consulate of tuni and tripolus twice that sum probably will be requisite for algier john adams united state _ July 3 1797 _ _ gentleman of the senate and gentleman of the house of representative _ : the whole of the intelligence which have for some time past be receive from abroad the correspondence between this government and the minister of the belligerent power reside here and the advice from the officer of the united state civil and military upon the frontier all conspire to shew in a very strong light the critical situation of we country that congress might be enable to form a more perfect judgment of it and of the measure necessary to be take i have direct the proper officer to prepare such collection of extract from the public correspondence as might afford the clearest information the report make to I from the secretary of state and the secretary of war with a collection of document from each of they be now communicate to both house of congress i have desire that the message report and document may be consider as confidential merely that the member of both house of congress may be apprise of they contents before they should be make public as soon as the two house shall have hear they i shall submit to they discretion the publication of the whole or any such part of they as they shall judge necessary or expedient for the public good john adams proclamation by john adam the president of the united state of america a proclamation whereas a act of the congress of the united state be pass on the 9th day of February 1793 entitle a act regulate foreign coin and for other purpose in which it be enact

to be affix to these present and sign the same with my hand -lrb- seal -rrb- do at philadelphium the 22d day of July ad 1797 and of the independence of the united state the twenty-second john adam by the president : timothy pickering _ secretary of state _ first annual address unite state _ November 22 1797 _ _ gentleman of the senate and gentleman of the house of representative _ : i be for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary on account of the contagious sickness which afflict the city of philadelphium to convene the national legislature at some other place this measure it be desirable to avoid because it would occasion much public inconvenience and a considerable public expense and add to the calamity of the inhabitant of this city whose suffering must have excite the sympathy of all they fellow-citizen therefore after take measure to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness i postpone my determination have hope now happily realize that without hazard to the life or health of the member congress might assemble at this place where it be next by law to meet i submit however to you consideration whether a power to postpone the meeting of congress without pass the time fix by the constitution upon such occasion would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794 although i can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in europe and the restoration of security to the person and property of we citizen from injustice and violence at sea we have nevertheless abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for interior tranquillity and personal security for propitious season prosperous agriculture productive fishery and general improvement and above all for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support we sovereignty as well as we moral and we religious principle against all open and secret attack we envoy extraordinary to the french republic embark -- one in July the other early in August -- to join they colleague in holland i have receive intelligence of the arrival of both of they in holland from whence they all proceed on they journey to pari within a few day of the 19th of September whatever may be the result of this mission i trust that nothing will have be omit on my part to conduct the negotiation to a successful conclusion on such equitable term as may be compatible with the safety honor and interest of the united state nothing in the meantime will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as a manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasion the people of the united state have give such memorable proof and the exertion of those resource for national defense which a beneficent providence have kindly place within they power it may be confidently assert that nothing have occur since the adjournment of congress which render inexpedient those precautionary measure recommend by I to the consideration of the two house at the opening of you late extraordinary session if that system be then prudent it be more so now as increase depredation strengthen the reason for its adoption indeed whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with france and whether the war in europe be or be not to continue i hold it most certain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtain the state of society have so long be disturb the sense of moral and religious obligation so much weaken public faith and national honor have be so impaired respect to treaty have be so diminish and the law of nation have lose so much of its force while pride ambition avarice and violence have be so long unrestrained there remain no reasonable ground on which to raise a expectation that a commerce without protection or defense will not be plunder the commerce of the united state be essential if not to they existence at least to they comfort they growth prosperity and happiness the genius character and habit of the people be highly commercial they city have be form and exist upon commerce we agriculture fishery art and manufacture be connect with and depend upon it in short commerce have make this country what it be and it can not be destroy or neglect without involve the people in poverty and distress great number be directly and solely support by navigation the faith of society be pledge for the preservation of the rights of commercial and seafaring no less than of the other citizen under this view of we affair i should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if i forbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect we commerce and to place we country in a suitable posture of defense as the only sure means of preserve both i have entertain a expectation that it would have be in my power at the opening of this session to have communicate to you the agreeable information of the due execution of we treaty with he catholic majesty respect the withdraw of he troops from we territory and the demarcation of the line of limit but by the latest authentic intelligence spanish garrison be still continue within we country and the running of the boundary line have not be commence these circumstance be the more to be regret as they can not fail to affect the indian in a manner injurious to the united state still however indulge the hope that the answer which have be give will remove the objection offer by the spanish officer to the immediate execution of the treaty i have judge it proper that we should continue in readiness to receive the post and to run the line of limit further information on this subject will be communicate in the course of the session in connection with this unpleasant state of thing on we western frontier it be proper for I to mention the attempt of foreign agent to alienate the affection of the indian nation and to excite they to actual hostility against the united state great activity have be exert by those person who have insinuate themselves among the indian tribe reside within the territory of the united state to influence they to transfer they affection and force to a foreign nation to form they into a confederacy and prepare they for war against the united state although measure have be take to counteract these infraction of we rights to prevent indian hostility and to preserve entire they attachment to the united state it be my duty to observe that to give a better effect to these measure and to obviate the consequence of a repetition of such practice a law provide adequate punishment for such offens may be necessary the commissioner appoint under the fifth article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the united state and great britain to ascertain the river which be truly intend under the name of the river st croix mention in the treaty of peace meet at passamaquoddy bay in October 1796 and view the mouth of the river in question and the adjacent shore and island and be of opinion that actual survey of both river to they source be necessary give to the agent of the two nation instruction for that purpose and adjourn to meet at boston in August they meet but the survey require more time than have be suppose and not be then complete the commissioner again adjourn to meet at providence in the state of rhode island in June next when we may expect a final examination and decision the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the sixth article of the treaty meet at philadelphium in may last to examine the claim of british subject for debt contract before the peace and still remain due to they from citizen or inhabitant of the united state various cause have hitherto prevent any determination but the business be now resume and doubtless will be prosecute without interruption several decision on the claim of citizen of the united state for loss and damages sustain by reason of irregular and illegal capture or condemnation of they vessel or other property have be make by the commissioner in london comformably to the seventh article of the treaty the sum award by the commissioner have be pay by the british government a considerable number of other claim where cost and damages and not capture property be the only object in question have be decide by arbitration and the sum award to the citizen of the united state have also be pay the commissioner appoint agreeably to the twenty-first article of we treaty with spain meet at philadelphium in the summer past to examine and decide on the claim of we citizen for loss they have sustain in consequence of they vessel and cargo have be take by the subject of he catholic majesty during the late war between spain and france they sitting have be interrupted but be now resume the united state be obligate to make compensation for the loss and damages sustain by british subject upon the award of the commissioner act under the sixth article of the treaty with great britain and for the loss and damages sustain by british subject by reason of the capture of they vessel and merchandise take within the limit and jurisdiction of the united state and bring into they port or take by vessel originally arm in port of the united state upon the award of the commissioner act under the seventh article of the same treaty it be necessary that provision be make for fulfil these obligation the numerous capture of american vessel by the cruiser of the french republic and of some by those of spain have occasion considerable expense in make and support the claim of we citizen before they tribunal the sum require for this purpose have in diver instance be disburse by the consul of the united state by means of the same capture great number of we seaman have be throw ashore in foreign country destitute of all means of subsistence and the sick in particular have be expose to grievous suffering the consul have in these case also advance money for they relief for these advance they reasonably expect reimbursement from the united state the consular act relative to seaman require revision and amendment the provision for they support in foreign country and for they return be find to be inadequate and ineffectual another provision seem necessary to be add to the consular act some foreign vessel have be discover sail under the flag of the united state and with forge papers it seldom happen that the consul can detect this deception because they have no authority to demand a inspection of the register and sea letter _ gentleman of the house of representative _ : it be my duty to recommend to you serious consideration those object which by the constitution be place particularly within you sphere -- the national debt and tax since the decay of the feudal system by which the public defense be provide for chiefly at the expense of individual the system of loan have be introduce and as no nation can raise within the year by tax sufficient sum for its defense and military operation in time of war the sum loan and debt contract have necessarily become the subject of what have be call fund system the consequence arise from the continual accumulation of public debt in other country ought to admonish we to be careful to prevent they growth in we own the national defense must be provide for as well as the support of government but both should be accomplish as much as possible by immediate tax and as little as possible by loan the estimate for the service of the ensue year will by my direction be lay before you _ gentleman of the senate and gentleman of the house of representative _ : we be meet together at a most interesting period the situation of the principal power of europe be singular and portentous connect with some by treaty and with all by commerce no important event there can be indifferent to we such circumstance call with peculiar importunity not less for a disposition to unite in all those measure on which the honor safety and prosperity of we country depend than for all the exertion of wisdom and firmness in all such measure you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence john adams address of the senate to john adams president of the united state the president of the united state sir : the communication you think proper to make in you speech to both house of congress on the opening of they present session afford additional proof of the attention integrity and firmness which have always marked you official character we can not but approve of the measure you have take to ascertain the state and decline of the contagious sickness which have so lately afflict the city of philadelphium and the pleasing circumstance that congress be now assemble at that place without hazard to the health of its member evince the propriety of you have postpone a determination to convene the national legislature at another place we shall take into consideration the law of 1794 on this subject and will readily concur in any amendment which may be deem expedient it would have give we much pleasure to have receive you congratulation on the reestablishment of peace in europe and the restoration of security to the person and property of we citizen from injustice and violence at sea but though these event so desirable to we country and the world have not take place yet we have abundant cause of gratitude to the great disposer of human event for interior tranquillity and personal security for propitious season prosperous agriculture productive fishery and general improvement and above all for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support we sovereignty against all open and secret attack we learn with satisfaction that we envoy extraordinary to the french republic have safely arrive in europe and be proceed to the scene of negotiation and whatever may be the result of the mission we be perfectly satisfy that nothing on you part have be omit which could in any way conduce to a successful conclusion of the negotiation upon term compatible with the safety honor and interest of the united state and we be fully convince that in the meantime a manifestation of that unanimity and energy of which the people of the united state have give such memorable proof and a proper exertion of those resource of national defense which we possess will essentially contribute to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice we think sir with you that the commerce of the united state be essential to the growth comfort and prosperity of we country and that the faith of society be pledge for the preservation of the rights of commercial and seafaring no less than of other citizen and even if we negotiation with france should terminate favorably and the war in europe cease yet the state of society which unhappily prevail in so great a portion of the world and the experience of past time under better circumstance unite in warn we that a commerce so extensive and which hold out so many temptation to lawless plunderer can never be safe without protection and we hold ourselves oblige by every tie of duty which bind we to we constituent to promote and concur in such measure of marine defense as may convince we merchant and seaman that they rights be not sacrifice nor they injury forget we regret that notwithstanding the clear and explicit term of the treaty between the united state and he catholic majesty the spanish garrison be not yet withdraw from we territory nor the running of the boundary line commence the united state have be faithful in the performance of they obligation to spain and have reason to expect a compliance equally prompt on the part of that power we still however indulge the hope that the convincing answer which have be give to the objection state by the spanish officer to the immediate execution of the treaty will have they proper effect and that this treaty so mutually beneficial to the contracting party will be finally observe with good faith we therefore entirely approve of you determination to continue in readiness to receive the post and to run the line of partition between we territory and that of the king of spain attempt to alienate the affection of the indian to form they into a confederacy and to excite they to actual hostility against the united state whether make by foreign agent or by other be so injurious to we interest at large and so inhuman with respect to we citizen inhabit the adjacent territory as to deserve the most exemplary punishment and we will cheerfully afford we aid in frame a law which may prescribe a punishment adequate to the commission of crime so heinous the several object you have point out to the attention of the legislature whether they regard we internal or external relation shall receive from we that consideration which they merit and we will readily concur in all such measure as may be necessary either to enable we to fulfill we engagement at home or to cause ourselves to be respect abroad and at this portentous period when the power of europe with whom we be connect by treaty or commerce be in so critical a situation and when the conduct of some of those power toward the united state be so hostile and menacing the several branch of the government be in we opinion call upon with peculiar importunity to unite and by union not only to devise and carry into effect those measure on which the safety and prosperity of we country depend but also to undeceive those nation who regard we as a weak and divided people have pursue system of aggression inconsistent with a state of peace between independent nation and sir we beg leave to assure you that we derive a singular consolation from the reflection that at such a time the executive part of we government have be commit to you hand for in you integrity talent and firmness we place the most entire confidence jacob read _ president of the senate pro tempore _ November 27 1797 reply of the president unite state _ November 28 1797 _ _ gentleman of the senate : _ i thank you for this address when after the most laborious investigation and serious reflection without partial consideration or personal motive measure have be adopt or recommend i can receive no higher testimony of they rectitude than the approbation of a assembly so independent patriotic and enlighten as the senate of the united state nothing have afford I more entire satisfaction than the coincidence of you judgment with mine in the opinion of the essential importance of we commerce and the absolute necessity of a maritime defense what be it that have draw to europe the superfluous riches of the three other quarter of the globe but a marine what be it that have drain the wealth of europe itself into the coffer of two or three of its principal commercial power but a marine the world have furnish no example of a flourish commerce without a maritime

influence upon agriculture art and manufacture have be verify in the growth and prosperity of we country it be essentially connect with the other great interest of the community they must flourish and decline together and while the extension of we navigation and trade naturally excite the jealousy and tempt the avarice of other nation we be firmly persuade that the numerous and deserving class of

1798 _ _ gentleman of the senate and gentleman of the house of representative _ : while with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensation of divine providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of we city and town have be visit there be cause for gratitude and mutual congratulation that the malady have disappear and that we be again permit to assemble in safety at the seat of government for the discharge of we important duty but when we reflect that this fatal disorder have within a few year make repeat ravages in some of we principal seaport and with increase malignancy and when we consider the magnitude of the evil arise from the interruption of public and private business whereby the national interest be deeply affect i think it my duty to invite the legislature of the union to examine the expediency of establish suitable regulation in aid of the health law of the respective state for these be form on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicate through the channel of commerce there seem to be a necessity that congress who alone can regulate trade should frame a system which while it may tend to preserve the general health may be compatible with the interest of commerce and the safety of the revenue while we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferer we have abundant reason to present to the supreme be we annual oblation of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessing of he providence to the usual subject of gratitude i can not omit to add one of the first importance to we well-being and safety i mean that spirit which have arise in we country against the menace and aggression of a foreign nation a manly sense of national honor dignity and independence have appear which if encourage and invigorate by every branch of the government will enable we to view undismayed the enterprise of any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory the course of the transaction in relation to the united state and france which have come to my knowledge during you recess will be make the subject of a future communication that communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measure which have be take by the government of the united state toward a amicable adjustment of difference with that power you will at the same time perceive that the french government appear solicitous to impress the opinion that it be averse to a rupture with this country and that it have in a qualified manner declare itself willing to receive a minister from the united state for the purpose of restore a good understanding it be unfortunate for profession of this kind that they should be express in term which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualification which a minister from the united state should possess and that while france be assert the existence of a disposition on she part to conciliate with sincerity the difference which have arise the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the united state of which so many demonstrative proof have be give should even be indirectly question it be also worthy of observation that the decree of the directory allege to be intend to restrain the depredation of french cruiser on we commerce have not give and can not give any relief it enjoin they to conform to all the law of france relative to cruise and prize while these law be themselves the source of the depredation of which we have so long so justly and so fruitlessly complain the law of france enact in January last which subject to capture and condemnation neutral vessel and they cargo if any portion of the latter are of british fabric or produce although the entire property belong to neutral instead of be rescind have lately receive a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal while this law which be a unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nation it attack continue in force those nation can see in the french government only a power regardless of they essential rights of they independence and sovereignty and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with they interest and honor but a firm resistance hitherto therefore nothing be discoverable in the conduct of france which ought to change or relax we measure of defense on the contrary to extend and invigorate they be we true policy we have no reason to regret that these measure have be thus far adopt and pursue and in proportion as we enlarge we view of the portentous and incalculable situation of europe we shall discover new and cogent motive for the full development of we energy and resource but in demonstrate by we conduct that we do not fear war in the necessary protection of we rights and honor we shall give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of peace a efficient preparation for war can alone insure peace it be peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly cultivate and harmony between we and france may be restore at she option but to send another minister without more determinate assurance that he would be receive would be a act of humiliation to which the united state ought not to submit it must therefore be leave with france -lrb- if she be indeed desirous of accommodation -rrb- to take the requisite step the united state will steadily observe the maxim by which they have hitherto be govern they will respect the sacred rights of embassy and with a sincere disposition on the part of france to desist from hostility to make reparation for the injury heretofore inflict on we commerce and to do justice in future there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a friendly intercourse in make to you this declaration i give a pledge to france and the world that the executive authority of this country still adhere to the humane and pacific policy which have invariably govern its proceedings in conformity with the wish of the other branch of the government and of the people of the united state but consider the late manifestation of she policy toward foreign nation i deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with she or not vigorous preparation for war will be alike indispensable these alone will give to we a equal treaty and insure its observance among the measure of preparation which appear expedient i take the liberty to recall you attention to the naval establishment the beneficial effect of the small naval armament provide under the act of the last session be know and acknowledge perhaps no country ever experience more sudden and remarkable advantage from any measure of policy than we have derive from the arm for we maritime protection and defense we ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for a increase of we navy to a size sufficient to guard we coast and protect we trade such a naval force as it be doubtless in the power of the united state to create and maintain would also afford to they the best means of general defense by facilitate the safe transportation of troops and store to every part of we extensive coast to accomplish this important object a prudent foresight require that systematical measure be adopt for procure at all time the requisite timber and other supplies in what manner this shall be do i leave to you consideration i will now advert gentleman to some matter of less moment but proper to be communicate to the national legislature after the spanish garrison have evacuate the post they occupy at the natchez and walnut hill the commissioner of the united state commence he observation to ascertain the point near the mississippus which terminate the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of north latitude from thence he proceed to run the boundary line between the united state and spain he be afterwards join by the spanish commissioner when the work of the former be confirm and they proceed together to the demarcation of the line recent information render it probable that the southern indian either instigate to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequence of suffer white people to run a line over land to which the indian title have not be extinguish have ere this time stop the progress of the commissioner and consider the mischief which may result from continue the demarcation in opposition to the will of the indian tribe the great expense attend it and that the boundary which the commissioner have actually establish probably extend
