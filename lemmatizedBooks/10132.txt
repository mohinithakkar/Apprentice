speaker finish he remark with a short laugh he be a big stout man he name be karl steinmetz and it be a name well know in the government of tver to this day he speak jerkily as stout man do when they ride and when he have laugh he good-natured half-cynical laugh he close he lip beneath a huge gray mustache so far as one could judge from the action of a square and deeply indented chin he mouth be expressive at that time -- and possibly at all time -- of a humorous resignation no reply be vouchsafe to he and karl steinmetz bump along on he little cossack horse which be stretch out at a gallop evening be draw on it be late in October and a cold wind be drive from the north-west across a plain which for sheer dismalness of aspect may give point to sahara and beat that abode of mental depression without a effort so far as the eye could reach there be no habitation to break the line of horizon a few stunt fir-tree stand in a position of permanent deprecation with they back turn as it be to the north stand sparsely on the plain the grass do not look good to eat though the cossack horse would no doubt have like to try it the road seem to have be draw by some titan engineer with a ruler from horizon to horizon away to the south there be a forest of the same stunt pine where a few charcoal-burner and resin-tapper eke out a forlorn and obscure existence there be a score of such settlement such gloomy forest dot over this plain of tver which cover a area of nearly two hundred square mile the remainder of it be pasture where miserable cattle and a few horse many sheep and countless pig seek they food pessimistically from god steinmetz look round over this cheerless prospect with a twinkle of amuse resignation in he blue eye as if this creation be a little practical joke which he karl steinmetz appreciate at its proper worth the whole scene be suggestive of immense distance of countless mile in all direction -- a suggestion not convey by any scene in england by few in europe in we crowded island we have no conception of a thousand mile how can we few of we have travel five hundred at a stretch the land through which these man be ride be the home of great distance -- russium they ride moreover as if they know it -- as if they have ride for day and be aware of more day in front of they the companion of karl steinmetz look like a englishman he be young and fair and quiet he look like a youthful athlete from oxford or cambridge -- a simple-minded person who have jump higher or run quicker than anybody else without conceit take himself like st paul as he find himself and give the credit elsewhere and one find that after all in this world of deceit we be most of we that which we look like you madam look thirty-five to a day although you figure be still youthful you hair untouched by gray you face unseamed by care you may look in you mirror and note these accident with satisfaction you may feel young and indulge in the pastime of youth without effort but you be thirty-five we know it we who look at you can see it for ourselves and if you could only be bring to believe it we think no worse of you on that account the man who ride beside karl steinmetz with gloomy eye and a vague suggestion of flight in he whole demeanor be like reader and writer exactly what he seem he be the product of a english public school and university he be moreover a modern product of those seat of athletic exercise he have little education and highly develop muscle -- that be to say he be no scholar but essentially a gentleman -- a good enough education in its way and long may briton seek it this young man 's name be paul howard alexi and fortune have make he a russian prince if however anyone even steinmetz call he prince he blush and become confused this terrible title have brood over he while at eton and cambridge but no one have find he out he remain paul howard alexi so far as england and he friend be concern in russium however he be know -lrb- by name only for he avoid slavonic society -rrb- as prince pavlo alexi this plain be he half the government of tver be he the great volga roll through he possession sixty mile behind he a grim stone castle bear he name and a tract of land as vast as yorkshire be people by humble-minded person who cringe at the mention of he excellency all this because thirty year earlier a certain princess natásha alexi have fall in love with plain mr howard of the british embassy in st petersburg with slavonic enthusiasm -lrb- for the russian be the most romantic race on earth -rrb- she inform mr howard of the fact and duly married he both these person be now dead and paul howard alexis owe it to he mother 's influence in high region that the responsibility of princedom be he at the time when this title be accord to he he have no say in the matter indeed he have little say in any matter except meal which he still take in liquid form certain it be however that he fail to appreciate he honor as soon as he grow up to a proper comprehension of they equally certain be it that he entirely fail to recognize the enviability of he position as he ride across the plain of tver toward the yellow volga by the side of karl steinmetz this be great nonsense he say suddenly i feel like a nihilist or some theatrical person of that sort i do not think it can be necessary steinmetz not necessary answer steinmetz in thick guttural tone but prudent this man speak with the soft consonant of a german prudent my dear prince oh drop that when we sight the volga i will drop it with pleasure good heaven i wish i be a prince i should have it mark on my linen and sit up in bed to read it on my nightshirt no you would not steinmetz answer alexi with a vex laugh you would hate it just as much as i do especially if it mean run away from the best bear-shooting in europe steinmetz shrug he shoulder then you should not have be charitable -- charity i tell you alexis cover no sin in this country who make I charitable besides no decent-minded fellow could be anything else here who tell I of the league of charity i should like to know who put I into it who arouse my pity for these poor beggar who but a stout german cynic call steinmetz stout yes -- cynic if you will -- german no the word be jerk out of he by the gallop horse then what be you steinmetz look straight in front of he with a meditation in he quiet eye which make a dreamy man of he that depend alexi laugh yes i know in germany you be a german in russium a slav in poland a pole and in england any thing the moment suggest exactly so but to return to you you must trust to I in this matter i know this country i know what this league of charity be it be a bigger thing than any dream of it be a power in russium -- the greatest of all -- above nihilism -- above the emperor himself ach gott it be a wonderful organization spreading over this country like sunlight over a field it would have make man of we poor peasant it be god 's work if there be a god -- bien entendu -- which some young man deny because god fail to recognize they importance i imagine and now it be all do it be crumble up by the scurrilous treachery of some miscreant ach i should like to have he out here on the plain i would choke he for money too the devil -- it must have be the devil -- to sell that secret to the government i can not see what the government want it for growl alexi moodily no but i can it be not the emperor he be a gentleman although he have the misfortune to wear the purple no it be those about he they want to stop education they want to crush the peasant they be afraid of be find out they live in they grand house and support they grand name on the money they crush out of the starve peasant so do i so far as that go of course you do and i be you steward -- you crusher we do not deny it we boast of it but we exchange a wink with the angel -- eh alexis ride on in silence for a few moment he sit he horse as english foxhunter do -- not prettily -- and the little animal with erect head and scraggy neck be evidently worry by the unusual grip on he rib for russian sit back with a short stirrup and a loose seat when they be travel one must not form one 's idea of russian horsemanship from the erect carriage affect in the newskus prospect i wish he say abruptly that i have never attempt to do any good do good to mankind do not pay here i be run away from my own home as if i be afraid of the police the position be impossible steinmetz shake he shaggy head no no position be impossible in this country -- except the czar 's -- if one only keep cool for man such as you and i any position be quite easy but these russian be too romantic -- too exaltés -- they give way to a morbid love of martyrdom : they think they can do no good to mankind unless they be uncomfortable alexi turn in he saddle and look keenly into he companion 's face do you know he say i believe you found the charity league steinmetz laugh in he easy stout way it found itself he say the angel found it in heaven i hope a committee of they will attend to the eternal misery of the dog who betray it i trust they will but in the meantime i stick to my opinion that it be unnecessary for I to leave the country what have i do i do not belong to the league it be compose entirely of russian noble i do not admit that i be a russian noble but persist steinmetz quietly you subscribe to the league four hundred thousand ruble -- they do not grow at the roadside but the ruble have not my name on they that may be but we all -- _ they all _ -- know where they be likely to come from my dear paul you can not keep up the farce any longer you be not a english gentleman who come across here for sport purpose you do not live in the old castle of osterno three month in the year because you have a taste for mediaeval fortress you be a russian prince and you estate be the happiest the most enlighten in the empire that alone be suspicious you collect you rent yourself you have no german agent -- no german vampire about you there be a thousand thing suspicious about prince pavlo alexi if those that be in high place only come to think about it they have not come to think about it -- thanks to we care and to you english independence but that be only another reason why we should redouble we care you must not be in russium when the charity league be pick to piece there will be trouble -- half the nobility in russium will be in it there will be confiscation and degradation : there will be imprisonment and siberium for some you be better out of it for you be not a englishman you have not even a foreign office passport you passport be you patent of nobility and that be russian no you be better out of it and you -- what about you ask paul with a little laugh -- the laugh that one brave man give when he see another do a plucky thing i oh i be all right i be nobody i be hate of all the peasant because i be you steward and so hard -- so cruel that be my certificate of harmlessness with those that be about the emperor paul make no answer he be not of a argumentative mind be a large man and consequently incline to the sin of omission rather than to the active form of do wrong he have a enormous faith in karl steinmetz and indeed no man know russia better than this cosmopolitan adventurer steinmetz it be who prick forward with all speed wear he hardy little horse to a droop semblance of its former self steinmetz it be who have recommend quit the travel carriage and take to the saddle although he own bulk lead he to prefer the slower and more comfortable method of cover space it would almost seem that he doubt he own ascendency over he companion and master which semblance be further increase by a subtle ring of anxiety in he voice while he argue it be possible that karl steinmetz suspect the late princess natásha of have transmit to she son a small hereditary portion of that slavonic exaltation and recklessness of consequence which he deplore then you turn back at tver enquire paul at length break a long silence yes i must not leave osterno just now perhaps later when the winter have come i will follow russium be quiet during the winter very quiet ha ha he shrug he shoulder and shiver but the shiver be interrupted he raise himself in he saddle and peer forward into the gathering darkness what be that he ask sharply on the road in front paul have already see it it look like a horse he answer -- a strayed horse for it have no rider they be go west and what little daylight there be live on the western horizon the form of the horse cut out in black relief against the sky be weird and ghostlike it be stand by the side of the road apparently grazing as they approach it its outline become more define it have a saddle say steinmetz at length what have we here the beast be evidently famish for as they come near it never cease its occupation of drag the wizened tuft of grass up root and all what have we here repeat steinmetz and the two man clap spur to they tired horse the solitary waif have a rider but he be not in the saddle one foot be catch in the stirrup and as the horse move on from tuft to tuft it drag its dead master along the ground chapter ii by the volga this be go to be unpleasant muttered steinmetz as he cumbrously leave the saddle that man be dead -- have be dead some day he be stiff and the horse have be drag he face downward god in heaven this will be unpleasant paul have leap to the ground and be already loosen the dead man 's foot from the stirrup he do it with a certain sort of skill despite the stiffness of the heavy riding-boot as if he have walk a hospital in he time very quickly steinmetz come to he assistance tenderly lift the dead man and lay he on he back ach he exclaim we be unfortunate to meet a thing like this there be no need of paul alexi ' medical skill to tell that this man be dead a child would have know it before search the pocket steinmetz take out he own handkerchief and lay it over a face which have become unrecognizable the horse be stand over they it bent its head and sniff wonderingly at that which have once be its master there be a singular scared look in its eye steinmetz push aside the enquire muzzle if you could speak my friend he say we might want you as it be you have better continue you meal paul be unbutton the dead man 's clothes he insert he hand within the rough shirt this man he say be starve he probably faint from sheer exhaustion and roll out of the saddle it be hunger that kill he with he pocket full of money add steinmetz withdraw he hand from the dead man 's pocket and display a bundle of note and some silver there be nothing in any of the other pocket -- no paper no clue of any sort to the man 's identity the two finder of this silent tragedy stand up and look around they it be almost dark they be ten mile from a habitation it do not sound much but a traveller would be hard put to place ten mile between himself and a habitation in the whole of the british island this add to a lack of road or path which be unknown to we in england make ten mile of some importance steinmetz have push he fur cap to the back of he head which he be scratch pensively he have a habit of scratch he forehead with one finger which denote think now what be we to do he mutter can not bury the poor chap and say nothing about it i wonder where he passport be we have here a tragedy he turn to the horse which be grazing hurriedly my friend of the four leg he say it be a thousand pity that you be dumb paul be still examine the dead man with that callousness which denote one who for love or convenience have become a doctor he be a doctor -- a amateur he be a caius man steinmetz look down at he with a little laugh he notice the tenderness of the touch the deft finger which have something of respect in it paul alexi be visibly one of those man who take mankind seriously and have that in they heart which for want of a better word we call sympathy mind you do not catch some infectious disease say steinmetz gruffly i should not care to handle any stray moujik one find dead about the roadside unless of course you think there be more money about he it would be a pity to leave that for the police paul do not answer he be examine the limp dirty hand of the dead man the finger be cover with soil the nail be break he have evidently clutch at the earth and at every tuft of grass after he fall from the saddle look here at these hand say paul suddenly this be a englishman you never see finger this shape in russium steinmetz stoop down he hold out he own square-tipped finger in comparison paul rub the dead hand with he sleeve as if it be a piece of statuary look here he continue the dirt rub off and leave the hand quite a gentlemanly color this -- he pause and lift steinmetz 's handkerchief drop it again hurriedly over the mutilate face -- this thing be once a gentleman it certainly have see better day admit steinmetz with a grim humor which be sometimes he come let we drag he beneath that pine-tree and ride on to tver we shall do no good my dear alexis waste we time over the possible antecedent of a gentleman who for reason of he own be silent on the subject paul rise from the ground he movement be those of a strong and supple man one whose muscle have never have time to grow stiff he be a active man who never hurry standing thus upright he be very tall -- nearly a giant only in st petersburg of all the city of the world could he expect to pass unnoticed -- the city of tall man and plain woman he rub he two hand together in a singularly professional manner which sit amiss on he what do you propose do he ask you know the law of this country better than i do steinmetz scratch he forehead with he forefinger we theatrical friend the police he say be go to enjoy this suppose we prop he up sit against that tree -- no one will run away with he -- and lead he horse into tver i will give notice to the police but i will not do so until you be in the petersburg train i will of course give the ispravnik to understand that you princely mind could not be bother by such detail as this -- that you have proceed on you journey i do not like leave the poor beggar alone all night say paul there may be wolf -- the crow in the early morning bah that be because you be so soft-hearted my dear fellow what business be it of ours if the universal law of nature be illustrate upon this unpleasant object we all live on each other the wolf and the crow have the last word tant mieux for the wolf and the crow come let we carry he to that tree the moon be just rise over the line of the horizon all around they the steppe lay in grim and lifeless silence in such a scene where life seem rare and precious death gain in its power of inspiring fear it be different in crowded city where a excess of human life seem to vouch for the continuity of the race where in a teem population one life more or less seem of little value the rosy hue of sunset be fading to a clear green and in the midst of a cloudless sky jupiter -- very near the earth at that time -- shone intense and brilliant like a lamp it be a evening such as only russium and the great north land ever see where the sunset be almost in the north and the sunrise hold it by the hand over the whole scene there hang a clear transparent night green and shimmering which would never be darker than a english twilight the two live man carry the nameless unrecognizable dead to a resting-place beneath a stunt pine a few pace remove from the road they lay he decently at full length cross he soil-begrimed hand over he breast tie the handkerchief down over he face then they turn and leave he alone in that luminous night a waif that have fall by the great highway without a word without a sign a half-run race -- a story cut off in the middle for he be a young man still he hair all dusty draggled and bloodstain have no streak of gray he hand be smooth and youthful there be a vague suspicion of sensual softness about he body as if this might have be a man who love comfort and ease who have always choose the primrose path have never learn the salutary lesson of self-denial the incipient stoutness of limb contrast strangely with the draw meagreness of he body which be contract by want of food paul alexi be right this man have die of starvation within ten mile of the great volga within nine mile of the outskirts of tver a city second to moscow and once she rival therefore it could only be that he have purposely avoid the dwelling of man that he be a fugitive of some sort or another paul 's theory that this be a englishman have not be receive with enthusiasm by steinmetz but that philosopher have stoop to inspect the narrow tell-tale finger steinmetz be it note have a infinite capacity for hold he tongue they mount they horse and ride away without look back but they do not speak as if each be deep in he own thought material have indeed be afford they for who could tell who this featureless man might be they be leave in a state of hopeless curiosity as who have pick up a page with finis write upon it fall to wonder what the story may have be steinmetz have throw the bridle of the stray horse over he arm and the animal trot obediently by the side of the fidgety little cossack that be bad luck exclaim the elder man at length d -- d bad luck in this country the less you find the less you see the less you understand the simpler be you existence those nihilist with they mysterious way and they reprehensible love of explosive have make honest man 's life a burden to they they motive be originally good put in paul that be possible but a good motive be no excuse for a bad means they want to get along too quickly they be pig-headed exalted unpractical to a man i do not mention the woman because when woman meddle in politics they make fool of themselves even in england these nihilist would have be all very well if they have be content to sow for posterity but they want to see the fruit of they labor in one generation education do not grow like that it require a couple of generation to germinate it have to be manure by the brain of fool before it be of any use in england it have reach this stage here in russium the sowing have only begin now we be do some good the charity league be the thing it begin by train they starve body to be ready for the education when it come and very little of it would have come in we time if you educate a hungry man you set a devil loose upon the world fill they stomach before you feed they brain or you will give they mental indigestion and a man with mental indigestion raise hell or cut he own throat that be just what i want to do -- fill they stomach i do not care about the rest i be not responsible for the progress of the world or the good of humanity say paul he ride on in silence then he burst out again in the curt phraseology of a man whose feeling be stronger than he care to admit i have get no grand idea about the human race he say a very little contents I a little piece of tver a few thousand peasant be good enough for I it seem rather hard that a fellow can not give away of he surplus money in charity if he be such a fool as to want to steinmetz be ride stubbornly along suddenly he give a little chuckle -- a guttural sound expressive of a somewhat germanic satisfaction i do not see how they can stop we he say the league of course be do it will crumble away in sheer panic but here in tver they can not stop we he clap he great hand on he thigh with more glee than one would have expect he to feel for this man pose as a cynic -- a despiser of man a scoffer at charity they 'll find it very difficult to stop I muttered paul alexi it be now dark -- as dark as ever it would be steinmetz peer through the gloom toward he with a little laugh -- half tolerance half admiration the country be here a little more broken long low hill like vast wave rise and fall beneath the horse ' foot age ago the volga may have be here and slowly narrow must have leave these hill in deposit from the crest of a incline the horseman look down over a vast rolling tableland and far ahead of they a great white streak bound the horizon the volga say steinmetz we be almost there and there to the right be the tversha it be like a great catapult gott what a wonderful night no wonder these russian be romantic what a night for a pipe and a long chair this horse of mine be tire he shake I most abominably like to change enquired paul curtly no it would make no difference you be as heavy as i although i be wider ah there be the light of tver ahead of they a few light twinkle feebly sometimes visible and then hide again as they ride over the rolling hillock one plain ever suggest another but the resemblance between the steppe of tver and the great sahara be at time startling there be in both that roll as of the sea -- the great roll that heave unceasingly round the cape of good hope and horn look at casually tver and sahara 's plain be level and it be only in cross they that one realize the gentle up and down beneath the horse ' foot soon steinmetz raise he head and sniff in a loud teutonic manner it be the reek of water for great river like the ocean have they smell and the volga be a revelation man travel far to see a city but few seem curious about a river every river have nevertheless its individuality its great silent interest every river have moreover its influence which extend to the people who pass they life within sight of its water thus the guadalquivir be rapid mysterious untrammelled -- break frequently from its boundary and it run through andalusium the nile -- the river of age -- run clear untrouble through the century between bank untouched by man the rhine -- romantic cultivate artificial with a rough subcurrent and a muddy bed -- through germany the seine and the thame -- shallow -- shallow -- shallow and we -- who live upon they bank the volga -- immense stupendous a great power a influence two thousand four hundred mile long some have see the danube and think they have see a great river so they have but the russian giant be seven hundred mile longer a vast yellow stream move on to the distant sea -- slow gentle inexorable overwhelming all great thing in nature have the power of crush the human intellect russian be thus crush by the vastness of they country of they river man be but a small thing in a great country and those who live by nile or guadalquivir or volga seem to hold they life on condition they exist from day to day by the tolerance of they river steinmetz and paul pause for a moment on the wooden float bridge and look at the great river all who cross that bridge or the railway bridge higher up the stream must do the same they pause and draw a deep breath as if in the presence of something supernatural they ride on without speak through the squalid town -- the whilom rival and the victim of brilliant moscow they ride straight to the station where they dine in by the way one of the best railway refreshment room in the world at one o'clock the night express from moscow to st petersburg with its huge american locomotive rumble into the station paul secure a chair in the long saloon car and then return to the platform the train wait twenty minute for refreshment and he still have much to say to steinmetz for one of these man own a principality and the other govern it they walk up and down the long platform smoking endless cigarette talk gravely steinmetz stand on the platform and watch the train pass slowly away into the night then he go toward a lamp and take a pocket-handkerchief from he pocket examine each corner of it in succession it be a small pocket-handkerchief of fine cambric in one corner be the initial ssb work neatly in white -- such embroidery as be do in st petersburg ach exclaim steinmetz shortly something tell I that that be he he turn the little piece of cambric over and over examine it slowly with a heavy germanic cunning he have take this handkerchief from the body of the nameless rider who be now lie alone on the steppe twelve mile away steinmetz return to the large refreshment room and order the waiter to bring he a glass of benedictine which he drink slowly and thoughtfully then he go toward the large black stove which stand in the railway restaurant at tver he open the door with the point of he boot the wood be roar and crackle within he throw the handkerchief in and close the door it be as well mon prince he mutter that i find this and not you chapter iii diplomatic all that there be of the most brilliant and least truthful in europe m claude de chauxville have say to a lady earlier in the evening apropo of the great gathering at the french embassy and the mot have go the round of the room in society a little mot will go a long way m le baron de chauxville be moreover a manufacturer of mots by call he be attaché to the french embassy in london by profession he be a epigrammatist that be to say he be a sort of social revolver he go off if one touch he conversationally and like other among we he frequently miss fire of course he have but little real respect for the truth if one wish to be epigrammatic one must relinquish the hope of be either agreeable or veracious m de chauxville do not really intend to convey the idea that any of the person assemble in the great guest chamber of the french embassy that evening be anything but what they seem he could not surely imagine that lady mealhead -- the beautiful spouse of the seventh earl mealhead -- be anything but what she seem : namely a great lady of course m de chauxville know that lady mealhead have once be the darling of the music-hall and that a thousand heart have vociferously go out to she from sixpenny and even threepenny gallery when she answer to the name of tiny smallto but then m de chauxville know as well as you and i -- lady mealhead no doubt have tell he -- that she be the daughter of a clergyman and have choose the stage in preference to the school-room as a means of support she aged mother whether m de chauxville believe this or not it be not for we to enquire he certainly look as if he believe it when lady mealhead tell he -- and he expressive gallic eye wax tender at the mention of she mother the relict of the late clergyman whose name have somehow be overlook by crockford a frenchman love he mother -- in the abstract nor could m de chauxville take exception at young cyril squyrt the poet cyril look like a poet he wear he hair over he collar at the back and below the collar-bone in front and moreover he be a poet -- one of those who write for age yet unborn besides he poem could be buy -lrb- of the publisher only the railway bookstall man do not understand they -rrb- beautifully bind really beautifully bind in white kid with green ribbon -- a very thin volume and very thin poetry meddlesome person have be know to state that cyril squyrt 's father keep a prosperous hot-sausage-and-mashed-potato shop in leed but one must not always believe all that one hear it appear that beneath the turf or on it all man be equal so no one could object to the presence of billy bale the man by gad who could give you the straight tip on any race and look like it we all know bale 's livery stable the same be billy 's father but no matter billy wear the best cut riding-breeches in the park and let I tell you there be many folk in society with a smaller recommendation than that now it be not we business to go round the room of the french embassy pick hole in the earthly robe of society 's elect suffice it to say that every one be there miss kate whyte of course who have make a place in society and hold it by the indecency of she language lady mealhead say she could not stand kitty whyte at any price we be sorry to use such a word as indecency in connection with a young person of the gentler sex but fact must sometimes be recognize and it be a bare fact that society tolerate nay encouraged kitty whyte because society never know and always want to know what she would say next she sail so near to the unsteady breeze of decorum that the safer-going craft hang breathlessly in she wake in the hope of a upset every one in fact be there all those who have have greatness thrust upon they and the other those who thrust themselves upon the great -- those in a word who reach such as be above they by do that which should be beneath they lord mealhead by the way be not there he never be anywhere where the respectable writer and he high-born reader be to be find it be discreet not to enquire where lord mealhead be especially of lady mealhead who have sever more completely she connection with the past he lordship be perchance of a sentimental humor and love to wander in those pasteboard grove where first he meet he tiny -- and very natural too there be music and the refreshment it be in fact a reception gaul 's most lively son bow before albion 's fairest daughter and display that fund of verve and esprit which they rightly pride themselves upon possess and which of course leave mere englishman so far behind in the path of love and chivalry when not thus actively engage they whisper together in corner and nudge each other exchange muttered comment in which the word charmante come conveniently to the fore thus the lightsome son of republican gaul in society it be however high time to explain the reason of we own presence -- of we own reception by france 's courteous representative we be here to meet mr sydney bamborough and moreover to confine we attention to the person more or less implicate in the present history mr sydney bamborough be undoubtedly the belle of the evening she have only to look in one of the many mirror to make sure of that fact and if she want further assurance a hundred man in the room would have be ready to swear to it this lady have recently dawn on london society -- a young widow she rarely mention she husband it be understand to be a painful subject he have be attach to several embassy she say he have a brilliant career before he and suddenly he have die abroad and then she give a little sigh and a bright smile which be interpret mean let we change the subject there be never any doubt about mr sydney bamborough she be aristocratic to the tip of she dainty white finger -- compose gentle and quite sure of herself quite the grand lady as lady mealhead say but mr sydney bamborough do not know lady mealhead which may have account for the title woman 's little sniff of interrogation as a matter of fact etta sydney bamborough come from excellent ancestry and could claim a uncle here a cousin there and a number of distant relative everywhere should it be worth the while it be safe to presume that she be rich from the manner in which she dress the number of servant and horse she keep the general air of wealth which pervade she existence that she be beautiful any one could see for himself -- not in the shop-window among the presumably self-selected type of english beauty but in the proper place -- namely in she own and other aristocratic drawing-room she be talk to a tall fair frenchman -- in perfect french -- and be herself nearly as tall as he bright brown hair wave prettily back from a white forehead clever dark gray eye and a lovely complexion -- one of those complexion which from a purity of conscience or a steadiness of nerve never change cheek of a faint pink a expressive mobile mouth a neck of dazzling white such be mrs sydney bamborough in the prime of she youth and you maintain that it be five year since we meet she be say to the tall frenchman have i not count every day he reply i do not know she answer with a little laugh that little laugh which tell wise man where flattery may be shoot like so much conversational rubbish some woman be fathomless pit the rubbish never seem to fill they i do not know but i should not think so well madam it be so witness these gray hair ah those be happy day in st petersburg mr sydney bamborough smile -- a pleasant society smile not too pronounced and just sufficient to suggest pearly tooth at the mention of st petersburg she glance round to see that they be not overhear she give a little shiver do not speak of russium she plead i hate to hear it mention i be so happy it be painful to remember even while she speak the expression of she face change to one of gay delight she nod and smile toward a tall man who be evidently look for she and take no notice of the frenchman 's apology who _ be _ that ask the young man i see he everywhere lately a mere english gentleman mr paul howard alexi reply the lady the frenchman raise he eyebrow he know better this be no plain english gentleman he bow and take he leave m de chauxville of the french embassy be watch every movement every change of expression from across the room in evening dress the man whom we last saw on the platform of the railway station at tver do not look so unmistakably english it be more evident that he have inherit certain characteristic from he russian mother -- notably he great height a physical advantage enjoy by many aristocratic russian family he hair be fair and inclined to curl and there the foreign suggestion suddenly cease he face have the quiet concentration the unobtrusive self-absorption which one see more strongly mark in english face than in any other he manner of move through the well-dressed crowd somewhat belie the tan of he skin here be a out-of-door athletic youth who know how to move in drawing-room -- a big man who do not look much too large for he surroundings it be evident that he do not know many people and also that he be indifferent to he loss he have come to see mr sydney bamborough and that lady be not insensible to the fact to prove this she diverge from the path of veracity as be the way of some woman i do not expect to see you here she say you tell I you be come he answer simply the inference would have be enough for some woman but not for etta sydney bamborough well be that a reason why you should attend a diplomatic soirée and force yourself to bow and smirk to a number of white-handed little dandy whom you despise the best reason he answer quietly with a honesty which somehow touch she as nothing else have touch this beautiful woman since she have become aware of she beauty then you think it worth the bowing and the smirk she ask look past he with innocent eye she make a imperceptible little movement toward he as if she expect he to whisper she be of that school but he be not he be not the sort of mind to conceive any thought that require whisper some person in fact go so far as to say that he be hopelessly dull that he have no subtlety of think no brightness no conversation these person be no doubt lady upon whom he have fail to lavish the exceedingly small change of compliment it be worth that and more he reply with he ready smile after all bow and smirk come very easily one soon get accustomed to it one have to she reply with a little sigh especially if one be a woman which little mishap come to some of we you know i wonder if you could find I a chair she be stand with she back to a small sofa capable of hold three but calculate to accommodate two she do not of course see it in fact she look everywhere but toward it raise she perfectly gloved finger tentatively for he arm i be tire of stand she add he turn and indicate the sofa toward which she immediately advance as she sit down he note vaguely that she be exquisitely dress certainly one of the best dress woman in the room she costume be daring without be startling be merely black and white largely boldly contrast he feel indefinitely proud of the dress some instinct in the man 's simple strong mind tell he that it be good for woman to be beautiful but he ignorance of the sex be profound he have no desire to analyze the beauty he have no mental reservation with regard to she indeed it would have be hard to find fault with etta sydney bamborough look upon she merely as a beautiful woman exquisitely dress in a cynical age this man be without cynicism he do not dream of reflect that the lovely hair owe half its beauty to the clever handling of a maid that the perfect dress have be the all-absorbing topic of many of its wearer 's leisure hour he be in fact young for he year and what be youth but a happy ignorance it be only when we know too much that gravity mark we for she own mr sydney bamborough look up at he with a certain admiration this man be like a mountain breeze to one who have breathe nothing but the fade air of drawing-room she draw in she train with a pretty curve of she gloved wrist you look as if you do not know what it be to be tired but perhaps you will sit down i can make room he accept with alacrity and now she say let I hear where you have be i have only have time to shake hand with you the last twice that we have meet you say you have be away yes i have be to russia she face be steadily beautiful compose and ready ah how interesting i have be in petersburg i love russium while she speak she be actually look across the room toward the tall frenchman she late companion do you answer paul eagerly he face light up after the manner of those countenance that belong to man of one idea i be very much interested in russium do you know petersburg she ask rather hurriedly i mean -- society there no i know one or two people in moscow she nod suppress a quick little sigh which might have be one of relief have she face be less pleasant and smile who she ask indifferently she be interested in the lace of she pocket-handkerchief of which the scent faintly reach he he be a simple person and the faint odor give he a distinct pleasure -- a suggest intimacy he mention several well-known muscovite name and she break into a sudden laugh how terrible they sound she say gayly even to I and i have be to petersburg but you speak russian mr alexi yes he answer and you she shake she head and give a little sigh i oh no i be not at all clever i be afraid chapter iv don quixote paul have be five month in england when he meet mr sydney bamborough since he hurry departure from tver a winter have come and go leave its mark as winter do it leave a very distinct mark on russium it be a famine winter from the snow-ridden plain that lie to the north of moscow karl steinmetz have write piteous description of a existence which seem hardly worth the living but each letter have terminate with a prayer remarkably near to a command that he paul howard alexi should remain in england so paul stay in london where he indulge to the full a sadly mistaken hobby this man have as we have see that which be call a crank or a loose screw accord to the fancy of the speaker he have conceive the absurd idea of benefit he fellow-being and of turn into that mistaken channel the surplus wealth that be he this moreover if it please you without so much as form himself into a society this be a age of society and far from conceal from the left hand the good which the right may be do we publish abroad we charity on all hand we publish in a stout volume we name and donation we even go so far as to cultivate a artificial charity by meat and drink and speech withal when we have eat and drunk the plate be hand round and from the fulness of we heart we give abundantly we be cunning even in we well-doing we do not pass round the plate until the decanter have lead the way and thus we degrade that quality of the human heart which be the best of all but paul howard alexi have the good fortune to be rich out of england and that roar lion of modern day organize charity pass he by he be thus leave to evolve from he own mind a mistaken sense of he duty toward he neighbor that there be thousand of well-meaning person in black and other coat ready to prove to he that revenue gather from russium should be spend in the east end or the east indy go without say there be always well-meaning person among we ready to direct the charity of other we have all meet those virtuous person who do good by proxy but paul have not he have never come face to face with the charity broker -- the man who stand between the needy and the giver give nothing himself and live on he brokerage sit in a comfortable chair with he foot on a turkey carpet in he office on a main thoroughfare paul have meet none of these and the only organized charity of which he be cognizant be the great russian charity league betray six month earlier to a government which have ever turn its face against education and enlightenment in this he have take no active part but he have give largely of he great wealth that he name have figure on the list of family sell for a vast sum of money to the authority of the ministry of the interior seem all too sure but he have have no intimation that he be look upon with small favor the more active member of the league have be less fortunate and more than one nobleman have be banish to he estate although the sum actually pay for the papers of the charity league be know the recipient of the blood money have never be discover it be a large sum for the government have be quick to recognize the necessity of nipping this movement in the bud education be a dangerous matter to deal with england be begin to find this out for herself for on the heel of education socialism ever tread when at last education make a foothold in russium that foothold will be on the very step of the autocratic throne the charity league have as steinmetz put it the primary object of prepare the peasant for education and thereafter place education within he reach such proceedings be naturally hold by those in high place to be only second to nihilism all this and more which shall transpire in the course of this narration be know to paul in face of the fact that he name be prominently before the russian ministry of the interior he proceed all through the winter to ship road-making tool agricultural implement seed and food the prince say steinmetz to those who be interested in the matter be mad he think that a russian principality be to be work on the same system as a english estate he would laugh and shrug he shoulder and then he would sit down and send a list of further requirement to paul howard alexi esquire in london paul have meet mr sydney bamborough on one or two occasion and have be interested in she from the first he have come under the influence of she beauty but she be then a married woman he meet she again toward the end of the terrible winter to which reference have be make and find that a mere acquaintanceship have in the meantime develop into friendship he could not have tell when and where the great social barrier have be surmount and leave behind he only know in a indefinite way that some such change have take place as all such change do not in intercourse but in the interval of absence it be a singular fact that we do not make we friend when they be near the seed of friendship and love alike be soon sown and the best be that which germinate in absence that friendship have rapidly develop into something else paul become aware early in the season and as we have see from he conversation mr sydney bamborough innocent and guileless as she be might with all modesty have divine the state of he feeling have she be less overshadow by she widow 's weed she apparently have no such suspicion for she ask paul in all good faith to call the next day and tell she all about russium -- dear russium my cousin maggie she add be stay with I she be a dear girl i be sure you will like she paul accept with alacrity but reserve to himself the option of hate mr sydney bamborough 's cousin maggie merely because that young lady exist and happen to be stay in upper brook street at five o'clock the next afternoon he present himself at the house of mourning and completely fill up its small entrance-hall he be show into the drawing-room where he discover miss margaret delafield in the act of drag she hat off in front of the mirror over the mantelpiece he hear a suppress exclamation of amuse horror and find himself shake hand with mr sydney bamborough the lady mention paul 's name and she cousin 's relationship in that casual manner which constitute a introduction in these degenerate day miss delafield bow laugh and move toward the door she leave the room and behind she a impression of breeziness and health of english girlhood and a certain bright cheerfulness which act as a filter in social muddy water it be very good of you to come -- i be mope say mr sydney bamborough she be as a matter of fact rest before the work of the evening this lady thoroughly understand the art of be beautiful paul do not answer at once he be look at a large photograph which stand in a frame on the mantelpiece -- the photograph of a handsome man of twenty-eight or thirty small-featured fair and shifty look who be that he ask abruptly do you not know my husband paul mutter a apology but he do not turn away from the photograph oh never mind say mr sydney bamborough in reply to he regret that he have stumble upon a painful subject i never -- she pause no she go on i will not say that but so far as convey what she mean be concern she might just as well have utter the word i do not want a sympathy which be unmerited she say gravely he turn and look at she sit in a graceful attitude the incarnation of a most refined and nineteenth-century misfortune she raise she eye to he for a moment -- a sort of photographic instantaneous shutter expose for the hundredth part of a second the sensitive plate of she heart then she suppress a sigh -- badly i be marry horribly young she say before i know what i be do but even if i have know i do not suppose i should have have the strength of mind to resist my father and mother they force you into it yes say mr bamborough and it be possible that a respectable and harmless pair of corpse turn in they respective coffin somewhere in the neighborhood of norwood i hope there be a special hell reserve for parent who ruin they daughter ' life to suit they own ambition say paul with a sudden concentrated heat which rather startle he hearer this man be full of surprise for etta sydney bamborough it be like play with fire -- a form of amusement which will be popular as long as feminine curiosity shall last you be rather shocking she say lightly but it be all over now so we need not dig up old grievance only i want you to understand that that photograph represent a part of my life which be only painful -- nothing else paul standing in front of she look down thoughtfully at the beautiful upturned face he hand be clasp behind he he firm mouth set sternly beneath the great fair mustache in russium the man have good eye -- blue fierce intelligent such eye have the son of the princess alexi there be something in etta bamborough that stir up within he a quality which man be slowly lose -- namely chivalry steinmetz hold that this man be quixotic and what steinmetz say be usually worth some small attention whatever fault that poor knight of la mancha who have be the laughing-stock of the world these many century -- whatever fault or foolishness may have be he he be at all event a gentleman paul 's instinct be to pity this woman for the past that have be hers he desire be to help she and protect she to watch over she and fight she battle for she it be what be call love but there be no word in any speak language that cover so wide a field every day and all day we call many thing love which be not love the real thing be as rare as genius but we usually fail to recognize its rarity we misuse the word for we fail to draw the necessary distinction we fail to recognize the plain and simple truth that many of we be not able to love -- just as there be many who be not able to play the piano or to sing we raise up we voice and make a sound but it be not singing we marry and we give in marriage but it be not loving love be like a color -- say blue there be a thousand shades of blue and the outer shades be at last not blue at all but green or purple so in love there be a thousand shades and very very few of they be worthy of the name that which paul howard alexis feel at this time for etta be merely the chivalrous instinct that teach man they primary duty toward woman -- namely to protect and respect they but out of this instinct grow the better thing -- love there be some woman whose desire it be to be all thing to all man instead of every thing to one this be the stumbling-block in the way of etta bamborough it be she instinct to please all at any price and she obedience to such instinct be often unconscious she hardly know perhaps that she be trade upon a sense of chivalry rare in these day but have she known she could not have trade with a keener comprehension of the commerce i should like to forget the past altogether she say but it be hard for woman to get rid of the past it be rather terrible to feel that one will be associate all one 's life with a person for whom no one have any respect he be not honorable or -- she pause for the intuition of some woman be marvellous a slight change of countenance have tell she that charity especially toward the dead be a commendable quality the world she go on rather hurriedly never make allowance -- do it he be easily lead i suppose and people say thing of he that be not true do you ever hear of he in russium -- of the thing they say of he she wait for the answer with suppress eagerness -- a good woman defend the memory of she dead husband -- a fair lioness protect she cub no i never hear russian gossip i know no one in st petersburg and few in moscow she give a little sigh of relief then perhaps poor sydney 's delinquency have be forget she say in six month every thing be forget now he have only be dead six month you know he die in russium all the while she be watch he face she have move in a circle where everything be know -- where man have face of iron and nerve of steel to conceal what they know she could hardly believe that paul alexi know so little as he pretend so i hear a month ago he say in a flash of thought etta remember that it be only within the last four week that this admirer have betray he admiration could this be that phenomenon of the three-volume novel a honorable man she look at he with curiosity -- without it be to be fear much respect and now she say cheerfully let we change the subject i have inflict enough of myself and my affair upon you for one day tell I about yourself why be you in russium last summer i be half a russian he answer my mother be russian and i have estate there she surprise be a triumph of art oh you be not prince pavlo alexis she exclaim yes i be she rise and sweep he a deep courtesy to the full advantage of she beautiful figure my respects -- mon prince she say and then quick as lightning for she have see displeasure on he face she break into a merry laugh no i will not call you that for i know you hate it i have hear of you prejudice and if it be of the slightest interest to you i think i rather admire they it be to be presume that mr sydney bamborough 's memory be short for it be a matter of common knowledge in the diplomatic circle in which she move that mr paul howard alexi of piccadilly house london and prince pavlo alexi of the province of tver be one and the same man have however fully establish this fact from the evidence of she own ear she converse very pleasantly and innocently upon matter russian and english until other visitor arrive and paul withdraw chapter v the baron among the visitor whom paul leave behind he in the little drawing-room in brook street be the baron claude de chauxville baron of chauxville and chauxville le duc in the province of seine-et-marne france attaché to the french embassy to the court of st jame before man a rise diplomatist before god a scoundrel this gentleman remain when the other visitor have leave and miss maggie delafield see he intention of prolong a visit of which she have already have sufficient make a inadequate excuse and leave the room miss delafield be a healthy-minded young english person of that simplicity which be no simplicity at all but merely simple-heartedness have she own idea of what a man should be and m de chauxville have the misfortune to fall short of those idea he be too epigrammatic for she and beneath the brilliancy of he epigram she feel at time the presence of something dark and nauseous she mental attitude toward he be contemptuous and perfectly polite with the reputation of possess a dangerous fascination -- one of those reputation which can only emanate from the man himself -- m de chauxville neither fascinate nor intimidate miss delafield he therefore dislike she intensely he vanity be colossal and when a frenchman be vain he be childishly so m de chauxville watch the door close behind miss delafield with a queer smile then he turn suddenly on he heel and face mr sydney bamborough you cousin he say be a typical englishwoman -- she only conceal she love for you enquire mr sydney bamborough the baron shrug he shoulder possibly one can never tell she conceal it very well if it exist however i be indifferent the virtue of the violet be its own reward perhaps for the rose always win he cross the room toward mr sydney bamborough who be stand near the mantelpiece she left hand be hang idly by she side he take the white finger and gallantly raise they to he lip but before they have reach that fount of truth and wisdom she jerk she hand away m de chauxville laugh -- the quiet assure laugh of a man who have read in book that he who be bold enough can win any woman and believe it he be of those man who treat and speak of woman as a class -- creature to be deal with successfully accord to generality and maxim it be a singular thing by the way that man as a whole continue to disbelieve in a woman 's negative -- singular that be when one reflect that the majority of man have have at least one negative which have remain a negative so far as they be concern all the woman 's life i be aware say m de chauxville that the rose have thorn one reason why the violet be hors de concors etta smile -- almost relent she be never quite safe against she own vanity happy the woman who be and rare i suspect that the violet be innocent of any desire to enter into competition say etta know suggest de chauxville that although the race be not always to the swift it be usually so please do not stand it suggest that you be wait for I to go or for some one else to come neither then prove it by take this chair thus near the fire for it be quite a english spring a footstool be it permit to admire you slipper -- what there be of they now you look comfortable he attend to she want divine they and perhaps create they with a perfect grace and much too intimate a knowledge as a carpet knight he be faultless and etta thought of paul who could do none of these thing -- or would do none of they -- paul who never make she feel like a doll will you not sit down she say indicate a chair which he do not take he select one nearer to she i can think of nothing more desirable than what she ask she vanity be like a hungry fish it rise to everything a chair in this room a modest desire she say be that really all you want in this world no he answer look at she she give a little laugh and move rather hurriedly i be go to suggest that you could have both at certain fixed period -- whenever -- i be out i be glad you do not suggest it why she ask sharply because i should have have to go into explanation i do not say all mr bamborough be look into the fire only half listen to he there be something in the nature of a duel between these two each think more of the next stroke than of the present party do you ever say all m de chauxville she ask the baron laugh perhaps he be vain of the reputation that be he for this man be hold to be a finish diplomatist a finish diplomatist be it know be one who be a dangerous foe and a unreliable friend perhaps -- now that i reflect upon it continue the clever woman dislike the clever man 's silence the person who say all would be intolerable there be some thing which go without it say de chauxville ah look lazily back at he over she shoulder yes he be cautious for he be fight on a field which woman may rightly claim for they own he really love etta he be try to gauge the meaning of a little change in she tone toward he -- a change so subtle that few man could have detect it but claude de chauxville -- accomplished steersman through the shoal of human nature especially through those very pronounced shoal who call themselves woman of the world -- claude de chauxville know the value of the slightest change of manner should that change manifest itself more than once the ring of indifference or something dangerously near it in etta 's voice have first be noticeable the previous evening and the attaché know it it have be in she voice whenever she speak to he then it be there now some thing he continue in a voice she have never hear before for this man be innately artificial which a woman usually know before they be tell to she what sort of thing m le baron he give a little laugh it be so strange a thing to he to be sincere that he feel awkward and abashed he be surprise at he own sincerity that i love you -- hum you have know it long the face which he could not see be not quite the face of a good woman etta be smile no -- o she almost whisper i think you must have know it he correct suavely will you do I the honor of become my wife it be very correctly do claude de chauxville have regain control over himself he be able to think about the riches which be evidently hers but through the thought he love the woman the lady lower the feather screen which she be hold between she face and the fire regardless of the imminent danger in which she be place she complexion she study the glowing cinder for some moment weigh something or some person in she mind no my friend she answer in french at length the baron 's face be draw and white beneath he trim black mustache there be a momentary gleam of sharp white tooth as he bite he lip he come nearer to she lean one hand on the back of she chair look down he could only see the beautifully dress hair the clean-cut profile she continue to look into the fire conscious of the hand close to she shoulder no my friend she repeat we know each other too well for that it would never do but when i tell you that i love you he say quietly with he voice well in control i do not know that the word be in you vocabulary -- you a diplomat and a man -- you put the word there -- etta the hand-screen be raise for a moment in objection -- presumably to the christian name of which he have make use he wait passivity be one of he strong point it have frighten man before this then with a graceful movement she swing suddenly round in she chair look up at he she break into a merry laugh i believe you be actually in earnest she cry he look quietly down into she face without move a muscle in response to she change of humor very clever he say what she ask still smile the attitude the voice every thing you have know all along that i be in earnest you have know it for the last six month you have see I often enough when i be -- well not in earnest to know the difference etta rise quickly it be some lightning-like woman 's instinct that make she do so standing she be taller than m de chauxville do not let we be tragic she say coldly you have ask I to marry you why i do not know the reason will probably transpire later i appreciate the honor but i beg to decline it et voilà tout all be say he spread out apologetic hand all be not say he correct with a dangerous suavity i acknowledge the claim enjoy by you sex to the last word in this matter however i be incline to deny it to the individual etta sydney bamborough smile she lean against the mantelpiece with she chin rest on she curved finger the attitude be eminently calculate to show to full advantage a faultless figure she evidently have no desire to cheapen that which she would deny she shrug she shoulder and wait de chauxville be vain but he be clever enough to conceal he vanity he be hurt but he be man enough to hide it under the passivity which be he by nature and practice he have learn to think very quickly but now he be at a disadvantage he be unnerved by he love for etta -- by the sight of etta before he daringly audaciously beautiful -- by the thought that she might never be he it be not only that i love you he say that i have a certain position to offer you these i beg you to take at they poor value but there be other circumstance know to both of we which be more worthy of you attention -- circumstance which may dispose you to reconsider you determination nothing will do that she reply not any circumstance etta be speak to de chauxville and thinking of paul alexi i should like to know since when you have discover that you never could under any circumstance marry I pursued m de chauxville not that it matter since it be too late i be not go to allow you to draw back now you have go too far all this winter you have allow I to pay you conspicuous and marked attention you have convey to I and to the world at large the impression that i have merely to speak in order to obtain you hand i doubt say etta whether the world at large be so deeply interested in the matter as you appear to imagine i be sorry that i have go too far but i reserve to myself the right of retrace my footstep wherever and whenever i please i be sorry i conveyed to you or to any one else the impression that you have only to speak in order to obtain my hand and i can only conclude that you overweening vanity have lead you into a mistake which i will be generous enough to hold my tongue about the diplomatist be for a moment take aback mais -- he exclaim with indignant arm outspread and even in he own language he could find nothing to add to the expressive monosyllable i think you have better go say etta quietly she go toward the fire-place and ring the bell m de chauxville take up he hat and glove of course he say coldly he voice shake with suppress rage there be some reason for this there be i presume some one else -- some one have be interfere no one interfere with I with impunity i shall make it my business to find out who be this -- he do not finish : for the door be throw open by the butler who announce : mr alexi paul come into the room with a bow toward de chauxville who be go out and whom he know slightly i come back he say to ask what evening next week you be free i have a box for the ` huguenot ' paul do not stay the thing be arrange in a few moment and as he leave the drawing-room he hear the wheel of de chauxville 's carriage etta stand for a moment when the door have close behind the two man look at the portière which have hide they from sight as if follow they in think then she give a little laugh -- a queer laugh that might have have no heart in it or too much for the ordinary purpose of life she shrug she shoulder and take up a magazine with which she return to the chair place for she before the fire by claude de chauxville in a few minute maggie come into the room she be carry a bundle of flannel the weakest thing i ever do she say cheerfully be to join lady crewel 's work guild two flannel petticoat for the young by Thursday morning i choose the young because the petticoat be so ludicrously small if you never do anything weaker than that say etta look into the fire you will not come to much harm perhaps not what have you be do -- something weaker yes i have be quarrel with m de chauxville maggie hold up a petticoat by the selvage -lrb- which a male writer take to be the lower hem -rrb- and look at she cousin through the orifice intend for the waist of the young if one could manage it without lower one 's dignity she say i think that that be the best thing one could possibly do with m de chauxville etta have take up the magazine again she be pretend to read it yes but he know too much -- about every-body she say chapter vi the talleyrand club it have be say of the talleyrand club that the only qualification require for admittance to its membership be a frock-coat and a glib tongue to explain the whereabouts of the talleyrand club be only a work of supererogation many hansom cabman know it hansom cabman know more than they be credit with the talleyrand as its name imply be a diplomatic club but ambassador and minister enter not its portal they send they junior some of these latter be in the habit of state that london be the hub of europe and the talleyrand smoking-room its grease-box certain be it that such man as claude de chauxville as karl steinmetz and a hundred other who be or have be political scene-shifter be to be find in the talleyrand room it be a quiet club with many member and sparse accommodation its room be never crowd because half of its member be afraid of meet the other half it have swing glass door to its every apartment the lower portion of the glass be opaque while the upper moiety afford a peep-hole thus if you be sit in one of the deep comfortable chair to be find in all these small room you will be aware from time to time of eye and a bald head above the ground glass if you be nobody eye and bald head will prove to be the property of a gentleman who do not know you or know you and pretend that he do not if you be somebody you solitude will depend upon you reputation there be quite a number of bald head in the talleyrand club -- bald head surmount youthful innocent face the innocence of these gentleman be quite remarkable like a certain celestial they be childlike and bland they ask guileless question they make blameless mistake in respect to fact and require correction which they receive meekly they know absolutely nothing and they thirst for information be as insatiable as it be unobtrusive the atmosphere be vivacious with the light sound of many foreign tongue it bristle with the ephemeral importance of cheap title one never know whether one 's neighbor be a ornament to the almanac de gotha or a disgrace to a degenerate colony of refugee some be plain monsieur señores or herren bluff foreigner with upright hair and melancholy eye who put up philosophically with a cheaper brand of cigar than they soul love among the latter

as you go in -- of the talleyrand he be there one evening after a excellent dinner take with humorous resignation smoking the largest cigar the waiter could supply when claude de chauxville happen to have nothing better or nothing worse to do de chauxville look through the glass door for some seconds then he twist he wax mustache and lounge in steinmetz be alone in the room and de chauxville be evidently -- almost obviously -- unaware of he presence he go to the table and proceed to search in vain for a newspaper that interest he he raise he eye casually and meet the quiet gaze of karl steinmetz ah he exclaim yes say steinmetz you -- in london steinmetz nod gravely yes he repeat one never know where one have you claude de chauxville go on seat himself in a deep arm-chair newspaper in hand you be a bird of passage a little heavy on the wing -- now say steinmetz he lay he newspaper down on he stout knee and look at de chauxville over he gold eye-glass he do not attempt to conceal the fact that he be wonder what this man want with he the baron seem to be wonder what object steinmetz have in view in get stout he suspect some motive in the obesity ah he say deprecatingly that be nothing time leave its mark upon all of we it be not yesterday that we be in petersburg together no answer steinmetz it be before the german empire -- many year ago de chauxville count back with he slim finger on the table -- delightfully innocent yes he say the year seem to fly in covey do you ever see any of we friend of that time -- you who be in russium who be we friend of that time parry steinmetz polish he glass with a silk handkerchief my memory be a broken reed -- you remember for a moment claude de chauxville meet the full quiet gray eye yes he say significantly i remember well -- for instance prince dawoff dead i never see he -- thank heaven the princess i never see she keep a gambling house in pari and little andrea never see I marry to a wholesale undertaker who have bury

she and she mother the countess de chauxville nod none of the detail really interested he he indifference be obvious ah the countess lanovitch he say reflectively she be a foolish woman and be m de chauxville laugh this clumsy german ex-diplomat amuse he immensely many people amuse we who be themselves amuse in they sleeve and -- er -- the sydney bamborough say the frenchman as if the name have almost leave he memory karl steinmetz lazily stretch out he arm and take up the _ morning post _ he unfold the sheet slowly and have find what he seek he read aloud : ` he excellency the roumanian ambassador give a select dinner-party at 4 craven garden yesterday among the guest be the baron de chauxville feneer pasha lord and lady standover mr sydney bamborough and other ' steinmetz throw the paper down and lean back in he chair so my dear friend he say it be probable that you know more about the sydney bamborough than i do if claude de chauxville be disconcert he certainly do not show it he be a face eminently calculate to conceal whatever think or feeling might be pass through he mind of a even white complexion -- verge on pastiness -- he be handsome in a certain statuesque way he feature be always compose and dignified he hair thin and straight be never out of order but ever smooth and sleek upon he high narrow brow he eye have that dulness which be characteristic of many frenchman and may perhaps be attribute to the habitual enjoyment of too rich a cuisine and too many cigarette de chauxville wave aside the small contretemps with easy nonchalance not necessarily he say in cold even tone mr sydney bamborough do not habitually take into she confidence all who happen to dine at the same table as herself you confidential woman be usually a liar steinmetz be fill he pipe this man have the evil habit of smoking a wooden pipe after a cigar my very dear de chauxville he say without lookup you epigram be lose on I i know most of they i have hear they before if you have anything to tell I about mr sydney bamborough for heaven 's sake tell it to I quite plainly i like plain dish and unvarnished story i be a german you know that be to say a person with a dull palate and a thick head de chauxville laugh again in a unemotional way you alter little he say you plainness of speech take I back to petersburg yes i admit that mr sydney bamborough rather interested I but i assume too much that be no reason why she should interest you she do not my good friend but you do i be all attention do you know anything of she asked de chauxville perfunctorily not as a man who expect a answer or intend to believe that which he may be about to hear nothing you be likely to know more karl steinmetz shrug he heavy shoulder and shake he head doubtfully i be not a lady 's man he add gruffly the good god have not shape I that way i be too d -- d fat have mr sydney bamborough fall in love with I have some imprudent person show she my photograph i hope not heaven forbid he puff steadily at he pipe and glance quickly at de chauxville through the smoke no answer the frenchman quite gravely frenchmen by the way do not admit that one may be too middle-aged or too stout for love but she be au mieux with the prince which prince pavlo the frenchman snap out the word watch the other 's benevolent countenance steinmetz continue to smoke placidly and contentedly my master he say at length i suppose that some day he will marry de chauxville shrug he shoulder he touch the button of the electric bell and when the servant appear order coffee he select a cigarette from a silver case with considerable care and have light it smoke for some moment in silence the servant bring the coffee which he drink thoughtfully steinmetz be lean back in he deep chair with he leg cross he be gaze into the fire which burnt brightly although it be nearly may the habit of the talleyrand club be almost continental the room be always too warm the silence be that of two man know each other well and why not mr sydney bamborough ask steinmetz suddenly why not indeed reply de chauxville it be no affair of mine a wise man reduce he affair to a minimum and he interest in the affair of he neighbor to less but i think it would interest you thanks the tone of the big man in the arm-chair be not dry karl steinmetz know better than to indulge in that pastime dryness be apt to parch the fount of expansiveness de chauxville 's attention be apparently catch by a illustration in a weekly paper lie open on the table near to he you shifty man like something to look at he do not speak for some moment then he throw the paper aside who be sydney bamborough at any rate he ask with a careless assumption of a slanginess which be affect by society in its decadent period so far as i remember answer steinmetz he be something in the diplomatic service yes but what my dear friend you have better ask he widow when next you sit beside she at dinner how do you know that i sit beside she at dinner i do not know it reply steinmetz with a quiet smile which leave de chauxville in doubt as to whether he be very stupid or exceedingly clever she seem to be very well off say the frenchman i be glad as she be go to marry my master de chauxville laugh almost awkwardly and for a fraction of a second he change countenance under steinmetz 's quiet eye one can never know whom a woman intend to marry say he carelessly even if they can themselves which i doubt but i do not understand how it be that she be so much better off or appear to be since the death of she husband ah she be much better off or appear to be since the death of she husband say the stout man in he slow germanic way yes de chauxville rise stretch himself and yawn man be not always be it understand on they best behavior at they club good-night he say shortly good-night my very dear friend after the frenchman have leave karl steinmetz remain quite motionless and expressionless in he chair until such time as he conclude that de chauxville be tire of watch he through the glass door then he slowly sit forward in he chair and look back over he shoulder we friend he mutter be afraid that paul be go to marry this woman now i wonder why these two have meet before in a past which have little or nothing to do with the present narrative they have dislike each other with a completeness partly breed of racial hatred partly the outcome of diverse interest but of late year they have drift apart there be no reason why the friendship such as it be should not have lapse into a mere bowing acquaintance for these man be foreigner understand fully the value of the bow as a interchange of masculine courtesy englishman bow badly steinmetz know that the frenchman have recognize he before enter the room it be to be presume that he have deliberately choose to cross the threshold know that a recognition be inevitable karl steinmetz go farther he suspect that de chauxville have come to the talleyrand club have hear that he be in england with the purpose in view of seek he out and warn he against mr sydney bamborough it would appear murmur the stout philosopher that we be about to work together for the first time but if there be one thing that i dislike more than the enmity of claude de chauxville it be he friendship chapter vii old hand karl steinmetz lift he pen from the paper before he and scratch he forehead with he forefinger now i wonder he say aloud how many bushel there be in a ton ach how be i to find out these english weight and measure this english money when there be a metrical system he sit and hardly look up when the clock strike seven it be a quiet room this in which he sit the library of paul 's london house the noise of piccadilly reach he ear as a faint roar not entirely unpleasant but sociable and full of life accustom as he be to the great silence of russium where sound seem lose in space the hum of a crowded humanity be a pleasant change to this philosopher who love he kind while fully recognize its little weakness while he sit there still wonder how many bushel of seed make a ton paul alexi come into the room the younger man be in evening dress he look at the clock rather eagerly will you dine here he ask and steinmetz wheel around in he chair i be go out to dinner he explain further ah say the elder man i be go to mr sydney bamborough 's steinmetz bow he head gravely he say nothing he be not look at paul but at the pattern of the carpet there be a short silence then paul say with entire simplicity : i shall probably ask she to marry I and she will probably say yes i be not so sure about that say paul with a laugh for this man be without conceit he have gradually be force to admit that there be among man person whose natural inclination be toward evil person who value not the truth nor hold by honesty but he be guileless enough to believe that woman be not so he actually believe that woman be truthful and open and honorable he believe it still which be somewhat startling there be a few such dullard yet i do not see why she should he go on gravely he be stand by the empty fire-place a manly upright figure one who be not very clever not brilliant at all somewhat slow in he speech but sure deadly sure in the honesty of he purpose karl steinmetz look at he and smile openly with the quaint air of resignation that be he you have never see she eh enquire paul steinmetz pause then he tell a lie a good one well tell deliberately no we be go to the opera box f2 if you come in i shall have pleasure in introduce you the sooner you know each other the better i be sure you will approve i think you ought to marry money why steinmetz laugh oh he answer because every-body do who can there be catrina lanovitch a estate as big as yours adjoining yours a great russian family a good girl who -- be willing paul laugh a good wholesome laugh you be incline to exaggerate my manifold and obvious qualification he say catrina be a very nice girl but i do not think she would marry I even if i ask she which you do not intend to do certainly not then you will make a enemy of she say steinmetz quietly it may be inconvenient but that can not be help a woman scorn -- you know shakspere or the bible i always mix they up no paul catrina lanovitch be a dangerous enemy she have be make love to you these last four year and you would have see it if you have not be a fool i be afraid my good paul you be a fool god bless you for it i think you be wrong say paul rather curtly not about I be a fool but about catrina lanovitch if you be right however it only make I dislike she instead of be perfectly indifferent to she he honest face flush up finely and he turn away to look at the clock again i hate you way of talk about woman steinmetz he say you be a cynical old beast you know heaven forbid my dear prince i admire all woman -- they be so clever so innocent so pure-minded do not you english novel prove it you english stage you newspaper so high-toned who support the novelist the play-wright the actor who but you english lady better than be cook -- like you german lady retort paul stoutly if you _ be _ german this evening better than be cook i doubt it i very much doubt it my friend at what time shall i present myself at box f2 this evening about nine -- as soon as you like paul look at the clock the pointer lag horribly he know that the carriage be certain to be at the door wait in the quiet street with its great restless horse its two perfectly train man its gleaming lamp and shine harness but he would not allow himself the luxury of be the first arrival paul have himself well in hand at last it be time to go see you later he say thank you -- yes reply steinmetz without look up so paul howard alexi sally forth to seek the hand of the lady of he choice and as he leave he own door that lady be receive claude de chauxville in she drawing-room the two have not meet for some week -- not indeed since etta have tell the frenchman that she could not marry he she invitation to dine couch in the usual friendly word have be the first move in that game commonly call bluff claude de chauxville 's acceptance of the same have be the second move and these two person who be not afraid of each other shake hand with a pleasant smile of greet while paul hurry toward they through the busy street be i forgive -- that i be invite to dinner ask de chauxville imperturbably when the servant have leave they alone etta be one of those woman who be conscious of they dress some may protest that a lady move in such circle would not be so but in all circle woman be only woman and in every class of life we meet such as etta bamborough woman who while they talk glance down and rearrange a flower or a piece of lace it be a mere habit seemingly small and unimportant but it mark the woman and set she apart etta be stand on the hearthrug beautifully dress -- too beautifully dress it be possible to sit down she maid have a moment earlier confess that she could do no more and etta have come down stair a vision of luxury of womanly loveliness nevertheless there appear to be something amiss she be so occupy with a flower at she shoulder that she do not answer at once forgive for what she ask at length in that preoccupy tone of voice which tell wise man that only question of dress will be consider de chauxville shrug he shoulder in he graceful gallic way mon dieu he exclaim for a crime which require no excuse and no explanation other than a mirror she look up at he innocently a mirror yours have you forgive I for fall in love with you it be i be tell a crime that woman sometimes condone it be no crime she say she have hear the wheel of paul 's carriage it be a misfortune please let we forget that it ever happen de chauxville twirl he neat mustache look keenly at she the while you forget he say but i -- will remember she do not answer but turn with a smile to greet paul i think you know each other she say gracefully when she have shake hand and the two man bow they be foreigner be it understand there be three language in which they could understand each other with equal ease where _ be _ maggie exclaim mr bamborough she be always late when i be here reflect de chauxville but he do not say it miss delafield keep they wait a few minute and during that time etta sydney bamborough give a very fine display of prowess with the double-stringed bow when a man attempt to handle this delicate weapon he usually make if one may put it thus crudely a ass of himself he generally succeed in snap one and probably both of the string injure himself most certainly in the process not so however this clever lady she have a smile and a epigram for claude de chauxville a grave air of sympathetic interest in more serious affair for paul alexis she be bright and amusing guileless and very worldly wise in the same breath -- simple for paul and a match for de chauxville within the space of three seconds withal she be a beautiful woman beautifully dress a thousand time too wise to scorn she womanhood as learn fool be prone to do in print and on platform in these wordy day but wield the strongest power on earth to wit that same womanhood with daring and with skill a learn woman be not of much account in the world a clever woman move as much of it as lie in she neighborhood -- that be to say as much as she care to rule for woman love power but they do not care to wield it at a distance paul be ask to take mr sydney bamborough down to dinner by the lady herself mon ami she say in a quiet aside to de chauxville before make she request it be the first time the prince dine here she speak in french maggie and paul be talk together at the other end of the room de chauxville bow in silence at dinner the conversation be necessarily general and as such be not worth report no general conversation one find be of much value when set down in black and white it be not even grammatical nowadays to be more correct let we note that the talk lay between etta and m de chauxville who have a famous supply of epigram and bright nothing deliver in such a way that they really sound like wisdom etta be equal to he sometimes cap he sharp wit sometimes content herself with silvery laughter maggie delafield be rather distraite as de chauxville note the girl 's dislike for he be a iron that enter the quick of he vanity anew every time he see she there be no petulance in the aversion such as he have perceive with other maiden who be only resent a pass negligence or seek to pique he curiosity this be a steady and if you will unmaidenly aversion which maggie conscientiously attempt to conceal paul it be to be fear be what hostess call heavy in hand he laugh where he see something to laugh at but not elsewhere which in some circle be consider morose and in bad form he join readily enough in the conversation but originate nothing those topic which occupy he mind do not present themselves as suitable to this occasion he devotion to etta be quite obvious and he be simple enough not to care that it should be so maggie be by turn quite silent and very talkative when paul and etta be speak together she never look at they but fixedly at she own plate at a decanter or a salt-cellar when she speak she address she remark -- valueless enough in themselves -- exclusively to the man she dislike claude de chauxville there be something amiss in the pretty little room there be shadow seat around that pretty little table à quatre beside the guest in they pretty dress and they black coat silent cold shadow who eat nothing while they chill the dainty food and take the sweetness from the succulent dish these shadow have creep in unaware a silent partie carrée to take they phantom place at the table and only etta seem able to jostle hers aside and talk it down she take the whole burden of the conversation upon she pretty shoulder and bear it through the little banquet with unerring skill and unflinching good humor in the midst of she merriest laughter the clever gray eye would flit from one man 's face to the other paul have be bring here to ask she to marry he claude de chauxville have be invite that he might be tacitly present to he successful rival maggie be there because she be a woman and make the necessary fourth puppet all and two of they know it and some of we know it all we life we be live move puppet we let ourselves be drag here and push there the victim of one who happen to have more energy of mind a greater steadfastness of purpose a keener grasp of the situation call life we smirk and smile and lose the game because we have begin by be anvil and be afraid of try to be hammer but etta sydney bamborough have to deal with metal of a harder grain than the majority of we claude de chauxville be for the moment force to assume the humble rôle of anvil because he have no choice maggie delafield be passive for the time be because that which would make she active be no more than a tiny seedling in she heart the girl bid fair to be one of those woman who develop late who ripen slowly like the best fruit during the drive to the opera house the two woman in etta 's snug little brougham be silent etta have she thought to occupy she she be at the crucial point of a difficult game she could not afford to allow even a friend to see so much as the corner of the card she hold in the luxurious box it be easily enough arrange -- etta and paul together in front de chauxville and maggie at the other corner of the box i have ask my friend karl steinmetz to come in during the evening say paul to etta when they be seat he be anxious to make you acquaintance he be my -- prime minister over in russium etta smile graciously it be kind of he she answer to be anxious to make my acquaintance she be apparently listen to the music in reality she be hurry back mentally over half a dozen year she have never have much to do with the stout german philosopher but she know enough of he to scorn the faint hope that he might have forget she name and she individuality etta bamborough have never be disconcert in she life yet this incident come very near to bring about the catastrophe at what time she ask be he come in about half-past nine etta have a watch on a bracelet on she arm such woman always know the time it be a race and etta win it she have only half a hour de chauxville be there and maggie with she quiet honest eye but the widow of sydney bamborough make paul ask she to be he wife and she promise to give he he answer later she do it despite a thousand difficulty and more than one danger -- accomplish it with as the sport people say plenty to spare -- before the door behind they be open by the attendant and karl steinmetz burly humorously imperturbable and impenetrable stand smile gravely on the situation he see claude de chauxville and before the frenchman have turn round the expression on steinmetz 's large and placid countenance have change from the self-consciousness usually precede a introduction to one of a dim recognition i have have the pleasure of meeting madame somewhere before i think in st petersburg be it not etta compose and smile say that it be so and introduce he to maggie de chauxville take the opportunity of leave that young lady 's side and place himself near enough to paul and etta to completely frustrate any further attempt at confidential conversation for a moment steinmetz and paul be leave stand together i have have a telegram say steinmetz in russian we must go back to tver there be cholera again when can you come beneath he heavy mustache paul bit he lip in three day he answer true you will come with I enquire steinmetz under cover of the clash music of course steinmetz look at he curiously he glance toward etta but he say nothing chapter viii safe the season wear on to its perihelion -- a period the scientific book advise we of the highest clang and crash of speed and whirl of the greatest brilliancy and deepest glow of a planet 's existence the business of life the pursuit of pleasure and the scientific demolition of we common enemy time receive all the care which such matter require débutantes bloom and be duly cull by aged connoisseur of such wares or by youthful aspirant with the means to pay the piper in the form of a handsome settlement the usual number of young person of the gentler sex enter the list of life with the mistaken notion that it be love that make the world go round to ride away from the joust wiser and sadder woman there be the same round of conventional pleasure which the reader and he humble servant have mix in deeply or dilettante accord to he taste or capacity for such giddy work there be withal the usual heart-burning heart-bartering heart -- anything you will but break for we have not break heart among we to-day providence it would seem have run short of the commodity and deal out only a few among a number of person amid the whirl of rout and ball and picnic race-meeting polo-match and what-not paul howard alexi stalk misunderstand distrust a object of ridicule to some of pity to other of impatience to all a man if it please you with a purpose -- a purpose at the latter end of the nineteenth century when most of we have decide that there be no future take it upon ourselves to despise the present paul soon discover that he be find out -- at no time a pleasant condition of thing except indeed when caller be about that which eton and cambridge have fail to lay they finger upon every match-making mother have find out for herself in a week that the discovery have be carefully keep in each maternal breast it be needless to relate ce dame be not confidential upon such matter between themselves when they have scented they game they stalk he and if possible bag he in a feline solitude which have no fear for stout ambitious heart the fear be that some other prowl mother of a eligible maiden may hit upon the same scent paul be invite to quiet dinner and a little music to quiet dinner without the music to a very little music and no dinner whatever the number of lady who have a seat in a box throw upon they hand at the last minute -- a seat next to angelina in she new pink or blanche in she sweet poult de soie -- the number of these lady one can only say be singular because politeness forbid one to suggest that it be suspicious soft cheek become rosy at he approach -- partly perhaps because soft and dainty toe in satin slipper be trodden upon with maternal emphasis at that moment soft eye look love into eye that alas only return preoccupation there be always room on a engagement card for paul 's name there be always space in the smallest drawing-room for paul 's person vast though the latter be there be -- fond mother convey it to he subtly after supper and champagne -- a ache void in more than one maiden heart which be he exact fit but paul be at once too simple and too clever for matron and maid alike too simple because he fail to understand the inner meaning of many pleasant thing that the guileless fair one say to he too clever because he meet the subtle matron with the only arm she fear a perfect honesty and when at last he obtain he answer from the coy and hesitating etta there be no gossip in london who could put forward a just cause or impediment etta give he the answer one evening at the house of a mutual friend where a multitude of guest have assemble ostensibly to hear certain celebrated singer apparently to whisper recrimination on they entertainer 's champagne it be a dull business -- except indeed for paul howard alexi as for the lady -- the only lady he honest simple world contain -- who shall say inwardly she may have be in tremble coy alarm in breathless blush hesitation outwardly she be however exceedingly compose and self-possessed she have be as careful as ever of she toilet -- as hard to please as -- dare we say snappish with she maid the beautiful hair have no one of its aureate thread out of place the pink of she shell-like cheek be steady unruffled fair to behold she whole demeanor be admirable in its well-bred repose do she love he be it in she power to love any man not the humble chronicler -- not any man perhaps and but few woman -- can essay a answer suffice it that she accept he in exchange for the title he could give she the position he could assure to she the wealth he be ready to lavish upon she and lastly let we mention in the effete old-fashioned way the love he bear she -- in exchange for these she give he she hand thus etta sydney bamborough be enable to throw down she card at last and win the game she have play so skilfully the widow of a obscure little foreign office clerk she might have be a baroness but she put the smaller honor aside and aspire to a prince behind the gay smile there must have be a quick and resourceful brain daring to scheme intrepid in execution within the fair breast there must have be a heart resolute indomitable devoid of weak scruple mark the last it be the scruple that keep the reader and he humble servant from be greater man than they be yes say etta allow paul to take she perfectly gloved hand in he great steady grasp yes i have my answer ready they be alone in the plashy solitude of a inner conservatory between the song of the great singer she be half afraid of this strong man for he have strange way with he -- not uncouth but unusual and somewhat surprising in a finnick emotionless generation and what be it whisper paul eagerly ah what fool man be -- what fool they always will be etta give a little nod look shamefacedly down at the pattern of she lace fan be that it he ask breathlessly the nod be repeat and paul howard alexi be thereby make the happiest man in england she half expect he to take she in he arm despite the temporary nature of they solitude perhaps she half wish it for behind she business-like and exceedingly practical appreciation of he wealth there lurk a very feminine curiosity and interest in he feeling -- a curiosity somewhat whet by the manifold difference that exist between he and the society lover with whom she have hitherto play the pretty game but paul contented himself with raise the gloved finger to he lip restrain by a feeling of respect for she which she would not have understand and probably do not merit but she say with a sudden smile i take no responsibility i be not very sure that it will be a success i can only try to make you happy -- goodness know if i shall succeed you have only to be yourself to do that he answer with lover-like promptness and a blindness which be the special privilege of those happy fool she give a strange little smile but how do i know that we life will harmonize in the least i know nothing of you daily existence where you live -- where you want to live i should like to live mostly in russium he answer honestly she expression do not change it merely fix itself as one see the face of a watch cat fix itself when the long for mouse show a whisker ah she say lightly confident in she own power that will arrange itself later i be glad i be rich say paul simply because i shall be able to give you all you want there be many little thing that add to a woman 's comfort i shall find they out and see that you have they be you so very rich paul she ask with a innocent wonder but i do not think it matter do you i do not think that riches have much to do with happiness no he answer he be not a person with many theory upon life or happiness or such matter -- which by the way be in no way affect by theory by take thought we can not add a cubit to the height of we happiness we can only undermine its base by too search a analysis of that upon which it be build so paul reply no and take pleasure in look at she as any lover must need have do except of course she say that one may do good with great riches she give a little sigh as if deplore the misfortune that hitherto she own small means have fall short of the happy point at which one may begin do good be you so very rich paul she repeat as if she be rather afraid of those riches and mistrust they oh i suppose so horribly rich she have withdraw she hand she give it to he again with a pretty movement usually understand to indicate bashfulness it can not be help she say we -- she dwell upon the word ever so slightly -- we can perhaps do a little good with it then suddenly he blurt out all he wish on this point -- he quixotic aim the foolish imagining of a too chivalrous soul she listen prettily eager sweetly compassionate of the sorrow of the peasantry whom he make the object of he simple pity she gray eye contract with horror when he tell she of the misery with which he be too familiar she pretty lip quiver when he tell she of little child bear only to starve because they mother be starve she lay she gloved finger gently on he when he recount tale of strong man -- good father in they simple barbarous way -- who be well content that the child should die rather than be save to pass a miserable existence without joy without hope she lift she eye with admiration to he face when he tell she what he hope to do what he dream of accomplish she even make a few eager heartfelt suggestion fitly come from a woman -- touch with a woman 's tenderness lighten by a woman 's sympathy and knowledge it be in its way a tragedy the picture we be call to look upon -- these newly make lover not talk of themselves as be the time-honored habit of such surround by every luxury both high-born refined and wealthy both educate both intelligent he simple-minded earnest quite absorb in he happiness because that happiness seem to fall in so easily with the busier and as some might say the nobler side of he ambition she fail to understand he aspiration think only of he wealth but she say at length shall you -- we -- be allow to do all this i think that such scheme be not encourage in russium it be such a pity to pauperize the people you can not pauperize a man who have absolutely nothing reply paul of course we shall have difficulty but together i think we shall be able to overcome they etta smile sympathetically and the smile finish up as it be with a gleam very like amusement she have be vouchsafe for a moment a vision of herself in some squalid russian village in a hideous russian-made tweed dress dispense the necessaries of life to a people only little raise above the beast of the field the vision make she smile as well it might in petersburg life might be tolerable for a little in the height of the season -- for a few week of the brilliant northern winter -- but in no other part of russium could she dream of dwelling they sit and talk of they future as lover will know as little of it as any of we build up castle in the air such edifice as we have all construct destine no doubt to the same rapid collapse as some of we have quail under paul with lamentable honesty talk almost as much of he stupid peasant as of he beautiful companion which please she not too well etta with a strange persistence bring the conversation ever back and back to the house in london the house in petersburg the great grim castle in the government of tver and the princely rent-roll and once on the subject of tver paul could scarce be bring to leave it i be go back there he say at length when she ask with a composure which do infinite credit to she modest reserve she love be jealously guard it lay too deep to be disturb by the thought that she lover would leave she soon to-morrow be he answer she do not speak at once should she try the extent of she power over he never be lover so chivalrous so respectful so sincere should she gauge the height of she supremacy if it prove less powerful than she suspect she would at all event be credit with a very natural aversion to parting from he paul she say you can not do that not so soon i can not let you go he flush up to the eye suddenly like a girl there be a little pause and the color slowly leave he face somehow that pause frightened etta i be afraid i must go he say gravely at length must -- a prince it be on that account he reply then i be to conclude that you be more devoted to you peasant than to -- I he assure she to the contrary she try once again but nothing could move he from he decision etta be perhaps a small-minded person and as such fail to attach due importance to this proof that she power over he be limit it cease in fact to exist as soon as it touch that strong sense of duty which be to be find in many man and in remarkably few woman it almost seem as if the abrupt departure of she lover be in some sense a relief to etta sydney bamborough for while he lover-like be grave and earnest during the small remainder of the evening she continue to be sprightly and gay the last he see of she be she smile face at the window as she carriage drive away arrive at the little house in upper brook street maggie and etta go into the drawing-room where biscuit and wine be set out they maid come and take they cloak away leave they alone paul and i be engage say etta suddenly she be pick the withered flower from she dress and throw they carelessly on the table maggie be stand with she back to she with she two hand on the mantel-piece she be about to turn round when she catch sight of she own face in the mirror and that which she see there make she change she intention i be not surprised she say in a even voice standing like a statue i congratulate you i think he be -- nice you also think he be too good for I say etta with a little laugh there be something in that laugh -- a ring of wounded vanity the wound vanity of a bad woman who be in the presence of she superior no answer maggie slowly trace the vein of the marble across the mantel-piece no -- o not that etta look up at she it be rather singular that she do not ask what maggie do think perhaps she be afraid of a certain british honesty which characterize the girl 's thought and speech instead she rise and indulge in a yawn which may have be counterfeit but it be a good counterfeit will you have a biscuit she say no thanks then shall we go to bed yes chapter ix the prince the village of osterno lie or rather scramble along the bank of the river oster be at no time a exhilarating spot it be a large village numbering over nine hundred soul as the board affix to its first house testifieth in incomprehensible russian figure a soul be it know be a different object in the land of the czar to that vague protoplasm about which we young person think such mighty thought we old man write such famous big book a soul be namely a man -- in russium the woman have not yet begin to seek they rights and lose they privilege a man be therefore a soul in russium and as such enjoy the doubtful privilege of contribute to the land-tax and to every other tax in compensation for the first-named impost he be apportion he share of the common land of the village and by the cultivation of this eke out a existence which would be valueless if he be a teetotaller it be melancholy to have to record this fact in the page of a respectable volume like the present but fact -- as the orator who deal in fiction be ever ready to announce -- fact can not be ignore and any man who have live in russium have dabble in russian humanity and note the singular unattractiveness of russian life -- any such man can scarcely deny the fact that if one deprive the moujik of he privilege of get gloriously and frequently intoxicate one take away from that same moujik the one happiness of he existence that the russian peasant be by nature one of the cheeriest the noisiest and lightest-hearted of man be only another proof of the creator 's power for this dimly light soul have nothing to cheer he on he forlorn way but the memory of the last indulgence in strong drink and the hope of more to come he be harass by a ruthless tax-collector he be shut off from the world by enormous distance over impracticable road when the famine come and come it assuredly will the moujik have no alternative but to stay where he be and starve since alexander ii of philanthropic memory make the russian serf a free man the blessing of freedom have be find to resolve themselves chiefly into a perfect liberty to die of starvation of cold or of dire disease when he be a serf this man be of some small value to some one now he be of no consequence to any one whatsoever except himself and with considerable intelligence he set but small store upon he own existence freedom in fact come to he before he be ready for it and hamper as he have be by petty departmental tyranny governmental neglect and a natural stupidity he have make very small progress toward a mental independence all that he have learn to do be to hate he tyrant when famine urge he he go blindly helplessly dumbly and try to take by force that which be deny by force with we in england the poor man raise up he voice and cry aloud when he want something he always want something -- never work by the way -- and therefore he voice pervade the atmosphere he have he evening newspaper which be dear at the moderate sum of a halfpenny he have he professional organizer and he trafalgar square he even have he member of parliament he do no work and he do not starve in he generation the poor man think himself wise in russium however thing be manage differently the poor man be under the heel of the rich some day there will be in russium a terror but not yet some day the moujik will erect unto himself a rough sort of a guillotine but not in we day perhaps some of we who be young man now may dimly read in we dotage of a great upheaval beside which the terror of france will be tame and uneventful who can tell when a country begin to grow its mental development be often startlingly rapid but we have to do with russium of to-day and the village of osterno in the government of tver not a famine government mind you for these be the volga province -- samara pensa voronish vintka and a dozen other no tver the civilized the prosperous the manufacturing center osterno be build of wood should it once fairly catch alight in a high wind all that will be leave of this town will be a few char timber and some daze human being the inhabitant know they own danger and endeavor to meet it in they fatalistic manner each village have its fire organization each soul have he appoint place he appoint duty and he special contribution -- be it bucket or rope or ladder -- to bring to the conflagration but no one ever dream of be sober and vigilant at the right time so the organization like many larger such be a broken reed the street bound on either side by low wooden house be singularly enough well paved this the traveller be tell by the tyrant prince pavlo who make the road because he do not like drive over rut and through puddle -- the usual russian rural thoroughfare not because prince pavlo want to give the peasant work not because he want to save they from starvation -- not at all although in the gratification of he own whim he happen to render those trifling service but merely because he be a great bárin -- a prince who could have any thing he desire have not the other bárin -- steinmetz by name -- superintend the work steinmetz the hate the loathe the tool of the tyrant whom they never see ask the starost -- the mayor of the village he know the bárins and hate they michael roon the starosta or elder of osterno president of the mir or village council principal shopkeeper mayor and only intelligent soul of the nine hundred probably have tartar blood in he vein to this strain may be attribute the narrow tartar face the keen black eye the short spare figure which many remember to this day although michael roon have be dead these many year remove far above the majority of he fellow-villager in intelligence and energy this man administer the law of he own will to he colleague on the village council it be late in the autumn one evening remember by many for its death-roll that the starosta be stand at the door of he small shop he be apparently idle he never sell vodka and the majority of the villager be in one of the three thrive kabak which drive a famous trade in strong drink and weak tea it be a very hot evening the sun have set in a pink haze which be now turn to a unhealthy gray and spread over the face of the western sky like the shadow of death across the human countenance the starosta shake he head forebodingly it be cholera weather cholera have come to osterno have come the starosta think to stay it have settle down in osterno and nothing but the winter frost would kill it when hunger-typhus would undoubtedly succeed it therefore the starosta shake he head at the sunset and forget to regret the badness of the time from a commercial point of view he have do all he could he have notify to the zemstvo the condition of he village he have make the usual appeal for help which have be forward in the usual way to tver where it have apparently be receive with the usual philosophic silence but michael roon have also telegraph to karl steinmetz and since the despatch of this message have the starosta drop into the habit of standing at he doorway in the evening with he hand clasp behind he back and he beady black eye bent westward along the prince 's high-road on the particular evening with which we have to do the beady eye look not in vain for presently far along the road appear a black speck like a insect crawling over the face of a map ah say the starosta ah he never fail presently a neighbor drop in to buy some of the dry leaf which the starosta honest tradesman call tea he find the purveyor of cathay 's produce at the door ah he say in a voice thick with vodka you see something on the road yes a cart no a carriage it move too quickly a strange expression come over the peasant 's face at no time a please physiognomy the bloodshot eye flare up suddenly like a smoulder flame in brown paper the unsteady drink-sodden lip twitch the man throw up he shaggy head upon which hair and beard mingle in unkempt confusion he glare along the road with eye and face aglow with a sullen beast-like hatred a carriage then it be for the castle possibly answer the starosta the prince -- curse he curse he mother 's soul curse he wife 's offspring yes say the starosta quietly yes curse he and all he work what be it you want little father -- tea he turn into the shop and serve he customer duly inscribe the debt among other in a rough cheap book the word soon spread that a carriage be come along the road from tver all the villager come to the door of they dilapidated wooden hut even the kabak be empty for a time as the vehicle approach it become apparent that the horse be go at a great pace not only be the loose horse gallop but also the pair in the shaft the carriage be a open one a ordinary north russian travel carriage not unlike the vehicle we call the victorium set on high wheel beside the driver on the box sit another servant in the open carriage sit one man only karl steinmetz as he pass through the village a murmur of many voice follow he not quite drown by the rattle of he wheel the clatter of the horse ' foot the murmur be a curse karl steinmetz hear it distinctly it make he smile with a queer expression beneath he great gray mustache the starosta standing in he door-way see the smile he raise he voice with he neighbor and curse as steinmetz pass he he give a little jerk of the head toward the castle the jerk of the head might have be due to a inequality of the road but it might also convey a appointment the keen haggard face of michael roon show no sign of mutual understanding and the carriage rattle on through the stricken village two hour later when it be quite dark a closed carriage with two bright lamp flare into the night pass through the village toward the castle at a gallop it be the prince the peasant say crouching in they low door-way it be the prince we know he bell -- they be of silver -- and we shall starve during the winter curse he -- curse he they raise they head and listen to the gallop foot with the patient dumb despair which be the curse of the slavonic race some of they creep to they door and look up saw that the castle window be ablaze with light if paul howard alexi be a plain english gentleman in london he be also a great prince in he country keep up a princely state enjoy the gilded solitude that belong to the high-born he english education have educe a strict sense of discipline and as in england and indeed all through he life so in russium do he attempt to do he duty the carriage rattle up to the brilliantly light door which stand open and within on either side of the broad entrance-hall the servant stand to welcome they master a strange picturesque motley crew : the majordomo in he black coat and beside he the other house-servant -- tall upright fellow in they bright livery beyond they the stable-man and keeper a little army in red cloth tunic with wide trousers tuck into high boot all hold they fur cap in they hand stand stiffly at attention clean honest and not too intelligent the castle of osterno be build on the line of many russian country seat and not a few palace in moscow the royal palace in the kremlin be a example a broad entrance-hall at the back of which a staircase as broad stretch up to a gallery around which the dwelling-room be situate at the head of the staircase directly face the entrance-hall high folding door disclose the drawing-room which be almost a throne room all gorgeous lofty spacious as only russian house be truly this northern empire this great white land be a country in which it be good to be a emperor a prince a noble but not a poor man paul pass through the rank of he retainer himself a head taller than the tallest footman a few inch broader than the sturdiest keeper he acknowledge the low bow by a quick nod and pass up the staircase steinmetz -- in evening dress wear the insignia of one or two order which he have win in the more active day of he earlier diplomatic life -- be wait for he at the head of the stair the two man bow gravely to each other steinmetz throw open the door of the great room and stand aside the prince pass on and the german follow he each play he part gravely as man in high place be call to do when the door be close behind they and they be alone there be no relaxation no smile of covert derision these man know the russian character thoroughly there be be it know no more impressionable man on the face of god 's earth paul and steinmetz have play they part so long that these come to be natural to they as soon as they pass the volga we be all so in a minor degree in each house to each of we friend we be unconsciously different in some particular one man hold we in awe and we unconsciously instil that feeling another consider we a buffoon and lo we be exceedingly funny paul and steinmetz know that the people around they in osterno be somewhat like the dumb and driven beast these peasant require overawing by a careful display of pomp -- a unrelaxed dignity the line of demarcation between the noble and the peasant be so marked in the land of the czar that it be difficult for englishman to realize or believe it it be like the line that be draw between we and we dog if we suppose it possible that dog could be teach to act and think for themselves if we take such a development as practicable and consider the possibility of social upheaval lie behind such a education we can in a minute degree realize the problem which prince pavlo alexi and all he fellow-noble will be call upon to solve within the lifetime of man already bear chapter x the moscow doctor colossal exclaimed steinmetz beneath he breath with a little trick of the tongue he transfer he cigar from the right-hand to the left-hand corner of he mouth colossal -- l he repeat for a moment paul look up from the papers spread out on the table before he -- look with the preoccupy air of a man who be add up something in he mind then he return to he occupation he have be at this work for four hour without a break it be nearly one o'clock in the morning since dinner karl steinmetz have consume no less than five cigar while he have not speak five word these two man lock in a small room in the middle of the castle of osterno -- a room with no window but which gain its light from the clear heaven by a shaft and a skylight on the roof -- lock in thus they have be engage in the addition of a enormous mass of figure each sheet have be carefully annotated and add by steinmetz and as each be finish he hand it to he companion be that fool never come ask paul with a impatient glance at the clock we very dear friend the starosta reply steinmetz be no slave to time he be late the room have the appearance of a office there be two safe -- square chest such as we learn to associate with the name of griffith in this country there be a huge writing-table -- a double table -- at which paul and steinmetz be seat there be sundry stationery case and a almanac or so suspend on the wall which be oaken panel a large white stove -- common to all russian room -- stand against the wall the room have no less than three door with a handle on no one of they each door open with a key like a cupboard steinmetz have apparently finish he work he be sit back in he chair contemplate he companion with a little smile it apparently tickle some obtuse teutonic sense of humor to see this prince do work which be usually assign to clerk -- work out statistics and abstruse calculation as to how much food be require to keep body and soul together the silence of the room be almost oppressive a russian village after nightfall be the quietest human habitation on earth for the moujik -- the native of a country which will some day supply the universe with petroleum -- can not afford to light up he humble abode and therefore sit in darkness have the village of osterno possess the liveliness of a spanish hamlet the sound of voice and laughter could not have reach the castle perch high up on the rock above but osterno be asleep : the castle servant have long go to rest and the great silence of russium wrap its wing over all when therefore the clear cough bark of a wolf be hear both occupant of the little room look up the sound be repeat and steinmetz slowly rise from he seat i can quite believe that we friend be able to call a wolf or a lynx to he he say he do it uncannily well i have see he do so say paul without look up but it be a common enough accomplishment among the keeper steinmetz have leave the room before he finish speak one of the door of this little room communicate with a large apartment use as a secretary 's office and through this by a small staircase with a side entrance to the castle by this side entrance the steward of the different outlying estate be conduct to the presence of the resident secretary -- a german select and overawe by karl steinmetz -- a mere calculate machine of a man with whom we have no affair to transact before many minute have elapse steinmetz come back closely follow by the starosta whose black eye twinkle and gleam in the sudden light of the lamp he drop on he knee when he see paul -- suddenly abjectly like a animal in he dumb attitude of deprecation with a jerk of he head paul bid he rise which the man do stand back against the panelled wall place as great a distance between himself and the prince as the size of the room would allow well say paul curtly almost roughly i hear you be in trouble in the village the cholera have come excellency many death to-day -- eleven paul look up sharply and the doctor he have not come yet excellency i send for he -- a fortnight ago the cholera be at oseff at dolja at kalisheffa it be everywhere he have forty thousand soul under he care he have to obey the zemstvo to go where they tell he he take no notice of I yes interrupt paul i know and the people themselves do they attempt to understand it -- to follow out my instruction the starosta spread out he thin hand in deprecation he cringe a little as he stand he have jewish blood in he vein which while it raise he above he fellow in osterno carry with it the usual tendency to cringe it be in the blood it be part of what the people who stand without pilate 's palace take upon themselves and upon they child you excellency he say know what they be it be slow they make no progress for they one disease be as another ` bog dal e bog vzial ' they say ` god give and god take ' he pause he black eye flash from one face to the other only the moscow doctor excellency he say significantly can manage they paul shrug he shoulder he rise from he seat glance at steinmetz who be look on in silence with he queer mock smile i will go with you now he say it be late enough already the starosta bow very low but he say nothing paul go to a cupboard and take from it a old fur coat drag at the seam stain about the cuff a dull brown -- doctor know the color such stain have hang a man before now for they be the mark of blood paul put on this coat he take a long soft silken scarf such as russian wear in winter and wrap it round he throat quite conceal the lower part of he face he cram a fur cap down over he ear come he say karl steinmetz accompany they down stair carry a lamp in one hand he close the door behind they but do not lock it then he go upstairs again to the quiet little room where he sit down in a deep chair he look at the open door of the cupboard from which paul alexi have take he simple disguise with a large tolerant humor el señor don quixote de la mancha he say sleepily it be say that to a doctor nothing be shocking and nothing be disgust but doctor be after all only man of stomach like the rest of we and it be to be presume that what nauseate one will nauseate the other when the starosta unceremoniously throw open the door of the miserable cabin belong to vasilli tulum paul give a little gasp the foul air pour out of the noisome den be such that it seem impossible that human lung could assimilate it this vasillus tulum be a notorious drunkard a discontent a braggart the nihilist propaganda have in the early day of that mistaken mission reach he and unsettled he discontented mind misfortune seem to pursue he in higher grade of life than he there be man who like tula make a profession of misfortune paul stumble down two step the cottage be dark the starosta have apparently trodden on a chicken which scream shrilly and flutter about in the dark with that complete abandon which belong to chicken sheep and some woman have you no light cry the starosta paul retreat to the top step where he have a short-lived struggle with a well-grown calf which have be live in the room with the family and evince a very creditable desire for fresh air yes yes we have a little petroleum say a voice but we have no match the starosta strike a light i have bring the moscow doctor to see you the moscow doctor cry several voice sbogom -- sbogom god be with you in the dim light the whole of the floor seem to get up and shake itself there be at least seven person sleep in the hut two of they do not get up one be dead the other be die of cholera a heavily build man reach down from the top of the brick stove a cheap tin paraffin lamp which he hand to the starosta by the light of this paul come again into the hut the floor be filthy as may be imagine for beast and human being live here together the man -- vasilli tulum -- throw himself down on he knee claw at paul 's coat with great unwashed hand whine out a tale of sorrow and misfortune in a moment they be all on they knee cling to he cry to he for help : tulum himself a wild-looking slav of fifty or thereabout he wife haggard emaciate horrible to look upon for she be toothless and almost blind two woman and a loutish boy of sixteen paul push he way not unkindly toward the corner where the two motionless form lay half conceal by a mass of ragged sheepskin here he say this woman be dead take she out when will you learn to be clean this boy may live -- with care bring the light closer little mother so it be well he will live come do not sit cry take all these rag out and burn they all of you go out it be a fine night you be better in the cart-shed than here here you tula go round with the starosta to he store he will give you clean blanket they obey he blindly tulum and one of the young woman -lrb- he daughter -rrb- drag the dead body which be that of a very old woman out into the night the starosta have retire to the door-way when the lamp be light he courage have fail he the air be foul with the reek of smoke and filth and infection come vasillus tulum the village elder say with suspicious eagerness come with I i will give you what the good doctor say though you owe I money and you never try to pay I but tulum be kiss and mumble over the hem of paul 's coat paul take no notice of he we be starve excellency the man be say i can get no work i have to sell my horse in the winter and i can not plough my little piece of land the government will not help we the prince -- curse he -- do nothing for we he live in petersburg where he spend all he money and have food and wine more than he want the count stépan lanovitch use to assist we -- god be with he but he have be send to siberium because he help the peasant he be like you he be a great bárin a great noble and yet he help the peasant paul turn round sharply and shake the man off go he say with the starosta and get what i tell you a great strong fellow like you have no business on he knee to any man i will not help you unless you help yourself you be a lazy good-for-nothing get out he push he out of the hut and kick after he a few rag of clothing which be lie about on the floor all filthy and slimy good god mutter he under he breath in english that a place like this should exist beneath the very wall of osterno from hut to hut he go all through that night on he mission of mercy -- without enthusiasm without high-flown notion respect mankind but with the simple sense of duty that be he these people be he thing -- he dumb and driven beast in he heart there may have exist a grudge against the almighty for place he in a position which be not only intensely disagreeable but also somewhat ridiculous for he do not dare to tell he friend of these thing he have speak of they to no man except karl steinmetz who be in a sense he dependent english public school and university have instil into he the intensely british feeling of shame respect good work he could take chaff as well as any man for he be grave by habit and a grave man receive the most chaff most good-humoredly but he have a nervous dread of be find out he have make a sort of religion of suppress the fact that he be a prince the holy of holy of this cult be the fact that he be a prince who seek to do good to he neighbor -- a prince in whom one might repose trust this be not the first time by any number that he have go down into he own village insist in a rough-and-ready way on cleanliness and purity the moscow doctor -- the peasant would say in the kabak over they vodka and they tea -- the moscow doctor come in and kick we bed out of the door he come in and throw we furniture into the street but afterward he give we new bed and new furniture it be a joke that always obtain in the kabak it flavor the vodka and with that fiery poison serve to raise a laugh the moscow doctor be look upon in osterno and in many neighbor village as second only to god in fact many of the peasant place he before they creator they be stupid vodka-soddened hapless man the moscow doctor they could see for themselves he come in a very tangible thing of flesh and blood build on a large and manly scale he take they by the shoulder and bundle they out of they own house kick they bedding after they he scold they he rate they and abuse they he bring they food and medicine he understand the disease which from time to time sweep over they village no cold be too intense for he to brave should they be in distress he ask no money and he give none but they live on he charity and they be wise enough to know it what wonder if these poor wretch love the man whom they could see and hear above the god who manifest himself to they in no way the orthodox priest of they village have no money to spend on they parishioner on the contrary they ask for money to keep the church in repair what wonder then if these poor ignorant helpless peasant would listen to no priest for the priest could not explain to they why it be that god send a four-month-long winter which cut they off from the rest of the world behind impassable barrier of snow that god send they drought in the summer so that there be no crop of rye that god scourge they with dread and horrible disease it be almost impossible for we to realize in these day of a lamentably cheap press and a cheaper literature the mental condition of man and woman who have no education no newspaper no news of the world no communication with the universe to they the mystery of the moscow doctor be as incomprehensible as to we be the deity they be so near to the animal that paul could not succeed in teach they that disease and death follow on the heel of dirt and neglect they be too ignorant to reason too low down the animal scale to comprehend thing which some of the dumb animal undoubtedly recognize paul alexi half russian half english understand these people very thoroughly he take advantage of they ignorance they simplicity they unfathomable superstition he govern as no other could have rule they by fear and kindness at once he master they by he vitality the wholesome strength of he nature he infinite superiority he avoid the terrible mistake of the nihilist by treat they as child to whom education must be give little by little instead of throw down before they a mass of dangerous knowledge which they mind unaccustomed to such strong food be incapable of digest a british coldness of blood damp as it be the russian quixotism which would desire to see result follow upon action -- to see the world make quicker progress than its creator have decree with very unsatisfactory material paul be set in motion a great rock which will roll down into the age unconnected with he name clear a path through a very thick forest of ignorance and tyranny chapter xi catrina the man who carry a deceit however innocent with he through life be apt to be somewhat handicapped in that unfair competition he be like a ship at sea with a spring mainmast a side breeze may arise at any moment which throw he all aback and upon he beam-end he run illegitimate risk which be thing much give to drag at a man 's mind handicap he thought paul suffer in this way it be a distinct burthen to he to play a double part although each be innocent enough in itself at school and later on at the ` varsity he have consistently and steadily suppress a truth from friend and foe alike -- namely that he be in he own country a prince no great crime on the face of it but a constant suppression of a very small truth be as burdensome as any suggestion of falsehood it make one afraid of contemptible foe and doubtful of the value of one 's own friendship paul be a simple-minded man he be not afraid of the russian government indeed he cultivate a fine contempt for that August body but he be distinctly afraid of be find out for that discovery could only mean a incontinent cessation of the good work which render he life happy the fear of be deprive of this interest in existence should certainly have be lessen if not quite allay by the fact that a greater interest have be bring into he life in the pleasant form of a prospective wife when he be in london with etta sydney bamborough he do not however forget osterno he only long for the time when he could take etta freely into he confidence and engage she interest in the object of he ambition -- namely to make the huge osterno estate into that lump of leaven which might in time leaven the whole of the empire that a man be capable of sustain two absorb interest at once be a matter of every-day illustration be we not surround by man who do they work well in life and love they wife well at home without allow the one to interfere with the other that woman be capable of the same seem exceedingly probable but we be a race of sheep who run after each other guide for the moment by a catchword which will not bear investigation or a erroneous deduction set in alliterative verse which cling to the mind and sway it thus we all think that woman 's whole existence be and be only capable of love because a poet in the trickiness of he trade once say so now paul hold a different opinion he think that etta could manage to love he well as she say she do and yet take a interest in that which be in reality the object of he life he intend to take the earliest opportunity of tell she all about the work he be endeavor to carry out at osterno and the knowledge that he be withhold something from she be a constant burden to a upright and honest nature i think he say one morning to steinmetz that i will write and tell mr sydney bamborough all about this place i should not do that reply steinmetz with a leisurely promptitude they be alone in a great smoking-room of which the wall be hang all round with hunting trophy paul be smoke a post-prandial cigar steinmetz reflect gravely over a pipe they be both reading russian newspaper -- periodical chiefly remarkable for that which they leave unsaid why not ask paul on principle never tell a woman that which be not interesting enough to magnify into a secret paul turn over he newspaper he begin read again then suddenly he look up we be engage to be marry he observe pointedly steinmetz take he pipe from he lip slowly and imperturbably he be a man to whom it be no satisfaction to impart news he either know it before or do not take much interest in the matter that make it worse he say a woman only conceal what be bad about she husband if she know anything that be likely to make other woman think that they husband be inferior she will tell it paul laugh but this be not good he argue we have keep it so confoundedly quiet that i be begin to feel as if it be a crime steinmetz uncross he leg cross they again and then speak after mature reflection : as i understand the law of libel a man be punish not for tell a lie but for tell either the truth or a lie with malicious intent i imagine the almighty will take the intent into consideration if human justice find it expedient to do so paul shrug he shoulder argument be not he strong point and like most man who can not argue he be almost impervious to the argument of other he recognize the necessity for secrecy -- the absolute need of a thousand little secretive precaution and disguise which be intensely disagreeable to he but he also grumble at they freely and whenever he make such objection karl steinmetz grow uneasy as if the question which he dispose of with facile philosophy or humorous resignation have behind it a possibility and a importance of which he be fully aware it be on these rare occasion that he might have convey to a keen observer the impression that he be play a very dangerous game with a smile countenance all that we do pursued steinmetz be to bow to a lamentable necessity for deceit i have bow to it all my life it have be my trade perhaps it be not we fault that we be place in charge of four or five thousand human being who be no more capable of help themselves than be sheep it be not we fault that the forefather of these sheep cut down the forest and omit to plant more so that the flock with whom we have to deal have no fuel it be not we fault that a most terrific winter annually render the land unproductive for four month it be not we fault that the government to which we be force to bow -- the czar whose name lift we hat from we head -- it be not we fault that progress and education be taboo and that all who endeavor to forward the cause of humanity be promptly put away in a safe place where they be at liberty to forward they own salvation and nothing else nothing be we fault mein lieber in this country we have to make the best of adverse circumstance we be not break any human law and in do nothing we should be break a divine command paul flick the ash off he cigar he have hear all this before karl steinmetz 's word be usually more remarkable for solid thoughtfulness than for brilliancy of conception or any great novelty of expression oh say paul quietly i be not go to leave off you need not fear that only i shall have to tell my wife surely a woman could help we in a thousand way there be such a lot that only a woman understand yes grunt steinmetz and only the right sort of woman paul look up sharply you must leave that to I he say my very dear friend i leave every thing to you paul smile there be no positive proof that this be not strictly true there be no say that karl steinmetz do not leave every thing to every-body but wise people think differently you do not know etta he say half shyly she be full of sympathy and pity for these people steinmetz bow gravely i have no doubt of it and yet you say that she must not be tell certainly not a secret be considerably strain if it be divide between two people stretch it to three will probably break it you can tell she when you be marry do she consent to live in osterno oh yes i think so um -- m what do you say um -- m repeat steinmetz and the conversation somewhat naturally show sign of collapse at this moment the door be open and a servant in bright livery with powdered wig silk stocking and a countenance which might have be of wood bring in a letter on a silver tray paul take the square envelope and turn it over display as he do so a coronet in black and gold on the corner like a stamp karl steinmetz see the coronet he never take he quiet unobtrusive glance from paul 's face while he open the letter and read it a fresh difficulty say paul throw the note across to he companion steinmetz look grave while he unfold the thick stationery dear paul -lrb- the letter run -rrb- : i hear you be at osterno and that the moscow doctor be in you country we be in great distress at thor -- cholera i fear the fame of you doctor have spread to my people and they be clamor for he can you bring or send he over you know you room here be always in readiness come soon with the great doctor and also herr steinmetz in do so you will give more than pleasure to you old friend catrina lanovitch p mother be afraid to go out of door for fear of infection she think she have a little cold steinmetz fold the letter very carefully press the seam of it reflectively with he stout forefinger and thumb i always think of the lie first he say it be my nature or my misfortune we can easily write and say that the moscow doctor have leave he pause scratch he brow pensively with he curved forefinger it be to be fear that he be seek not so much the truth as the most convenient perversion of the same but then he go on by do that we leave these poor devil to die in they -- stye catrina can not manage they they be worse than we people whatever be the best lie to tell burst in paul -- as we seem to live in a atmosphere of they -- i must go to thor that be quite certain there be no must in the case put in steinmetz quietly as a parenthesis no man be compel to throw himself in the way of infection but i know you will go whatever i say i suppose i shall admit paul and catrina will find you out at once why steinmetz draw in he foot he lean forward and knock he pipe on one of the log that lay ready to light in the great open fire-place because she love you he say shortly there be no come the moscow doctor over she mien lieber paul laugh rather awkwardly he be one of the few man -- daily grow fewer -- who hold that a woman 's love be not a thing to be toss lightly about in conversation then -- he begin speak rather quickly as if afraid that steinmetz be go to say more if he amend you think she will find out she must not see I that be all steinmetz reflect again he be unusually grave over this matter one would scarcely have take this stout german for a person of any sentiment whatever nevertheless he would have like paul to marry catrina lanovitch in preference to etta sydney bamborough merely because he think that the former love he while he feel sure that the latter do not so much for the sentimental point of view -- a starting-point by the way which usually make all the difference in a man 's life for a man need to be love as much as a woman need it from the practical point of view karl steinmetz know too much about etta to place entire reliance on the goodness of she motive he keenly suspect that she be marry paul for he money -- for the position he could give she in the world we must be careful he say we must place clearly before ourselves the risk that we be run before we come to any decision for you the risk be simply that of unofficial banishment they can hardly send you to siberium because you be half a englishman and that impertinent country have a habit of get up and shout when she son be interfere with but they can easily make russium impossible for you they can do you more harm than you think they can do these poor devil of peasant of yours more harm than we can comfortably contemplate as for I he pause and shrug he great shoulder it mean siberium already i be a suspect -- a persona non grata i do not see how we can refuse to help catrina say paul in a voice which steinmetz seem to know for he suddenly give in as you will he say he sit up and draw a small table toward he take up a pen reflectively paul watch he in silence when the letter be finish steinmetz read it aloud : my dear catrina : the moscow doctor and you obedient servant will be -lrb- dv -rrb- in thor by seven o'clock to-night we propose spend about a hour in the village if you will kindly advise the starosta to be ready for we as we time be limited and we be much need in osterno we shall have to deprive ourselves of the pleasure of call at the castle the prince send kind remembrance and propose ride over to thor to avail himself of you proffer hospitality in a day or two with salutation to the countess you old friend karl steinmetz steinmetz wait with the letter in he hand for paul 's approval you see he explain you be notoriously indifferent to the welfare of the peasant it would be unnatural if you suddenly display so much interest as to induce you to go to thor on a mission of charity paul nod all right he say yes i see though i confess i sometimes forget what the deuce i _ be _ suppose to be steinmetz laugh pleasantly as he fold the letter he rise and go to the door i will send it off he say he pause on the threshold and look back gravely do not forget he add that catrina lanovitch love you chapter xii at thor below the window of a long low stone house in its architecture remarkably like a fortified farm -- below these deep-embrasured window the river oster mumble softly one of the window be wide open and with the voice of the water a wonderful music roll out to mingle and lose itself in the hum of the pine-wood the room be a small one beneath the artistic wall-paper one detect the outline of square-hewn stone there be woman 's thing lie about there be flower in a bowl on a low strong table there be a few good engraving on the wall deep-curtained window low chair a sofa a fan but it be not a womanly room the music fill it vibrate back from the grim stone wall be not womanly music it be more than manly it be not earthly but almost divine it happen to be grieg with the halt beat of a disabled perhaps a broken heart in it as that master 's music usually have the girl be alone in the room the presence of any one would have silence something that be throb at the back of the chord quite suddenly she stop she know how to play the quaint last note she know something that no master have ever teach she she swing round on the stool and face the light it be afternoon -- a autumn afternoon in russium -- and the pink light make the very best of a face which be not beautiful at all never could be beautiful -- a face about which even the owner a woman could have no possible illusion it be broad and powerful with eye too far apart forehead too broad and low jaw too heavy mouth too determine the eye be almond-shaped and slightly slope downward and inward -- deep passionate blue eye set in a mongolian head it be the face of a woman who could morally speak make mincemeat of nine young man out of ten but she could not have make one out of the number love she for it have be decree that woman shall win love -- except in some happy exception -- by beauty only the same unwritten law have it that a man 's appearance do not matter -- a law much appreciate by some of we and duly canonize by not a few the girl be evidently listen she glance at a little golden clock on the mantel-piece and then at the open window she rise -- she be short and somewhat broadly build -- and go to the window he will be back she say to herself in a few minute now she raise she hand to she forehead and press back she hair with a little movement of impatience expressive perhaps of a great suspense she stand idly drum on the window-sill for a few moment then with a quick little sigh she go back to the piano as she move she give a jerk of the head from time to time as schoolgirl who have too much hair be wont to do the reason of this nervous movement be a wondrous plait of gold reach far below she waist catrina lanovitch almost worship she own hair she know without any doubt that not one woman in ten thousand could rival she in this feminine glory -- know it as indubitably as she know that she be plain the latter fact she face with a unflinching cold conviction which be not feminine at all she do not say that she be hideous for the sake of hear a contradiction or a series of save clause she never speak of it to any one she have grow up with it and as it be beyond doubt so be it outside discussion all she femininity seem to be concentrate all she vanity centre on she hair it be she one pride perhaps she one hope woman have be love for they voice catrina 's voice be musical enough but it be deep and strong it be passionate tender if she wish fascinating but it be not lovable if the voice may win love why not the hair catrina despise all man but one -- that one she worship she live night and day with one great desire beside which heaven and hell be mere word neither the hope of the one nor the fear of the other in any way touch or affect she desire she want to make paul alexis love she and womanlike she cling to the one womanly charm that be hers -- the wonderful golden hair pathetic aye pathetic -- with a grin behind the pathos as there ever be she sit down at the piano and she strong small hand tear the heart out of each wire there be some people who get farther into a piano than other make the wire speak as with a voice catrina lanovitch have this trick she only play a russian people-song -- a simple lay such as one may hear issue from the door of any kabak on a summer evening but she infuse a true russian soul into it -- the soul that be curse with a fatal power of dumb and patient endurance she do not sway from side to side as do some people who lose themselves in the intoxication of music but she sit quite upright she sturdy square shoulder motionless she strange eye be fix with the stillness of distant contemplation suddenly she stop and leap to she foot she do not go to the window but stand listen beside the piano the beat of a horse 's hoof on the narrow road be distinctly audible hollow and sodden as be the sound of a wooden road it come nearer and nearer and a certain unsteadiness indicate that the horse be tired i think he might have come she whisper and she sit down breathlessly when the servant come into the room a few minute later catrina be at the piano a letter mademoiselle say the maid lay it on the table answer catrina without look round she be play the closing bar of a nocturne she rise slowly turn and seize the letter as a starve man seize food there be something almost wolf-like in she eye steinmetz she exclaim read the address steinmetz oh why will not he write to I she tear open the letter read it and stand hold it in she hand look out over the trackless pine-wood with absorb speculative eye the sun have just set the farthest ridge of pine-tree stand out like the tooth of a saw in black relief on the rosy sky catrina lanovitch watch the rosiness fade into pearly gray madame the countess await mademoiselle for tea say the maid 's voice suddenly in the gloom of the door-way i will come the village of thor -- twenty mile farther down the river oster twenty mile nearer to the junction of that river with the volga -- be little more than a hamlet in the day of which we write some day perhaps the three hundred soul of thor may increase and multiply -- some day when russium be attack by the railway fever for thor be on the chorno-ziom -- the belt of black and fertile soil that run right across the vast empire karl steinmetz a dogged watcher of the wander jew -- the deathless scoffer at we lord 's agony who shall never die who shall leave cholera in he track wherever he may wander -- karl steinmetz know that the oster be in itself a wander jew this river meander through the lonesome country bear cholera germ within its water whenever osterno have cholera it send it down the river to thor and so on to the volga thor lay groan under the scourge and the countess lanovitch shut herself within she stone wall shiver with fear beg she daughter to return to petersburg it be nearly dark when karl steinmetz and the moscow doctor ride into the little village to find the starosta a simple russian farmer await they outside the kabak steinmetz know the man and immediately take command of the situation with that unquestioned sense of authority which in russium place the bárin on much the same footing as that take by the anglo-indian in we eastern empire now starosta he say we have only a hour to spend in thor this be the moscow doctor if you listen to what he tell you you will soon have no sickness in the village the worst house first -- and quickly you need not be afraid but if you do not care to come in you may stay outside as they walk down the straggle village-street the moscow doctor tell the starosta in no measure term as be he wont wherein lay the heart of the sickness here as in osterno dirt and neglect be at the base of all the trouble here as in the larger village the house be more like the abode of four-footed beast than the dwelling of human being the starosta prudently remain outside the first house to which he introduce the visitor paul go fearlessly in while steinmetz stand in the door-way hold open the door as he be stand there he perceive a flickering light approach he the light be evidently that of a ordinary hand-lantern and from the swing motion it be easy to divine that it be be carry by some one who be walk quickly who be this ask steinmetz it be likely to be the countess catrina excellency steinmetz glance back into the cottage which be dark save for the light of a single petroleum lamp paul 's huge form could be dimly distinguish bend over a heap of humanity and foul clothing in a corner do she visit the cottage ask steinmetz sharply she do god be with she she have no fear she be a angel without she we should all be dead she will not visit this if i can help it mutter steinmetz the light flicker along the road toward they in the course of a few minute it fall on the stricken cottage on the starosta standing in the road on steinmetz in the door-way herr steinmetz be that you ask a voice deep and musical in the darkness zum befehl answer steinmetz without move catrina come up to he she be clothe in a long dark cloak a dark hat and wear no glove she bring with she a clean aromatic odor of disinfectant she carry the lantern herself while behind she walk a man-servant in livery with a large basket in either hand it be good of you she say to come to we in we need -- also to persuade the good doctor to come with you it be not much that we can do answer steinmetz take the small outstretched hand within he large soft grasp but that little you may always count upon i know she say gravely she look up at he expect he to step aside and allow she to pass into the cottage but steinmetz stand quite still look down at she with he pleasant smile and how be it with you he ask speak in german as they always do together she shrug she shoulder oh she answer indifferently i be well of course i always be i have the strength of a horse of course i have be trouble about these poor people it have be terrible they be worse than child i can not quite understand why god afflict they so they have never do any harm they be not like the jew it seem unjust i have be very busy in my small way my mother you know do not take much interest in thing that be not clean madame the countess read french novel and the fictional production of some modern english lady suggest steinmetz quietly yes but she object to honest dirt say catrina coldly may i go in steinmetz do not move i think not this moscow man be eccentric he like to do good sub rosa he prefer to be alone catrina try to look into the cottage but karl steinmetz as we know be fat and fill up the whole door-way i should like to thank he for come to we or at least to offer he hospitality i suppose one can not pay he no one can not pay he answer steinmetz gravely there be a little pause from the interior of the cottage come the murmured gratitude of the peasant break at time by a wail of agony -- the wail of a man it be not a pleasant sound to hear catrina hear it and it twist she plain strong face in a sudden spasm of sympathy again she make a impatient little movement let I go in she urge i may be able to help steinmetz shake he head better not he say besides you life be too precious to these poor people to run unnecessary risk she give a strange bitter laugh and what about you she say and paul you never hear of paul go into any of the cottage snap steinmetz sharply for I it be different you have never hear that of paul no she answer slowly and it be quite right he life -- it be different for he how -- how be paul he be well thank you steinmetz glance down at she she be look across the plain beyond the boundless pine forest that lay between thor and the volga quite well he go on kindly enough he hope to ride over and pay he respects to the countess to-morrow or the next day and the keen kind eye see what they expect in the flickering light of the lamp at this moment steinmetz be push aside from within and a hulk young man stagger out into the road propel from behind with considerable vigor after he come a shower of clothes and bedding pah exclaim steinmetz splutter himmel what filth be careful catrina but catrina have slip past he in a instant he have catch she by the wrist come back he cry you must not go in there she be just over the threshold you have some reason for keep I out she return wriggle in he strong grasp i will -- i will with a twist she wrench herself free and go into the dimly light room almost immediately she give a mock laugh paul she say chapter xiii unmask for a moment there be silence in the hovel break only by the wail of the die man in the corner paul and catrina face each other -- she white and suddenly breathless he half frown but he do not meet she eye paul she say again with a linger touch on the name the sound of she voice a rough sort of tenderness in she angry tone make steinmetz smile in he grim way as a man may smile when in pain paul what do you do this for why be you here oh why be you in this wretched place because you send for I he answer quietly come let we go out i have finish here that man will die there be nothing more to be do for he you must not stay in here she give a short laugh as she follow he he have to stoop low to pass through the door-way then he turn and hold out he hand for fear she should trip over the high threshold she nod she thanks but refuse the proffer assistance steinmetz linger behind to give some last instruction leave paul and catrina to walk on down the narrow street alone the moon be just rise -- a great yellow moon such as only russium know -- the land of the silver night how long have you be do this ask catrina suddenly she do not look toward he but straight in front of she for some year now he reply simply he linger he be wait for steinmetz who always rise to such emergency who understand secret and how to secure they when they seem already lose he do not quite understand what be to be do with catrina -- how she be to be silence she have find he out with such startling rapidity that he feel disposed to admit she right to dictate she own term on a straight road this man be fearless and quick but he have no taste or capacity for crooked way catrina walk on in silence she be not look at the matter from he point of view at all of course she say at length of course paul i admire you for it immensely it be just like you to go and do the thing quietly and say nothing about it but -- oh you must go away from here i -- i -- it be too horrible to think of you run such risk rather let they all die like fly than that you must not do it you must not she speak in english hurriedly with a little break in she voice which he do not understand with ordinary precaution the risk be very small he say practically yes but do you take ordinary precaution be you sure you be all right now she stop they be quite alone in the one silent street of the stricken village she look up into he face she hand be run over the breast of the tattered coat he wear it be lamentably obvious even to he that she love he in she anxiety she either do not know what she be do or she do not care whether he know or not she merely give sway to the maternal instinct which be in the love of all woman she feel he hand she reach up and touch he face be you sure -- be you sure you have not take it she whisper he walk on almost roughly oh yes quite he say i will not allow you to go into any more house in thor i can not -- i will not oh paul you do not know if you do i will tell they all who you be and -- and the government will stop you what would be the good of that say paul awkwardly you father care for he peasant and be content to run risk for they i suppose you care about they too as you go into they house yes but -- she pause give a strange little reckless laugh and be silent heaven forbid that we should say that she want he to know that she love he chivalry bid we believe that woman guard the secret of they love inviolate from the world but what be catrina to do man be in the habit of forget that plain woman be woman at all surely some of they may be excuse for remind we at time that they also be capable of loving -- that they also desire to be love happy be the man who love and be loved of a plain woman for she will take she own lack of beauty into consideration and give he more than most beautiful woman have it in they power to give of course catrina go on with a sudden anger which surprise herself i can not stop you from do this at osterno though i think it be wicked but i can prevent you from do it here and i certainly shall paul shrug he shoulder as you like he say i think you care more about the peasant i do not care a jot about the peasant she answer passionately as compare -- it be you i be think about not they i think you be selfish and cruel to you friend my friend have never show that they be consume with anxiety on my account that be mere prevarication leave that to herr steinmetz and such man whose business it be you do not do it well you friend may feel a lot that they do not show she speak the word shortly and sharply surreptitious good be so rare that when it be find out it very naturally get mix up with secret evil and the perpetrator of the hidden good deed feel guilty of a crime paul be in this lamentable position which he proceed to further aggravate by seek to excuse himself i do it after mature consideration i try pay another man but he shirk he work and show the white feather so steinmetz and i conclude that there be nothing to be do but do we dirty work ourselves which be translate means that you do it pardon I steinmetz do he share catrina lanovitch be essentially a woman despite she somewhat masculine frame she settle karl steinmetz 's account with a sniff of contempt and that be why you have be so fond of osterno the last two year she ask innocently yes he answer fall into the trap catrina wince one do not wince the less because the pain be expect the girl have the slav instinct of self-martyrdom which make russian so very different from the pleasure-loving nation of europe only that she enquire paul glance down at she yes he answer quietly they walk on in silence for a few moment paul seem tacitly to have give up the idea of visit any more of the stricken cottage they be go toward the long old house which be call the castle more by courtesy than by right how long be you go to stay in osterno ask catrina at length about a fortnight i can not stay longer i be go to be marry catrina stop dead she stand for a moment look at the ground with a sort of wonder in she eye not pleasant to see it be the look of one who have fall from a great height be not quite sure whether it mean death or not then she walk on i congratulate you she say i only hope she will make you happy she be -- beautiful i suppose yes answer paul simply the girl nod she head what be she name etta sydney bamborough catrina have evidently never hear the name before it convey nothing to she womanlike she go back to she first question what be she like paul hesitate tall i suppose suggest the stunt woman at he side yes and graceful yes have she -- pretty hair ask catrina i think so -- yes you be not observant say the girl in a singularly even and emotionless voice perhaps you never notice not particularly answer paul the girl raise she face there be a painful smile twist she lip the moonlight fall upon she the deep shadow beneath the eye make she face wear a grin some have see such a grin on the face of a drown man -- a sight not to be forget where do she live ask catrina she be unaware of the thought of murder that be in she own heart nevertheless the desire -- indefinite shapeless -- be there to kill this woman who be tall and beautiful whom paul alexi love it must be remember in extenuation that catrina lanovitch have live nearly all she life in the province of tver she be not modern at all deprive of the advantage of we enlighten society press without the benefit of we decadent fictional literature she have lamentably narrow view of life she be without that deep philosophy which teach you mademoiselle who read this guileless tale that nothing matter very much that love be but a pass amusement the plaything of a hour that if tom be faithless dick be equally amusing while harry 's taste in glove and compliment be worthy of some consideration that these thing be true -- that at all event the modern young lady think they true -- be a matter of no doubt whatever have not the modern lady novelist tell we so and be not the modern lady novelist notable for she close observation of human nature she impartial judgment of human motive she sublime truth of delineation when she sit down to describe the thing she call a man by a close study of the refine feminine literature of the day the modern young lady acquire not only the knowledge of some startling social delinquency -- retail not as if they be quite the exception but as if they be quite the correct thing -- but also she will learn that she be human she will realize how utterly absurd it be to attempt to be any thing else if person in book she will reflect be not high-minded or pure-minded or even clean-minded it be useless for a ordinary person out of a book to attempt to be any of these this be the lesson of some new writer and catrina lanovitch have fortunately enough lack the opportunity of learn it she only know that she love paul and that what she want be paul 's love to go with she all through she life she be not self-analytical nor subtle nor give to think about she own thought perhaps she be old-fashioned enough to be romantic if this be so we must bear with she romance remember that at all event romance serve to elevate while realism tend undoubtedly toward deterioration catrina hate etta sydney bamborough with a simple half-barbaric hatred because she have gain the love of paul alexi etta have take away from she the only man whom catrina could ever love all through she life the girl be simple enough unsophisticated enough never to dream of compromise she never for a moment entertain the cheap consolatory thought that in time she would get over it she would marry somebody else and make that compromise which be responsible for more misery in this world than ever be vice in she great solitude grow to womanhood as she have in the vast forest of tver she have learn nearly all that she know from the best teacher nature and she hold the strange effete theory that it be wicked for a woman to marry a man she do not love or to marry at all for any reason except love st paul and a few other hold like theory but nous avon changé tout celum where do she live ask catrina in london they walk on in silence for a few moment they be walk slowly and they presently hear the footstep of karl steinmetz and the servant close behind they i wonder say catrina half to herself whether she love you it be a question but not one that a man can answer paul say nothing but walk gravely on by the side of this woman who know that even if etta sydney bamborough should try she could never love he as she herself do when karl steinmetz join they they be silent i suppose he say in english that we may rely upon the discretion of the fraülein catrina yes answer the girl you may so far as osterno be concerned but i would rather that you do not visit we people here it be too dangerous in several way ah murmur steinmetz respectfully acquiescent he be look straight in front of he with a expression of countenance which be almost dense then we must bow to you decision he go on turn toward the tall man stride along at he side yes say paul simply steinmetz smile grimly to himself it be one of he half-cynical theory that woman hold the casting vote in all earthly matter and when a illustration such as this come to prove the correctness of he deduction he only smile he be not by nature a cynic -- only by the force of circumstance will you come to the castle ask the girl at length and steinmetz by a gesture defer the decision to paul i think not to-night thanks say the latter we will take you as far as the gate catrina make no comment when the tall gate-way be reach she stop and they all become aware of the sound of horse ' foot behind they what be this ask catrina only the starosta bring we horse reply steinmetz he have discover nothing catrina nod and hold out she hand good-night she say rather coldly you secret be safe with I set a thief to catch a thief reflect steinmetz he say nothing however when he shake hand they mount they horse and ride back the way they have come for half a hour no one speak then paul break the silence he only say one word : d -- n yes return steinmetz quietly charity be a dangerous plaything chapter xiv a wire-puller the palace of industry -- where with a fine sense of the fitness of the name the parisian amuse themselves -- be in a blaze of electric light and fashion the occasion be the concor hippique a ultra-equine fête where the lover of the friend of man and such person as be fit by a ungenerous fate with limb suitable to horsey clothes meet and bow in france as in a neighboring land -lrb- less sunny -rrb- horsiness be the last refuge of the diminutive it be you small man who be ever the horsiest in he outward appearance just as it be you very plain young person who be keenest at the sunday-school class when a frenchman be horsey he never run the risk of be mistake for a groom or a jockey as do he turfy compeer in england he costume be so exaggeratedly suggestive of the stable and the horse as to leave no doubt whatever that he be a amateur of the most pronounced type he collar be so white and stiff and portentous as to make it impossible for he to tighten up he own girth he breeches be so breechy about the knee as to render a ascent to the saddle a feat which it be not prudent to attempt without assistance he glove be so large and seamy as to make it extremely difficult to grasp the bridle and quite impossible to buckle a strap you french horseman be in fact rather like a knight of old inasmuch as he attendant be require to set he on he horse with he face turn in the right direction he bridle in he left hand he whip in he right and it be to be suppose he heart in he mouth when he be once up there however the gallant son of gaul can teach even some of we my fox-hunting master the way to sit a horse we have however little to do with such matter here except in so far as they affect the person connect with this record the concor hippique be it therefore know be at its height great deed of horsemanship have be successfully accomplish the fair have smile beneath pencil eyebrow upon the brave in uniform and breeches at the time when we join the fashionable throng the fair be smile they brightest it be in fact a interval for refreshment a crowd of well-dressed man jostle each other good-naturedly around a long table where insolent waiter serve tepid coffee and sandwich that have be cut by the hand of a knave in the background a number of lady nod encouragement to they cavalier in the interval of scrutinize each other 's dress many pencil eyebrow be raise in derision of too little style display by some innocent rival or bring down in disapproval of too much of the same vague quality display by one less innocent in the midst of these as in he element move the baron claude de chauxville smile he courteous ready smile which he enemy call a grin he take up less room than the majority of the man around he he succeed in pass through narrower place and jostle fewer people in a word he prove to he own satisfaction and to the discomfiture of many a younger man he proficiency in the gentle art of get on in the world not far from he stand a stout gentleman of middle age with a heavy fair mustache brush upward on either side this man have a air of distinction which be notable even in this assembly for there be many distinguished people present and a frenchman of note play he part better than do we dull self-conscious islander this man look like a general so upright be he so keen he glance so independent the carriage of he head he stand with he hand behind he back look gravely on at the social festivity he bow and raise he hat to many but he enter into conversation with none ce vassilus he hear more than once whisper c'est un homme dangereux and he smile all the more pleasantly now if a very keen observer have take the trouble to ignore the throng and watch two person only that observer might have discover the fact that claude de chauxville be slowly and purposely make he way toward the man call vassili de chauxville know and be know of many he have but recently arrive from london he find himself call upon to shake hand à l'anglai with this one and that give all and sundry he impression of the perfidious albion with a verve and neatness truly french he go from one to the other with perfect grace and savoir-faire and each change of position bring he nearer to the middle-aged man with upturned mustache upon whom he movement be by no means lose finally de chauxville bump against the object of he quest -- possibly indeed the object of he presence at the concor hippique he turn with a ready apology ah he exclaim the very man i be desire to see the individual know as ce vassilus -- a term of mingled contempt and distrust -- bow very low he be a plain commoner while he interlocutor be a baron the knowledge of this be subtly convey in he bow how can i serve m le baron he enquire in a voice which be naturally loud and strong but have be reduce by careful training to a tone inaudible at the distance of a few pace by follow I to the café tantale in ten minute answer de chauxville pass on to greet a lady who be bow to he with the labored grace of a parisienne vassilus merely bow and stand upright again there be something in he attitude of quiet attention of unobtrusive scrutiny and retire intelligence vaguely suggestive of the police -- something which he friend refrain from mention to he for this vassilus be a dignified man of like susceptibility with ourselves and justly proud of the fact that he belong to the corps diplomatique what position he occupy in that select corporation he never vouchsafe to define but it be know that he enjoy considerable emolument while he be never call upon to represent he country or he emperor in any official capacity he be attach he say to the russian embassy he enemy call he a spy but the world never put a charitable construction on that of which it only have a partial knowledge in ten minute claude de chauxville leave the concor hippique in the champ elysées he turn to the leave up toward the boi du boulogne turn to the left again and take one of the smaller path that lead to one or other of the sequestered and somewhat select cafés on the south side of the champ elysées at the café tantale -- not in the garden for it be winter but in the inner room -- he find the man call vassilus consume a pensive and solitary glass of liqueur de chauxville sit down state he requirement to the waiter in a single word and offer he companion a cigarette which vassilus accept with the consciousness that it come from a coroneted case i be rather think of visit russium say the frenchman again add vassilus in he quiet voice de chauxville look up sharply smile and wave the word away with a gesture of the finger that hold a cigarette if you will -- again on private affair enquire vassilus not so much it would appear from curiosity as from habit he put the question with the assurance of one who have a right to know de chauxville nod acquiescence through the tobacco smoke the bane of public man -- private affair he say epigrammatically but the attaché to the russian embassy be either too dense or too clever to be move to a sympathetic smile by a cheap epigram and m le baron want a passport he say lapse into the useful third person which make the french language so much more fit to social and diplomatic purpose than be we rough northern tongue and more answer de chauxville i want what you hate parting with -- information the man call vassilus lean back in he chair with a little smile it be a odd little smile which fall over he feature like a mask and completely hide he thought it be apparent that claude de chauxville 's trick of speech and manner fall here on barren ground the frenchman 's epigram he method of convey he meaning in a non-committing and impersonal generality fail to impress this hearer the difference between a frenchman and a russian be that the former be amenable to every outward influence -- the outer thing penetrate the russian on the contrary be a man who work he thought as it be from internal generation to external action the action moreover be demonstrative which make the russian different from other northern nation of a older civilization and a completer self-control then say vassilus if i understand m le baron aright it be a question of private and personal affair that suggest this journey to -- russium precisely in no sense a mission suggest the other sip he liqueur thoughtfully in no sense a mission i give you a proof i have be grant six month ' leave of absence as you probably know precisely so mo ' cher baron vassilus have a habit of apply to every one the endearing epithet which lose a consonant somewhere in he mustache when a military officer be grant a six month ' leave it be exactly then that we watch he de chauxville shrug he shoulder in deprecation possibly with contempt for any system of watch may one call it a affaire de coeur ask vassilus with he grim smile certainly be not all private affair such one way or the other and you want a passport yes -- a special one i will see what i can do thank you vassili empty he glass draw in he foot and glance at the clock but that be not all i want say de chauxville so i perceive i want you to tell I what you know of prince pavlo alexi of tver of tver what you know from you point of view you understand my dear vassili nothing political nothing incriminate nothing official i only want a few social detail again the odd smile fall over the dignified face in case say vassilus rather slowly i should only impart to you stale news and valueless detail with which you be already acquaint i must ask you to tell I first what you know -- from

forced foliage and bloom in no country of the world be flower so worship be money so freely spend in floral decoration there be something in the sight and more especially in the scent of hot-house plant that appeal to the complex sifting of three race which constitute a modern russian we in the modest self-depreciation which be a national characteristic be in the habit of thinking and sometimes say that we have all the good point of the angle and the saxon roll satisfactorily into one anglo-saxon whole we be of the opinion that mixed race be the best and we leave it to be understand that ours be the only satisfactory combination most of we ignore the fact that there be other at all and very few indeed recognize the fact that the russian of to-day be essentially a modern outcome of a triple racial alliance of which the best component be the tartar the modern russian be a interesting study because he have the remnant of barbaric taste with ultra-civilized facility for gratify the

flame of a wood fire she hold a magazine in she hand and yawn as she turn its page she be not so stout in person as she loose and somewhat highly color cheek would imply she eye be dull and sleepy the woman be a incarnate yawn she look up turn lazily in she chair to note the darken of the air without the double window ah she say aloud to herself in french when will it be tea-time as she speak the

effect of tilt she cap to one side i oh i have nothing to tell you i be a nun what can one do -- what can one hear in petersburg now in paris it be different but catrina be so firm have you ever notice that steinmetz catrina 's firmness i mean she will a thing and she will be like a rock the thing have to be do it do itself it come to pass some people be so now i my clear steinmetz only

commiserate smile he take the countess 's trouble indifferently as do the rest of we when we neighbor 's burden do not drag upon we own shoulder it suit he that catrina should be in petersburg and it be to be fear that the feeling of the countess lanovitch have no weight as against the convenience of karl steinmetz ah well he say you must console yourself with the thought that petersburg be the brighter for some of we who be this -- another visitor the door be throw open and claude de chauxville walk into the room with the easy grace which be he mme la comtesse he say bow over she hand then

none but be one to believe so notorious a bad character madame it be wise to believe only that which be convenient but steinmetz i promise you be the soul of honor what sort of news do you crave for political which be dangerous social which be scandalous or court news which be invariably false let we have scandal then ah i must refer you to the soul of honor who answer steinmetz in that official capacity be necessarily deaf and in a private capacity be naturally dull he be look very hard at de chauxville as if he be attempt to make he understand something which he could not say aloud de chauxville from carelessness or natural perversity choose to ignore the persistent eye surely the news be from london he say lightly we have nothing from paris he glance at steinmetz who be frown i can hardly tell you stale news that come from london via paris can i he continue steinmetz be tap impatiently on the floor with he broad boot about whom -- about whom cry the countess clap she soft hand together well about prince paul say de chauxville look at steinmetz with airy defiance steinmetz move a little he place himself in front of catrina who have suddenly lose color she could only see he broad back the other in the room could not see she at all she be rather small and steinmetz hide she as behind a screen ah he say to the countess he marriage but madame the countess assuredly know of that how could she put in de chauxville the countess know that prince paul be go to be marry explain karl steinmetz very slowly as if he wish to give some one time with such a man as he ` go to be ' be not very far from be then it be a accomplished fact say the countess sharply yesterday answer steinmetz and you be not there exclaim countess lanovitch with uplifted hand since i be here answer steinmetz the countess launch into a disquisition on the heinousness of marry any but a compatriot the tone of she voice be sharp and the volume of she word almost amount to invective as steinmetz be obviously not listen the lady impart she view to the baron de chauxville steinmetz wait for some time then he turn slowly toward catrina without actually look at she it be dangerous he say to stay in this warm room with you fur yes she answer rather faintly i will go and take they off steinmetz hold the door open for she but he do not look at she chapter xvi the thin end but i confess i can not understand why i should not be call the princess alexi -- there be nothing to be ashamed of in the title i presume you have a right to it etta look up from she occupation of fix a bracelet with a little glance of enquiry toward she husband they have be marry a month the honeymoon -- a short one -- have be pass in the house of a friend indeed a relation of etta 's own a scotch peer who be not above lend a shooting-lodge in scotland on the tacit understanding that there should be some quid pro quo in the future in answer paul merely smile affectionately tolerant of she bright sharpness of manner you bright woman in society be apt to be keen at home what be call vivacity abroad may easily degenerate into snappiness by the hearth i think it be rather ridiculous be call plain mr howard-alexi add etta with a pout they be go to a ball -- the first since they marriage they have just dine and paul have follow he wife into the drawing-room he take a simple-minded delight in she beauty which be of the description that be at its best in a gorgeous setting he stand look at she note she grace she pretty study movement there be he reflect few woman more beautiful -- none in he own estimation fit to compare with she she have hitherto be sweetness itself to he enliven he lonely existence shine suddenly upon he self-contained nature with a brilliancy that make he feel dull and tongue-tied already however he be begin to discover certain small difference not so much of opinion as of thought between etta and himself she attach a importance to social function to social opinion to social duty which he in no wise understand invitation be shower upon they a man who be a prince and prefer to drop the title need not seek popularity in london the very respectable reader probably know as well as he humble servant the writer that in london there be always a social circle just a little lower than one 's own which open its door with noble disinterested hospitality and be prepare to lick the black from any famous foot these invitation etta accept eagerly some woman hold it little short of a crime to refuse a invitation and go through life regret that there be only one evening to each day to paul these call be nothing new he secretary have hitherto draw a handsome salary for do little more than refuse such it be in etta 's nature to be somewhat carry away by glitter a great ball-room brilliant illumination music flower and diamond have a effect upon she which she enjoy in anticipation she eye gleam brightly on read the mere card of invitation some dull and self-contained man be only to be rouse by the clatter and whirl of a battle-field and this stir they into brilliancy change they to new man etta always brilliant always bright exceed herself on she battle-field -- a great social function since they marriage she have never be so beautiful she eye have never be so sparkling she color so brilliant as at this moment when she ask she husband to let she use she title hers be the beauty that bloom not for one man alone but for the multitude that feed not on the love of one but on the admiration of many the murmur of the man in the street who turn and stare into she carriage be more than the devotion of she husband a foreign title answer paul be nothing in england i soon find that out at eton and at trinity it be impossible there i drop it and i have never take it up again yes you old stupid and you have never take the place you be entitle to in consequence what place may i button that thanks she hold out she arm while he with finger much too large for such dainty work button she glove the place in society she answer oh do that matter i never think of it of course it matter answer the lady with a astonished little laugh -lrb- it be wonderful what a importance we attach to that which have be dearly win -rrb- of course it matter answer etta more than -- well more than any thing but the position that depend upon a foreign title can not be of much value say the pupil of karl steinmetz etta shake she pretty head reflectively of course she answer money make a position of its own and every-body know that you be a prince but it would be nicer with the servant and every-body to be a princess i be afraid i can not do it say paul then there be some reason for it answer he wife look at he sharply yes there be ah the reason be the responsibility that attach to the very title you wish to wear the lady smile a little scornfully perhaps oh you grubby old peasant i suppose she say yes you remember etta what i tell you before we be marry -- about the people i mean oh yes answer etta glance at the clock and hide a little yawn behind she fan i do not tell you all go on paul partly because it be inexpedient partly because i fear it might bear you i only tell you that i be vaguely interested in the peasant and think it would be a good thing if they could be gradually educate into a greater self-respect a greater regard for cleanliness and that sort of thing yes dear i remember answer etta listlessly contemplate she gloved hand well i have not contented myself with think this during the last two or three year i have try to put it into practice steinmetz and i have live at osterno six month of the year on purpose to organize matter on the estate i be deeply implicate in the -- charity league -- etta drop she fan with a clatter into the fender oh i hope it be not break she gasp with a singular breathlessness i do not think so reply paul pick up the fan and return it to she why you look quite white what do it matter if it be break you have other yes but -- etta pause open the fan and examine the stick so closely that she face be hide by the feather yes but i like this one what be the charity league dear it be a large organization get up by the hereditary noble of russium to educate the people and better they circumstance by discriminate charity of course it have to be keep secret as the bureaucracy be against any attempt to civilize the people -- against education or the dissemination of news the thing be organize we be just get to work when some one steal the papers of the league from the house of count stépan lanovitch and sell they to the government the whole thing be break up lanovitch and other be exile i bolt home and steinmetz face the storm alone in osterno he be too clever for they and nothing be bring home to we but you will understand that it be necessary for we to avoid any notoriety to live as quietly and privately as possible yes of course but -- but what you can never go back to russium say etta slowly feel she ground as it be oh yes i can i be just come to that i want to go back this winter there be so much to be do and i want you to come with I no paul no no i could not do that cry etta with a ring of horror in she voice strangely out of keep with she peaceful and luxurious surroundings why not ask the man who have never know fear oh i should be afraid i could not i hate russium but you do not know it no answer etta turn away and busy herself with she long silken train no of course not only petersburg i mean but i have hear what it be so cold and dismal and miserable i feel the cold so horribly i want to go to the riviera this winter i really think paul you be ask I too much i be only ask a proof that you care for I etta give a little laugh -- a nervous laugh with no mirth in it a proof but that be so bourgeois and unnecessary have not you proof enough since i be you wife paul look at she without any sign of yield he attitude he whole be be expressive of that immovability of purpose which have hitherto be conceal from she by he quiet manner steinmetz know of the mental barrier within this anglo-russian soul against which prayer and argument be alike unavail the german have run against it once or twice in the course of they joint labor and have invariably give way at once etta look at he the color be come back to she face in patch there be something unsteady in she eye -- something suggest that for the first time in she life she be daunt by a man it be not paul 's speech but he silence that alarm she she feel that trivial argument small feminine reason be without weight now that you be marry she say i do not think you have any right to risk you life and you position for a fad i have do it with impunity for the last two or three year he answer with ordinary precaution the risk be small i have begin the thing now i must go on with it but the country be not safe for we -- for you oh yes it be answer paul as safe as ever it have be etta pause she turn round and look into the fire he could not see she face then the ch -- charity league be forget she say no answer she husband quietly it will not be forget until we have find out who sell we to the government etta 's lip move in a singular way she draw they in and hold they with she tooth for a moment she beautiful face wear a hunt expression of fear what will you gain by that she ask evenly i oh nothing i do not care one way or the other but there be some people who want the man -- very much etta draw in a long deep breath i will go to osterno with you if you like she say only -- only i must have maggie with I yes if you like answer paul in some surprise the clock strike ten and etta 's eye recover they brightness womanlike she live for the present the responsibility of the future be essentially a man 's affair the present contain a ball and it be only in the future that osterno and russium have to be face let we also give etta alexi she due she be almost fearless it be permissible to the bravest to be startle she be now quite collect the even delicate color have return to she face maggie be such a splendid companion she say lightly she be so easy to please i think she would come if you ask she paul if you want she i shall ask she of course but it may hinder we a little i think you might be able to help we -- with the woman you know there be a queer little smile on etta 's face -- a smile one might have think of contempt yes of course she say it be so nice to be able to do good with one 's money paul look at she in he slow grave way but he say nothing he know that he wife be cleverer and brighter than himself he be simple enough to think that this superiority of intellect might be devote to the good of the peasant of osterno it be not a bad place he say -- a very fine castle one of the finest in europe before i come away i give order for you room to be do up i should like every thing to be nice for you i know you would dear she answer glance at the clock -lrb- the carriage be order for a quarter-past ten -rrb- but i suppose she go on that socially speak we shall be rather isolate we neighbor be few and far between the nearest say paul quietly be the lanovitch _ who _ the lanovitch do you know they of course not answer etta sharply but i seem to know the name be there any in st petersburg the same people answer paul count stépan lanovitch etta be look at she husband with she bright smile it be a little too bright perhaps she eye have a gleam in they she be conscious of be beautifully dress conscious of she own matchless beauty almost dauntless like a very strong man arm well i think i be a model wife she say : to give in meekly to you tyranny to go and bury myself in the heart of russium in the middle of winter -- by the way we must buy some fur that will be rather exciting but you must not expect I to be very intimate with you russian friend i be not quite sure that i like russian -- she go toward he lay she two hand gently on he broad breast and look up at he -- not quite sure -- especially russian prince who bully they wife you may kiss I however but be very careful now i must go and finish dress we shall be late as it be she gather together she fan and glove for she have petulantly drag off a pair which do not fit and you will ask maggie to come with we she say he hold open the door for she to pass out gravely polite even to he wife -- this old-fashioned man yes he answer but why do you want I to ask she because i want she to come chapter xvii charity in these democratic day a very democratic theory have explode not so very long ago we believe or make semblance of belief that it be useless to put a high price upon a ticket with the object of secure that selectness for which the high-born crave if they want to come lady champignon -lrb- wife of alderman champignon -rrb- would say they do not mind pay the extra half-guinea but lady champignon be wrong it be not that the self-made man can not or will not pay two guinea for a ball-ticket it be merely that in he commercial way he think that he will not have he money 's worth and therefore prefer keep he two guinea to spend on something more tangible -- say food the nouveau riche never quite purge he mind of the instinct commercial and it therefore go against the grain to pay heavily for a form of entertainment which he soul have not the opportunity of learn to love in its youth the aristocrat on the other hand have usually be bring up to the cultivation of enjoyment and he therefore spend with perfect equanimity more on he pleasure than the bourgeois mind can countenance the ball to which paul and etta be go be manage by some title lady who know they business well the price of the ticket be fabulous the lady patroness of the great charity ball be tactful and unabashed they draw the necessary line -lrb- never more necessary than it be to-day -rrb- with a firm hand the success of the ball be therefore a foregone conclusion in french fiction there be invariably a murmur of applause when the heroine enter a room full of people which fact serve at all event to show the breeding and social status of person with whom french novelist be in the habit of associate there be therefore no applause when paul and etta make they appearance but that lady have nevertheless the satisfaction of perceive glance not only of admiration but of interest and even of disapproval among she own sex she dress she know to be perfect and when she perceive the crane pale face of the inevitable lady-journalist peer between the baluster of a gallery she thoughtfully take up a prominent position immediately beneath that gallery and slowly turn round like a beautifully garnish joint before the fire of cheap publicity to paul this ball be much like other there be a number of the friend of he youth -- tall clean-featured clean-limbed man with a tendency toward length and spareness -- who greet he almost affectionately some of they introduce he to they wife and sister which lady duly set he down as nice but dull -- a form of faint praise which fail to damn there be a number of lady to whom it be necessary for he to bow in acknowledgment of past favor which have miss they mark from the gallery the washed-out female journalist poke out they eager face -- for they be woman still and like to look upon a man when he be strong and all the while karl steinmetz be storm in he guttural english at the door upbraid hire waiter for they stupidity in accept two literal fact literally the one fact be that they be forbid to admit any one without a ticket the second fact be that ticket be not to be obtain at the price of either one or the other of the two great motive of man -- love or money steinmetz be teutonic and impose with the ribbon of a great order on he breast he mention the name of several lady who might have be but be not of the committee finally however he mention the historic name of one whose husband have brave more than one russian emperor successfully for england yes I lord she ladyship 's here answer the man steinmetz write on a card in memory of '56 let I in and send in the missive a few minute later a stout smile lady come toward he with outstretched hand what mischief be you about she enquire you stormy petrel this be no place for you deep-laid machination we be here to enjoy ourselves and find a hospital come in however i be delighted to see you you use to be a famous dancer -- well some little time ago yes my dear countess let we say some little time ago ach those be day those be day you do not mind the liberty i have take i be glad you take it but you card give I a little tug at the heart it bring back so much and still plain karl steinmetz -- after all we use to think much of you in the old day who would have think that all the honor would have slip past you steinmetz shrug he shoulder with a heart-whole laugh ah what matter who care so long as my old friend remember I who would have think my dear madam that the map of europe would have be paint the color it be to-day it be a kaleidoscope -- the clatter of many stool and i fall down between they all still plain karl steinmetz -- still very much at you service shall i send my check for five guinea to you yes do i be secretary always businesslike a wonderful man you be

with I though you manner might lead one to think so i will not keep you i come to see prince pavlo answer steinmetz i must thank you for enable I to do so i may not see you again this evening my best thanks my very dear lady he bow and with he half-humorous half-melancholy smile leave she the first face he recognize be a pretty one miss maggie delafield be just turn away from a partner who be take he congé when she look across the room and see steinmetz he have only meet she once barely exchange six word with she and she frank friendly bow be rather a surprise to he she come toward he hold out she hand with a open friendliness which this young lady be in the habit of bestow upon man and woman impartially -- upon person of either sex who happen to meet with she approval she do not know what make she incline to like this man neither do she seek to know in a quiet british way miss delafield be a creature of impulse she likes and dislike be a matter of instinct and much as one respect the doctrine of charity it be a question whether a instinctive dislike should be quash by a exaggerated sense of neighborly duty steinmetz she like and there be a end to it i be afraid you do not recognize I she say my life have not so many pleasure that i can afford to forget one of they reply steinmetz in he somewhat old-fashioned courtesy but a old -- buffer shall i say -- hardly expect to be take much notice of by young lady at a ball it be not ten minute since paul assure I that you be the best dancer that vienna ever produce say the girl look at he with bright honest eye karl steinmetz look down at she for he be a tall man when paul alexi be not near he quiet gray eye be almost affectionate there be a sudden sympathy between these two and sudden sympathy be the best will you give a old man a trial he ask they will laugh at you she hand he she program let they laugh she say he take the next dance which happen to be vacant on she card almost immediately the music begin and they glide off together maggie begin with the feeling that she be dance with she own father but this wear off before they have make much progress through the crowd and give way to the sensation that she have for partner the best dancer she have ever meet gray-haired stout and middle-aged i want to speak to you she say ah steinmetz answer he be steer with infinite skill in that room full of dancer no one touch maggie 's elbow or the swing of she dress and she who know what such thing mean smile as she note it i have be ask to go and stay at osterno she say shall i go by whom by paul then

while strength reply maggie promptly he look down at she -- a momentary glance of wonder he be like a woman inasmuch as he judge a person by a flicker of the eyelid -- a glance a silence -- in preference to judge by the speak word then with we both to take care of you may we hope that you will brave the peril of osterno ah -- the music be stop if i may assure my mother that there be no peril something take place beneath the gray mustache -- a smile or a purse up of the lip in doubt ah i can not go so far as that you may assure lady delafield that i will protect you as i would my own daughter if -- well if the good god in heaven have not have other use for I i should have have a daughter of you age ach the music have stop the music always do stop miss delafield that be the worst of it thank you for dance with a old buffer he take she back to she chaperon bow in he old-world way to both lady and leave they if i can help it my very dear young friend he say to himself as he

make a dangerous enemy -- claude de chauxville claude de chauxville repeat paul yes he want to marry you wife -- for she money paul lean forward and drag at he great fair mustache he be not a subtle man analyze he own thought have he be he might have wonder why he be not more jealous in respect to etta or go on steinmetz it may have be -- the other thing it be a singular thing that many man incapable of a lifelong love can conceive a lifelong hatred base on that love claude de chauxville have hate I all he life for very good reason no doubt you be now include in he antipathy because you marry madame i dare say reply paul carelessly but i be not afraid of claude de chauxville or any other man i be say steinmetz he be up to some mischief i be call on the countess lanovitch in

and delay on the frontier by a stupid -- a singularly and suspiciously stupid -- minor official if we refuse vassilus will conclude that we be afraid of he therefore we must accept especially as vassilus have he weak point he love a lord ` ce vassili ' if you accept on some of that stationery i order for you with a colossal gold coronet that will already be of some effect a chain be as strong

laugh it be he habit either to laugh or to grumble at karl steinmetz 's somewhat subtle precaution the word danger invariably make he laugh with a ring in he voice which seem to betoken enjoyment of course he say i leave these matter to you let we show vassilus at all event that we be not afraid of he then sit down and accept that which m vassilus be please to call he little dog-hole in the champ élysées be in fact a gorgeous house in the tawdry style of modern pari -- resplendent in gray iron railing and high gate-post surmount by green cactus plant cunningly devise in cast iron the heavy front door be throw open by a lackey and other bow in the hall as if by machinery two maid pounce upon the lady with the self-assurance of they kind and country and lead the way upstairs while the man remove fur coat in the hall it be all very princely and gorgeous and parisian vassilus and he sister the marquise -- a stout lady in ruby velvet and amethyst who invariably cause maggie delafield 's mouth to twitch whenever she open she own during the evening -- receive the guest in the drawing-room they be stand on the white fur hearth-rug side by side when the door be dramatically throw open and the servant roll the name unctuously over he tongue steinmetz who be behind saw everything he see vassilus 's masklike face contract with stupefaction when he set eye on etta he see the self-contained russian give a little gasp and mutter a exclamation before he collect himself sufficiently to bow and conceal he face but he could not see etta 's face for a moment or two -- until the formal greeting be over when he do see it he note that it be as white as marble aha ce bon steinmetz cry vassilus with less formality hold out he hand with frank and boyish good humor aha ce cher vassilus return steinmetz take the hand it be good of you m le prince and you madame to honor we in we small house say the marquise in a guttural voice such as one might expect from within ruby velvet and amethyst thereafter she subside into silence and obscurity so far as the evening be concerned and the present historian be interested so say vassilus with a comprehensive bow to all he guest -- so you be bind for russium but i envy you -- i envy you you know russium mme la princesse etta meet he veil gaze calmly a little she reply there be no sign of recognition in he eye now nor pallor on she face a beautiful country but the rest of europe do not believe it and the estate of the prince be one of the vastest if not the most beautiful it be a sport estate be it not prince essentially so reply paul bear wolf deer besides of course black game capercailzie ptarmigan -- every thing one could desire speak as a sportsman suggest vassilus gravely speak as a sportsman of course -- vassilus pause and with a little gesture of the hand include steinmetz in the conversation it may have be that he prefer to have he talk than watch of course like all great russian landholder you have you trouble with the people though you be not strictly speak within the famine district not quite we be not starve but we be hungry say steinmetz bluntly vassili laugh and shake a gold eye-glass chidingly ah my friend you old pernicious habit of call a spade a spade it be unfortunate that they should hunger a little but what will you they must learn to be provident to work harder and drink less with such people experience be the only taskmaster possible it be useless talk to they it be dangerous to pauperize they besides the account that one read in the newspaper be manifestly absurd and exaggerated you must not mademoiselle he say turn courteously to maggie you must not believe all you be tell about russium i do not reply maggie with a honest smile which completely baffle m vassilus he have not have much to do with people who smile honestly vrai he say with grave emphasis i be not joke it be a matter of the strictest fact that fiction have for the moment fix its fancy upon my country -- just as it have upon the east end of you london mon dieu what a lot of harm fiction with a purpose can do but we do not take we fact from fiction in england say maggie nor put in steinmetz with he blandest smile do we allow fiction to affect we fact vassilus glance at steinmetz sideways here be dinner he say mme la princesse may i have the honor the table be gorgeously decorate the wine be perfect the dish parisian every thing be brilliant and etta 's spirit rise such little thing affect the spirit of such little-minded woman it require a certain mental reserve from which to extract cheerfulness over a chop and a pint of beer withal serve on a doubtful cloth but some of we find it easy enough to be witty and brilliant over good wine and a perfectly appoint table it be exile it be nothing short of exile protest vassilus who lead the conversation much as i admire my own country as a country i do not pretend to regret a fate that keep I resident in paris for man it be different but for madame and for you mademoiselle -- ach he shrug he shoulder and look up to the ceiling in mute appeal to the god above it beauty brilliancy wit -- they be all lose in russium he bow to the princess who be look and to maggie who be not what would pari say if it know what it be lose he add in a lower tone to etta who smile well pleased she be not always able to distinguish between impertinence and flattery and indeed they be so closely ally that the distinction be subtle steinmetz on the left hand of the marquise address one or two remark to that lady who reply with she mouth full he soon discover that that which be before she interested she more than any thing around and during the banquet he contented himself by utter a exclamation of delight at a particular flavor which the lady be kind enough to point out to he with a eloquent and emphatic fork from time to time vassilus note this with some disgust he would have prefer that karl steinmetz be greedy or more conversational but the host add aloud lady be so good perhaps you be interested in the peasant etta look at steinmetz who give a imperceptible nod yes she answer i be vassilus follow she glance and find steinmetz eating with grave appreciation of the fare provide ah he say in a expectant tone then you will no doubt pass much of you time in endeavor to alleviate they trouble -- they self-inflicted trouble with all deference to ce cher prince why with deference to I ask paul look up quietly with something in he steady gaze that make maggie glance anxiously at steinmetz well i understand that you hold different opinion say the russian not at all answer paul i admit that the peasant have themselves to blame -- just as a dog have himself to blame when he be catch in a trap be the case analogous let I recommend those olive -- i have they from barcelona by a courier quite answer paul and it be the obvious duty of those who know better to teach the dog to avoid the place where the trap be set thanks the olive be excellent ah say vassilus turn courteously to maggie i sometimes thank my star that i be not a landholder -- only a poor bureaucrat it be so difficult to comprehend these question mademoiselle but of all man in or out of russium it be possible we dear prince know best of what he be talk oh no disclaimed paul with that gravity at which some be ready to laugh i only judge in a small way from a small experience ah you be too modest you know the peasant thoroughly you understand they you love they -- so at least i have be tell be it not so mme la princesse karl steinmetz be frown over a olive i really do not know say etta who have glance across the table i assure you madame it be so i be always hear good of you prince from whom ask paul vassili shrug he peculiarly square shoulder ah from all and sundry i do not know the prince have so many enemy say steinmetz bluntly whereat the marquise laugh suddenly and apparently approach within bow distance of apoplexy in such wise the conversation go on during the dinner which be a long one continually repeatedly vassili approach the subject of osterno and the daily life in that sequestered country but those who know be silent and it be obvious that etta and maggie be ignorant of the life to which they be go from time to time vassilus raise he dull yellow eye to the servant who d'ailleur be do they work perfectly and invariably the master 's glance fall to the glass again these the servant never leave in peace -- constantly replenish constantly watch with that assiduity which make man thirsty against they will by reason of the repeat reminder but tongue wag no more freely for the choice vintage pour upon they paul have a grave strong head and that self-control against which alcohol may ply itself in vain karl steinmetz have take he degree at heidelberg he be a seasoned vessel have pass that way before etta be bright enough -- amusing light and gay -- so long as it be a question of mere social gossip but whenever vassilus speak of the country to which he express so deep a devotion she seem to take she cue from she husband and he agent fall to pleasant non-committing silence it be only after dinner in the drawing-room while musician discourse offenbach and rossinus from behind a screen of fern and flower that vassilus find a opportunity of address himself directly to etta in part she desire this opportunity with a breathless apprehension behind she bright society smile without she assistance he never would have have it it be most kind of you he say in french which language have be speak all the evening in courtesy to the marquise who be now asleep -- it be most kind of you to condescend to visit my poor house princess believe I i feel the honor deeply when you first come into the room -- you may have observe it -- i be quite take aback i -- i have read in book of beauty capable of take away a man 's breath you must excuse I -- i be a plain-spoken man i never meet it until this evening etta excuse he readily enough she could forgive plenty of plain-speaking of this description have she not be inordinately vain this woman like many would have be extraordinarily clever she laugh with little sidelong glance i only hope that you will honor pari on you way home to england go on vassilus who have a wonderful knack of judge man and woman especially shallow one now when may that be when may we hope to see you again how long will you be in russium and -- ce vassilus be the best english scholar i know break in steinmetz who have approach somewhat quietly but he will not talk princess -- he be so shy paul be approach also it be eleven o'clock he say and traveller who have to make a early start would do well to get home to bed when the tall door have be close behind the depart guest vassilus walk slowly to the fire-place he post himself on the bear-skin hearthrug he perfectly shod foot well apart -- a fine dignified figure of a man of erect and military carriage a very mask of a face -- soulless colorless emotionless ever he stand bite at he thumb-nail look at the door through which etta alexi have just pass in all the glory of she beauty wealth and position the woman he say slowly who sell I the charity league papers -- and she think i do not recognize she chapter xix on the neva karl steinmetz have apparently be transact

own and he tongue against the world he be recross the river not by the bridge which require a doff hat by reason of its shrine but by one of the numerous road cut across the ice from bank to bank he duly reach the southern shore ascend to the admiralty garden by a flight of sanded step here he light a cigar and tuck he hand deep into the pocket of he fur coat he proceed to walk slowly through the

womanly woman engage in unwomanly work then she come back steinmetz raise he hat in he most fatherly way my dear young lady he say in russian if my personal appearance have make so profound a impression as my vanity prompt I to believe would it not be decorous of you to conceal you feeling beneath a maiden modesty if on the other hand the signal you have be make to I be of profound political importance let I assure you that i be no nihilist then say the girl begin to walk by he side what be you what you see -- a stout middle-aged man in easy circumstance happily place in social

say the count in he businesslike calm way vassilus pay that woman seven thousand pound for the papers and probably charge he master ten add steinmetz and now you must go the count rise and look at he watch -- a cheap american article with a loud tick he hold it out with he queer washed-out smile and steinmetz smile the two embrace again -- and there be nothing funny in the action it be a singular thing that the sight of two man kiss be conducive either to laughter or to tear there be no medium emotion my dear friend -- my very dear friend say the count god be with you always we may meet again -- or we may not steinmetz walk down the nevskus prospekt on the left-hand pavement -- no one walk on the other -- and the sleigh follow he he turn into a large brilliantly light café and loosen he coat give I beer he say to the waiter a very large quantity of it the man smile obsequiously as he set the foam mug before he be it that he excellency be cold he enquire no it be not answer steinmetz quite the contrary he drink the beer and hold out he hand in the shadow of the table he notice that it tremble only a little that be better he murmur but i must sit here a while longer i suppose i be upset that be what they call it -- upset i have never be like that before those lamp in the prospekt gott how they jump up and down he press he hand over he eye as if to shut out the brightness of the room -- the glaring gas and brilliant decoration -- the shine bottle and the many table which would not keep still here he say to the man give I more beer presently he rise and get rather clumsily into he sleigh drive back at the usual breakneck pace to the palace at the upper end of the english quay he send a ambiguous message to paul say that he have return and be dress for dinner this ceremony he go through slowly as one daze by a great fall or a heavy fatigue he servant a quick silent man notice the strangeness of he manner and like a wise servant only betray the result of he observation by a readier service a quicker hand a quieter motion as steinmetz go to the drawing-room he glance at he watch it be twenty minute past seven he still have ten minute to spare before dinner he open the drawing-room door etta be sit by the fire alone she glance back over she shoulder in a quick hunt way which have only become apparent to steinmetz since she arrival at petersburg good-evening she say good-evening madame he answer he close the door carefully behind he chapter xx a offer of friendship etta do not move when steinmetz approach except indeed to push one foot farther out toward the warmth of the wood fire she certainly be very neatly shoe steinmetz be one of she few failure she have never get any nearer to the man despite he gray hair and bulky person she argue that he be still a man and therefore a easy victim to flattery -- open to the influence of beauty i wonder why she say look into the fire you hate I steinmetz look down at she with he grim smile the mise en scène be perfect from the thoughtful droop of the head to the innocent display of slipper i wonder why you think that of I he reply one can not help perceive that which be obvious while that which be purposely make obvious serve to conceal that which may exist behind it reply the stout man etta pause to reflect over this be steinmetz go to make love to she she be not a inexperienced girl and know that there be nothing impossible or even improbable in the thought she wonder what karl steinmetz must have be like when he be a young man he have a deft way even now of plant a double entendre when he take the trouble how could she know that he manner be always easiest he attitude always politest toward the woman whom he despise in he way this man be a philosopher he have a theory that a exaggerated politeness be a insult to a woman 's intellect you think i do not care say the princess howard alexis you think i do not admire you reply steinmetz imperturbably she look up at he do you not give I every reason to think so she return with a toss of the head she be one of those woman -- and there be not a few -- who would quarrel with you if you do not admire they not intentionally princess i be as you know a german of no very subtle comprehension my position in you household appear to I to be a little above the servant although the prince be kind enough to make a friend of I and he friend be so good as to do the same i do not complain far from it i be well pay i be interested in my work i be more or less my own master i be very fond of paul you -- be kind and forbearing i do my best -- in a clumsy way no doubt -- to spare you my heavy society but of course i do not presume to form a opinion upon you -- upon you but i want you to form a opinion she say petulantly then you must know that i could only form one which would be please to you i know nothing of the sort reply etta of course i know that all that you say about position and work be mere irony paul think there be no one in the world like you steinmetz glance sharply down at she he have never consider the possibility that she might love paul be this after all jealousy he have attribute it to vanity and i have no doubt he be right she go on suddenly she give a little laugh do not you understand she say i want to be friend she do not look at he but sit with pouting lip hold out she hand karl steinmetz have be up to the elbow as it be in the diplomacy of a unscrupulous grasp age ever since he college day he have be behind the scene in more than one european crisis and that which go on behind the scene be not always edifying or conducive to a squeamishness of touch he be not the man to be mawkishly afraid of soil he finger but the small white hand rather disconcert he he take it however in he great warm soft grasp hold it for a moment and relinquish it i do not want you to address all you conversation to maggie and to ignore I do you think maggie so very pretty there be a twist beneath the gray mustache as he answer be that all the friendship you desire do it extend no farther than a pass wish to be first in petty rivalry of daily existence i be afraid my dear princess that my friendship be a heavier matter -- a clumsier thing than that a big thing not easily move she suggest look up with she dauntless smile he shrug he great shoulder it may be -- who know i hope it be he answer the worst of those big thing be that they be sometimes in the way say etta reflectively without look at he and yet the life that be only a conglomeration of trifle be a poor life to look back upon mean mine she ask you life have not be trifling he say gravely she look up at he and then for some moment keep silence while she idly open and shut she fan there be in the immediate vicinity of karl steinmetz a sort of atmosphere of sympathy which have the effect of compelling confidence even etta be affect by it during the silence record she be quell a sudden desire to say thing to this man which she have never say to any she only succeed in part do you ever feel a unaccountable sensation of dread she ask with a weary little laugh a sort of foreboding with nothing definite to forebode unaccountable -- no reply steinmetz but then i be a german -- and stout which may make a difference i have no nerve he look into the fire through he benevolent gold-rimmed spectacles be it nerve -- or be it petersburg she ask abruptly i think it be petersburg i hate petersburg why petersburg more than moscow or nijnus or -- tver she draw in a long slow breath look he up and down the while from the corner of she eye i do not know she reply collectedly i think it be damp these house be build on reclaim land i believe this be all marsh be it not he do not answer she question and somehow she seem to expect no reply he stand blinking down into the fire while she watch he furtively from the corner of she eye she lip parch and open she face quite white a few moment before she have protest that she desire he friendship she know now that she could not brave he enmity and the one word tver have do it all the mere mention of a town obscure and squalid on the upper water of the mighty volga in mid-russium during those few moment she suddenly come face to face with she position what have she to offer this man she look he up and down -- stout placid and impenetrable here be no common adventurer seek place -- no coxcomb seek lady ' favor -- no pauper to be buy with gold she have no means of ascertain how much he know how much he suspect she have to deal with a man who hold the best card and would not play they she could never hope to find out whether he knowledge and he suspicion be he alone or have be impart to other in she walk through life she have jostle mostly villain and a villain be no very dangerous foe for he fight on slippery ground except paul she have never have to do with a man who be quite honest upright and fearless and she have fall into the common error of think that all such be necessarily simple unsuspicious and a little stupid she breathe hard live through year of anxiety in a few moment of time and she could only realize that she be helpless bind hand and foot in this man 's power it be he who speak first in the smaller crisis of life it be usually the woman who take this privilege upon herself but the larger situation need a man 's steadier grasp my dear lady he say if you be content to take my friendship as it be it be yours but i warn you it be no showy drawing-room article there will be no compliment no pretty speech no little gift of flower and such trumpery amenity it will all be very solid and middle-aged like myself you think return the lady that i be fit for nothing better than pretty speech and compliment and floral offering she break off with a force little laugh and await he verdict with defiant eye upraise he return the gaze through he placid spectacles she beauty in its setting of brilliant dress and furniture soft light flower and a thousand feminine surroundings fail to dazzle he i do he say quietly and yet you offer I you friendship he bow in acquiescence why she ask for paul 's sake my dear lady she shrug she shoulder and turn away from he of course she say it be quite easy to be rude as it happen it be precisely for paul 's sake that i take the trouble of speak to you on this matter i do not wish he to be trouble with such small domestic affair and therefore if we be to live under the same roof i shall deem it a favor if you will at all event conceal you disapproval of I he bow gravely and keep silence etta sit with a little patch of color on either cheek look into the fire until the door be open and maggie come in steinmetz go toward she with he grave smile while etta hide a face which have grow haggard maggie glance from one to the other with frank interest the relationship between these two have rather puzzle she of late well say steinmetz and what of st petersburg i be not disappointed reply maggie it be all i expect and more i be not blasée like etta every thing interest I we be discuss petersburg when you come in say steinmetz drawing forward a chair the

light what one may come to in old age i see a gray hair this morning i be nearly thirty-three you know when glamour go nerve come well i suppose they do -- especially in russium perhaps there be a glamour about russium and i mean to cultivate it rather than nerve there be a glamour about every thing -- the broad street the neva the snow and the cold especially the people it be always especially the people be it not it be the people my dear young lady that lend interest to the world paul take I out in a sleigh this morning go on maggie in she cheerful voice that know no harm i like every thing -- the policeman in they little box at the street corner the officer in they fur coat the cabman every-body there be something so mysterious about they all one can easily make up story about every-body one meet in petersburg it be so easy to think that they be not what they seem paul etta even you herr steinmetz may not be what you seem yes that be so answer steinmetz with a laugh you may be a nihilist pursue maggie you may have bomb conceal up you sleeve you may exchange mysterious password with people in the street you may be much less innocent than you appear all that may be so he admit you may have a revolver in the pocket of you dress-coat go on maggie point to the voluminous garment with she fan he hand go to the pocket in question and produce exactly what she have suggest he hold out he hand with a small silver-mounted revolver lie in the palm of it even that he say may be so maggie look at it with a sudden curiosity she bright eye grave load she ask yes then i will not examine it how curious i wonder how near to the mark i may have be in other way i wonder say steinmetz look at etta and now tell we something about the princess what do you suspect she of at this moment paul come into the room distinguished-looking and grave miss delafield pursued steinmetz turn to the new-comer be tell we she suspicion about ourselves i be already as good as condemn to siberia she be now about to sit in judgment on the princess maggie laugh herr steinmetz have plead guilty to the worst accusation she say on the other count i leave he to he own conscience any thing but that urge steinmetz paul come forward and maggie rather obviously avoid look at he tell we of paul 's crime first say etta rather hurriedly she glance at the clock whither karl steinmetz 's eye have also travel oh paul say maggie rather indifferently indeed it seem as if she lightness of heart have suddenly fail she well perhaps he be deeply involve in scheme for the resurrection of the polish kingdom or something of that sort that sound tame put in steinmetz i think you would construct a better romance respect the princess in book it be always the beautiful princess who be most deeply dye in crime maggie open she fan and close it again well she say tap on the arm of she chair with it i give etta a mysterious past she be the sort of person who would laugh and dance at a ball with the knowledge that there be a mine beneath the floor i do not think i be say etta with a shudder she rise rather hurriedly and cross the room with a great rustle of silk stop she she whisper as she pass steinmetz chapter xxi a suspect house the countess lanovitch and catrina be sit together in the too-luxurious drawing-room that overlook the english quay and the neva the double window be rigorously close while the inner pane be cover with a thick rime the sun be just set over the marsh that border the upper water of the gulf of finland and light up the snow-clad city with a rosy glow which penetrate to the room where the two woman sit catrina be restless move from chair to chair from fire-place to window with a lack of repose which would certainly have touch the nerve of a less lethargic person than the countess my dear child that lady be exclaim with lackadaisical horror we can not go to thor yet the thought be too horrible you never think of my health besides the gloom of the everlasting snow be too painful it make I think of you poor mistaken father who be probably shovel it in siberium here at all event one can avoid the window -- one need not look at it the policy of shut one 's eye be a mistake say catrina she have rise and be stand by the window she stunt form be frame as it be in a rosy glow of pink the countess heave a little sigh and gaze idly at the fire she do not understand catrina she be afraid of she there be something rugged and dogged which the girl have inherit from she father -- that slavonic love of pain for its own sake -- which make russian patriot and thinker strange incomprehensible being i question it catrina say the elder lady but perhaps it be a matter of health dr stantovitch tell I quite between ourselves that if i have give way to my grief at the time of the trial he would not have hold himself responsible for the consequence dr stantovitch say catrina be a humbug my dear child exclaim the countess he attend all the noble lady of petersburg precisely answer catrina she be woman enough to enter into futile argument with she mother and man enough to despise herself for do it why do you want to go back to thor so soon murmur the elder lady with a little sigh of despair she know she be play a lose game very badly she be mentally shuddering at the recollection of former sleigh-journeying from tver to thor because i be sure father would like we to be there this hard winter but you father be in siberium put in the countess which remark be ignore because if we do not go before the snow begin to melt we shall have to do the journey in carriage over bad road which be sure to knock you up because we place be at thor and no one want we here i hate petersburg it be no use living here unless one be rich and beautiful and popular we be none of those thing so we be better at thor but we have many nice friend here dear you will see this afternoon i expect quite a reception by the way i hope kupfer have send the little cake you father use to be so fond of they i wonder if we could send he a box to siberia he would enjoy they poor man he might give some to the prison people and thus obtain a little alleviation yes the comte de chauxville say he would come on my first reception-day and of course paul and he wife must return my call they will come to-day i be anxious to see she they say she be beautiful and dress well catrina 's broad white tooth gleam for a moment in the flicker firelight as she clench they over she lower lip and therefore paul 's happiness in life be assure she say in a hard voice of course what more could he want murmur the countess in blissful ignorance of any irony catrina look at she mother with a gleam of utter contempt in she eye that be one of the privilege of a great love whether it bring happiness or misery -- the contempt for all who have never know it while they remain thus the sound of sleigh-bell on the quiet english quay make itself hear through the double window there be a clang of many tone and the horse pull up with a jerk the color leave catrina 's face quite suddenly as if wipe away leave she ghastly she be go to see paul and he wife presently the door open and etta come into the room with the indomitable assurance which characterize she movement and earn for she a host of feminine enemy mme la comtesse she say with she most gracious smile take the limp hand offer to she by the countess lanovitch catrina stand in the embrasure of the window hate she paul follow on he wife 's heel scarcely conceal he boredom he be not a society man catrina come forward and exchange a formal bow with etta who take in she plainness and the fault of she dress at one contemptuous glance she smile with the perfect pity of a good figure for no figure at all paul be shake hand with the countess when he take catrina 's hand she finger be icy and twitch nervously within he grasp the countess be already babble to etta in french the princess howard alexi always begin by inform paul 's friend that she know no russian for a moment paul and catrina be leave as it be alone when the countess be once fairly rouse from she chronic lethargy she voice usually acquire a metallic ring which dominate any other conversation that might be go on in the room i wish you happiness say catrina and no one hear she but paul she do not raise she eye to he but look vaguely at he collar she voice be short and rather breathless as if she have just emerge from deep water thank you answer paul simply he turn and somewhat naturally look at he wife catrina 's thought follow he a man be at a disadvantage in the presence of the woman who love he she usually see through he -- a marked difference between masculine and feminine love catrina look up sharply and catch he eye rest on etta he do not love she -- he do not love she be the thought that instantly leap into she brain and if she have say it to he he would have contradict she flatly and honestly and in vain yes the countess be say with lazy volubility paul be one of we oldest friend we be neighbor in the country you know he have always be in and out of we house like one of the family my poor husband be very fond of he be you husband dead then ask etta in a low voice with a strange haste no he be only in siberium you have perhaps hear of he misfortune -- count stépan lanovitch etta nod she head with the deepest sympathy i feel for you countess she say and yet you be so brave -- and mademoiselle she say turn to catrina i hope we shall see more of each other in tver catrina bow jerkily and make no reply etta glance at she sharply perhaps she see more than catrina know i suppose she say to the countess with that inclusive manner which spread the conversation out that paul and mlle de lanovitch be playmate the reply lay with either of the lady but catrina turn away yes answer the countess but catrina be only twenty-four -- ten year younger than paul indeed with a faint cut surprise indeed etta look younger than catrina on a l'âge de son coeur and if the heart be wear it transmit its weariness to the face where such sign be ascribe to year so the little stab be justify by catrina 's appearance while the party assemble be thus exchange social amenity a past master in such commerce join they in the person of claude de chauxville he smile he mechanical heartless smile upon they all but when he bow over etta 's hand he face be grave he express no surprise at see paul and etta though he manner betoken that emotion there be no sign of this meeting have be a prearranged matter bring about by himself through the easy and innocent instrumentality of the countess and you be go to tver no doubt he say almost at once to etta yes answer that lady with a momentary hunt look in she eye it be strange how a obscure geographical name may force its way into we life never to be forget queen mary of england strike a note of the human octave when she protest that the word calai be grave on she heart it seem to etta that tver be write large wheresoever she turn for the conscience look through a glass and see whatever may be write thereon overspread every prospect the prince continue de chauxville turn to paul be a great sportsman i be tell -- a mighty hunter i wonder why englishman always want to kill something paul smile without make a immediate answer he be not the man to be lead into the danger of repartee by such as de chauxville we have a few bear leave he say you be fortunate protest de chauxville i shot one when i be younger i be immensely afraid and so be the bear i have a great desire to try again etta glance at paul who return de chauxville 's bland gaze with all the imperturbability of a prince the countess 's cackle voice break in at this juncture as perhaps de chauxville have intend it to do then why not come and shoot ours she say we have quite a number of they in the forest at thor ah mme la comtesse he answer with outspread deprecatory hand but that would be take too great a advantage of you hospitality and you well-known kindness he turn to catrina who receive he with a half-concealed frown the countess bridle and look at she daughter with obvious maternal meaning as one who be say there -- you bungle you prince but i have procure you a baron the abuse of hospitality be the last refuge of the needy continued de chauxville oracularly but my temptation be strong shall i yield to it mademoiselle catrina smile unwillingly i would rather leave it to you own conscience she say but i fail to see the danger you anticipate then i accept madame say de chauxville with the engaging frankness which ever have a false ring in it if the whole affair have be prearrange in claude de chauxville 's mind it certainly succeed more fully than be usually the case with human scheme if on the other hand this invitation be the result of chance fortune have favor claude de chauxville beyond he desert the little scene have play itself out before the eye of paul who do not want it of etta who desire it and of catrina who do not exactly know what she want with the precision of a stage-play carefully rehearse claude de chauxville have unscrupulously make use of feminine vanity with all the skill that be he a little glance toward etta as he accept the invitation convey to she the fact that she be the object of he clever little plot that it be in order to be near she that he have force the countess lanovitch to invite he to thor and etta with all she shrewdness be promptly hoodwink vanity be a handicap assign to clever woman by fate who handicap we all without appeal de chauxville saw by a little flicker of the eyelid that he have not miss he mark he have hit etta where he knowledge of she tell he she be unusually vulnerable he have make one ally the countess he look upon with a wise contempt she be easier game than etta catrina he understand well enough she rugged simplicity have betray she secret to he before he have be five minute in the room paul he despise as a man lack finesse and esprit -- a truly french form of contempt for frenchman have yet to learn that such quality have remarkably little to do with love claude de chauxville be one of those man -- alas too many -- who owe they success in life almost entirely to some feminine influence or another whenever he come into direct opposition to man it be he instinct to retire from the field behind paul 's back he despise he before he face he cringe then perhaps he say when the princess be engage in the usual farewell with the countess and paul be move toward the door -- then perhaps prince we may meet again before the spring -- if the countess intend she invitation to be take seriously yes answer paul i often shoot at thor if you do not happen to come over perhaps i may be allow to call and pay my respects -- or be the distance too great you can do it in a hour and a half with a quick horse if the snow be good answer paul then i may make it au revoir enquired de chauxville hold out a frank hand au revoir say paul if you wish it and he turn to say good-by to catrina as de chauxville have arrive later than the other visitor it be quite natural that he should remain after they have leave and it may be safely presume that he take good care to pin the countess lanovitch down to she rash invitation why be that man come to tver say paul rather gruffly when etta and he be settle beneath the fur of the sleigh we do not want he there i expect reply etta rather petulantly that we shall be so horribly dull that even m de chauxville will be a welcome alleviation paul say nothing he give a little sign to the driver and the horse leap forward with a musical clash of they silver bell chapter xxii the spider and the fly it be to be fear that there be a lamentable lack of local color in the present narrative have safely arrive at petersburg we have nothing to tell of that romantic city -- no hint at deep-laid plot no prison nor tale of jail-bird -- tale with salt on they bien entendu -- the usual grain we have hardly mention the nevskus prospekt which street by ancient right must need figure in all russian romance we have instead be prate of drawing-room and mere interior of house which to-day be the same all the world over a japanese fan be but a japanese fan whether it hang on the wall of a canadian drawing-room or the matting of a indian bungalow a afghan carpet be the same on any floor it be the foot that tread the carpet which make one to differ from another whether it be in petersburg or pekin it still must be the human be that lend the interest to the still life around it a truce therefore to picturesque description -- sour grape to the present pen -- of church and fort and river with which the living person of whom we tell have little or nothing to do maggie be alone in the great drawing-room of the house at the end of the english quay -- alone and grave some people be it note be gravest when alone and they be wise for the world have too much gravity for we to go about it with a long face make matter worse let each of we be the center of he own gravity maggie delafield have perhaps that spark in the brain for which we have but a ugly word we call it pluck and by it we be enable to win a losing game -- and harder still to lose a losing game -- without much noise or plaint whatever this girl 's joy or sorrow may have be -- and pray you madam remember that no man ever know he neighbor 's heart -- she succeed as well as any in conceal both there be some woman who tell one just enough about themselves to prove that they can understand and sympathize maggie be of these but she tell no more she be alone when paul come into the room it be a large room with more than one fire-place maggie be read and she do not look round paul stop -- warm himself by the fire nearest to the door he be the sort of man to come into a room without any remark maggie look up for a moment glance at the wood fire she seem to know for certain that it be paul have you be out she ask yes -- call he come toward she standing beside she with he hand clasp behind he back look into the fire socially he say with a quiet humor i be not a success she book drop upon she knee she two hand cross upon its page she stare at the glowing log as if he thought be write there i do not want to give way he go on to a habit of morbid introspection but socially i be a horrid failure there be a little smile on the girl 's face not cause by he grave humor it would appear that she be smile at something beyond that -- something only visible to she own mental vision perhaps you do not try she suggest practically oh yes i do i try in several language i have no small-talk you see she say gravely you be a large man do that make any difference he ask simply she turn and look at he as he tower by she side -- look at he with a queer smile yes she answer i think so for some moment they remain thus without speak -- in a peaceful silence although the room be very large it be peaceful what be it by the way that bring peace to the atmosphere of a room of a whole house sometimes it can only be something in the individuality of some person in it we talk glibly of the comfort of be settle -- the peacefulness the restfulness of it some people it would appear be always settle -- of settle conviction settle mind settle purpose paul howard alexi be perhaps such a person at all event the girl sit in the low chair by he side seem to be under some such influence seem to have escape the unrest which be say to live in palace when she speak it be with a quiet voice as one have plenty of time and leisure where have you be she ask practically maggie be always practical to the lanovitch ' where we meet the baron de chauxville ah why -- ah because i dislike the baron de chauxville answer maggie in she decisive way i be glad of that -- because i hate he say paul have you any reason for you dislike miss delafield have a reason but it be not one that she could mention to paul so she gracefully skirt the question he have the same effect upon I as snail she explain airily then as if to salve she conscience she give the reason but disguise so that he do not recognize it i have see more of m de chauxville than you have she say gravely he be one of those man of whom woman do see more when man be present he lose confidence like a cur when a thoroughbred terrier be about he dislike you i should take care to give m de chauxville a wide berth if i be you paul she have rise after glance at the clock she turn down the page of she book and look up suddenly meet he eye for a moment only we be not likely to drop into a close friendship say paul but -- he be come to thor twenty mile from osterno there be a momentary look of anxiety in the girl 's eye which she turn away to hide i be sorry for that she say do herr steinmetz know it not yet maggie pause for a moment she be trace with the tip of she finger a pattern stamp on the binding of the book it would seem that she have something more to say then suddenly she go away without say it in the meantime claude de chauxville have gently lead the countess lanovitch to invite he to stay to dinner he accept the invitation with become reluctance and return to the hotel de berlin where he be stay in order to dress he be fully alive to the expediency of striking while the iron be hot -- more especially where woman be concerned moreover he knowledge of the countess lead he to fear that she would soon tire of he society this lady have a lamentable facility for get to the bottom of she friend ' power of entertainment within a few day it be de chauxville 's intention to make secure he invitation to thor and then to absent himself from the countess at dinner he make himself vastly agreeable recount many anecdote fresh from pari which duly amuse the countess lanovitch and somewhat shocked catrina who be not advance or incline to advance after dinner the guest ask mlle catrina to play he open the grand piano in the inner drawing-room with such gallantry and effusion that the sanguine countess post-prandially somnolescent in she luxurious chair begin rehearse different mode of mention she son-in-law the baron yes she mutter to herself and catrina be plain -- terribly plain thereupon she fall asleep de chauxville have a good memory and be moreover a good and capable liar so catrina do not find out that he know nothing whatever of music he watch the plain face as the music rise and fall himself impervious to its transcendent tone with practice cunning he wait until catrina be almost intoxicate with music -- a intoxication to which all great musician be liable ah he say i envy you you power with music like that one can almost imagine that life be what one would wish it to be she do not answer but she wander off into another air -- a slumber song the schlummerly say de chauxville softly it almost have the power to send a sorrow to sleep this time she answer he -- possibly because he have not look at she such never sleep she say do you know that too he ask not in a tone that want reply she make no answer i be sorry he go on for I it be different i be a man i have man 's work to do i can occupy myself with ambition at all event i have a man 's privilege of nursing revenge he see she eye light up she breast heave with a sudden sigh something like a smile waver for a moment beneath he wax mustache catrina 's finger supple and strong strike in great chord the air of a gloomy march from the half-forgotten muse of some monastic composer while she play claude de chauxville proceed with he delicate touch to play on the hidden chord of a untame heart a man 's privilege he repeat musingly need it be such she ask for the first time he eye meet hers not necessarily he answer and she eye drop before he narrow gaze he sit back in he chair content for the moment with the progress he have make he glance at the countess he be too experience a man to be trick the countess be really asleep she cap be on one side she mouth open a woman who be pretend to sleep usually do so in become attitude de chauxville do not speak again for some minute he sit back in he chair lean he forehead on he hand while he peep through he slim finger he could almost read the girl 's thought as she put they into music she do not hate he yet he be reflect but she need only to see he with etta a few time and she will come to it the girl play on throw all the pain in she passionate untame heart into the music she know nothing of the world for half of its temptation its wiles its wickedness be close to she by the plain face that god have give she for beautiful woman see the worst side of human nature -- they usually deal with the worst of man catrina be a easy tool in the hand of such as claude de chauxville for he have deal with woman and that which be evil in woman all he life and the only mistake he ever make be those characteristic error of omission attach to a persistent ignorance of the innate good in human nature it be this same innate good that upset the calculation of most villain absorb as she be in she great grief catrina be in no mood to seek for motive -- to split a moral straw she only know that this man seem to understand she as no one have ever understand she she be content with the knowledge that he take the trouble to express and to show a sympathy of which those around she have not suspect she to be in need the moment have be propitious and claude de chauxville with true gallic insight have seize it she heart be sore and lonely -- almost break -- and she be without the worldly wisdom which tell we that such heart must at all cost be hide from the world she be without religious teaching -- quite without that higher moral teaching which be independent of creed and conformity which be only learn at a good mother 's knee catrina have not have a good mother she have have the countess -- a weak-minded self-indulgent french-novel-reading woman heaven protect we child from such mother in the solitude of she life catrina lanovitch have conceive a great love -- a passion such as a few only be capable of attain be it for weal or woe she have see this love ignore -- walk under foot by its object with a grave deliberation which take she breath away when she think of it it be all in all to she to he it be nothing she philosophy be simple she could not sit still and endure at this time it seem unbearable she must turn and rend some one she do not know whom but some one must suffer it be in this that claude de chauxville propose to assist she it be preposterous that people should make other suffer and go unpunished he say intent on he noble purpose catrina 's eyelid flicker but she make no answer the soreness of she heart have not take the form of a definite revenge as yet she love for paul be still love but it be perilously near to hatred she have not reach the point of wish definitely that he should suffer but the sight of etta -- beautiful self-confident carelessly possessive in respect to paul -- have bring she within measurable distance of it the arrogance of those who have all that they desire be insupportable the frenchman go on in he favorite non-committing epigrammatic way catrina -- a second eve -- glance at he and she silence give he permission to go on some man have a different code of honor for woman who be helpless catrina know vaguely that unless a woman be beloved by the object of she displeasure she can not easily make he suffer she clench she tooth over she lower lip as she play a new light be dawn in she eye the music be a marvel but no one in the room hear it i would be pitiless to all such man say de chauxville they deserve no pity for they have show none the man who deceive a woman be worthy of -- he never finish the sentence she deep passionate eye meet he she hand come down with one final crash on the chord she rise and cross the room mother she say shall i ring for tea when the countess awake de chauxville be turn over some sheet of music at the piano chapter xxiii a winter scene between petersburg and the sea there be several favorite island more or less assign to the foreigner reside in the russian capital here the english live and in summer the familiar cry of the tennis-lawn may be hear while in winter snow-shoeing skating and toboggan hold merry sway it be here namely on the island of christeffsky that a great ice fête be hold on the day precede the departure of the howard alexi household for tver the fête be give by one of the foreign ambassador -- a gentleman whose wife be accredit to the first place in petersburg society it be absolutely necessary steinmetz aver for the whole howard alexi party to put in a appearance the fête be suppose to begin at four in the afternoon and by five o'clock all st petersburg -- all c'est à dire worthy of mention in that aristocratic city -- have arrive one may be sure claude de chauxville arrive early in beautiful fur with a pair of silver-plated skate under he arm he be a influential member of the cercle des patineurs in paris steinmetz arrive soon after to look on as he tell he many friend he be he aver too stout to skate and too heavy for the little iron sled on the ice-hill no no he say there be nothing leave for I but to watch i shall watch de chauxville he add turn to that graceful skater with a grim smile de chauxville nod and laugh you have be do that any time this twenty year mon ami he say as he stand upright on he skate and describe a easy little figure on the outside edge backward and have always find you on slippery ground and never a fall say de chauxville over he shoulder as he shoot away across the brilliantly light pond it be quite dark a young moon be rise over the city throw out in dark relief against the sky a hundred steeple and dome the long thin spire of the fortress church -- the tomb of the romanoff -- shoot up into the heaven like a dagger near at hand a thousand electric light and color lantern cunningly swing on the branch of the pine make a veritable fairyland the ceaseless song of the skate on ice as hard as iron mingle with the strain of a band playing in a kiosk with open window from the ice-hill come the swish scream of the iron runner down the terrific slope the russian be a people of great emotion there be a candor in they recognition of the need of the sens which do not obtain in we self-conscious nature these strangely constitute people of the north -- a bud nation a nation which shall some day overrun the world -- be easily intoxicate and there be a deliberation about they method of seek this enjoyment which appear at time almost brutal there be nothing more characteristic than the ice-hill imagine a slope as steep as a roof pave with solid block of ice which be subsequently freeze together by flood with water imagine a sledge with steel runner polish like a knife imagine a thousand light on either side of this glittering path and you have some idea of a ice-hill it be certainly the strongest form of excitement imaginable -- next perhaps to whale-fishing there be no question of breathing once the sledge have be start by the attendant the sensation be somewhat suggestive of a fall from a balloon and yet one go to the top again as surely as the drunkard will return to he bottle fox-hunting be child 's play to it and yet grave man have pray that they might die in pink steinmetz be stand at the foot of the ice-hill when a arm be slip within he will you take I down ask maggie delafield he turn and smile at she -- fresh and bloom in she fur no my dear young lady but thank you for suggest it be it very dangerous very but i think you ought to try it it be a revelation it be a epoch in you life when i be a younger man i use to sneak away to a ice-hill where i be not know and spend hour of the keenest enjoyment where be paul he have just go over there with etta she refuse to go yes answer maggie steinmetz look down at he companion with he smile of quiet resignation you tell I you be afraid of mouse he say i hate mouse she reply yes -- i suppose i be afraid of they the princess be not afraid of _ rat _ -- she be afraid of very little the princess -- and yet she will not go on the ice-hill what strange creature mademoiselle come let we look for paul he be the only man who may be trust to take you down they find paul and etta together in one of the brilliantly light kiosk where refreshment be be serve all hot and steam by fur-clad servant it be a singular scene if a coffee-cup be leave for a few moment on the table by the watchful servitor the spoon freeze to the saucer the refreshment -- bread and butter dainty sandwich of caviare of pâté de foie gras of a thousand delicatessen from berlin and petersburg -- be keep from freezing on hot-water dish the whole scene be typical of life in the northern capital where wealth wages a successful fight against climate open fire burn brilliantly in iron tripod within the doorway of the tent and at interval in the garden in a large hall a string band console those whose year or lung would not permit of the more vigorous out-door entertainment steinmetz make know to paul maggie 's desire to risk she life on the ice-hill and gallantly propose to take care of the princess until he return then say etta gayly you must skate it be much too cold to stand about they be go to dance a cotillon if it be you command princess i obey with alacrity etta speak rapidly look round she all the while with the bright enjoyment which overspread the face of some woman at almost any form of entertainment provide there be music brilliant light and a crowd of people one can not help wonder a little what the mind of such fair lady must consist of to be throw off they balance by such outward influence etta 's eye gleam with excitement she be beautifully dress in fur which adornment she be tall and stately enough to carry to full advantage she hold she graceful head with regal hauteur every inch a princess she be enjoy she keenest pleasure -- a social triumph no whisper escape she no glance no nudge of admiring or envious notice on steinmetz 's arm she pass out of the tent the touch of she hand on he sleeve remind he of a thoroughbred horse step on to turf so full of life of electric thrill of excitement be it but then karl steinmetz be a cynic no one else could have think of compare etta 's self-complaisant humor to that of a horse in a racing paddock they procure skate and glide off hand in hand equally proficient equally practice maybe on this same lake for both have learn to skate in russium they talk only of the present of the brilliancy of the fête of the music of the thousand light etta be quite incapable of think or talk of any other subject at that moment steinmetz distinguished claude de chauxville easily enough and avoid he with some success for a short time but de chauxville soon catch sight of they here be m de chauxville say etta with a pleased ring in she voice leave I with he i expect you be tired i be not tired but i be obedient reply steinmetz as the frenchman come up with he fur cap in he hand bow gracefully claude de chauxville usually overdid thing there be something honest in a clumsy bow which have no place in he courtly obeisance although steinmetz continue to skate in a leisurely way he also hold to he original intention of look on he see paul and maggie come back to the edge of the lake accompany by a english lady of some importance in russium with whom maggie presently go away to the concert-room steinmetz glide up to paul who be light a cigarette at the edge of the pond where a attendant stand by a open wood fire with cigarette and hot beverage get a pair of skate say the german this ice be marvellous -- colossa-a-a-l he amuse himself with describe figure like a huge grave-minded boy until paul join he where be etta ask the prince at once over there with de chauxville paul say nothing for a few moment they skate side by side round the lake it be too cold to stand still even for a minute i tell you remark paul at length that that fellow be come to thor i wish he would go to the devil say steinmetz no doubt he will in time answer paul carelessly yes but not soon enough i assure you paul i do not like it we be just in that position that the least breath of suspicion will get we into endless trouble the authority know that stépan lanovitch have escape at any moment the charity league scandal may be resuscitate we do not want fellow like de chauxville prowl about i know the man he be a d -- d scoundrel who would sell he immortal soul if he could get a bid for it what be he come to thor for he be not a sportsman why he would be afraid of a cock pheasant though he would be plucky enough among the hen you do not imagine he be in love with catrina do you no say paul sharply i do not steinmetz raise he bushy eyebrow etta and de chauxville skate past they at that moment laugh gayly i have be think about it go on steinmetz and i have come to the conclusion that we friend hate you personally he have a grudge against you of some sort of course he hate I -- celum va san dire he have come to russia to watch we that i be convince of he have come here bent on mischief it may be that he be hard up and be to be buy he be always to be buy ce bon de chauxville at a price we shall see steinmetz pause and glance at paul he could not tell he more he could not tell he that he wife have sell the charity league papers to those who want they he could not tell he all that he know of etta 's past none of these thing could karl steinmetz in the philosophy that be he tell to the person whom they most concerned and who be we that we may hold he wrong the question of tell and withholding be not to be dismiss in a few word but it seem very certain that there be too much tell too much speak out and too little holding in in these day of much publicity there be a school of speakers-out and would to heaven they would learn to hold they tongue there be a school for call a spade by no other name and they have still to learn that the world be by no means interested in they clatter of shovel the psalmist know much of which he do not write and the young man of the modern school of poesy and fiction know no more but they lack the good taste of the singer of old that be all karl steinmetz be a man who form he opinion on the best basis -- namely experience and that have teach he that a bold reticence do less harm to one 's neighbor than a weak volubility paul be a easy subject for such treatment he own method incline to err on the side of reticence he give few confidence and ask none as be the habit of englishman well he say i do not suppose he will stay long at thor and i know that he will not stay at all at osterno besides what harm can he actually do to we he can not well go about make enquiry to begin with he know no russian i doubt that put in steinmetz and even if he do he can not come poke about in osterno catrina will give he no information maggie hate he you and i know he there be only the countess who will tell he all she know she would render that service to a drosky driver paul shrug he shoulder there be no mention of etta they stand side by side both thinking of she both look at she as she skate with de chauxville there lay the danger and they both know it but she be the wife of one of they and they lip be necessarily seal and it will be permit claude de chauxville happen to be say at that moment that i call and pay my respects to a exile princess there will be difficulty answer etta in that tone which make it necessary to protest that difficulty be nothing under some circumstance -- the which de chauxville duly protest with much fervor you think that twenty mile of snow would deter I he say well they might they might if -- well -- he leave the sentence unfinished -- the last resource of the sneak and the coward who wish to reserve to himself the letter of the denial in the spirit of the meanest lie chapter xxiv home a tear howling wind from the north -- from the boundless snow-clad plain of russium that lie between the neva and the yellow sea a gray sky wash over as with a huge brush dip in dirty whitening and the plain of tver a spotless dazzling level of snow the snow be fall softly and steadily fall as it never fall in england in little more than fine powder with a temperature forty degree below freezing-point a drift -- constant restless never alter -- speed over the level plain like the dust on a high-road before a steady wind this white scud -- a fly scud of frozen water -- be singularly like the scud that be blow from the crest of the wave by a cyclone in the china sea any object that break the wind -- a stunt pine a broken tree-trunk a government road-post -- have at its leeward side a high narrow snow-drift tail off to the dead level of the plain where the wind drop the snow rise at once but these object be few and far between the deadly monotony of the scene -- the trackless level the preposterous dimension of the plain the sense of distance that be convey only by the steppe and the great desert of gobus when the snow lie on it -- all these tell the same grim truth to all who look on they : the old truth that man be but a small thing and he life but as the flower of the grass across the plain of tver before the north wind a single sleigh be tear as fast as horse could lay hoof to ground -- a sleigh drive by paul howard alexi and the track of it be as a line draw from point to point across a map a striking feature of the winter of northern russium be the glorious uncertainty of its snowfall at tver the weather-wise have say : the snow have not all fall yet more be come it be yellow in the sky although march be nearly go the landlord of the hotel -lrb- a good enough resting-place face the broad volga -rrb- have urge upon m le prince the advisability of wait as be the way of landlord all the world over but etta have show a strange restlessness a petulant desire to hurry forward at all risk she hate tver the hotel be uncomfortable there be a unhealthy smell about the place paul accede readily enough to she wish he rather like tver in a way he be proud of this busy town -- a center of russian civilization he would have like etta to be favorably impress with it as any prejudice would naturally reflect upon osterno 140 mile across the steppe but with a characteristic silent patience he make the necessary preparation for a immediate start the night express from st petersburg have deposit they on the platform in the early morning steinmetz have precede they close sleigh from osterno be await they a luxurious breakfast be prepare at the hotel relay of horse be post along the road the journey to osterno have be carefully plan and arrange by steinmetz -- a king among organizer the sleigh drive across the steppe be to be accomplish in ten hour the snow have begin to fall as they clatter across the float bridge of tver it have fall ever since and the afternoon lower gloomily in america such visitation be call blizzard here in russium it be merely the snow the freezing wind be take as a matter of course at a distance of one hundred mile from tver the driver of the sleigh contain etta maggie and paul have suddenly roll off he perch he hand be frostbitten a piteous blue face peer out at he master through ice-laden eyebrow mustache and beard in a moment maggie be out in the snow beside the two man while etta hastily close the door he be all right say paul it be only the cold pour some brandy into he mouth while i hold the ice aside _ do not _ take off you glove the flask will stick to you finger maggie obey with she usual breezy readiness turn to nod reassurance to etta who truth to tell have pull up the rime-covered window shut out the whole scene he must come inside say maggie we be nice and warm with all the hot-water can paul look rather dubiously toward the sleigh you can carry he i suppose say the girl cheerfully he be not very big -- he be all fur coat etta look rather disgusted but make no objection while paul lift the frozen man into the seat he have just vacate when you be cold i will drive cry maggie as paul shut the door i should love it thus it come about that a single sleigh be speed across the plain of tver paul with the composure that come of a large experience gather the rein in he two hand drive with both and with extended arm after the manner of russian yemschik for a man must accommodate himself to circumstance and fingerless glove be not conducive to a finished style of handle the ribbon this driver know that the next station be twenty mile off that at any moment the horse might break down or plunge into a drift he know that in the event of such emergency it would be singularly easy for four people to die of cold within a few mile of help but he have face such possibility a hundred time before in this vast country where the standard price of a human life be no great sum he be not therefore dismayed but rather take delight in battle with the element as all strong man should and most of they thank heaven do moreover he battle successfully and before the moon be well up draw rein outside the village of osterno to accede at last to the oft-repeated prayer of the driver that he might return to he task it be not meet the man have gruffly say whenever a short halt be make to change horse that a great prince should drive a yemschik it be meet answer paul simply for one man to help another then this man of deed and not of word clamber into the sleigh and draw up the window hide he head as he drive through he own village where every man be dependent for life and be on he charity they be silent for the lady be tired and cold we shall soon be there say paul reassuringly but he do not lower the window and look out as any man might have wish to do on return to the place of he birth maggie sit back wrap in she fur she be meditate over the event of the day and more particularly over a certain skill a quickness of touch a deft handling of stricken man which she have note far out on the snowy steppe a few hour earlier paul be a different man when he have to deal with pain and sickness he be quicker brighter full of confidence in himself for the great sympathy be he -- that love of the neighbor which be throw like a mantle over the shoulder of some man make they different from they fellow secure to they that love of great and small which perchance follow some when they be dead to that place where a human testimony may not be all in vain at the castle all be in readiness for the prince and princess they departure from tver have be telegraph on the threshold of the great house before she have enter the magnificent hall etta 's eye brighten she fatigue vanish she play she part before the crowd of bow servant with that forgetfulness of mere bodily fatigue which be expect of princess and other great lady she sweep up the broad staircase lean on paul 's arm with a carriage a presence a dazzling wealth of beauty which do not fail to impress the onlooker whatever etta may have fail to bring to paul howard alexi as a wife she make he a matchless princess he lead she straight through the drawing-room to the suite of room which be hers these consist of a ante-room a small drawing-room and she private apartment beyond paul stop in the drawing-room look round with a simple satisfaction in all that have be do by he order for etta 's comfort these he say be you room he be no adept at turn a neat phrase -- at reel off a pretty honeymoon welcome perhaps he expect she to express delight to come to he possibly and kiss he as some woman would have do she look round critically yes she say they be very nice she cross the room and draw aside the curtain that cover the double-latticed window the room be so warm that there be no rime on the pane she give a little shudder and he go to she side put he strong quiet arm around she below they stretch away beneath the brilliant moonlight lay the country that be he inheritance a estate as large as a large english county immediately beneath they at the foot of the great rock upon which the castle be build nestle the village of osterno -- straggle squalid oh she say dully this be siberium this be terrible it have never present itself to he in that light the wonderful stretch of country over which they be look it be not so bad he say in the daylight and that be all for he have no persuasive tongue that be the village he go on after a little pause those be the people who look to we to help they in they fight against terrible odds i hope -- that you would be interested in they she look down curiously at the little wooden hut half-buried in the snow the smoking chimney the twinkling curtainless window what do you expect I to do she ask in a queer voice he look at she in a sort of wonderment perhaps it seem to he that a woman should have no need to ask such a question it be a long story he say i will tell you about it another time you be tire now after you journey he arm slip from she waist they stand side by side and both be conscious of a feeling of difference they be not the same as they have be in london the atmosphere of russium seem to have have some subtle effect upon they etta turn and sit slowly down on a low chair before the fire she have throw she fur aside and they lay in a luxurious heap on the floor the maid hear that the prince and princess be together wait silently in the next room behind the closed door i think i have better hear it now say etta but you be tired protest she husband you have better rest until dinner-time no i be not tire he come toward she and stand with one elbow on the mantel-piece look down at she -- a quiet strong man who have already forget he feat of endurance of a few hour earlier these people he say would die of starvation and cold and sickness if we do not help they it be simply impossible for they in the few month that they can work the land to cultivate it so as to yield any more than they tax they be overtax and no one care the army must be keep up and a huge civil service and no one care what happen to the peasant some day the peasant _ must _ turn but not yet it be a question for all russian land-owner to face and nobody face it if any one try to improve the condition of he peasant -- they be happier a thousand time as serf -- the bureaucrat of petersburg mark he down and he be force to leave the country the whole fabric of this government be rotten but every-one except the peasant would suffer by its fall and therefore it stand etta be stare into the fire it be impossible to say whether she hear with comprehension or not paul go on : there be nothing left therefore but to go and do good by stealth i study medicine with that view steinmetz have scrape and economize the working of the estate for the same purpose the government will not allow we to have a doctor they prevent we from organize relief and education on anything like a adequate scale they do it all by underhand means they have not the pluck to oppose we openly for year we have be do what we can we have almost eradicate cholera they do not die of starvation now and they be learn -- very slowly but still they be learn we -- i -- think you might be interested in you people you might want to help she give a short little nod there be a suggestion of suspense in she whole be and attitude as if she be wait to hear something which she know could not be avoid a few year ago he go on a gigantic scheme be set on foot i tell you a little about it -- the charity league she lip move but no sound come from they so she nod a second time a tiny carriage-clock on the mantel-piece strike seven and she look up in a startled way as if the sound have frighten she the castle be quite still silence seem to brood over the old wall that fall through he go on as i tell you it be betray stépan lanovitch be banish he have escape however steinmetz have see he he succeed in destroy some of the papers before the place be search after the robbery -- one paper in particular if he have not destroy that i should have be banish i be one of the leader of the charity league steinmetz and i get the thing up it would have be for the happiness of million of peasant if it have not be betray in time -- we shall find out who do it he pause he do not say what he would do when he have find out etta be stare into the fire she lip be dry she hardly seem to be breathe it be possible he go on in he strong quiet inexorable voice that stépan lanovitch know now etta do not move she be stare into the fire -- stare -- stare then she slowly faint roll from the low chair to the fur hearth-rug paul pick she up like a child and carry she to the bedroom where the maid be wait to dress she here he say you mistress have faint from the fatigue of the journey and with he practiced medical knowledge he himself tend she chapter xxv osterno always gay always gay laugh steinmetz rub he broad hand together and look down into the face of maggie who be busy at the breakfast-table yes answer the girl glance toward paul lean against the window read he letter yes always gay why not karl steinmetz see the glance it be one of the little daily incident that one see and half forget he only half forget it why not indeed he answer and you will be glad to hear that ivanovitch be as ready as yourself this morning to treat the matter as a joke he be none the worse for he freezing and all the better for he experience you have add another friend my dear young lady to a list which be doubtless a very long one he be a nice man answer maggie how be it she ask after a little pause that there be more man in the lower class whom one can call nice than among they betters paul pause between two letter hear the question he look up as if interested in the answer but do not join in the conversation because deal with animal and with nature be more conducive to niceness than too much trafficking with human being reply steinmetz promptly i suppose that be it say maggie lift the tea-pot lid and look in at all event it be the sort of answer one might expect from you you be always hard on human nature i take it as i find it reply steinmetz with a laugh but i do not worry about it like some people now paul would like to alter the course of the world as he speak he half turn toward paul as if suggest that he should give a opinion and this little action have the effect of put a stop to the conversation maggie have plenty to say to steinmetz but toward paul she mental attitude be different she be probably unaware of this little fact there she say after a pause i have obey etta 's instruction she do not want we to begin i suppose no reply paul she will be down in a minute i hope the princess be not overtire say steinmetz with a certain formal politeness which seem to accompany any mention of etta 's name not at all thank you reply etta herself come into the room at that moment she look fresh and self-confident on the contrary i be full of energy and eagerness to explore the castle one naturally take a interest in one 's baronial hall with this she walk slowly across to the window she stand there look out and every one in the room be watch on look for the first time on the same view a few moment earlier maggie have utter a little cry of surprise and have then remain silent etta look out of the window and say nothing it be a most singular out-look -- weird uncouth prehistoric as some part of the earth still be the castle be build on the edge of a perpendicular cliff on this side it be impregnable any object drop from the breakfast-room window would fall a clear two hundred foot to the brawl oster river the rock be black and shine like the topmost crag of a alpine mountain where snow and ice have polish the bare stone beyond and across the river lay the boundless steppe -- a sheet of virgin snow etta stand look over this to the far horizon where the white snow and the gray sky softly merge into one she first remark be characteristic as first and last remark usually be and as far as you can see be yours she ask yes answer paul simply with that calm which only come with hereditary possession the observation attract steinmetz 's attention he go to another window and look across the waste critically four time as far as we can see be he he say etta look out slowly and comprehensively absorb it all like a long sweet drink there be no hereditary calmness in she sense of possession and where be thors she ask paul stretch out he arm point with a lean steady finger : it lie out there he answer another of the little incident that be only half forget some of the person assemble in that room remember the point finger long afterward it make one feel very small say etta turn to the breakfast-table -- at no time a pleasant sensation do you know she say after a little pause i think it probable that i shall become very fond of osterno but i wish it be nearer to civilization paul look pleased steinmetz have a queer expression on he face maggie murmur something about one 's surroundings make but little difference to one 's happiness and the subject be wisely shelve after breakfast steinmetz withdraw now say paul shall i show you the old place you and maggie etta signify she readiness but maggie say that she have letter to write that etta could show she the castle another time when the man be out shooting perhaps but say etta i shall do it horribly badly they be not my ancestor you know i shall attach the story to the wrong people and locate the ghost in the wrong room you will be wise to take paul 's guidance no thank you reply maggie quite firmly and frankly i feel inclined to write and the feeling be rare so i must take advantage of it the girl look at she cousin with something in she honest blue eye that almost amount to wonder etta be always surprising she there be a whole gamut of feel a octave of callow half-formed girlish instinct of which etta seem to be deprive if she have ever have they no trace be leave of they whilom presence at first maggie have flatly refuse to come to russia when paul press she to do so she accept with a sort of wonder there be something which she do not understand the same instinct make she refuse now to accompany paul and etta over they new home again etta press she show she lack of some feeling which maggie indefinitely know she ought to have have this time paul make no sign he add no word to etta 's persuasion but stand gravely look at he wife when the door have close behind they maggie stand for some minute by the window look out over the snow-clad plain the rugged broken rock beneath she then she turn to the writing-table she resolutely take pen and paper but the least thing seem to distract she attention -- the coronet on the note-paper cost she five minute of far-off reflection she take up the pen again and write dear mother the room grow darker maggie look up the snow have begin again it be drive past the window with a silent purposeful monotony the girl draw the writing-case toward she she examine the pen critically and dip it into the ink but she add nothing to the two word already write the castle of osterno be almost unique in the particular that one roof cover the ancient and the modern building the vast reception-rooms worthy of the name of state-room adjoin the small stone-built apartment of the fortress which paul 's ancestor hold against the tartar this grimmer side of the building paul reserve to the last for reason of he own and etta 's manifest delight in the grandeur of the more modern apartment fully reward he here again that side of she character manifest itself which have already be show she be dazzle and exhilarate by the splendor of it all and the immediate effect be a feeling of affection toward the man to whom this belong who be in act if not in word lay it at she foot when they pass from the lofty room to the dimmer passage of the old castle etta 's spirit visibly drop she interest slacken he tell she of tragedy enact in by-gone time -- such ancient tale of violent death and broken heart as attach themselves to gray stone wall and dungeon keep she only half listen for she mind be busy with the splendor they have leave behind with the purpose to which such splendor could be turn and the sum total of she thought be gratified vanity she bright presence awaken the gloom of age within the dimly light historic room she laugh sound strangely light and frivolous and shallow in the silence of the age which have brood within these wall since the day of tamerlane it be perhaps the greatest tragedy of the alexi family this beautiful tragedy that walk by the side of paul i be glad you grandfather bring french architect here and build the modern side she say these room be of course very interesting but gloomy -- horribly gloomy paul there be a smell of ghost and dulness all the same i like these room answer paul steinmetz and i use to live entirely on this side of the house this be the smoking-room we shoot those bear and all the deer that be a wolf 's head he kill a keeper before i finish he off etta look at she husband with a curious little smile she sometimes feel proud of he despite the ever present knowledge that intellectually speak she be he superior there be something strong and simple and manly in a sort of mediaeval way that please she in this big husband of hers and how do you finish he off she ask i choke he that bear knock I down but steinmetz shoot he we be four day out in the open after that elk this be a lynx -- a queer face -- rather like de chauxville the dog kill he but why do you not paper the room ask etta with a shiver instead of this gloomy panelling it be so mysterious and creepy quite suggestive of secret passage there be no secret passage answer paul but there be a room behind here this be the door i will show it to you presently i have thing in there i want to show you i keep all my medicine and appliance in there it be we secret surgery and office in that room the charity league be organize etta turn away suddenly and go to the narrow window where she sit on a low window-seat look down into the snow-clad depths i do not know you be a doctor she say i doctor the peasant reply paul in a rough-and-ready way i take my degree on purpose but of course they do not know that it be i they think i be a doctor from moscow i put on a old coat and wear a scarf so that they can not see my face i only go to they at night it would never do for the government to know that we attempt to do good to the peasant we have to keep it a secret even from the people themselves and they hate we they groan and hoot when we drive through the village but they never attempt to do we any harm they be too much afraid of we when etta rise and come toward he she face be colorless let I see this room she say he open the door and follow she into the apartment which have already be describe here he tell further somewhat bald detail of the work he have attempt to do it be to be fear that he make neither a interesting nor a romantic story of it there be too many detail -- too much statistic and no thrilling realism whatever the experience of a youthful curate in bethnal green would have make high tragedy beside the tale that this man tell he wife of the land upon which god have assuredly lay he curse -- aceldama the field of blood etta listen and despite herself she become interested she be sit in a chair usually occupy by steinmetz there be a faint aroma of tobacco-smoke the atmosphere of the room be manly and energetic paul show she he simple store of medicine -- the old coat saturate with disinfectant which have become the recognize outward sign of the moscow doctor and do other people other nobleman try to do this sort of thing too ask etta at length catrina lanovitch do reply paul what the girl with the hair yes answer paul he have never notice catrina 's hair etta 's appraise eye have see more in one second than paul have perceive in twenty year yes he answer but of course she be handicap by she appearance no by she circumstance she name be sufficient to handicap she every moment in this country but she do a great deal she -- she find I out confound she etta have rise she be look curiously at the cupboard where paul 's infected clothes be hang he have forbid she to go near it she turn and look at he find you out how she ask with a queer smile see through my disguise yes -- she would do that say etta aloud to herself what be this door she ask after a pause it lead to a inner room reply paul where steinmetz usually work he pass in front of she and open the door as he be do so etta go on in the train of she thought : so catrina know yes and no one else paul make no answer for he have pass on into the smaller room where steinmetz be seat at a writing-table except of course herr steinmetz etta go on interrogatively madame say the german look up with he pleasant smile i know _ every thing _ and he go on write chapter xxvi bloodhound the table d'hôte of the hôtel de moscou at tver have just begin the soup have be remove the diner be engage in ignite they first cigarette at the candle place between each pair of they for that purpose by nature the modern russian be a dignified and somewhat reserved gentleman by circumstance he have be school into a state of guard unsociability if there be a seat at a public table conveniently remove from those occupy by earlier arrival the new-comer invariably take it in russium one converse -- as in scotland one joke -- with difficulty a russian table d'hôte be therefore any thing but hilarious in its tendency a certain number of grave-faced gentleman and a few broad-jowled lady be visibly constrain by the force of circumstance to dine at the same table and hour et voilà tout there be no pretence that any more sociable and neighborly motive have bring they together indeed they each suspect the other of be a german or a nihilist or worse still a government servant they therefore sit as far apart as possible and smoke cigarette between and during the course with that self-centred absorption which would be rude if it be not entirely satisfactory to the average briton the lady of course have the same easy method of show a desire for silence and reflection in a country where nurse carry infant usually smoke in the street and where a dainty confectioner 's assistant place she cigarette between she lip in order to leave she hand free for the service of she customer the table d'hôte of the hôtel de moscou at tver be no exception to the general rule in russium by the way there be no exception to general rule the personal habit of the native of cronstadt differ in no way from those of the czar 's subject living in petropavlovsk eight thousand mile away around the long table of the host be seat at respectable interval a dozen or more gentleman who gaze stolidly at each other from time to time while the host himself smile broadly upon they all from that end of the room where the lift and the smell of cooking exercise they calling -- the one to spoil the appetite the other to pander to it when spoil of these dozen gentleman we have only to deal with one -- a man of broad high forehead of colorless eye of a mask-like face who consume what be put before he with as little noise as possible know in pari as ce bon vassili this traveller but in paris one do not always use the word bon in its english sense of good m vassilus be evidently desirous of attract as little attention as circumstance would allow he be obviously do he best to look like one who travel in the interest of braid or button moreover when claude de chauxville enter the table d'hôte room he conceal whatever surprise he may have feel behind a cloud of cigarette smoke through the same blue haze he meet the frenchman 's eye a moment later without the faintest twinkle of recognition these two worthy go through the weird course provide by a cook profess a knowledge of french _ cuisine _ without take any compromise notice of each other when the meal be over vassilus inscribe the number of he bedroom in large figure on the label of he bottle of st emilion -- after the manner of wise commercial-traveller in continental hotel he subsequently turn the bottle round so that claude de chauxville could scarcely fail to read the number and with a vague and general bow he leave the room in he apartment the genial vassilus throw more wood into the stove draw forward the two regulation arm-chair and light all the candle provide he then ring the bell and order liqueur there be evidently something in the nature of a entertainment about to take place in apartment no 44 of the hôtel de moscou before long a discreet knock announce the arrival of the expect visitor entrez cry vassilus and de chauxville stand before he with a smile which in french be call crâne a pleasure say vassilus behind he wooden face that i do not anticipate in tver and consequently one that carry its own mitigation a unanticipated pleasure mon amus be always inopportune i make no doubt that you be sorry to see I on the contrary will you sit i can hardly believe go on de chauxville take the proffer chair that my appearance be opportune -- on the principle ha ha that a flower grow out of place be a weed gentleman of the -- eh -- home office prefer i know to travel quietly he spread out he expressive hand as if smooth the path of m vassilus through this stony world incognito he add guilelessly one do not publish one 's name from the housetops reply the russian with a glimmer of pride in he eye especially if it happen to be not quite obscure but between friend my dear baron -- between friend yes then what be you do in tver enquire de chauxville with engaging frankness ah that be a long story but i will tell you -- never fear -- i will tell you on the usual term viz enquire the frenchman light a cigarette vassilus accept the match with a bow and do likewise he blow a guileless cloud of smoke toward the dingy ceiling exchange my dear baron exchange oh certainly reply de chauxville who know that vassilus be in all probability fully inform as to he movement past and prospective i be go to visit some old friend in this government -- the lanovitch at thor ah you know they vassili raise he shoulder and make a little gesture with he cigarette as much as to say why ask de chauxville look at he companion keenly he be wonder whether this man know that he -- claude de chauxville -- love etta howard alexi and consequently hate she husband he be wonder how much or how little this impenetrable individual know and suspect i have always say observe vassilus suddenly that for unmitigated impertinence give I a diplomatist ah and what would you desire that i should for the same commodity give you now a woman there be a short silence in the room while these two bird of a feather reflect suddenly vassili tap himself on the chest with he forefinger it be i he say who crush that very dangerous movement -- the charity league i know it a movement my dear baron to educate the moujik if you please to feed he and clothe he and teach he -- to be discontent with he lot to raise he up and make a man of he pah he be a beast let he be treat as such let he work if he will not work let he starve and die the man who can not contribute toward the support of those above he in life be superfluous say de chauxville glibly precisely now my dear baron listen to I the genial vassilus lean forward and tap with one finger on the knee of de chauxville as if knock at the door of he attention i be all ear mon bon monsieur reply the frenchman rather coldly he have just be reflect that after all he do not want any favor from vassilus for the moment and the manner of the latter be verge on the familiar the woman -- who -- sell -- I -- the charity league papers dine at my house in paris -- a fortnight ago say vassilus with a staccato tap on he companion 's knee by way of emphasis to each word then my friend i can not -- congratulate -- you -- on the society -- in -- which you move reply de chauxville mimic he manner bah she be a princess a princess yes of you acquaintance m le baron and she come to my house with she -- eh -- husband -- the prince paul howard alexi this be news indeed de chauxville lean back and pass he slim white hand across he brow with a slow pressure as if wipe some write from a slate -- as if he forehead bear the writing of he thought and he be wipe it away and the thought he thus conceal -- who can count they for thought be the quickest and the longest and the saddest thing of this life the first thought be that if he have know this three month earlier he could have make etta marry he and that thought have a thousand branch with etta for he wife he might have be a different man one can never tell what the effect of a acquire desire may be one can only judge by analogy and it would seem that it be a frustrated desire that make the majority of villain but the news come thus too late only serve a evil purpose for in that flash of thought claude de chauxville see paul 's secret give to he paul 's wealth mete out to he paul in exile paul dead in siberium where death come easily paul 's widow claude de chauxville 's wife he wipe all the thought away and show to vassili a face that be as compose and impertinent as usual you say ` she -- eh -- husband ' he observe why why do you add that little ` eh ' my friend vassilus rise and walk to the door that lead through into he bedroom from the salon in which they be sit it be possible to enter the bedroom from another door and overhear any conversation that might be pass in the sitting-room the investigation be apparently satisfactory for the russian come back but he do not sit down instead he stand lean against the tall china stove needless to tell you he observe the antecedent of the -- princess quite needless married seven year ago to charle sydney bamborough promptly give the unnecessary information which be not wanted de chauxville nod where be sydney bamborough ask vassilus with he mask-like smile dead reply the other quietly prove it de chauxville look up sharply the cigarette drop from he finger to the floor he face be yellow and draw with a singular tremble of the lip which be twist to one side good god he whisper hoarsely there be only one thought in he mind -- a sudden wild desire to rise up and stand by etta against the whole world verily we can not tell what love may make of we whither it may lead we we only know that it never leave we as it find we then lean quietly against the stove vassilus state he case rather more than a year ago he say i receive a offer of the papers connect with a great scheme in this country after certain enquiry have be make i accept the offer i pay a fabulous price for the papers they be bring to I by a lady wear a thick veil -- a lady i have never see before i ask no question and pay she the money it subsequently transpire that the papers have be steal as you perhaps know from the house of count stépan lanovitch -- the house to which you happen to be go -- at thor well that be all ancient history it be to be suppose that the papers be steal by sydney bamborough who bring they here -- probably to this hotel where he wife be stay he hand she the papers and she convey they to I in pari but before she reach petersburg they

the countess look at she daughter with a unctuous smile as if to urge she on to make the most of this opportunity it be one of the countess 's chief trouble that she could not by hook or crook involve catrina in any sort of a love intrigue she be the sort of mother who would have prefer to hear scandal about she daughter to hear nothing if it will not freeze monsieur reply catrina with

and catrina leave the room she go upstairs to she own little den where the piano stand it be the only room in the house that be not too warm for here the window be occasionally open -- a proceeding which the countess consider scarcely short of criminal catrina begin to play feverishly nervously with all the weird force of she nature she be like a very sick person seek a desperate remedy -- race against time it be she habit to take she breaking heart thus to the great master to interpret they thought in they music welding they melody to the need of she own sorrow she only have half a hour of late music have fail she a little it have not give she the comfort she have usually extract from solitude and the piano she be in a dangerous humor she be afraid of trust herself to de chauxville the

glide off between the pine at first there be no opportunity of conversation for the pony be fresh and troublesome the road over which they be pass have not be beat down by the passage of previous sleigh so that the powdery snow rise up like dust and fill the eye and mouth it will be better presently gasp catrina wrestling with she fractious little tartar thoroughbred when we get out on to the high-road de chauxville sit quite still if he feel any misgiving as to she power of master she team he keep it to himself there be a subtle difference in he manner toward catrina when they be alone together a suggestion of camaraderie of a common interest and a common desire of which she be conscious without be able to put definite meaning to it it annoy and alarm she while give she full attention to the management of the sleigh she be begin to dread the first word of this man who be merely wield a cheap power acquire in the shady course of he career there be nothing so disarm as the assume air of intimate knowledge of one 's private thought and action de chauxville assume this air with a skill against which catrina 's dogged strength of character be incapable of battle he manner convey the impression that he know more of catrina 's inward thought than any other living be and she be simple enough to be frighten into the conclusion that she have betray herself to he there be no simpler method of discover a secret than to ignore its existence it be possible that de chauxville become aware of catrina 's sidelong glance of anxiety in he direction he may have divine that silence be more effective than speech he sit look straight in front of he as if too deeply absorb in he own thought to take even a pass interest in the scenery why do you come here ask catrina suddenly de chauxville seem to awake from a revery he turn and look at she in assume surprise they be on the high-road now where the snow be beat down so conversation be easy but -- to see you mademoiselle i be

catrina make no answer to this she pony require considerable attention also there be some mind like large banking house -- not deal in small change that which pass in or out of such mind have its own standard of importance such people be not of much use in these day when we like to touch thing lightly adorn a tale but point no moral i would ask you to believe that you society be one incentive to make I accept the countess 's kind hospitality the frenchman observe after a pause and de chauxville look at she he have not meet many woman of solid intellect and repeat catrina i have other of course catrina give a little nod and wait i wish to be near alexis add de chauxville catrina be stare straight in front of she she face have acquire a habit of harden at the mention of paul 's name it be stone-like now and set perhaps she might have forgive he if he have love she once if only for a little while she might have forgive he if only for the remembrance of that little while but paul have always be a man of set purpose and such man be cruel even for she sake even for the sake of he own vanity he have never pretend to love catrina he have never mistaken gratified vanity for dawn love as million of man do or perhaps he be without vanity some few man be so construct do you love he so ask catrina with a grim smile distort she strong face as much as you mademoiselle reply de chauxville catrina start she be not sure that she hate paul toward etta there be no mistake in she feeling and this be so strong that like a electric current there be enough of it to pass through the wife and reach the husband passion like character do not grow in crowded place in great city man be all more or less alike it be only in solitary abode that strong nature grow up in they own way catrina have grow to womanhood in one of the solitary place of the earth she have no facile axiom no powerful precedent to guide she every step through life the woman who be in daily contact with she be immeasurably beneath she in mental power in force of character in those possibility of love or hatred which go to make a strong life for good or for evil by the side of she daughter the countess lanovitch be as the willow sway by every wind in the neighborhood of the oak crooked and still and strong in petersburg you pledge yourself to help I say de chauxville and although she know that in the letter this be false she do not contradict he i come here to claim fulfilment of you promise the hard blue eye beneath the fur cap stare straight in front of they catrina seem to be drive like one asleep for she note nothing by the roadside so far as eye could reach over the snow-clad plain through the silent pine these two be alone in a white dead world of they own catrina never drive with bell there be no sound beyond the high-pitched drone of the steel runner over the powdery snow they be alone unseen unheard save of that ear that listen in the waste place of the world what do you want I to do she ask oh not very much answer de chauxville -- a cautious man who know a woman 's humor catrina drive a pair of pony in the clear sharp air of central russium and catrina play the piano in the enervate flower-scented atmosphere of a drawing-room be two different woman de chauxville be not the man to mistake the one for the other not very much mademoiselle he answer i should like mme la comtesse to invite the whole osterno party to dine and sleep perhaps if one may suggest it catrina want this too she want to torture herself with the sight of etta beautiful self-confident carelessly cognizant of paul 's love she want to see paul look at he wife with the open admiration which she have set down as something else than love -- something immeasurably beneath love as catrina understand that passion she soul brood under a weight of misery be ready to welcome any change should it only mean a greater misery i can manage that she say if they will come it be a prearranged matter that there should be a bear-hunt in we forest that will do answer de chauxville reflectively in a few day perhaps if it suit the countess catrina make no reply after a pause she speak again in she strange jerky way what will you gain by it she ask de chauxville shrug he shoulder who know he answer there be many thing i want to know many question which can be answer only by one 's own observation i want to see they together be they happy catrina 's face harden if there be a god in heaven and he hear we prayer they ought not to be she reply curtly she look happy enough in petersburg say the frenchman who never tell the truth for its own sake whenever he think that catrina 's hatred need stimulation he mention etta 's name there be other question in my mind he go on some of which you can answer mademoiselle if you care to catrina 's face express no great willingness to oblige the charity league say de chauxville look at she keenly i have always have a feeling of curiosity respect it be for instance we friend the prince pavlo implicate in that unfortunate affair catrina flush suddenly she do not take she eye from the pony she be conscious of the unwonted color in she cheek which be slowly die away beneath she companion 's relentless gaze you need not trouble to reply mademoiselle say de chauxville with he dark smile i be answer catrina pull the pony up with a jerk and proceed to turn they willing head toward home she be alarmed and disturbed nothing seem to be safe from the curiosity of this man no secret secure no prevarication of the slightest avail there be other question in my mind say de chauxville quietly but not now mademoiselle be no doubt tire he lean back and when at length he speak it be to give utterance to the trite commonplace of which he make a conversational study chapter xxviii in the castle of thor a week later catrina watch from the window of she own small room see paul lift etta from the sleigh and the sight make she clench she hand

be light by lamp it be warm and cheery a second door lead to the little music-room which catrina have make she own and beyond be she bedroom maggie have assure she hostess that she have every thing that she could wish and that she do not desire the service of catrina 's maid but the russian girl still linger she be slow to make friend -- not shy but diffident and suspicious she friendship once secure be a thing worth possess she be incline to bestow it upon this quiet self-contained english girl in such matter the length of a acquaintance go for nothing a long acquaintanceship do not necessarily mean friendship -- one be the result of circumstance the other of selection the princess know russian say catrina suddenly she be stand near the dressing-table where she have be absently attend to the candle she wheel round and look at maggie who be hospitably sit on a low chair near the fire she be sorry for the loneliness of this girl 's life she do not want she to go away just yet there be another chair by the fire invite catrina to indulge in those maiden confidence which attach themselves to slipper and hair-brushing maggie look up with a smile which slowly ebb away catrina 's remark be of the nature of a defiance she half-diffident rôle of hostess be suddenly lay aside no she do not answer the english girl catrina come forward stand over maggie look down at she with eye full of antagonism excuse I i see she understand a remark i make to one of the servant she be not careful i see it distinctly i think you must be mistaken answer maggie quietly she have be in russium before for a few week but she do not learn the language she tell I so herself why should she pretend not to know russian if she do catrina make no answer she sit heavily down in the vacant chair she attitude be uncouth and strong -- a perpetual source of tribulation to the countess she sit with she elbow on she knee stare into the fire i do not mean to hate she i do not want to she say if it have be you i should not have hate you maggie 's clear eye waver for a moment a faint color rise to she face she lean back so that the firelight do not reach she there be a silence during which maggie unclasp a bracelet with a little snap of the spring catrina do not hear the sound she hear nothing she do not appear to be aware of she surroundings maggie unclasped another bracelet noisily she be probably regret she former kindness of manner catrina have come too near be you not judge rather hastily suggest maggie in a measure voice which heighten the contrast between the two i find it take some time to discover whether one likes or dislike new acquaintance yes but you english be so cold and deliberate you do not know what it be to hate -- or to care perhaps we do say maggie but we say less about it catrina turn and look at she with a queer smile less she laugh nothing -- you say nothing paul be the same i have see i know you have say nothing since you come to thor you have talk and laugh you have give opinion you have speak of many thing but you have say nothing you be the same as paul -- one never know i know nothing about you but i like you you be she cousin yes and i hate she maggie laugh she be quite steady and loyal when you get to know she you will change perhaps she say perhaps i know she now better than you do maggie laugh in she cheery practical way that seem hardly likely consider that i have know she since we be child catrina shrug she shoulder in a honest if somewhat mannerless refusal to discuss the side issue she return to the main question with characteristic stubbornness i shall always hate she she say i be sorry she be you cousin i shall always regret that and i shall always hate she there be something wrong about she -- something none of you know except karl steinmetz he know every thing -- herr steinmetz he know a great deal admit maggie yes and that be why he be sad be it not so catrina sit stare into the fire she strange earnest eye almost fierce in they concentration do she pretend that she love he at first she ask suddenly receive no answer she look up and fix she search gaze on the face of she companion maggie be look straight in front of she in the direction of the fire but not with eye focus to see any thing so near at hand she bear the scrutiny without flinch as soon as catrina 's eye be avert the mask-like stillness of she feature relax she do not take that trouble now add the russian girl in reply to she own question do you see she to-night when we be at the piano m de chauxville be talk to she they be keep two conversation go at the same time i could see by they face they say different thing when the music be loud i hate she she be not true to paul m de chauxville know something about she they have something in common which be not know to paul or to any of we why do you not speak why do you sit stare into the fire with you lip so close together because i do not think that we shall gain any thing by discuss paul and he wife it be no business of ours catrina laugh -- a lamentable mirthless laugh that be because she be you cousin and he -- he be nothing to you you do not care whether he be happy or not catrina have turn upon she companion fiercely maggie swing round in she chair to pick up she bracelet which have slip from she knee to the floor you exaggerate thing she say quietly i see no reason to suppose that paul be unhappy it be because you have take this unreasoning dislike to she she take a long time to collect three bracelet then she rise and place they on the dressing-table do you want I to go asked catrina in she blunt way no answer maggie civilly enough but she extract a couple of hair-pin rather obviously catrina heed the voice and not the action you english be all alike she say you hold one at arm 's length i suppose there be some one in england for whom you care -- who be out of all this -- away from all the trouble of russium this have nothing to do with you life it be only a pass incident -- a few week to be forget when you go back i wonder what he be like -- the man in england you need not tell I i be not curious in that way i be not ask you to tell I i be

and do not want to play again you hair be very pretty you be very pretty you quiet english girl i wonder what you think about behind you steady eye i say maggie with a little laugh oh -- i think about my dress and the new fashion and party and all the thing that girl do think of catrina shake she head she look stubborn and unconvinced then suddenly she change the conversation do you like m de chauxville she ask no do paul like he i do not know catrina look up for a moment only then she eye return to the contemplation of the burning pine-log i wonder why you will not talk of paul she say in a voice require no answer maggie move rather uneasily she have she back turn toward catrina i be afraid i be rather a dull person she answer i have not much to say about any body and nothing about paul suggest catrina nothing we be talk of m de chauxville yes i do not understand m de chauxville he seem to I to be the incarnation of insincerity he pose -- even to himself he be always watch for

simpler he would be cleverer catrina be afraid of claude de chauxville and because this be so she stare in wonder at the english girl who dismiss he from the conversation and she thought with a few careless word of contempt such mind as that of miss delafield be quite outside the field of de chauxville 's influence while that frenchman have considerable power over highly strung and imaginative nature catrina lanovitch have begin by tolerate he -- have proceed to make the serious blunder of permit he to be impertinently familiar and be now exaggerate in she own mind the hold that he have over she she do not actually dislike he so few people have take the trouble or find the expediency of endeavor to sympathize with she or understand she nature that she be unconsciously draw toward this man whom she now fear in exaggerate the power he exercise over herself she somewhat naturally exaggerate also he importance in the world and in the life of those around he she have imagine he all-powerful and the first person to whom she mention he name dismiss the subject indifferently she own entire sincerity have enable she to detect the insincerity of she ally she have purposely make mention of the weak spot which she have discover in order that she observation might be corroborate and this maggie have fail to do with the slightest encouragement catrina would have tell she

we may despise they we jeer very grandly at girl ' talk and promptly return to the discussion of we dog and pipe and clothing but catrina be not happy under this judicious treatment she have no one in the world to whom she could impart a thousand doubt and question -- a hundred grievance and one great grief and it be just this one great grief of which maggie dread the mention she be quite well aware of its existence -- have be aware of it for some time karl steinmetz have throw out one or two vague hint everything point to it maggie could hardly be ignorant of the fact that catrina have grow to womanhood loving paul a score of time catrina approach the subject and with imperturbable steadfastness maggie hold to she determination that paul be not to be discuss by they she ward she evade she ignore with a skill which baffle the simple russian she have a hundred subterfuge -- a hundred skilful turn and twist where woman learn these matter heaven only know all we experience of the

until another time he close the door behind he leave etta white-lipped chapter xxxi a dangerous experiment a russian forest in winter be one of nature 's place of worship there be some such place in the world where nature seem to stand in the presence of the deity a sunrise at sea night on a snow-clad mountain mid-day in a russian forest in winter these place and these time be good for convalescent atheist and such as pose as unbeliever -- the cheapest form of notoriety paul have request catrina and maggie to drive as quietly as possible through the forest the warning be unnecessary for the stillness of snow be infectious while the beauty of the scene seem to command silence as usual catrina drive without bell the one attendant on he perch behind be a fur-clad statue of servitude and silence maggie lean back hide to the eye in she sable have nothing to say to she companion the way lay through forest of pine -- trackless motionless virgin the sun filter through the snow-laden branch cast a subdue golden light upon the ruddy upright trunk of the tree at time a willow-grouse white as the snow light and graceful on the wing rise from the branch where he have be laugh to he mate with a low coo laugh and flutter away over the tree a kooropatka say catrina who know the life of the forest almost as well as paul whose very existence be wrap up in these thing far over the summit of the pine a snipe seem to be wheeling a sentinel round he follow they as they speed along call out all the while he deep warning note like that of a lamb crouching beneath a hedge where the wind be not temper once or twice they hear the dismal howl of a wolf -- the most melancholy the weirdest the most hopeless of nature 's call the whole forest seem to be on the alert -- astir and in suspense the wolf disturb in he lair no doubt hear and understand the cry of the watchful snipe and the sudden silence of the willow-grouse who love to sit and laugh when all be safe a clumsy capercailzie swing along over the tree with a great flap and rush of wing seem to be intent on he own solitary majestic business -- a very king among the fowl of the air amid the topmost branch of the pine the wind whisper and stir like a child in sleep but beneath all be still every branch stand motionless beneath its burden of snow the air be thin exhilarating brilliant -- like dry champagne it seem to send the blood course through the vein with a very joy of life catrina note all these thing while cleverly handle she pony they speak to she with a thousand voice she have roam in these same forest with paul who love they and understand they as she do maggie in the midst as it be of a revelation lean back and wonder at it all she too be think of paul the owner of these boundless forest she understand he better now this drive have reveal to she a part of he nature which have rather puzzle she -- a large simple quiet strength which have develop and grow to maturity beneath these tree we be all part of what we have see we all carry with we through life somewhat of the scene through which we pass in childhood maggie know now where paul have learn the quiet concentration of mind the absorption in he own affair the complete lack of interest in the business of he neighbor which make he different from other man he have learn these thing at first hand from god 's creature these forest-dweller of fur and feather go about they affair in the same absorb way with the same complete faith the same desire to leave and be leave alone the simplicity of nature be he he only craft be forest craft now you know say catrina when they reach the hut why i hate petersburg maggie nod the effect of the forest be still upon she she do not want to talk the woman who receive they the wife of a keeper have prepare in a rough way for they reception she have a large fire and bowl of warm milk the door and window have be throw wide open by paul 's order he want to spare maggie too intimate a acquaintance with a russian interior the hut be really a shooting-box build by paul some year earlier and inhabit by a head-keeper one learn in the way of bear and wolf and lynx the large dwelling-room have be carefully scrub there be a smell of pine-wood and soap the table ready spread with a simple luncheon take up nearly the whole of the room while the two girl be warm themselves a keeper come to the door of the hut and ask to see catrina he stand in the little door-way completely fill it and explain that he could not come in as the buckle and strap of he snow-shoe be clog and freeze he wear the long norwegian snow-shoe and be hold to be the quickest runner in the country catrina have a long conversation with the man who stand hatless ruddy and shy it be she then explain to maggie paul 's own man who always load for he and carry he spare gun he have send he to tell we that the game have be ringed and that the beater will close in on a place call the schapka clearing where there be a woodman 's refuge if we care to put on we snow-shoe this man will guide we to the clearing and take care of we till the battue be over of course maggie welcome the proposal with delight and after a hasty luncheon the three glide off through the forest as noiselessly as they have come after a tiring walk of a hour and more they come to the clearing and be duly conceal in the hut no one the keeper tell the lady except paul know of they presence in the little wooden house the arrangement of the beat have be slightly alter at the last moment after the hunter have separate the keeper light a small fire and shyly attend to the lady remove they snow-shoe with clumsy finger he close the door and arrange a branch of larch across the window so that they could stand near it without be see they have not be there long before de chauxville appear he move quickly across the clearing skimming over the snow with long sweeping stride two keeper follow he and after have show he the rough hiding-place prepare for he silently withdraw to they place soon karl steinmetz come from another direction and take up he position rather nearer to the hut in a thicket of pine and dwarf oak he be only twenty yard away from the refuge where the girl be conceal it be not long before paul come he be quite alone and suddenly appear at the far end of the clearing in very truth a mighty hunter standing nearly seven foot on he snow-shoe one rifle he carry in he hand another slung across he back it be like a silent scene on a stage the snow-white clearing with long-drawn track across it where the snow-shoe have pass the still tree the brilliant sun and the blue depths of the forest behind while paul like the hero of some grim arctic saga a huge fur-clad northern giant stand alone in the desolation from he attitude it be apparent that he be listen it be probable that the cry of the bird and the distant howl of a wolf tell he practiced ear how near the beater be he presently move across to where de chauxville be hide speak some word of advice or warn to he and point with he gloved hand in the direction whence the game might be expect to come it subsequently transpire that paul be ask de chauxville the whereabouts of steinmetz who have gain he place of concealment unobserved by either de chauxville could give he no information and paul go away to he post dissatisfy karl steinmetz must have see they he must have divine the subject of they conversation but he remain hidden and give no sign paul 's post be behind a fall tree and the watcher in the hut could see he while he be completely hide from any animal that might enter the open clearing from the far end he turn and look hard at the hut but the larch branch across the window effectually prevent he from discover whether any one be behind it or not thus they all wait in suspense a blackcock skim across the open space and disappear unmolested a wolf -- gray gaunt sneak and lurch in he gait -- trot into the clearing and stand listen with evil lip draw back the two girl watch he breathlessly when he trot on unmolested they draw a deep breath as if they have be under water paul with he two rifle lay before he watch the wolf depart with a smile the girl could see the smile and from it learn somewhat of the man the keeper beside they give a little laugh and look to the hammer of he rifle and still there be no sound it be still unreal and like a scene on the stage the bird skim over the top of the tree from time to time throw in as it be a note of fear and suspense there be breathlessness in the air a couple of hare like white shadow in they spotless winter coat shoot from covert to covert across the open ground then suddenly the keeper give a little grunt and hold up he hand listen with part lip and eager eye there be a distinct sound of break branch and crackle underwood they could see paul cautiously rise from he knee to a crouching attitude they follow the direction of he gaze and before they the monarch of these forest stand in clumsy might a bear have shamble to the edge of the clearing and be stand upright growling and grumble to himself he great paw wave from side to side he shaggy head thrust forward with a recur jerk singularly suggestive of a dandy with a uncomfortable collar these bear of northern russium have not the reputation of be very fierce unless they be arouse from they winter quarter when they wrath know no bound and they courage recognize no danger a angry bear be afraid of no living man or beast moreover these king of the northern forest be huge beast capable of smother a strong man by fall on he and lie there -- a death which have come to more than one daring hunter the beast 's favorite method of deal with he foe be to claw he to death or else hug he till he rib be snap and crush into he vitals the bear stand poke he head and look about with little fiery bloodshot eye for something to destroy he rage be manifest and in he strength he be a grand sight the majesty of power and a dauntless courage be he it be de chauxville 's shot and while keep he eye on the bear paul glance impatiently over he shoulder from time to time wonder why the frenchman do not fire the bear be a huge one and would probably carry three bullet and still be a dangerous adversary the keeper mutter impatiently they be watch paul breathlessly the bear be approach he it would not be safe to defer firing another second suddenly the keeper give a short exclamation of astonishment and throw up he rifle there be another bear behind paul shamble toward he unseen by he all he attention be rivet on the huge brute forty yard in front of he it be claude de chauxville 's task to protect paul from any flank or rear attack and claude de chauxville be peer over he covert watch with blanch face the second bear and lifting no hand make no sign the bear be within a few yard of paul who be crouch behind the fall pine and now raise he rifle to he shoulder in a flash of comprehension the two girl see all through the pane of the close window it be still singularly like a scene on the stage the second bear raise he powerful fore-paw as he approach one blow would tear open paul 's brain a terrific report send the girl stagger back for a moment paralyze think the keeper have fire through the window both barrel almost simultaneously it be a question how much lead would bring the bear down before he cover the intervene dozen yard in the confine space of the hut the report of the heavy double charge be like that of a cannon moreover steinmetz twenty yard away have fire at the same moment the room be fill with smoke the two girl be blind for a instant then they see the keeper tear open the door and disappear the cold air through the shatter casement be a sudden relief to they lung choke with sulphur and the fume of spend powder in a flash they be out of the open door and there again with the suddenness of a panorama they see another picture -- paul kneel in the middle of the clearing take careful aim at the retreat form of the first bear they see the puff of blue smoke rise from he rifle they hear the sharp report and the bear roll over on its face steinmetz and the keeper be walk toward paul claude de chauxville standing outside he screen of brushwood be stare with wide fear-stricken eye at the hut which he have think empty he do not know that there be three people behind he watch he what have they see what have they understand catrina and maggie run toward paul they be on snow-shoe and make short work of the intervene distance paul have rise to he foot he face be grave there be a singular gleam in he eye which be not a gleam of mere excitement such as the chase bring into some man 's eye steinmetz look at he and say nothing for a moment paul stand still he look round he note with experienced glance the lay of the whole incident -- the dead form of the bear ten yard behind he late hiding-place one hundred and eighty yard from the hut one hundred and sixty yard from the spot whence karl steinmetz have send he unerring bullet through the bear 's brain paul see it all he measure the distance he look at de chauxville standing white-faced at he post not fifty yard from the carcass of the second bear paul seem to see no one but de chauxville he go straight toward he and the whole party follow in breathless suspense steinmetz be nearest to he watch with he keen quiet eye paul go up to de chauxville and take the rifle from he hand he open the breech and look into the barrel they be clean the rifle have not be fire off he give a little laugh of contempt and throw the rifle at de chauxville 's foot turn abruptly away it be catrina who speak if you have kill he she say i would have kill you steinmetz pick up the rifle close the breech and hand it to de chauxville with a queer smile chapter xxxii a cloud when the osterno party reach home that same evening the starosta be wait to see steinmetz he news be such that steinmetz send for paul and the three man go together to the little room beyond the smoking-room in the old part of the castle well say paul with the unconscious hauteur which make he a prince to these people the starosta spread out he hand you excellency he answer i be afraid of what the starosta shrug he narrow shoulder in cringe deprecation excellency i do not know there be something in the village -- something in the whole country i know not what it be it be a feeling -- one can not see it one can not define it but it be there like the gleam of water at the bottom of a deep well the moujik be get dangerous they will not speak to I i be suspect i be watch he shifty eye like black bead flit from side to side as he speak he be like a weasel at bay it be the face of a man who go in bodily fear i will go with you down to the village now say paul be there any excuse -- any illness ah excellency reply the chief there be always that excuse paul look at the clock i will go now he say he begin he simple preparation at once there be dinner to be think of suggest steinmetz with a resigned smile it be half-past seven dinner can wait reply paul in english you might tell the lady that i have go out and will dine alone when i come back steinmetz shrug he broad shoulder i think you be a fool he say to go alone if they discover you identity they will tear you to piece i be not afraid of they reply paul with he head in the medicine cupboard any more than i be afraid of a horse they be like horse they do not know they own strength with this difference add steinmetz that the moujik will one day make the discovery he be begin to make it now the starosta be quite right paul there be something in the air it be about time that you take the lady away from here and leave I to manage it alone that time will never come again answer paul i be not go to leave you alone again he be push he arm into the sleeve of the old brown coat reach to he heel a garment which command as much love and respect in osterno as ever would a angel 's wing steinmetz open the drawer of he bureau and lay a revolver on the table at all event he say you may as well have the wherewithal to make a fight of it if the worst come to the worst as you like answer paul slip the fire-arm into he pocket the starosta move away a pace or two he be essentially a man of peace half a hour later it become know in the village that the moscow doctor be in the house of one ivan krass where he be prepare to see all patient who be now suffer from infectious complaint the door of this cottage be soon besiege by the sick and the idle while the starosta stand in the door-way and keep order within in the one dwelling-room of the cottage be assemble as picturesque and as unsavory a group as the most enthusiastic modern slummer could desire to see paul standing by the table with two paraffin lamp place behind he see each suppliant in turn and all the while he keep up a run conversation with the more intelligent some of whom linger on to talk and watch ah john the son of john he would say what be the matter with you it be not often i see you i think you be clean and thrifty to which john the son of john reply that the winter have be hard and fuel scarce that he wife be dead and he child stricken with influenza but you have have relief we good friend the starosta -- do what he can grumble john but he dare not do much the bárins will not let he the noble want all the money for themselves the emperor be live in he palace where there be fountain of wine we pay for that with we tax you see my hand -- i can not work but i must pay the tax or else we shall be turn out into the street paul while attend to the wounded hand -- a old story of a old wound neglect and a constitution with all the natural healing power drain out of it by hunger and want and vodka -- paul ever watchful glance round and see sullen lowering face eager eye hungry cruel lip but the winter be over now you be mistaken about the noble they do what they can the emperor pay for the relief that you have have all these month it be foolish to talk as you do i only tell the truth reply the man wince as paul deliberately cut away the dead flesh we know now why it be that we be all so poor why ask paul pour some lotion over a wad of lint and speak indifferently because the noble -- begin the man and some one nudge he from behind urge he to silence you need not be afraid of I say paul i tell no tale and i take no money then why do you come ask a voice in the background some one pay you who be it ah tulum say paul without look up you be there be you the great tulum there be a hardworking sober man my little father who never beat he wife and never drink and never borrow money a useful neighbor what be the matter with you tula you have be too spare with the vodka no doubt i must order you a glass every hour there be a little laugh but paul who know these people be quite alive to the difference of feeling toward himself they still accept he care he help he medicine but they be begin to doubt he there be you own prince he go on fearlessly to the man whose hand he be bind up he will help you when there be real distress a ominous silence greet this observation paul raise he head and look round in the dim light of the two smoky lamp he see a ring of wild face man with shaggy beard and hair all entangled and unkempt with fierce eye and lower glance woman with face that unsex they there be despair and desperation and utter recklessness in the air in the attitude in the heart of these people and paul have work among they for year the sight would have be heart-breaking have paul howard alexi be the sort of man to admit the possibility of a broken heart all that he have do have be frustrate by the wall of heartless bureaucracy against which he have pitch he single strength there be no visible progress these be not the face of man and woman move up the social scale by the aid of education and the deeper self-respect that follow it some of they be young although they hardly look it they be young in year but old in life and misery some of they he know to be educate he have pay for the education himself he have risk he own personal freedom to procure it for they and misery have kill the seed he look on this stony ground and he stout heart be tear with pity it be easy to be patient in social economy when that vague jumble of impossible idea be calmly discuss across the dinner-table but the result seem hopelessly distant when the mass of the poor and wretched stand before one in the flesh paul know that this little room be only a specimen of the whole of russium each of these poor peasant represent a million -- equally hopeless equally powerless to contend with a impossible taxation he could not give they money because the tax-collector have they all under he thumb and would exact the last kopeck the question be far above he single-handed reach and he do not dare to meet it openly and seek the assistance of the few fellow-noble who face the position without fear he could not see in the brutal face before he one spark of intelligence one little gleam of independence and self-respect which could be attribute to he endeavor which the most sanguine construction could take as result from he time and money give to a hopeless cause well he say have you nothing to tell I of

loquacious orator of the kabak and he be at that moment be quietly hustle out of the room after this there be a sullen silence which paul could not charm away charm he never so wisely when he patient have at last ebb away he light a cigarette and walk thoughtfully back to the castle there be danger in the air and this be one of those man upon whom danger act as a pleasant stimulant chapter xxxiii the net be draw during the day follow paul 's visit to the village the lady do not see much male society paul and steinmetz usually leave the castle immediately after breakfast and do not return till nightfall be there any thing wrong maggie ask steinmetz on the evening of the second day steinmetz have just come into the vast drawing-room dress for dinner -- stout placid and very clean-looking they be alone in the room nothing my dear young lady -- yet he answer come forward and rub he broad palm slowly together maggie be read a english newspaper she turn its page without pause to notice the black and sticky obliteration effect by the postal authority before delivery it be no new thing to she now to come upon the press censor 's handiwork in the column of such periodical and newspaper as paul receive from england because she say if there be you need not be afraid of tell I to have that fear would be to offer you a insult reply steinmetz paul and i be investigate matter that be all the plain truth my dear young lady be that we do not know ourselves what be in the wind we only know there be something you be a horsewoman -- you know the feeling of a restive horse one know that he

carefully we be seek for the fly on the horse 's body -- you understand yes i understand she give a little nod she have not lose color but there be a anxious look in she eye some people would have send to tver for the soldier steinmetz go on but paul be not that sort of man he will not do it yet you remember we conversation at the charity ball in london yes i do not want you to come then i be sorry you have come now maggie lay aside the newspaper with a little laugh but herr steinmetz she say i be not afraid please remember that i have absolute faith in you -- and in paul steinmetz accept

indium gott what wonderful people you english be -- man and woman alike you remember how the lady keep up and brazen it out before the servant you must do the same i think i hear the rustle of the princess 's dress yes and there be no news in the papers you say none reply maggie it may not have be entirely by chance that claude de chauxville drive over to osterno to pay he respects the next day and express himself desolate at hear that the prince have go out with herr steinmetz in a sleigh to a distant corner of the estate my horse must rest say the frenchman calmly take off he fur glove perhaps the princess will see I a few minute later he be show into the morning-room do i see mlle delafield on snow-shoe in the forest as i come along de chauxville ask the servant in perfect russian before the man leave the room doubtless excellency she go out on she snow-shoe half a hour ago that be all right say the frenchman to himself when the door be close he go to the fire and warm he slim white finger there be a evil smile lurk beneath he mustache when etta open the door a minute later he bow low without speak there be a suggestion of triumph in he attitude well say the princess without acknowledge he salutation de chauxville raise he eyebrow with the resigned surprise of a man to whom no feminine humor be new he bring forward a chair will you sit he say with exaggerated courtesy i have much to say to you besides we have all the time you husband and he german friend be mile away i pass miss delafield in the forest she be not quite at home on she snow-shoe yet she can not be back for at least half a hour etta bite she lip as she look at the chair she sit slowly down and draw in the fold of she rich dress i have the good fortune to find you alone so you have inform I she reply coldly de chauxville lean against the mantel-piece and look down at she thoughtfully at the bear-hunt the other day he say i have the misfortune to -- well to fall out with the prince we be not quite at one on a question of etiquette he think that i ought to have fire i do not fire i be not ready it appear that the prince consider himself to be in danger he be nervous -- flurry you be not always artistic in you untruth interrupted etta i know nothing of the incident to which you refer but in lie you should always endeavor to be consistent i be sure paul be not nervous -- or flurry de chauxville smile imperturbably he end be gain etta obviously know nothing of he attempt to murder paul at the bear-hunt it be nothing he go on we do not come to word but we have never be much in sympathy the coldness be intensify that be all so i take the opportunity of call when i know he be away how do you know he be away ah madame i know more than i be credit with etta give a little laugh and shrug she shoulder you do not care for osterno suggest de chauxville i hate it precisely and i be here to help you to get away from russium once for all ah you may shake you head some day perhaps i shall succeed in convince you that i have only you interest at heart i be here princess to make a little arrangement with you -- a final arrangement i hope he pause look at she with a sudden gleam in he eye not the last of all he add in a different tone that will make you my wife etta allow this statement to pass unchallenged she courage and energy be not exhaust she be learn to nurse she force you husband go on de chauxville after he have sufficiently enjoy the savor of he own word be a brave man to frighten he it be necessary to resort to strong measure the last and the strongest measure in the diplomat 's scale be the people the people madame will take no denial it be a game i have play before -- a dangerous game but i be not afraid you need not trouble to be theatrical with I put in etta scornfully she be sit with a patch of color in either cheek at time this man have the power of move she and she be afraid of allow he to exercise it she know she own weakness -- she inordinate vanity for vanity be the weakness of strong woman she be ever open to flattery and claude de chauxville flatter she in every word he speak for by act and speech he make it manifest that she be the motive power of he existence a man who play for a high stake go on the frenchman in a quieter voice must be content to throw he all on the table time after time a week to-night -- Thursday the 5th of April -- i will throw down my all on the turn of a card for the people be like that it be rouge or noir -- one never know we only know that there be no third color no compromise etta be listen now with ill-disguised interest at last he have give she something definite -- a date on Thursday he go on the peasant will make a demonstration you know as well as i do -- as well as prince pavlo do despite he imperturbable face -- that the whole country be a volcano which may break forth at any moment but the control be strong and therefore there be never a large eruption -- a grumble here a gleam of fire there a sullen heat everywhere but it be hold in check by the impossibility of communication it seem strange but russium stand because she have no penny postage the great crash will come not by force of arm but by way of peace the signal will be a postal system the standard of the revolution will be a postage-stamp all over this country there be million wait and burn to rise up and crush despotism but they be hold in check by the simple fact that they be far apart and they can not write to each other when at last they be bring together there will be no fight at all because they will overwhelm they enemy that time madame have not come yet we be only at the stage of tentative underground rumbling but a little eruption be enough to wipe out one man if he be stand on the spot go on say etta quietly -- too quietly de chauxville might have think have he be calmer i want you he go on to assist I we shall be ready on Thursday i shall not appear in the matter at all i have strong colleague at my back starvation and misery properly handle be strong incentive and how do you propose to handle they ask etta in the same quiet voice the peasant will make a demonstration the rest we must leave to -- well to the course of fortune i have no doubt that we astute friend karl steinmetz will manage to hold they in check but whatever the end of the demonstration the outcome will be the impossibility of a longer residence in this country for the prince pavlo alexi a regiment of soldier could hardly make it possible i do not understand say etta what you describe as a demonstration -- be it a rise de chauxville nod with a grin in force to take what they want by force ask the princess de chauxville spread out he hand in he graceful gallic way that depend and what do you wish I to do asked etta with the same concentrated quiet in the first place to believe that no harm will come to you either directly or indirectly they would not dare to touch the prince they will content themselves with break a few window what do you want I to do repeat etta de chauxville pause merely he answer lightly to leave open a door -- a side door i understand that there be a door in the old portion of the castle lead up by a flight of stair to the smoking-room and thence to the new part of the building etta do not answer de chauxville glance at he watch and walk to the window where he stand look out he be too refine a person to whistle but he attitude be suggestive of that mode of kill time this door i wish you to unbar yourself before dinner on Thursday evening he say turn round and slowly come toward she and i refuse to do it say etta ah etta spring to she foot and face he -- a beautiful woman a very queen of anger she blaze eye be on a level with he yes she cry with clenched fist stand she full height till she seem to look down into he mean fox-like face yes i refuse to betray my husband -- stop he be not you husband slowly the anger fade out of she eye she clenched fist relax she finger be scrape nervously at the silk of she dress like the finger of a child seek support she seem to lose several inch of she majestic stature what do you mean she whisper what do you mean sydney bamborough be you husband say the frenchman without take he dull eye from she face he be dead she hiss prove it he walk past she and lean against the mantelpiece in the pose of easy familiarity which he have maintain during the first portion of they interview prove it madame he say again he die at tver she say but there be no conviction in she voice with she title and position to hold to she could face the world without these what be she a local newspaper report that the body of a man be discover on the plain of tver and duly bury in the pauper cemetery say de chauxville indifferently you husband -- sydney bamborough i mean -- be for reason which need not be go into here in the neighborhood of tver at the time a police officer who have since be transfer to odessa be of the opinion that the dead man be a foreigner there be about twelve thousand foreigner in tver -- operative in the manufactory you husband -- sydney bamborough bien entendu -- leave tver to proceed eastward and cross siberium to china in order to avoid the emissary of the charity league who be look out for he at the western frontier he will be due at one of the treaty port in china in about a month upon the supposition that the body discover on the plain of tver be that of you husband you take the opportunity of become a princess it be enterprising i admire you spirit but it be dangerous i madame can suppress sydney bamborough when he turn up i have two arrow in my quiver for he one be the charity league the other the russian government who want he you husband -- i beg you pardon the prince -- would perhaps take a different view of the case it be a pretty story i will tell it to he unless i have you implicit obedience etta stand dry-lipped before he she try to speak but no word come from she lip de chauxville look at she with a quiet smile of triumph and she know that he love she there be no define love nor tell when it merge into hatred Thursday evening before dinner say de chauxville and he leave she standing on the hearth-rug she lip move and frame no word chapter xxxiv a appeal have you speak to the princess ask steinmetz without take the cigar from he lip they be drive home through the forest that surround osterno as the sea surround a island they be alone in the sleigh that which they have be do have require no servant paul be drive and consequently the three horse be go as hard as they could the snow fly past they face like the foam over the gunwale of a boat that be thrash into a ten-knot breeze yet it be not all snow there be fleck of foam from the horse ' mouth mingle with it yes answer paul he face be set and hard he eye stern this trouble with the peasant be affect he more keenly than he suspect it be change the man 's face -- draw line about he lip streak he forehead with the mark of care he position can hardly be realize by a englishman unless it be compare to that of the captain of a great sinking ship full of human soul who have be place under he care and what do she say ask steinmetz that she would not leave unless we all go with she steinmetz draw the fur closer up round he yes he say glancing at he companion 's face and see little but the eye by reason of the sable collar of he coat which meet the fur of he cap yes and why not i can not leave they answer paul i can not go away now that there be trouble among they what it be goodness only know they would never have get like this by themselves somebody have be at they and i do not think it be the nihilist it be worse than that some devil have be stir they up and they know no better he be still at it they be get worse day by day and i can not catch he if i do by god steinmetz i 'll twist he neck steinmetz smile grimly yes he answer you be capable of it for I i be get tired of the moujik he be a inveterate incurable fool if he be go to be a dangerous fool as well i should almost be incline to let he go to the devil in he own way i dare

toil and slave and legislate for they i have not learn medicine that i might doctor they i have not risk my health and life in they sty where pig would refuse to live i have not give my whole heart and soul to they welfare to receive no thanks but only hatred no it be different for I i owe they nothing mein lieber that be the difference if i agree to make a bolt for petersburg to-morrow will you come retorted paul no answer the stout man i think not you cynicism be only a matter of word steinmetz and not of deed there be no question of either of we leave osterno we must stay and fight it right out here that be so answer steinmetz with the teutonic stolidity of manner which sometimes come over he but the lady -- what of they paul do not answer they be pass over the rise of a heavy drift it be necessary to keep the horse up to they work to prevent the runner of the sleigh sink into the snow with voice and whip paul encourage they he be kind to animal but never spare they -- a strong man who give freely of he strength and expect a equal generosity this be no place for miss delafield add steinmetz look straight in front of he i know that answer paul sharply i wish to god she be not here he add in a lower tone and the word be lose beneath the frozen mustache steinmetz make no answer they drive on through the gathering gloom the sky be of a yellow gray and the earth reflect the dismal hue of it presently it begin to snow driving in a fine haze from the north the two man lapse into silence steinmetz bury in he fur like a great cumbrous bear appear to be half asleep they have have a long and wearisome day the horse have cover they forty mile and more from village to village where the two man have only gather discouragement and foreboding some of the starosta be sullen other openly scared none of they be glad to see steinmetz paul have never dare to betray he identity with the gendarme -- the tchinovnik -- they have not deem it wise to hold communication stop cry steinmetz suddenly and paul pull the horse on to they haunch i think you be asleep he say there be no one in sight they be drive along the new road now the high-way paul have construct from osterno to tver the road itself be of course indistinguishable but the telegraph post mark its course steinmetz tumble heavily out of he fur and go toward the nearest telegraph post where be the wire he shout paul follow he in the sleigh together they peer up into the darkness and the fall snow the post be there but the wire be go a whole length of it have be remove they be cut off from civilization by one hundred and forty mile of untrodden snow steinmetz clamber back into the sleigh and draw up the fur apron he give a strange little laugh that have a ring of boyish excitement in it this man have not always be stout and placid he too have have he day and those who know he say that it have be a stir one that settle one question he say which question ask paul he be drive as hard as the horse could lay hoof to ground take with a sudden misgiving and a great desire to reach osterno before dark the question of the lady reply steinmetz it be too late for they to go now the village nestle beneath the grim protection of osterno be desert and forlorn all the door be close the meager curtain draw it be very cold there be a sense of relief in this great frost for when nature put forth she strength man be usually cow thereby at the castle all seem to be in order the groom in he great sheepskin coat be wait in the doorway the servant throw open the vast door and stand respectfully in the warm brilliantly light hall while they master pass in where be the princess steinmetz ask he valet while he be remove the evidence of a long day in the open air in she drawing-room excellency then go and ask she if she will give I a cup of tea in a few minute and the man a timorous german go a few minute later steinmetz present himself at the door of the little drawing-room attach to etta 's suite of room find the princess in a matchless tea-gown wait beside a table laden with silver tea appliance a dainty samovar a tiny tea-pot a spirit-lamp and the rest all in the wonderful silver-work of the slavonskus bazaar in moscow you see she say with a smile for she always smile on man i have obey you order steinmetz bow gravely he be one of the few man who could see that smile and be strong he close the door carefully behind he no mention be make of the fact that he message have imply and she have understand that he wish to see she alone etta be rather pale there be a anxious look in she eye -- behind the smile as it be she be afraid of this man she look at the flame of the samovar busy herself among the tea-thing with pretty curving finger and rustling sleeve but the tea be never make i begin to think say steinmetz come to the point in he bluff way that you be a sort of beautiful jonah a graceful stormy petrel a fair wander jewess there be always trouble where you go she glance at he broad face and read nothing there go on she say what have i be do now how you do hate I herr steinmetz perhaps it be safer than loving you he answer with he grim humor i suppose she say with a quaint little air of resignation which be very disarm that you have come here to scold I -- you do not want any tea no i do not want any tea she turn the wick of the spirit-lamp and the peaceful music of the samovar be still in she clever eye there be a little air of sidelong indecision she could not make up she mind how to take he she chiefest method be so old as to be biblical yet she could not take he with she eyelid she have try you be horribly grave she say the situation he reply be horribly grave etta look up at he as he stand before she and the lamp-light fall on the perfect oval of she face show it to be white and draw princess say the man there be in the life of some of we time when we cease to be man and woman and become mere human being there be time i mean when the thousand influence of sex die at one blow of fate this be such a time we must forget that you be a beautiful woman i verily believe that there be none more beautiful in the world i once know one whom i admire more but that be not because she be more beautiful that however be my own story and this -- he pause and look round the little room furnished decorate for she comfort -- this be you story we must forget that i be a man and therefore subject to the influence of you beauty she sit look up into he strong grave face and during all that follow she never move i know you he say to be courageous and must ask you to believe that i exaggerate nothing in what i be about to tell you i tell it to you instead of leave paul to do so because i know he complete fearlessness and he blind faith in a people who be unworthy of it he do not realize the gravity of the situation they be he own people a sailor never believe that he own ship be unseaworthy go on say etta for he have pause this country he continue be unsettle the people of the estate be on the brink of a revolt you know what the russian peasant be it will be no parisian émeute half noise half laughter we can not hope to hold this old place against they we can not get away from it we can not send for help because we have no one to send princess this be no time for half-confidence i know -- for i know these people better even than paul know they -- i be convince that this be not the outcome of they own brain they be be urge on by some one there be some one at they back this be no revolt of the peasant organize by the peasant princess you must tell I all you know i -- i she stammer i know nothing and then suddenly she burst into tear and bury she face in a tiny useless handkerchief it be so unlike she and so sudden that steinmetz be startle he lay he great hand soothingly on she shoulder i know he say quietly i know more than you think i be no saint princess myself i too have have my difficulty i have have my temptation and i have not always resist god know it be difficult for man to do always the right thing it be a thousand time more difficult for woman when we speak together in petersburg and i offer you my poor friendship i be not act in the dark i know as much then as i do now princess i know about the charity league papers i know more than any except stépan lanovitch and it be he who tell I he be stroke she shoulder with the soothing movement that one use toward a child in distress he great hand broad and thick have a certain sense of quiet comfort and strength in it etta cease sob and sit with bow head look through she tear into the gay wood fire it be probable that she fail to realize the great charity of the man who be speak to she for the capacity for evil merge at some point or other into incapability for comprehend good be that all he know she be wonder the suggestion that sydney bamborough be not dead have rise up to eclipse all other fear in she mind in some part she thought reach he i know so much he say that it be safest to tell I more i offer you my friendship because i think that no woman could carry through you difficulty unaided princess the admiration of claude de chauxville may be pleasant but i venture to think that my friendship be essential etta raise she head a little she be within a ace of hand over to karl steinmetz the rod of power hold over she by the frenchman there be something in steinmetz that appeal to she and soften she something that reach a tender part of she heart through the coating of vanity through the hardness of worldly experience i have know de chauxville twenty-five year he go on and etta defer she confession we have never be good friend i admit i be no saint princess but de chauxville be a villain some day you may discover when it be too late that it would have be for paul 's happiness for you happiness for every one 's good to have nothing more to do with claude de chauxville i want to save you that discovery will you act upon my advice will you make a stand now will you come to I and tell I all that de chauxville know about you that he could ever use against you will you give yourself into my hand -- give I you battle to fight you can not do it alone only believe in my friendship princess that be all i ask etta shake she head i think not she answer in a voice too light too superficial too hopelessly shallow for the depth of the moment she be think only of sydney bamborough and of that dread secret she fight with what arm she wield best -- the lightest the quickest the most baffling as you will say steinmetz chapter xxxv on the edge of the storm a russian village kabak with a smoking lamp of which the chimney be break the greasy curtain draw across the small window exclude the faintest possibility of a draught the moujik do not like a draught in fact he hate the fresh air of heaven air that have be breathe three or four time over be the air for he it be warmer the atmosphere of this particular inn be not unlike that of every other inn in the white empire inasmuch as it be heavily seasoned with the scent of cabbage soup the odor of this nourishing compound be only exceed in unpleasantness by the taste of the same add to this warm smell there be the smoke of a score of the very cheapest cigarette the russian peasant smoke he cigarette now it be the first step and it do not cost he much it be the dawn of progress -- the thin end of the wedge which will broaden out into anarchy the poor man who smoke a cigarette be sure to pass on to socialistic opinion and trouble in the market-place witness the cigarette-smoking country moreover this same poor man be not a pleasant companion he smoke a poor cigarette there be also the smell of vodka which bottle curse be stand in tumbler all down the long table the news have spread in osterno that vodka be to be have for the ask at the kabak where there be a meeting needless to say the meeting be a large one foolishness and thirst be often find in the same head -- a cranium which by the way be exceptionally liable to be turn by knowledge or drink if the drink at the kabak of osterno be dangerous the knowledge be no less so i tell you little father a orator be shout that the day of the capitalist have go the rich man -- the prince the noble the great merchant the monopolist the tchinovnik -- tremble they know that the poor man be awaken at last from he long lethargy what have we do in germany what have we do in america what have we do in england and france whereupon he bang a unwashed fist upon the table with such emphasis that more than one of the audience clutch he glass of vodka in alarm lest a drop of the precious liquor should be waste no one seem to know what have be do in germany in america in england or in france the people 's orator be a man of many question and much fist-banging the moujik of osterno gaze at he beneath they shaggy brow half of they do not understand he they be as yet uneducated to a comprehension of the street orator 's period a few of the more intelligent wait for he to answer he own question which he fail to do a vague and ominous question carry as much weight with some people as a statement and have the signal advantage of be less incriminate the speaker -- a neckless broad-shouldered ruffian of the type know in england as unemployed -- look round with triumphant head well throw back from he attitude it be obvious that he have be the salvation of the country name and have now come to russia to do the same for she he speak with the throaty accent of the pole it be quite evident that he speech be a write one -- probably a print harangue issue to he and he compeer for circulation throughout the country he deliver many of the longer word with a certain unctuous roll of the tongue and a emphasis indicate the fact that he do not know they meaning from afar he go on we have long be watch you we have note you difficulty and you hardship you sickness you starvation ` these man of tver ' we have say ` be brave and true and steadfast we will tell they of liberty ' so i have come to you and i be glad to see you alexander alexandrovitch pass the bottle down the table you see little father i have not come beg for you money no keep you kopeck in you pocket we do not want you money we be no tchinovnik we prove it by give you vodka to keep you throat wet and you ear open fill up you glass -- fill up you glass the little father of osterno understand this part of the harangue perfectly and act upon it the orator scratch he head reflectively there be a certain business-like mouthing of he period show that he have learn all this by heart he do not press all he point home in the manner of one speaking from he own brain i see before I he go on without a overplus of sequence man worthy to take they place among the ruler of the world -- eh -- er -- ruler of the world little father he pause and drink half a tumbler of vodka he last statement be so obviously inapplicable -- what he actually do see be so very far remove from what he say he see -- that he decide to relinquish the point i drink he cry to liberty and equality some of the little father also drink to assuage a hereditary thirst and now continue the orator let we get to business i think we understand each other he look round with a engaging smile upon face brutal enough to suit he purpose but quite devoid of intelligence there be not much understanding there the poor man have one only way of make himself feel -- force we have work for generation we have toil in

child draw and hold a mother 's love paul howard alexi be not a man to analyze he thought you strong man be usually ignorant of the existence of he own feeling he be never conscious of they paul walk slowly through the village of osterno and realize in he uncompromising honesty that of the nine hundred man who live therein there be not three upon whom he could rely he have uphold he peasant for year against the cynic truth of karl steinmetz he have resolutely refuse to admit even to himself that they be as devoid of gratitude as they be of wisdom and this be the end of all one of the man follow he hurry on and catch he up excellency he gasp breathless with he haste you must not come here alone any longer i be afraid of they -- i have no control paul pause and suit he pace to the

the nihilist and they do not want money excellency that seem strange very admit paul ironically and they give vodka this seem to be the chief stumbling-block in the starosta 's road to a solution of the mystery find out for I say paul after a pause who this man be where he come from and how much he be pay to open he mouth we will pay he more to shut it find out as much as you can and let I know to-morrow i will try excellency but i have little hope of succeed they distrust I they send the child to my shop for what they want and the little one have evidently be tell not to chatter the moujik avoid I when they meet I what can i do you can show they that you be not afraid of they answer paul that go a long way with the moujik they walk on together through the lane of cottage where furtive form lurk in door-way and behind curtain and paul have only one word of advice to give upon which he harp continually : be thou very courageous -- be thou very courageous nothing new for so it be write in the oldest book of all the starosta be a timorous man need such strong support as he master give he from time to time at the great gate of the park they pause and paul give the mayor of osterno a few last word of advice while they be stand there the other man who have be follow join they be that you steinmetz ask paul he hand thrust with suspicious speed into he jacket pocket yes what be you do here watch you answer karl steinmetz in he mild way it be no longer safe for either of we to go about alone it be mere foolery you go to that kabak chapter xxxvi à troi of all the room in the great castle etta like the morning-room best person of a troubled mind usually love to look upon a wide prospect the mind no doubt fear the unseen approach of detection or danger and transmit this dread to the eye which like to command a wide view all around the great drawing-room be only use after dinner until that time the lady spend the day either in they own boudoir or in the morning-room look over the cliff here while the cold weather last etta have tea serve and thither the gentleman usually repair at the hour set apart for the homely meal they have come regularly the last few evening paul and steinmetz have suddenly give up they long drive to distant part of the estate here the whole party be assemble on the Sunday afternoon follow paul 's visit to the village kabak and to they come a unexpected guest the door be throw open and claude de chauxville pale but self-possessed and quiet come into the room the perfect ease of he manner bespoke a practice familiarity with the position difficult he last parting with paul and steinmetz have be to say the least of it strain maggie he know dislike and distrust he etta hate and fear he he be in ride costume -- a short fur jacket fur glove a cap in he hand and a silver-mounted crop a fine figure of a man -- smart well turn out well-groomed -- a gentleman prince he say frankly i have come to throw myself upon you generosity will you lend I a horse i be ride in the forest when my horse fall over a root and lame himself i find i be only three mile from osterno so i come my misfortune must be my excuse for this -- intrusion paul perform graciously enough that which charity and politeness demand of he there be plenty of people who trade unscrupulously upon these demand but it be probable that they mostly have they reward love and friendship be stronger than charity and politeness and those who trade upon the latter be rarely accord the former so paul ignore the probability that de chauxville have lame he horse on purpose and offer he refreshment while he saddle be be transfer to the back of a fresh mount farther than that he do not go he do not consider himself call upon to offer a night 's hospitality to the man who have attempt to murder he a week before with engaging frankness de chauxville accept every thing it be a art soon acquire and soon abused there be something honest in a ungracious acceptance of favor steinmetz suggest that perhaps m de chauxville have lunch sparsely and the frenchman admit that such be the case but that he love afternoon tea above all meal it be so innocent and simple -- i know i have the same feeling myself concur steinmetz courteously do you ride about the country much alone ask paul while the servant be set before this uninvited guest a few more substantial delicacy ah no prince this be my first attempt and if it have not procure I this pleasure i should say that it will be my last it be easy to lose yourself say paul besides -- and the two friend watch the frenchman 's face closely -- besides the country be disturb at present de chauxville be help himself daintily to pâté de foie gras ah indeed be that so he answer but they would not hurt I -- a stranger in the land and a orphan too i have no doubt add steinmetz with a laugh but would the moujik pause to enquire my very dear de chauxville at all event i should not pause to answer reply the frenchman in the same light tone i should evacuate ah mademoiselle he go on address maggie they have be attempt to frighten you i suspect with they story of disturbed peasantry it be to keep up the lurid local color they must have they romance these russian and so the ball be keep roll there be never any lack of conversation when steinmetz and de chauxville be together nor be the talk without sub-flavor of acidity at length the center of attention himself divert that attention he inaugurate a argument over the best cross-country route from osterno to thor which send steinmetz out of the room for a map during the absence of the watchful german he admire the view from the window and this strategetic movement enable he to say to etta aside : i must see you before i leave the house it be absolutely necessary not long after the return of steinmetz and the final decision respect the road to thor etta leave the room and a few minute later the servant announce that the baron 's horse be at the door de chauxville take he leave at once with many assurance of lasting gratitude kindly he add make my adieu to the princess i will not trouble she quite by accident he meet etta at the head of the state staircase and express such admiration for the castle that she open the door of the large drawing-room and take he to see that apartment what i arrange for Thursday be for the day after to-morrow -- Tuesday say de chauxville as soon as they be alone we can not keep they back any longer you understand -- the side door to be open at seven o'clock ah who be this they both turn steinmetz be stand behind they but he could not have hear de chauxville 's word he close the door carefully and come forward with he grim smile à nous troi he say and the subsequent conversation be in the language in which these three understand each other best de chauxville bit he lip and wait it be a moment of the tensest suspense à nous troi repeat steinmetz de chauxville you love a epigram the man who overestimate the foolishness of other be himself the biggest fool concern a lame horse -- the prince 's generosity -- make you adieu mon dieu you should know I better than that after all these year no you need not look at the door no one will interrupt we i have see to that he attitude and manner indicate a complete mastery of the situation but whether this assumption be justify by fact or be a mere trick it be impossible to say there be in the man something strong and good and calm -- a manner never acquire by one who have anything to conceal he dignity be perfect one forget he stoutness he heavy breathing he ungainly size he be essentially manly and a presence to be fear the strength of he will make itself feel he turn to the princess with the grave courtesy that always mark he attitude toward she madame he say i fully recognize you cleverness in raise yourself to the position you now occupy but i would remind you that that position carry with it certain obligation it be hardly dignified for a princess to engage herself in a vulgar love intrigue in she own house it be not a vulgar love intrigue cry etta with blaze eye i will not allow you to say that where be you boast friendship be this a sample of it karl steinmetz bow gravely with outspread hand madame that friendship be at you service now as always de chauxville give a scornful little laugh he be bite the end of he mustache as he watch etta 's face for a moment the woman stand -- not the first woman to stand thus -- between two fear then she turn to steinmetz the victory be he -- the greatest he have ever tear from the grasp of claude de chauxville you know she say that this man have I in he power you alone but not both of we together answer steinmetz de chauxville look uneasy he give a careless little laugh my good steinmetz you allow you imagination to run away with you you interfere in what do not concern you my very dear de chauxville i think not at all event i be go to continue to interfere etta look from one to the other she have at the first impulse go over to steinmetz she be now meditate draw back if de chauxville keep cool all might yet be well -- the dread secret of the probability of sydney bamborough be alive might still be withhold from steinmetz for the moment it would appear that she be about to occupy the ignominious position of the bone of contention if these two man be go to use she as a mere excuse to settle a lifelong quarrel of many issue it be probable that there would not be much left of she character by the time that they have finish she have to decide quickly she decide to assume the role of peacemaker m de chauxville be on the point of go she say let he go m de chauxville be not go until i have finish with he madame this may be the last time we meet i hope it be de chauxville look uneasy he be a ready wit and fear be the only feeling that paralyze it etta look at he be he wit go to desert he now when he most need it he have ride boldly into the lion 's den such a proceeding require a certain courage but a higher form of intrepidity be require to face the lion standing before the exit de chauxville look at steinmetz with shifty eye he be very like the mask of the lynx in the smoking-room even to the self-conscious deprecatory smile on the countenance of the forest sneak keep you temper he say do not let we quarrel in the presence of a lady no we will keep the quarrel till afterward steinmetz turn to etta princess he say will you now in my presence forbid this man to come to this or any other house of yours will you forbid he to address himself either by speech or letter to you again you know i can not do that reply etta why not etta make no answer because reply de chauxville for she the princess be too wise to make a enemy of I in that respect she be wiser than you she know that i could send you and you prince to siberium steinmetz laugh nonsense he say princess he go on if you think that the fact of de chauxville numbering among he friend a few obscure police spy give he the right to persecute you you be mistaken we friend be very clever but he can do no harm with the little that he know of the charity league etta remain silent the silence make steinmetz frown princess he say gravely you be indignant just now because i make so bold as to put the most natural construction upon the circumstance in which i find you it be a prearranged meeting between de chauxville and yourself if the meeting be not the outcome of a intrigue such as i mention nor the result of this man 's hold over you on account of the charity league what be it i beg of you to answer etta make no reply instead she raise she eye and look at de chauxville without go into affair which do not concern you say the frenchman answering for she i think you will recognize that the secret of the charity league be quite sufficient excuse for I to request a few minute alone with the princess of this steinmetz take no notice he be stand in front of etta between de chauxville and the door he broad deeply line face be flush with the excitement of the moment he great mournful eye yellow and draw with much reading and the hardship of a rigorous climate be fix anxiously on she face etta be not look at he she eye be turn toward the window but they do not see with comprehension she be stony and stubborn princess say steinmetz answer I before it be too late have de chauxville any other hold over you etta nod and the little action bring a sudden gleam to the frenchman 's eye if say steinmetz look from one to the other if you two have be deceive paul i will have no mercy i warn you of that etta turn on he can you not believe I she cry i have practice no deception in common with m de chauxville the charity league be quite enough for you my friend put in the frenchman hurriedly you know no more of the charity league than you do before -- than the whole world know before -- except this lady 's share in the disposal of the papers say steinmetz and this lady 's share in the disposal of the papers will not be welcome news to the prince answer de chauxville welcome or unwelcome he shall be tell of it to-night etta look round sharply she lip apart and tremble by whom ask de chauxville by I reply steinmetz there be a momentary pause de chauxville and etta exchange a glance etta feel that she be lose this frenchman be not one to spare either man or woman from any motive of charity or chivalry even if that be so he say the princess be not relieve from the embarrassment of she situation no no my astute friend there be a little matter connect with sydney bamborough which have come to my knowledge etta move but she say nothing the sound of she breathing be startlingly loud ah sydney bamborough say steinmetz slowly what about he he be not dead that be all karl steinmetz pass he broad hand down over he face cover he mouth for a second but he die he be find on the steppe and bury at tver so the story run say de chauxville with easy sarcasm but who find he on the steppe who bury he at tver i do my friend the next second steinmetz stagger back a step or two as etta fall heavily into he arm but he never take he eye off de chauxville chapter xxxvii à deux steinmetz lay etta on a sofa she be already recover consciousness he ring the bell twice and all the while he keep he eye on de chauxville a quick touch on etta 's wrist and breast show that this man know something of woman and of those short-lived fainting fit that belong to strong emotion the maid soon come the princess require you attention say steinmetz still watch de chauxville who be look at etta and neglect he opportunity steinmetz go up to he and take he by the arm come with I he say the frenchman could have take advantage of the presence of the servant to effect a retreat but he do not dare to do so it be essential that he should obtain a few word with etta to effect this he be ready even to face a interview with steinmetz in he heart he be cursing that liability to inconvenient faint fit that make all woman unreliable in a moment of need he precede steinmetz out of the room forget even to resent the large warm grasp on he arm they go through the long dimly light passage to the old part of the castle where steinmetz have he room and now say steinmetz when they be alone with closed door and now de chauxville let we understand each other de chauxville shrug he shoulder he be not thinking of steinmetz yet he be still think of etta and how he could get speech with she with the assurance which have carry he through many a difficulty before this the frenchman look round he take in the detail of the room they be in the apartment beyond the large smoking room -- the ante-room as it be to the little chamber where paul keep he medicine-chest he disguise all the compromise detail of he work among the peasant the broad writing-table in the middle of the room stand between the two man do you imagine yourself in love with the princess ask steinmetz suddenly with characteristic bluntness if you like return the other if i think that it be that say the german look at he thoughtfully i would throw you out of the window if it be any thing else i will only throw you down stair de chauxville bit he thumb-nail anxiously he frown across the table into steinmetz 's face in all they intercourse he have never hear that tone of voice he have never see quite that look on the heavy face be steinmetz arouse at last steinmetz arouse be a unknown quantity to claude de chauxville i have know you now for twenty-five year go on karl steinmetz and i can not say that i know any good of you but let that pass it be not i suppose my business the world be as the good god make it i can do

it to the wrong person when you bring it to I do you suppose that i would have allow the marriage to take place unless i know that bamborough be dead you may be tell the truth about that incident or you may not say de chauxville but my knowledge of the betrayal of the charity league be sufficient for my purpose yes admit steinmetz grimly you have information there with possibility of mischief in it but i shall discount most of it by tell prince pavlo to-night all that i know and i know more than you do also i intend to seal you lip before you leave this room de chauxville stare at he with a drop lip he gulp down something in he throat he hand be steal round under the fur jacket to a pocket at the back of he trousers let I out he hiss there be a gleam of bright metal in the sunlight that

karl steinmetz thrash he it do not last long no word be speak the silence be only break by they shuffling foot by the startling report of each blow by de chauxville 's repeat gasp of pain the fur jacket be tear in several place the white shirt appear here and there in one place it be stain with red at last steinmetz throw he huddle into one corner of the room the chatter face the wild eye that look up at he be terrible to see when you have promise to keep the secret you may go say steinmetz you must swear it de chauxville 's lip move but no sound come from they steinmetz pour some water into a tumbler and give it to he it have to come to this he say sooner or later paul would have kill you that be the only difference do you swear by god in heaven above you that you will keep the

quite red de chauxville be crawl toward the revolver in the corner of the room but he be almost faint it be a question whether he would last long enough to reach the fire-arm there be a bright patch of red in either liver-colored cheek he lip be work convulsively and steinmetz see he in time he seize he by the collar of he coat and drag he back he place he foot on the little pistol and face de chauxville with glaring eye de chauxville rise to he foot and for a moment the two man look into each other 's soul the frenchman 's face be twist with pain no word be say such be the last reckoning between karl steinmetz and the baron claude de chauxville the frenchman go slowly toward the door he falter and look round for a chair he sit heavily down with a little exclamation of pain and exhaustion and feel for he pocket-handkerchief the scented cambric diffuse a faint dainty odor of violet he sit forward with he two hand on he knee sway a little from side to side presently he raise he handkerchief to he face there be tear in he eye thus the two man wait until de chauxville have recover himself sufficiently to take he departure the air be full of naked human passion it be rather a grewsome scene at last the frenchman stand slowly up and with characteristic thought of appearance finger he torn coat have you a cloak ask steinmetz no the german go to a cupboard in the wall and select a long riding-cloak which he hand to the frenchman without a word thus claude de chauxville walk to the door in a cloak which have figure at many a charity league meeting assuredly the irony of fate be a keener thing than any poor humor we have at we command when evil be punish in this present life there be no staying of the hand steinmetz follow de chauxville through the long passage they have traverse a few minute earlier and down the broad staircase the servant be wait at the door with the horse put at the frenchman 's disposal by paul de chauxville mount slowly heavily with twitch lip he face be set and cold now the pain be get bearable the wound vanity be bleed inwardly in he dull eye there be a gleam of hatred and malice it be the face of a man rejoice inwardly over a deep and certain vengeance it be well he be mutter between he clenched tooth as he ride away while steinmetz watch he from the doorstep it be well now i will not spare you he ride down the hill and through the village with the light of the setting sun shine on a face where pain and deadly rage be fight for the mastery chapter xxxviii a tale that be tell karl steinmetz walk slowly upstairs to he own room

of the eyelid i be get too old for this sort of thing he say he gaze light on the heavy riding-whip throw on the ground near the door where he have release claude de chauxville after the terrible punishment mete out to that foe with heavy teutonic hand steinmetz rise and pick up the whip with the grunt of a stout man stoop replace it carefully in the rack over the mantelpiece he stand look out of the window for a few moment it will have to be do he say resolutely and ring the bell my compliment to the prince he say to he servant who appear instantly and will he come to I here when paul come into the room a few minute later steinmetz be stand by the fire he turn and look gravely at the prince i have just kick de chauxville out of the house he say the color leave paul 's face quite suddenly why he ask with hard eye he have begin to distrust etta and there be nothing so hard to stop as the growth of distrust steinmetz do not answer at once be it not _ my _ privilege ask paul with a grim smile there be some smile more terrible than any frown no answer steinmetz i think not it be not as bad as that but it be bad enough mein lieber -- it be bad enough i horsewhip he first for myself gott how pleasant that be and then i kick he out for you why repeat paul with a white face it be a long story answer steinmetz without look at he he know too much about whom about all of we

against I -- this be no time for mistaken charity interrupted paul do not try to screen any body i shall see through it there be a little pause never have that silent room be so noiseless in after-life steinmetz go on it be we fate to be at variance several time we mutual dislike have have no opportunity of diminish it seem that before you married de chauxville be please to consider himself in love with mr sydney bamborough whether he have any right to think himself ill-used i do not know such matter be usually know to two person only and imperfectly by they it would appear that the wound to he vanity be serious it develop into a thirst for revenge he look about for some means to do you harm he communicate with you enemy and ally himself to such man as vassilus of pari he follow we to petersburg and then he have a stroke of good fortune he find out -- who betray the charity league paul turn slowly round in he eye there burn a dull hunger fire man have see such a look

know before the word be speak he turn again and stand look out of the window with he hand thrust into he pocket he stand there for whole minute in a awful stillness the clock on the mantel-piece a little travel timepiece tick in a hurry way as if anxious to get on down beneath they somewhere in the courtyard of the great castle a dog -- a deep-voiced wolf-hound -- be bay persistently and nervously listen for the echo of its own voice amid the pine of the desert forest steinmetz watch paul 's motionless back with a sort of fascination he move uneasily as if to break a spell of silence almost unbearable in its intensity he go to the table and sit down from mere habit he take up a quill pen he look at the point of it and at the inkstand but he have nothing to write there be nothing to say he lay the pen aside and sit lean he broad head upon the palm of he hand he two elbow on the table paul never move steinmetz wait he own life have be no great success he have have much to bear and he have bear it he be wonder heavily whether any of it have be as bad as what paul be bear now while he look out of the window with he hand in he pocket say nothing at length paul move he turn and come toward the table lay he hand on steinmetz 's broad shoulder be you sure of it he ask in a voice that do not sound like he own at all -- a hollow voice like that of a old man quite i have it from stépan lanovitch -- from the princess herself they remain thus for a moment then paul withdraw he hand and walk slowly to the window tell I he say how she do it steinmetz be play with the quill pen again it be singular how at great moment we perform trivial act think trivial thought he dip the pen in the ink and make a pattern on the blotting-pad with dot it be a organize plan between husband and wife he say bamborough turn up at thor and ask for a night 's lodging on the strength of a very small acquaintance he steal the papers from stépan 's study and take they to tver where he wife be wait for they she take they on to paris and sell they to vassilus bamborough begin he journey eastward know presumably that he could not escape by the western frontier but lose he way on the steppe you remember the man whom we pick up between here and tver with he face all cut to piece -- he have be drag by the stirrup that be sydney bamborough the good god have hit back quickly how long have you know this ask paul in a queer voice i see it suddenly in the princess 's face one day in petersburg -- a sort of revelation i read it there and she see I read i should have like to keep it from you for you sake as well as for hers we daily life be make possible only by the fact that we know so little of we neighbor there be many thing of which we be better ignorant right up to the end this might have be one of they but de chauxville find it out and it be better that i should tell you than he paul do not look around the wolf-hound be still bark at its own echo -- a favorite pastime of those who make a great local stir in the world of course say paul after a long pause i have be a great fool i know that but -- he turn and look at steinmetz with haggard eye but i would rather go on be a fool than suspect any one of a deception like this steinmetz be still make pattern on the blotting-pad it be difficult for we man he say slowly to look at these thing from a woman 's point of view they hold a different sense of honor from ours -- especially if they be beautiful and the fault be ours -- especially toward the beautiful one there may have be temptation of which we be ignorant paul be still look at he steinmetz look up slowly and see that he have grow ten year older in the last few minute he do not look at he for more than a second because the sight of paul 's face hurt he but he see in that moment that paul do not understand this strong man hard in he youthful strength of limb and purpose would be just but nothing more and between man and man it be not always justice that be require between man and woman justice rarely meet the difficulty comprendre c'est pardonner quote steinmetz vaguely he hesitate to interfere between paul and he wife axiom be make for crucial moment a man 's life have be steer by a proverb before this some who have no religion steer by they all the voyage paul walk slowly to the chair he usually occupy opposite to steinmetz at the writing-table he walk and sit down as if he have travel a long distance what be to be do ask steinmetz i do not know i do not think that it matter much what do you recommend there be so much to be do answer steinmetz that it be difficult to know what to do first we must not forget that de chauxville be furious he will do all the harm of which he be capable at once we must not forget that the country be in a state of smolder revolt and that we have two woman two english lady entrust to we care paul move uneasily in he chair he companion have strike the right note this large man be happiest when he be tire himself out yes but about etta he say and the sound of he voice make steinmetz wince there be nothing so heartrending as the sight of dumb suffering you must see she answer he reflectively you must see she of course she may be able to explain he look across the table beneath he shaggy gray eyebrow paul do not at that moment look a likely subject for explanation -- even the explanation of a beautiful woman but there be one human quantity which in all he experience karl steinmetz have never successfully gauge -- namely the extent of a woman 's power over the man who love or at one time have love she she can not explain away stépan lanovitch 's ruin life she can hardly explain away a thousand death from unnatural cause every winter in this province alone this be what steinmetz dread -- justice give she the opportunity he say paul be look out of the window he singularly firm mouth be still and quiet -- not a mouth for explanation i will if you like he say i do like paul i beg of you to do it and remember that -- she be not a man this like other appeal of the same nature fall on stony ground paul simply do not understand it in all the year of he work among the peasant it be possible that some well-spring of conventional charity have be dry up -- scorch in the glare of burn injustice he be not at this moment in a mood to consider the only excuse that steinmetz seem to be able to urge the sun have set long ago the short twilight lay over the snow-covered land with a chill hopelessness steinmetz look at he watch they have be together a hour -- one of those hour that count as year in a life time he have to peer into the face of the watch in order to see the hand the room be almost dark and no servant ever come to it unless summon paul be look down at he companion as if wait to hear the time at great moment we be suddenly bring face to face with the limit of human nature it be at such moment that we find that we be not god but only man we can only feel to a certain extent only suffer up to a certain point we must dress for dinner say steinmetz afterward -- well afterward we shall see yes answer paul and he do not go the two man stand look at each other for a moment they have pass through much together -- danger excitement and now they be dabble in sorrow it would appear that this same sorrow run like a river across the road of we life some of we find the ford and plash through the shallows -- shallow ourselves -- while other flounder into deep water these be they who look right on to the greater event and fail to note the trivial detail of each little step paul be wade through the deep water and this good friend of he be not incline to stand upon the bank it be while pass through this river that fortune send some of we a friend who be ever afterward different from all other paul stand look down at the broad heavy face of the man who love he like a father it be not easy for he to speak he seem to be make a effort i do not want you to think he say at last that it be as bad as it might have be it might have be worse -- much worse -- have i not make a mistake in regard to my own feeling when i marry she i will try and do the right thing by she only at present there do not seem to be much left except you steinmetz look up with he quaintly resign smile ah yes he say i be there always chapter xxxix husband and wife karl steinmetz have show the depth of he knowledge of man and woman when he comment on that power of face danger with a unruffled countenance which he be please to attribute to english lady above all woman during the evening he have full opportunity of verify he own observation etta come down to dinner smile and imperturbable on the threshold of the drawing-room she exchange a glance with karl steinmetz and that be all at dinner it be maggie and paul who be silent etta talk to steinmetz -- brightly gayly with a certain courage of a very high order for she be desperate and she do not show it at last the evening come to a end maggie have sing two song steinmetz have perform on the piano with a marvellous touch all have play they part with the brazen face which steinmetz in he knowledge of many nation assign to the anglo-saxon race before other at last etta rise to go to bed with a little sharp sigh of great suspense it be come she go up to she room bidding maggie good-night in the passage in a mechanical way she allow the deft-handed maid to array she in a dress gown -- soft silken a dainty triumph in its way then almost impatiently she send the maid away when she hair be only half release she would brush it herself she be tired no she want nothing more she sit down by the fire brush in hand she could hardly breathe it be come she hear paul come to he dressing-room she hear he deep quiet voice reply to some question of he valet 's then the word good-night in the same quiet voice the valet have go there be only the door now between she and -- what she finger be at the throat of she dressing-gown the soft lace seem to choke she then paul knock at the door it be come she open she lip but at first could make no sound come in she say at length hoarsely she wonder whether he would kill she she wonder whether she be in love with she husband she have begin wonder that lately she be wonder it when he come in he have change he dress-coat for a silk-faced jacket in which he be in the habit of work with steinmetz in the quiet room after the household have go to bed she look up she drop the brush and run toward he with a great rustle of she flow silk oh paul what be it she cry she stop short not daring to touch he before he cold set face have you see any one she whisper only de chauxville he answer this afternoon indeed paul she protest hastily it be nothing a message from catrina lanovitch it be only the usual visit of a acquaintance it would have be very strange if he have not call do you think i could care for a man like that i never do think so until now return paul steadily you excuse accuse you you may care for he i do not know i -- do -- not -- care she turn slowly and go back to she chair mechanically she take up the brush and shake back she beautiful hair you mean you do not care for I she say oh paul be careful paul stand look at she he be not a subtle-minded man at all he be not one of those who take it upon themselves to say that they understand woman -- use the word in a offensively general sense as if woman be situate midway between the human and the animal race he be old-fashioned enough to look upon woman as higher and purer than man while equally capable of thought and self-control he have it must be remember no great taste for fictional literature he have not read the voluminous lucubration of the modern woman writer he have not assist at the nauseating spectacle of a woman morally turn herself inside out in three volume and a interview no this man respect woman still and he pay they a honor which thank heaven most of they still deserve he treat they as man in the sense that he consider they to be under the same code of right and wrong of good and evil he do not understand what etta mean when she tell he to be careful he do not know that the modern social code be like the spanish grammar -- there be so many exception that the rule be hardly worth note and one of we most notorious modern exception be the married woman who be pleased to hold herself excuse because outsider tell she that she husband do not understand she i do not think say paul judicially that you can have care very much whether i love you or not when you marry I you know that i be the promoter of the charity league i almost tell you i tell you so much that with you knowledge you must have be aware of the fact that i be heavily interested in the undertaking which you betray you marry I without certain proof of you husband 's death such be you indecent haste to call yourself a princess and now i find on you own confession that you have a clandestine understanding with a man who try to murder I only a week ago be it not rather absurd to talk of care he stand look down at she cold and terrible in the white heat of he suppress northern anger the little clock on the mantel-piece in a terrible hurry tick with all its might time be speed every moment be against she and she could think of nothing to say simply because those thing that she would have say to other would carry no weight with this man etta be lean forward in the luxurious chair stare with haggard eye into the fire the flame leap up and gleam on she pale face in she deep eye i suppose she say without look at he that you will not believe I when i tell you that i hate the man i know nothing of what you refer to as happen last week he attempt to murder you i mean you be a prince and all-powerful in you own province can you not throw he into prison and keep he there such thing be do in russium he be more dangerous than you think please do it -- please -- paul look at she with hard unresponsive eye live depend on he answer i do not come here to discuss claude de chauxville he say but you and we future etta draw herself up as one under the lash and wait with set tooth i propose he say in a final voice which make it no proposition at all that you go home to england at once with -- you cousin this country be not safe for you the house in london will be at you disposal i will make a suitable settlement on you sufficient to live in accordance with you title and position i must ask you to remember that the name you bear have hitherto be a unsullied one we have be proud of we princess -- up to now in case of any trouble reach you from outside source connect with this country i should like you to remember that you be under my protection and that of steinmetz either of we will be glad at any time to consider any appeal for assistance that you may think fit to make you will always be the princess howard alexis etta give a sudden laugh oh yes she say and she face be strangely red i shall still be the princess alexi with sufficient money to keep up the position he go on with the cruel irony of a slow-spoken man a queer twisted smile pass across etta 's face -- the smile of one who be in agony and will not shriek there be certain stipulation which i must make in self-defence go on paul i must ask you to cease all communication of whatever nature with the baron de chauxville i be not jealous of he -- now i do not know why he pause as if wonder what the meaning of this might be etta know it the knowledge be part of she punishment but continue she husband i be not go to sacrifice the name my mother bear to the vanity of a french coxcomb you will be kind enough to avoid all society where it be likely that you should meet he if you disregard my desire in this matter i shall be compel to take means to enforce they what mean i shall reduce you allowance they eye meet and perhaps that be the bitterest moment in etta 's life dead thing be better put out of sight at once etta feel that paul 's dead love would grin at she in every sovereign of the allowance which be to be hers she would never get away from it she could never shake off its memory be i to live alone ask etta suddenly find she voice that be as you like answer paul perhaps purposely misunderstand she you be at liberty to have any friend or companion you wish perhaps -- you cousin maggie yes answer paul for the first time since he have enter the room he eye be avert from etta 's face she would not live with I say the princess curtly paul seem to be reflect when he next speak it be in a kinder voice you need not tell the circumstance which have give rise to this arrangement etta shrug she shoulder that go on paul rest entirely with yourself you may be sure that i will tell no one i be not likely to discuss it with any one whomsoever etta 's stony eye soften for a moment she seem to be alternate between hatred of this man and love of he -- a dangerous state for any woman it be possible that if he have hold he hand out to she she would have be at he foot in a wild incoherent passion of self-hatred and abasement such moment as these turn we life and determine they paul know nothing of the issue hang on this moment on the pass softness of she eye he know nothing of the danger in which this woman stand of the temptation with which she be wrestle he go on in he blindness go on be only just if he say you have any further question to ask i shall always be at you service for the next few day i shall be busy the peasant be in a state of discontent verge on rebellion we can not at present arrange for you journey to tver but as soon as it be possible i will tell you he look at the clock and make a imperceptible movement toward the door etta glance up sharply she do not seem to be breathing be that all she ask in a dull voice there be a long silence tense and throb the great silence of the steppe i think so answer paul at length i have try to be just then justice be very cruel not so cruel as the woman who for a few pound sell the happiness of thousand of human being steinmetz advise I to speak to you he suggest the possibility of circumstance of which we be ignorant he say that you might be able to explain silence can you explain silence etta sit look into the fire the little clock hurry on at length etta draw a deep breath you be the sort of man she say who do not understand temptation you be strong the devil leave the strong in peace you have find virtue easy because you have never wanted money you position have always be assure you name alone be a password through the world you sort be always hard on woman who -- who -- what have i do after all some instinct bid she rise to she foot and stand before he -- tall beautiful passionate a woman in a thousand a fit mate for such as he she beautiful hair in burnished glory round she face gleam in the firelight she white finger clench she arm throw back she breast panting beneath the lace she proud face look defiance into he -- no one but a prince could have brave this princess what have i do she cry a second time i have only fight for myself and if i have win so much the greater credit i be you wife i have do nothing the law can touch thousand of woman move in we circle be not half so good as i be i swear before god i be -- hush he say with upraised hand i never doubt that i will do any thing you wish she go on and in she humility she be very dangerous i deceive you i know but i sell the charity league before i know that you -- that you think of I when i marry you i do not love you i admit that but paul -- oh paul if you be not so good you would understand perhaps he do understand for there be that in she eye that make she meaning clear he be silent standing before she in he great strength he marvellous and cruel self-restraint you will not forgive I for a moment she lean forward peer into he face he seem to be reflect yes he say at length i forgive you but if i care for you forgiveness would be impossible he go slowly toward the door etta look round the room with draw eye they room -- the room he have fit up for he bride with the lavishness of a great wealth and a great love he pause with he hand on the door and she say with fiery cheek do you forgiveness date from to-night yes he open the door good-night he say and go out chapter xl stépan return at daybreak the next morning karl steinmetz be awaken by the familiar cry of the wolf beneath he window he rise and dress hastily the eastern sky be faintly pink a rosy twilight move among the pine he go down stair and open the little door at the back of the castle it be of course the starosta shiver and bleached in the chilly dawn they have watch my cottage excellency all night it be only now that i could get away there be two strange sleigh outside domensky 's hut there be mark of many sleigh that have be and go excellency it be unsafe for any one to venture outside the castle to-day you must send to tver for the soldier the prince refuse to do that but why excellency we shall be kill you do not know the effect of platoon firing on a closely packed mob starost the prince do reply steinmetz with he grim smile they speak together in hushed voice for half a hour while the daylight creep up the eastern sky then the starosta steal away among the still larch like the wolf whose cry he imitate so perfectly steinmetz close the door and go upstairs to he own room he face grave and thoughtful he tread heavy with the weight of anxiety the day pass as such day do etta be not the woman to plead a conventional headache and remain hidden she come down to breakfast and during that meal be boldly conversational she have spirit reflect karl steinmetz behind he quiet gray eye he admire she for it and help she he throw back the ball of conversation with imperturbable good humor they be completely shut in no news from the outer world penetrate to the little party besiege within they own stone wall maggie fearless and innocent announce she intention of snow-shoeing but be dissuade therefrom by steinmetz with covert warning during the morning each be occupy in individual affair at luncheon time they meet again etta be now almost defiant she be on she mettle she be so near to loving paul that a hatred of he well up within she breast whenever he repel she advance with uncompromising reticence they do not know -- perhaps she hardly know herself -- that the opening of the side-door depend upon she humor in the afternoon etta and maggie sit as be they wont in the morning-room look out over the cliff of late they intercourse have be slightly strain they have never have much in common although circumstance have throw they life together it be one of the ill to which woman be heir that they have frequently to pass they whole life in the society of person with whom they have no real sympathy both these woman be conscious of the little rift within the lute but such rift be better treat with silence that which come to interfere with a woman 's friendship will not often bear discussion at dusk steinmetz go out he have a appointment with the starosta paul be sit in he own room make a pretence of work about five o'clock when steinmetz come hurriedly to he a new development he say shortly come to my room paul rise and follow he through the double doorway build in the thickness of the wall steinmetz 's large room be light only by a lamp standing on the table all the light be throw on the desk by a large green shade leave the rest of the room in a semi-darkness at the far end of the room a man be stand in a expectant attitude there be something furtive about this intruder and at the same time familiar to paul who peer at he through the gloom then the man come hurriedly forward ah pavlo pavlo he say in a deep hollow voice i could not expect you to know I he throw he arm around he and embrace he after the simple manner of russium then he hold he at arm 's length stépan say paul no i do not know you stépan lanovitch be still hold he at arm 's length examine he with the large faint blue eye which so often go with a exaggerated philanthropy old he mutter old ah my poor pavlo i hear in kiew -- you know how we outlaw hear such thing -- that you be in trouble so i come to you steinmetz in the background raise he patient eyebrow there be two man in the world go on the voluble lanovitch who can manage the moujik of tver -- you and i so i come i will help you pavlo i will stand by you together we can assuredly quell this revolt paul nod and allow himself to be embrace a second time he have long know stépan lanovitch of thor as one of the many who go about the world do good with they eye shut for the moment he have absolutely no use for this well-meaning blunderer i be afraid he say that it have get beyond control we can not stamp it out now except by force and i would rather not do that we only hope be that it may burn itself out the talker must get hoarse in time lanovitch shake he head they have be talk since the day of anania he say and they be not hoarse yet i fear pavlo there will never be peace in the world until the talker be hoarse how do you get here ask paul who be always businesslike i bring a pack on my back and sell cotton i make myself know to the starosta and he communicate with good karl here do you learn any thing in the village ask paul no they suspect I they would not talk but i understand they pavlo these poor simple fool a pebble in the stream would turn the current of they conviction tell they who be the moscow doctor it be you only chance steinmetz grunt acquiescence and walk wearily to the window this be only a old and futile argument of he own and make it impossible for I to live another day among they say paul do you think st petersburg would countenance a prince who work among he moujik stépan lanovitch 's pale blue eye look troubled steinmetz shrug he shoulder they have bring it on themselves he say as much as a lamb bring the knife upon itself by grow up reply paul lanovitch shake he white head with a tolerant little smile he love these poor helpless peasant with a love as large as and a thousand time less practical than paul 's in the meantime paul be think in he clear direct way it be this man 's habit in life and in think to walk straight past the side issue it be like you stépan he say at length to come to we at this time we feel it and we recognize the generosity of it for steinmetz and i know the danger you be run in come back to this country but we can not let you do it -- no do not protest it be quite out of the question we might quell the revolt no doubt we should -- the two of we together but what would happen afterward you would be send back to siberium and i should probably follow you for harbor a escape convict the face of the impulsive philanthropist drop pathetically he have come to he friend 's assistance on the spur of the moment he be destine as some man be to plunge about the world seek to do good and it have be decree that good must be do by stealth and after deliberation only he who do good on the spur of the moment usually sow a seed of dissension in the trench of time also go on paul with that deliberate grasp of the situation which never fail to astonish the ready-witted steinmetz also you have other call upon you energy you have other work to do lanovitch 's broad face lighten up he benevolent brow beam he capacity for work have bring he to the shoemaker 's last in tomsk it be a vice that grow with indulgence it have please the authority go on paul who be shy of religious turn of phrase to give we all we own trouble mine -- such as they be stépan -- must be manage by myself yours can be face by no one but you you have come at the right moment you do not quite realize what you come means to catrina catrina ah the weak blue eye look into the strong face and read nothing there i doubt say paul whether it be right for you to continue sacrifice catrina for the sake of the little good that you be able to do you be hamper in you good work to such a extent that the result be very small while the pain you give be very great but be that so pavlo be my child unhappy i fear so reply paul gravely with he baffling self-restraint she have not much in common with she mother you understand ah yes it be you to whom she be attach sometimes it be so with child and parent one can not tell why steinmetz look as if he could supply information upon the subject : but he remain silent standing as it be in a acquiescent attitude you have fight you fight say paul a good fight too you have strike you blow for the country you have sow you seed but the harvest be not yet now it be time to think of you own safety of the happiness of you own child stépan lanovitch turn away and sit heavily down he lean he two arm on the table and he chin upon he clenched hand why not leave the country now at all event for a few year go on paul and when a man who be accustom to command stoop to persuade it be strong persuasion that he wield you can take catrina with you you will be assure she happiness which at all event be something tangible -- a present harvest i will drive over to thor now and bring she back you can leave to-night and go to america stépan lanovitch raise he head and look hard into paul 's face you wish it i think answer paul steadily that it be for catrina 's happiness then lanovitch rise up and take paul 's hand in he work-stained grip go my son it will be a great happiness to I i will wait here he say paul go straight to the door he be a man with a capacity for prompt action which seem to rise to demand steinmetz follow he out into the passage and take he by the arm you can not do it he say yes i can reply paul i can find my way through the forest no one will venture to follow I there in the dark steinmetz hesitate shrug he shoulder and go back into the room the lady at thor be dress for dinner -- be indeed await the announcement of that meal -- when paul break in upon they solitude he do not pause to lay aside he fur but go into the long low room withdraw he seal glove painfully for it be freezing as it only can freeze in march the countess assail he with many question more or less sensible which he endure patiently until the servant have leave the room catrina with flush cheek stand look at he but say nothing paul withdraw he glove and submit to the countess ' futile tug at he fur coat then catrina speak the baron de chauxville have leave we she say without know exactly why for the moment paul have forget claude de chauxville 's existence i have news for you he say and he gently push the chatter countess aside stépan lanovitch be at osterno he arrive to-night ah they have set he free poor man do he wear chain on he ankle -- be he hair long my poor stépan ah but what a stupid man the countess collapse into a soft chair she choose a soft one obviously it have to be record here that she do not receive the news with unmitigated joy when he be in siberium she gasp one know at all event where he be and now mon dieu what a anxiety i have come over to see whether you will join he to-night and go with he to america say paul look at she to -- america -- to-night my dear paul be you mad one can not do such thing as that america that be across the sea yes answer paul and i be such a bad sailor now if it have be paris -- but it can not be interrupted paul will you join you father to-night he add turn to catrina the girl be look at he with something in she eye that he do not care to meet and go to america she ask in a lifeless voice paul nod catrina turn suddenly away from he and walk to the fire where she stand with she back toward he -- a small uncouth figure in black and green the lamplight gleam on she wonderful hair she turn suddenly again and come back stand look into he face i will go she say you think it best yes he answer i think it best she draw a sharp breath and be about to speak when the countess interrupt she what she cry you be go away to-night like this without any luggage and pray what be to become of I you can join they in america say paul in he quietest tone or you can live in pari at last chapter xli duty it be not now a very cold night there be fleecy cloud throw like puff of smoke against the western sky the moon on the wane -- a small crescent lie on its back -- be lower toward the horizon the thermometer have rise since sunset as it often do in march there be a suggestion of spring in the air it seem that at last the long winter be draw to a close that the iron grip of frost be relax paul go out and inspect the harness by the light of a stable lantern hold in the mittened hand of a yemschick he have reason of he own for absent himself while catrina bid she mother farewell he be rather afraid of these woman the harness inspect he begin reckon how many hour of moonlight might still be vouchsafe to he the stableman see the direction of he gaze begin to talk of the weather and the possibility of snow in the near future they converse in low voice together presently the door open and catrina come quickly out follow by a servant carry a small hand-bag paul could not see catrina 's face she be veil and fur to the eyelid without a word the girl take she seat in the sleigh and the servant prepare the bear-skin rug paul gather up the rein and take he place beside she a few moment be require to draw up the rug and fasten they with strap then paul give the word and the horse leap forward as they speed down the avenue catrina turn and look she last on thor before long paul wheel into the trackless forest he have come very carefully steer chiefly by the moon and star with occasional assistance from a bend of the wind river at time he have take to the ice follow the course of the stream for a few mile no snow have fall it would be easy to return on he own track through this part of the forest no road be cut for nearly half a hour they drive in silence only the whistle of the iron-bound runner on the powdery snow the creak of the warming leather on the horse the regular breathing of the team break the stillness of the forest paul hope against hope that catrina be asleep she sit by he side she arm touch he sleeve she weight throw against he at such time as the sleigh bump over a fall tree or some inequality of the ground he could not help wonder what thought there be behind she silence steinmetz 's good-natured banter have come back to he memory during the last few day in a new light paul say the woman at he side quite suddenly break the silence of the great forest where they have grow to life and sorrow almost side by side yes i want to know how this all come about it be not my father 's do there be something quick and practical and wise which suggest you and herr steinmetz i suspect that you have do this -- you and he -- for we happiness no answer paul it be mere accident you father hear of we trouble in kiew you know he -- always impulsive and reckless he never think of the danger he come to help we catrina smile wanly but it _ be _ for we happiness be it not paul you know that it be -- that be why you have do it i have not have time yet to realize what i be do all that be go to happen but if it be you do i think i shall be content to abide by the result it be not my do reply paul who do not like she wistful tone it be the outcome of circumstance circumstance have be rule we all lately we seem to have no time to consider but only to do that which seem best for the moment and it be best that i should go to america with my father she voice be compose and quiet in the dim light he could not see she white lip indeed he never look it seem so to I undoubtedly he say in do this so far as we can see at present it seem certain that you be save you father from siberium you know what he be he never think of he own safety he ought never to have come here to-night if he remain in russium it be a absolute certainty that he will sooner or later be rearrest he be one of those good people who require saving from themselves catrina nod at time duty be the kedge-anchor of happiness the girl be dimly aware that she be hold to this she be simple and unsophisticated enough to consider paul 's opinion infallible at the great cross-road of life we be apt to ask the way of any body who happen to be near catrina might perhaps have make a worse choice of counsel for paul be honest as you put it she say it be clearly my duty there be a sort of consolation in that however painful it may be at the time i suppose it be consolatory to look back and think that at all event one do one 's duty i do not know answer paul simply i suppose so look back be not include in he method of life which be rather characterize by a large faith and a forward pressure whenever there be question of consider life as a abstract he draw within he shell with a manlike shyness he have no generality ready for each emergency would father have go alone she ask with a very human thrill of hope in she voice no answer paul steadily i think not but you can ask he they have never be so distant as they be at this moment -- so cold such mere acquaintance and they have play together in one nursery of course if that be the case say the girl my duty be quite clear it require some persuasion to make he consent to go even with you say paul a rough piece of go -- for there be no road -- debar further conversation at this time the sleigh roll and bump over one fall tree after another paul with he foot stretch out wedge firmly into the sleigh encourage the tired horse with rein and voice catrina be compel to steady herself with both hand on the bar of the apron for the apron of a russian sleigh be a heavy piece of leather stretch on a wooden bar then you think my duty be quite clear repeat the girl at length paul do not answer at once i be sure of it he say and there the question end catrina lanovitch who have never be rule by those about she shaped she whole life unquestioningly upon a opinion they do not speak for some time and then it be the girl who break the silence i have a confession to make and a favor to ask she say bluntly paul 's attitude denote attention but he say nothing it be about the baron de chauxville she say ah i be a coward she go on i do not know it before it be rather humiliating i have be try for some week to tell you something but i be horribly afraid of it i be afraid you will despise I i have be a fool -- worse perhaps i never know that claude de chauxville be the sort of person he be i allow he to find out thing about I which he never should have know -- my own private affair i mean then i become frightened and he try to make use of I i think he make use of every-body _ you _ know what he be yes answer paul i know he hate you she go on i do not want to make mischief but i suppose he want to marry the princess he vanity be wound because she prefer you and he want to be avenge upon you wound to the vanity never heal i do not know how he do it paul but he make I help he in he scheme i could have prevent you from go to the bear hunt for i suspect he then i could have prevent my mother from invite he to thor i could have put a thousand difficulty in he way but i do not i help he i tell he about the people and who be the worst -- who have be influence by the nihilist and who would not work i allow he to stay on here and carry out he plan all this trouble among the peasant be he handiwork he have organize a regular rise against you he be horribly clever he leave we yesterday but i be convince that he be in the neighborhood still she stop and reflect there be something want in the story which she could not supply it be a motive a half-confession be almost a impossibility when we speak of ourselves it must be all or nothing -- preferably nothing i do not know why i do it she say it be a sort of period i go through i can not explain he do not ask she to do so they be singularly like brother and sister in they mental attitude they have drive through twenty mile of forest which belong to one or other of they each be touch by the intangible inexplicable dignity that belong to the possession of great land -- to the inheritance of a great name that be the confession she say he give a little laugh if none of we have worse than that upon we conscience he answer there would be little harm in the world de chauxville 's scheme have only hurry on a crisis which be foreordain the progress of humanity can not be stay they have try to stay it in this country they will go on try until the crash come what be the favor you have to ask you must leave osterno she urge earnestly it be unsafe to delay even a few hour m de chauxville say there would be no danger i believe he then but i do not now besides i know the peasant they be hard to rouse but once excite they be uncontrollable they be afraid of nothing you must get away to-night paul make no answer she turn slowly in she seat and look into he face by the light of the wane moon do you mean that you will not go he meet she glance with he grave slow smile there be no question of go he answer you must know that she do not attempt to persuade perhaps there be something in he voice which she as a russian understand -- a ring of that which we call pig-headedness in other it must be splendid to be a man she say suddenly in a ringing voice one feeling in I make I ask you the favor while another be a sense of gladness at you certain refusal i wish i be a man i envy you you do not know how i envy you paul paul give a quiet laugh -- such a laugh as one hear in the trench after the low hum of a pass ball if it be danger you want you will have more than i in the next week he answer steinmetz and i know that you be the only woman in russium who could get you father safely out of the country that be why i come for you the girl do not answer at once they be drive on the road again now and the sleigh be run smoothly i suppose she say reflectively at length that the secret of the enormous influence you exercise over all who come in contact with you be that you drag the best out of every one -- the best that be in they paul do not answer what be that light she ask suddenly lay she hand on the thick fur of he sleeve she be not nervous but very watchful there -- straight in front it be the sleigh reply paul with you father and steinmetz i arrange that they should meet we at the cross-road you must be at the volga before daylight send the horse on to tver i have give you minna and the warrior they can do the journey with one hour 's rest but you must drive they catrina have sway forward against the bar of the apron in a strange way for the road be quite smooth she place she gloved hand on the bar and hold herself upright with a peculiar effort what say paul for she have make a inarticulate sound nothing she answer then after a pause i do not know that we be to go so soon that be all chapter xlii the storm burst the large drawing-room be brilliantly light another weary day have drag to its close it be the Tuesday evening -- the last Tuesday in march five year ago the starosta have not be near the castle all day steinmetz and paul have never lose sight of the lady since breakfast time they have not venture out of door there be in the atmosphere a sense of foreboding -- the stillness of a crisis etta have be defiant and silent -- a dangerous humor -- all day maggie have watch paul 's face with steadfast quiet eye full of courage but she know now that there be danger the conversation at breakfast and luncheon have be maintain by steinmetz -- always collect and a little humorous it be now dinner time the whole castle be brilliantly light as if for a great assembly of guest during the last week a fuller state -- a greater ceremony -- have be observe by paul 's order and steinmetz have think more than once of that historical event which appeal to he admiration most -- the indian mutiny maggie be in the drawing-room alone she be lean one hand and arm on the mantel-piece look thoughtfully into the fire the rustle of silk make she turn she head it be etta beautifully dress with a white face and eye dull with suspense i think it be warmer to-night say maggie urge by a sudden necessity of speech hamper by a sudden chill at the heart yes answer etta and she shiver for a moment there be a little silence and etta look at the clock it be ten minute to seven a high wind be blow the first of the equinoctial gale herald the spring the sound of the wind in the great chimney be like the moaning of high rigging at sea the door open and steinmetz come in etta 's face harden she lip close with a snap steinmetz look at she and at maggie for once he seem to have no pleasantry ready for use he walk toward a table where some book and newspaper lay in pleasant profusion he be stand there when paul come into the room the prince glance at maggie he see where he wife stand but he do not look at she steinmetz be write something on half a sheet of notepaper in pencil he push it across the table toward paul who draw it nearer to he be you arm be the write word paul crush the paper in the hollow of he hand and throw it into the fire where it burn away he also glance at the clock it be five minute to seven suddenly the door be throw open and a manservant rush in -- pale confused terror-stricken he be a giant footman in the gorgeous livery of the alexi excellency he stammer in russian the castle be surround -- they will kill we -- they will burn we out -- he stop abashed before paul 's point finger and stony face leave the room say paul you forget yourself through the open door-way to which paul point peer the ashen face of other servant huddle together like sheep leave the room repeat paul and the man obey he walk to the door unsteadily with quiver chin on the threshold he pause paul stand point to the door he have a poise of the head -- some sudden awakening of the blood that have course in the vein of hereditary potentate maggie look at he she have never know he like this she have know the man she have never encounter the prince the big clock over the castle boom out the hour and at the same instant there arise a roar like the voice of the surf on a malabar shore there be a crash of glass almost in the room itself already steinmetz be draw the curtain closer over the window in order to prevent the light from filter through the interstice of the closed shutter only stone he say to paul with he grim smile it might have be bullet as if in corroboration of he suggestion the sharp ring of more than one fire-arm ring out above the dull roar of many voice steinmetz cross the room to where etta be stand white-lipped by the fire she clenched hand be grip maggie 's wrist she be half hidden behind she cousin maggie be look at paul etta be obviously conscious of steinmetz 's gaze and approach i ask you before to tell I all you know he say you refuse will you do it now etta meet he glance for a moment shrug she shoulder and turn she back on he paul be stand in the open door-way with he back turn toward they -- alone the palace have never look so vast as it do at that moment -- brilliantly light gorgeous empty through the hail of blow on the stout door the rattle of stone at the window the prince could hear yell of execration and the wild laughter that be breed of destruction he turn and enter the room he face be gray and terrible they have no chance he say of effect a entrance by force the lower window be bar they have no ladder steinmetz and i have see to that we have be expect this for some day he turn toward steinmetz as if seek confirmation the din be increase when the german speak he have to shout we can beat they back if we like we can shoot they down from the window but -- he pause shrug he shoulder and laugh -- what will you this prince will not shoot he father 's serf we must leave you go on paul we must beware of treachery whatever happen we shall not leave the house if the worst come we make we last stand in this room whatever happen stay here till we come he leave the room follow by steinmetz there be only three door in the impregnable stone wall the great entrance a side door for use in time of deep snow and the small conceal entrance by which the starosta be in the habit of reach he master for a moment the two man stand at the head of the stair listen to the wild commotion they be turn to descend the state stair when a pierce shriek immediately drown by a yell of triumph break the silence of the interior of the castle there be a momentary stillness follow by another shriek they be in say steinmetz the side door and the two man look at each other with wide eye full of knowledge as they run to the foot of the broad staircase the tramp of scuffle foot the roar of angry voice come through the passage from the back of curtained doorway the servant ' quarter seem to be pandemonium the sound approach half-way up say paul and they run half-way up the broad staircase side by side there they stand and wait in a moment the baize door be burst open and a scuffle mass of man and woman pour into the hall -- a very sewer of humanity a yell of execration signalize they recognition of the prince they be mad say steinmetz as the crowd surge forward toward the stair with wave arm and the dull gleam of steel with wild face turn upward wild mouth bellow hatred and murder it be a chance -- it may stop they say steinmetz he arm be outstretch steadily a loud report a little puff of smoke shooting upward to the gilded ceiling and for one brief moment the crowd stand still watch one of they ringleader who be turn and twist on he side half a dozen step from the bottom the man writhe in silence with he hand to he breast and the crowd stand aghast he hold up he hand and gaze at it with a queer stupefaction the blood drip from he finger then he chin go up as if some one be grip the back of he neck he turn over slowly and roll to the bottom of the stair then paul raise he voice listen to I he say but he get no farther for some one shot at he from the background over the frantic head of the other and miss he the bullet lodge in the wall at the head of the stair in the jamb of the gorgeous door-way it be there to-day there be a yell of hatred and a ugly charge toward the stair but the sight of the two revolver hold they there -- motionless for a few moment those in front push back while the shouter in the safe background urge they forward by word and gesture two man hold a hundred in check but one of the two be a prince which make all the difference and will continue to make that difference despite halfpenny journalism until the end of the world what do you want cry paul oh i will wait he shout in the next pause there be plenty of time -- when you be tire of shout several of they proceed to tell he what they want a old story too stale for repetition here paul recognize in the din of many voice the tinkling argument of the professional agitator all the world over -- the cry of equality equality when man be obviously create unequal look out say paul i believe they be go to make a rush all the while the foremost man be edge toward the stair while the densely packed throng at the back be struggle among themselves in the passage behind some be yell and scream with a wild intonation which steinmetz recognize he have be through the commune those fellow at the back have be kill some one he say i can tell by they voice they be drunk with the sight of blood some new orator gain the ear of the rabble at this moment and the ill-kempt head sway from side to side it be useless he cry tell he what you want he will not give it you go and take it go and take it little father that be the only way steinmetz raise he hand and peer down into the crowd look for the man of eloquence and the voice be hush at this moment however the yell increase and through the door-way lead to the servant ' quarter come a stream of man -- bloodstained ragged tear they be wave arm and implement above they head down with the aristocrat kill they -- kill they they be shriek a little volley of fire-arm further excite they but vodka be not a good thing to shoot upon and paul stand untouched wait as he have say until they be tire of shout now yell steinmetz to he in english we must go we can make a stand at the head of the stair then the door-way then -- he shrug he shoulder then -- the end he add as they move up the stair step by step backward my very good friend he go on at the door we must begin to shoot they down it be we only chance it be moreover we duty toward the lady there be one alternative answer paul the moscow doctor yes they may turn say paul they be just in that humor the new-comer be the most dangerous they be force they way to the front there be no doubt that as soon as they could penetrate the densely packed mob they would charge up the stair even in face of a heavy fire the reek of vodka be bear up in the heated atmosphere mingle with the nauseating odor of filthy clothing go say steinmetz and put on you doctor 's clothes i can keep they back for a few minute there be no time to be lose paul slip away leave steinmetz alone at the summit of the state stairway standing grimly revolver in hand in the drawing-room paul find maggie alone where be etta he ask she leave the room some time ago but i tell she to stay say paul to this maggie make no answer she be look at he with a anxious scrutiny do they shoot at you she ask yes but not straight he answer with a little laugh as he hurry on in a few moment he be back in the drawing-room a different man in the rough stain clothes of the moscow doctor the din on the stair be louder steinmetz be almost in the door-way he be shoot economically pick he man with a effort paul drag one or two heavy piece of furniture across the room in the form of a rough barricade he point to the hearthrug where maggie be to stand ready he shout to steinmetz come the german run in and paul close the barricade the rabble pour in at the open door scream and shout bloodstained ragged wild with the madness of murder they crowd to the barricade there they stop gaze stupidly at paul the moscow doctor -- the moscow doctor pass from lip to lip it be the woman who shout it the loudest like the wind through a forest it sweep out of the room and down the stair those crowd up push on and utter the word as they come the room be pack with they yes shout steinmetz at the top of he great voice and the prince he know the note to strike and strike with a sure hand the barricade be tear aside and the people sweep forward fall on they knee grovel at paul 's foot kiss the hem of he garment seize he strong hand in theirs it be a mighty harvest that which be sow in the people 's heart bear a thousandfold at last get they out of the place -- open the big door say paul to steinmetz he stand cold and grave among they some of they be already sneak toward the door -- the ringleader the talker from the town -- mindful of they own neck in this change of feeling steinmetz hustle they out bid they take they dead with they some of the servant reappear peep white-faced behind curtain when the last villager have cross the threshold these run forward to close and bar the great door no say paul from the head of the stair leave they open so the great door stand defiantly open the light of the state staircase flare out over the village as the peasant creep crest-fallen to they cottage they glance up shamefacedly but they have no word to say steinmetz in the drawing-room look at paul with he resigned semi-humorous shrug of the shoulder touch-and-go mein lieber he say yes a end of russium for we answer the prince he move toward the door lead through to the old castle i be go to look for etta he say and i say steinmetz go to the other entrance be go to see who open the side door chapter xliii behind the veil will you come with I say paul to maggie i will send the servant to put this room to rights maggie follow he out of the room and together they go through the passage call etta and look for she there be a air of gloom and chilliness in the room of the old castle the outline of the great stone dimly discernible through the wall-paper be singularly suggestive of a fortress thinly disguise i suppose say paul that etta lose she nerve yes answer maggie doubtfully i think it be that paul go on he carry a lamp in one steady hand we shall probably find she in one of these room he say it be so easy to lose one 's self among the passage and staircase they pass on through the great smoking-room with its hunting trophy the lynx with its face of claude de chauxville grin at they darkly from its pedestal half-way down the stair lead to the side door they meet steinmetz come hastily up he face be white and draw with horror you must not go down here he say in a husky voice bar the passage with he arm why not go up again say steinmetz breathlessly you must not go down here paul lay he hand on the broad arm stretch across the stairway for a moment it almost appear to be a physical struggle then steinmetz step aside i beg of you he say not to go down and paul go on follow by steinmetz and behind they maggie at the foot of the stair a broader passage lead to the side door and from this other passage open into the servant ' quarter and communicate through the kitchen with the modern building it be evident that the door lead to the grassy slope at the back of the castle be open for a cold wind blow up the stair and make the lamp flicker at the end of the passage paul stop steinmetz be a little behind he hold maggie back the two lamp light up the passage and show the white form of the princess etta lie huddle up against the wall the face be hide but there be no mistake the beautiful dress and hair it could only be etta paul stoop down and look at she but he do not touch she he go a few pace forward and close the door beyond etta a black form lay across the passage all trodden underfoot and dishevelled paul hold the lamp down and through the mud and blood claude de chauxville 's clear-cut feature be outline death be always unmistakable though it be show by nothing more than a heap of muddy clothes claude de chauxville be lie across the passage he have be trodden underfoot by the stream of maddened peasant who have enter by this door which have be open for they whom steinmetz have check at the foot of the stair by shoot they ringleader de chauxville 's scalp be tear away by a blow probably give with a spade or some blunt instrument he hand all muddy and bloodstain still hold a revolver the other hand be stretch out toward etta who lay across he foot crouch against the wall death have find and leave she in a attitude of fear shield she bow head from a blow with she upraised hand she loosen hair fall in a long wave of gold down to the bloodstained hand outstretch toward she she be kneel in de chauxville 's blood which stain the stone floor of the passage paul lean forward and lay he finger on the bare arm just below a bracelet which gleam in the lamplight she be quite dead he hold a lamp close to she there be no mark or scratch upon she arm or shoulder the blow which have tear she hair down have kill she without any disfigurement the silken skirt of she dress which lay across the passage be trample and stain by the tread of a hundred foot then paul go to claude de chauxville he stoop down and slip he skilled finger inside the tear and mud-stained clothing here also be death paul stand upright and look at they as they lay silent motionless with they tale untold maggie and steinmetz stand watch he he go to the door which be of solid oak four inch thick and examine the fastening there have be no damage do to bolt or lock or hinge the door have be open from the inside he look slowly round measure the distance what be the meaning of it he say at length to steinmetz in a dull voice maggie wince at the sound of it steinmetz do not answer at once but hesitate -- after the manner of a man weigh word which will never be forget by they hearer it seem to I he say with a slow wise charity the best of its kind quite clear that de chauxville die in try to save she -- the rest must be only guesswork maggie have come forward and be stand beside he and in guess let we be charitable -- be it not so he say turn to she with a twist of he humorous lip i suppose he go on after a little pause that claude de chauxville have be at the bottom of all we trouble all he life he have be one of the stormy petrel of diplomacy wherever he have go trouble have follow later by some means he obtain sufficient mastery over the princess to compel she to obey he order the means he employ be threat he have it in he power to make mischief and in such affair a woman be so helpless that we may well forgive that which she may do in a moment of panic i imagine that he frighten the poor lady into obedience to he command that she should open this door before dinner when we be all in the drawing-room i note a little mark of dust on the white silk skirt of she dress at the time i think only that she maid have be careless perhaps you notice it mademoiselle lady note such thing he turn to maggie who nod she head that he go on be the dust of these old passage she have be down here she have open this door he spread out he hand in deprecation in he quaint germanic way he hold one hand out over the two motionless form in mute prayer that they might be forgive we all have we fault he say who be we to judge each other if we understand all we might pardon the two strongest human motive be ambition and fear she be rule by both i myself have see she under the influence of sudden panic i have note the working of she great ambition she be probably deceive at every turn by that man who be a scoundrel he be dead and death be understand to wipe out all debt if i be a better man than i be i might speak well of he but -- ach gott that man be a scoundrel i think the good god will judge between they and forgive that poor woman she must have repent of she action when she hear the clatter of the rioter all round the castle i be sure she do that i be sure she come down here to shut the door and find claude de chauxville here they be probably talk together when the poor mad fool who kill they come round to this side of the castle and find they they recognize she as the princess they probably mistake he for the prince it be what man call a series of coincidence i wonder what god call it he break off and stoop down he draw the lapel of the frenchman 's cloak gently over the mar face and let we remember he say that he try to save she some life be so at the very end a little reparation be make in life he be she evil genius when he die they trample he underfoot in order to reach she mademoiselle will you come he take maggie by the arm and lead she gently away she be shake all over but he hand be steady and wholly kind he lead she up the narrow stair to she own room in the little boudoir the fire be burn brightly the lamp be light just as the maid have leave they at the first alarm maggie sit down and quite suddenly she burst into tear steinmetz do not leave she he stand beside she gently stroke she shoulder with he stout finger he say nothing but the gray mustache only half conceal he lip which be twist with a little smile full of tenderness and sympathy maggie be the first to speak i be all right now she say please do not wait any longer and do not think I a very weak-minded person poor etta steinmetz move away toward the door yes he say poor etta it be often those who get on in the world who need the world 's pity most at the door he stop to-morrow he say i will take you home to england be that agreeable to you mademoiselle she smile at he sadly through she tear yes i should like that she say this country be horrible you be very kind to I steinmetz go down stair and find paul at the door talk to a young officer who slowly dismount and lounge into the hall conscious of he brilliant uniform -- of he own physical capacity to show off any uniform to full advantage he be a lieutenant in a cossack regiment and as he bow to steinmetz whom paul introduce he swing off he high astrakhan cap with a flourish show a fair boyish face yes he continue to paul in english the general send I over with a sotnium of man and pretty hungry you will find they we have cover the whole distance since daybreak a report reach the old gentleman that the whole countryside be about to rise against you who spread the report ask steinmetz i believe it originate down at the wharf it have be trace to a old man and he daughter -- a sort of pedler i think who take a passage down the river -- but where they hear the rumor i do not know paul and steinmetz carefully avoid look at each other they know that catrina and stépan lanovitch have send back assistance of course say paul i be very glad to see you but i be equally glad to inform you that you be not wanted steinmetz will tell you all about it and when you be ready for dinner it will be ready for you i will give instruction that the man be care for thanks the funny thing be that i be instruct with you approval to put the place under martial law and take charge that will not be necessary thanks answer paul go out of the open door to speak to the wild-looking cossack send for he protection in russium as in other country where life be cheaply hold the death formality be small it be only in england where we be so careful for the individual and so careless of the type that we have to pay for die and leave a mass of red-tape formality for we friend while the young officer be change he uniform for the evening finery which he servant 's forethought have provide paul and steinmetz hurriedly arrange what story of the evening should be give to the world know the country as they do they be enable to tell a true tale which be yet devoid of that small personal interest that gossip love and all the world ever know be that the princess howard alexi be kill by the revolt peasant while attempt to escape by a side door and that the baron claude de chauxville who be stay in the neighborhood meet he death in attempt to save she from the fury of the mob on the recommendation of karl steinmetz paul place the castle and village under martial law and there and then give the command to the young cossack officer pend further instruction from he general command at tver the officer dine with steinmetz and under the careful treatment of that diplomatist inaugurate a reign of military autocracy which vary pleasingly between strict discipline and boyish neglect before the master of the situation have sleep off the effect of he hundred-mile ride and a heavy dinner the next morning steinmetz and maggie be ready to start on they journey to england the breakfast be serve in the room abut on the cliff in the dim light of a misty morning the lamp be alight on the table and paul be wait when maggie come down cloak for she journey steinmetz have breakfast they say good-morning and manage to talk of ordinary thing until maggie be supply with coffee and toast and a somewhat heavy manly help of a breakfast-dish then come a silence paul break it at length with a effort standing as it be on the edge of the forbid topic steinmetz will take you all the way he say and then come back to I you can safely trust yourself to he care yes answer the girl look at the food set before she with a helpless stare it be not that can i safely trust etta 's memory to you judgment you be very stern paul i think you might easily misjudge she man do not always understand a woman 's temptation paul have not sit down he walk away to the window and stand there look out into the gloomy mist it be not because she be my cousin say maggie from the table it be because she be a woman leave she memory to be judge by two man who be both -- hard paul neither look round nor answer when a woman have to form she own life and render it a prominent one she usually make a huge mistake of it say the girl she wait a moment and then she plead once more hastily for she hear a step approach if you only understand every thing you might think differently -- it be because you can not understand then paul turn round slowly no he say i can not understand it and i do not think that i ever shall and steinmetz come into the room in a few minute the sleigh bearing steinmetz and maggie disappear into the gloom closely follow by a couple of cossack act as guard and carry despatch so etta sydney bamborough -- the princess howard alexi -- come back after all to she husband lie in a nameless grave in the churchyard by the volga at tver within the white wall -- beneath the shadow of the great spangled cupola -- they await the verdict almost side by side chapter xliv kismet between brandon in suffolk and thetford in norfolk run a quiet river the little ouse where few boat break the stillness of the water on either bank stand whisper beech-tree and so low be the music of the leaf that the message of ely 's distant bell float through they on a quiet evening as far as brandon and beyond it three year after etta 's death in the glow of a April sunset a canadian canoe be make its stealthy way up the river the paddle creep in and out so gently so lazily and peacefully that the dabchick and other waterfowl do not cease they chatter of nest and other April matter as the canoe glide by so quiet indeed be its progress that karl steinmetz -- suddenly white-headed as strong old man be apt to find themselves -- do not heed its approach he be sit on the bank with a gun a little rifle lie on the grass beside he he be half-asleep in the enjoyment of a large havana cigar the ray of the setting sun peep through the lower branch make he blink lazily like a large good-natured cat he turn he head slowly with a hunter 's consciousness of the approach of some one and contemplate the canoe with a sense of placid satisfaction the small craft be pass in the shadow of a great tree -- steal over the dark unruffled depth a girl dress in white with a large diaphanous white hat and a general air of brisk english daintiness be paddle slowly and with no great skill a picture say steinmetz to himself with teutonic deliberation gott im himmel what a pretty picture to make a old man young then he gray eye open suddenly and he rise to he foot coloss-a-al he mutter he drag from he head a lamentable old straw hat and sweep a courteous bow mademoiselle he say ah what happiness after three year maggie stop and look at he with troubled eye all the color slowly leave she face what be you do here she ask and there be something like fear in she voice no harm mademoiselle but good i have come down from big game to vermin i have here a saloon rifle i wait till a water-rat come and then i shoot he the canoe have drift closer to the land the paddle trail in the water you be look at my white hair he go on in a sudden need of conversation please bring you boat a little nearer the paddle twist lazily in the water like a fish 's tail hold tight he say reach down with a little laugh he lift the canoe and its occupant far up on to the bank despite my white hair he say with a tap of both hand on he broad chest i attach no importance to they she answer take he proffer hand and step over the light bulwark i have gray one myself i be get old too how old he ask look down at she with he old bluntness twenty-eight ah they be summer he say mine have turn to winter will you sit here where i be sit see i will spread this rug for you white dress maggie pause look through the tree toward the sink sun the light fall on she face and show one or two line which have not be there before it show a patient tenderness in the steady eye which have always be there -- which catrina have notice in the stormy day that be past i can not stay long she reply i be with the faneaux at brandon for a few day they dine at seven ah she ladyship be a good friend of mine you

at he then she sit down tell I she say all that have happen since then i go back answer steinmetz and we be duly exile from russia it be sure to come we be too dangerous altogether too quixotic for a autocracy for myself i do not mind but it hurt paul there be a little pause while the water lapped and whisper at they foot i hear say maggie at length in a measure voice that he have go abroad for big game yes -- to india he do not go to america enquired maggie indifferently she be idly throw fragment of wood into the river no answer steinmetz look straight in front of he no he do not go to

be my lot to stand helplessly by while he pass through many trouble perhaps the good god give he all he trouble at first do you think so maggie be look straight in front of she across the quiet river perhaps so she say steinmetz also stare in front of he during a little silence the common thought of two mind may well be draw together by the contemplation of a common object then he turn toward she

there be much happiness in life to make up for the rest but that happiness must be firmly hold it be so easily slip through the finger a little irresolution -- a little want of moral courage -- a little want of self-confidence -- a little pride and it be lose you follow I maggie nod there be a great tenderness in she eye -- such a tenderness as rest on man may bring they nearer to the angel steinmetz lay he large hand over hers mademoiselle he go on i believe that the good god send you along this lonely river in you boat paul leave I to-morrow he arrangement be to go to indium and shoot

at a table he be surround by papers and the pen in he large firm hand move rapidly over the sheet before he we still administer the estate say steinmetz in a low voice from we exile we still sow we seed they approach over the mossy turf and presently paul look up -- a strong face stern and self-contained the face of a man who would always have a purpose in life who would never be petty in thought or deed for a moment he do not seem to recognize they then he rise and the pen fall on the flag of the terrace it be mademoiselle say steinmetz and no other word be speak maggie walk on in a sort of unconsciousness she only know that they be all act a inevitable part write for they in the great libretto of life she never notice that steinmetz have leave she side that she be walk across the lawn alone paul come to meet she and take she hand in silence there be so much to say that word seem suddenly valueless there be so little to say that they be unnecessary for that which these two
