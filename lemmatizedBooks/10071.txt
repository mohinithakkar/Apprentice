very moment that krishna with a final shriek plunge into the sea they follow he carry he out of danger and lay he stark and speechless upon the margin of the wave thence after a pause and a final prayer they bear he homeward as man bear a corpse nor leave he until he have regain consciousness and he very self for with that last shrill cry the ghost of chandrabaus flee across the waste water to meet the pale ancestral dead and dwell with they for evermore : and the house of vishnu the fisherman be free from the curse of she vagrant and unpropitiated spirit she have never trouble I since that

hear more distinctly the sound in the house here rise the bright note of the shadus or luck song with which during the livelong night the woman of the house dispel the evil influence that gather around a birth a circumcision or a bismillah ceremony there one catch the passionate outcry of the husband vainly try to pierce the deaf ear of death for life in the city have harden the heart of the faithful and have lead they to forget the kindly injunction of the prophet still observe in small town or village up-country : -- neither shall the merry song of birth or of marriage deepen the sorrow of a bereaved brother the last sound that reach you as you turn homewards be the appeal of the sawale or beg fakir for a hundred rupee to help he on he pilgrimage all night long he tramp through the darkness stop every twenty or thirty pace to deliver he sonorous prayer for help nor cease until the muezzin voice the summons to morning prayer he be the last person you see this strange and

the city where a man may purchase nightly oblivion for the modest sum of two or three anna and hither come regularly like homing pigeon at nightfall the human flotsam and jetsam which the tide of urban life now toss into sight for a brief moment and now submerge within she bosom halt in that squalid lane which look out upon the traffic of one of the most crowded thoroughfare and listen if you will for some sign of life in the dark ungarnished house which tower above you all be hush in silence no voice no cry from within reach the ear the chal must be tenant only by the shadow not so at the far end of a passage into which the sullage water drip form ill-smelling pool a greasy curtain be suddenly lift for a minute disclose several flicker light girt about with what in the distance appear to be amorphous block of wood or washerman 's bundle grope you way down the passage push aside the curtain with you stick -- it be far too foul to touch with the hand -- and the mystery be make plain the room with its tightly-closed shutter and smoke-blackened wall be fill with recumbent man in various stage of _ deshabille _ all sink in the sleep which the bamboo-pipe and the little black pellet of opium ensure the room be not a large one for the habitual smoker prefer a small apartment in which the fume of the drug hang about easily and its reek wall be unadorned save with a chromo plan of the chief building at mecca a crude portrait of a hindu goddess and oleograph of british royalty it be all the same if these be absent for the opium-smoker come not hither to see picture save those which the drug brain fashion and care not for distinction of race creed or sovereignty the proprietor of the club may be a musalman he patron may be hindus christian or chinese and the dream which riot across the semi-consciousness of the latter be not concern as a rule with hero of either the spiritual or temporal kind -lrb- illustration : a opium club -rrb- the smoker lie all over the room in group of four or five each of whom be provide with a little wooden head-rest and lie curl up like a tired dog with he face towards the lamp in the center of the group in he hand be the bamboo-stemmed pipe the bowl of which remind one of the cheap china ink-bottle use in native office and close by lie the long thin needle which from time to time he dip in the saucer of opium-juice and hold in the flame until the juice frizzle into a tiny pellet fit for insertion in the bowl of the pipe the room be heavy with vapor that clutch at the throat for every cranny and interstice be cover with fragment of old sack defy the passage of the night air as you turn towards the door a fat mughal rise slowly from the ground and make obeisance say that he be the proprietor you club seem to pay shet-jus be it always as well patronise as it be this evening aye always come the sleepy answer for my opium be good the daily subscription but small and there be many whom trouble and sorrow have teach the road to peace they come hither daily about sundown and dream till day-break and again set forth upon they day 's work but they return they always return until sonapur claim they they be of all kind my customer there mark you be a sikh embroiderer from lahore here be a mahomedan fitter from the railway work-shop this one keep a tea shop in the nall bazaar that one be a pedlar and he you see smile in he sleep he be a seaman just arrive from a long voyage you hazard the question whether any of the customer ever die in this paradise of smoke-begotten dream and the answer come : not often for they that smoke opium be immune from plague and other sudden disease but the parrot which you see in the cage overhead be leave to I by one who die just where the saheb now stand he be a merchant of some status and use to travel to singapore and south africa before he come here but once after a longer journey than usual he return to find that he only son have die of the plague and that he wife have forget he for another therefore he cast aside he business and come hither in quest of forgetfulness here he daily smoke until he money be well-nigh spend and then one night he die quietly leave I the parrot you peer up through the fume and discern one bright black eye fix upon you half in anger half in inquiry the bird 's plumage be soil and smoke-darkened but the eye be clear wickedly clear suggest that its owner be the one creature in this languid atmosphere that never sleep what story it could tell if it could but speak-story of sorrow story of evil tale of the little kindness which the freemasonry of the opium-club teach man to do unto one another but as if it shun inquiry it retreat to the back of its perch and drop a film over its eye just as the smoke-film shutter in the consciousness of those over whom it mount guard further down the indescribable passage be a similar room the occupant of which be engage in a novel game two man squat against the wall on either side surround by they adherent each holding between he knee a long-stemmed pipe build somewhat on the german fashion into the bowl they push at interval a round ball of light opium or some other drug and then after a long pull blow with all the force of they lung down the stem so that the light ball leap forth in the direction of the adversary the game be to make seven point by hit the adversary as many time and he who win receive the exiguous stake for which they play what do you call this game you ask and a obvious sidus in the corner reply : -- this russian and japanese war sar japanese win the game move very slowly for both the player and onlooker be in a condition of semi-coma but the interest which they take in a occasional coup be by no means feign and be perhaps natural to people whose daily life be fraught with little joy round the corner lie a third room or club likewise fill with starve and sleepy humanity near the door squat a figure without arm who can scratch he head with he toe without alter he position what do you do for a living baba you ask i beg saheb i beg from sunrise until noon wander about the street and past the pedhi of the rich merchant and with luck i obtain six or eight anna that give I the one meal i need for i be a small man and the balance i spend in the club where i may smoke and lie at peace no i be not a maratha i be a panchkalshus but i reck nothing of caste now that belong to the past a light chuckle behind you as the last word be speak bring you sharp round on you heel and you discern huddle in the semi-darkness of the corner what appear in the miserable light of the cocoanut oil lamp to be a goanese boy there be the short gray knickers and the thin white shirt affect by the native christian boy there be the short black hair but the skin be white unusually white for a native of goa and there be something curious about the face which prompt you to ask the owner who he be and whence he come the only reply be a vacant but not unpleasant smile and the armless wastrel then volunteer the information that the child -- for she be little more -- be not a boy but a girl merciful heaven how come she here amid this refuse of humanity she be a orphan say the armless one and she be half-mad she parent die when she be very young and she mind become somehow weak there be none to take charge of she so we of the opium-club bring she here and in return for we support she run errand for we and prepare the room for the nightly conclave she be a mahomedan you look again at the dark-eyed child smile in the corner and you wonder what horror what ill-treatment or what grief bring she to this pass peradventure it be a mercy that she mind have go and can not therefore revolt against the squalor of she surroundings it be useless to ask she of herself she can only smile in she scanty boyish garb it be the saddest sight in this valley of the abyss where man purchase draught of nepenthe to fortify themselves against the care that the day bring the opium-club kill religion kill nationality in this case it have kill sex also -lrb- illustration : a madak-khana -rrb- iv the birthplace of shivajus about half a mile westward of the town of junnar there rise from the plain a colossal hill the lower portion whereof consist of steep slope cover with rough grass and a few tree and the upper part of two nearly perpendicular tier of scarped rock surmount by a undulating and triangular-shaped summit the upper tier commence at a height of six hundred foot from the level of the plain and rise another 200 foot extend dark and repellant round the entire circumference of the hill view from the outskirts of the town the upper scarp which run straight to a point in the north bear the strongest similarity to the side of a huge battleship ride over billow long since petrified and grass grow : and the similarity be accentuate by the presence in both scarp of a line of small buddhist cell the aperture of which be visible at a considerable distance and appear like the porthole or gun-port of the fossilised vessel unless one have a predilection for push one 's way through a perpendicular jungle or crawling over jagged and sunbaked rock the only way to ascend the hill be from the south-western side from the upper portion of which still frown the outwork and bastioned wall which once render the fortress impregnable the road from the town of junnar be in tolerable repair and lead you across a stream past the ruin mud wall of a old fortified enclosure and past the camping-ground of the twelve well until you reach a group of tree overshadow the ruin tomb of a former captain of the fort and other musulman the grave of the killedar be still in fair condition but the wall which enclose it be sorely dilapidated and the wild thorn and prickly pear creep unchecked through the interstice have run riot over the whole enclosure at this point one must leave the main road which run forward to the crest of the pirpadus pass and after cross a level stretch of rock set one 's step upon the pathway which flank on one side by the lofty rock-bastion of the hill and on the other by the rolling slope lead upward to the first gate at you foot lie the desert and ruin village of bhatkalum which once supply the musulman garrison with food and other necessaries and be now but a memory and above you head the wall and outwork of the phatak tower mark the vicinity of the shrine of shivabaus the family goddess of the founder of the maratha empire the pathway yield place to a steep and roughly-paved ascent girt with dense clump of prickly pear extend as far as the first gateway of the fortress there be in all seven great gateway guard the approach to the hill-top of which the first already mention the second or parvangicha darvaja the fourth or saint 's gate and the fifth or shivabai gate be perhaps more interesting than the rest one wonder why there should be seven gateway no more and no less be it merely a accident or the physical formation of the hill-side which lead to the choice of this number or be it perhaps a memory of the mysterious power of the number seven exemplify in both hebrew and hindu writings which induce the musulman to build that number of entrance to he hill-citadel the coincidence merit pass think the second gateway originally bear on either side at the level of the point of its arch a mystic tiger carve on the face of a stone slab hold in its right forepaw some animal which the _ gazetteer _ declare be a elephant but which more closely resemble a dog the tiger on the left of the arch alone abide in its place the other lie on the ground at the threshold of the gate local wiseacre believe the tiger to have be the crest of the killedar who build the gate and to have signify to the public of those lawless day much the same as the famous escutcheon in marmion with its legend who laugh at I to death be dight the saint 's gate so call from the tomb of a pir hide in the surround growth of prickly pear be the largest of all the gate and be form of splendid slab of dress stone each about 8 foot in length on either side of the gateway be rectangular recess which be doubtless use as dwelling or guardroom by the soldier in charge of the gate thence the pathway divide one track intend for cavalry lead round to the north-western side of the hill and the other for foot-passenger compose of rock-hewn step and pass directly upward to the shivabaus gate where still hang the great teak-door stud with iron spike against which the mad elephant of a oppose force might fruitlessly hurl they titanic bulk leave for a moment the direct path which climb to the crest of the hill past the buddhist cave and cistern we walk along a dainty terrace line with champak and sandalwood tree and pass under a carve stone gateway halt before the shrine dedicate to shivajus 's family goddess the dark inner shrine must have once be a buddhist cave carve out of the wall of rock and to it later generation add the outer hall with its carve pillar of teakwood which hang over the very edge of a precipitous descent repair to the shrine be at present in progress and on the day of we visit two bullock be tethered in the outer chamber the material of the stone-mason be lie here and there among the carve pillar and a painfully modern stone wall be rise in face of the austere threshold of the inner sanctuary the lintel of the shrine be surmount with inferior color picture of hindu deity and two print and tolerably faithful portrait of the great maratha chieftain thence in the word of the poet we turn and slowly clomb the last hard footstep of that iron crag and traverse the seventh and last gate reach the ruin _ ambarkhana _ or elephant-stable on the hill top it be a picture of great desolation which meet the eye the fragment of a wall or plinth cover with rank creeper a archway of which the stone be sag into final disruption and many a tumulus of coarse brown grass be all that remain of the wide building which once surround the _ ambarkhana _ the latter gray and time-scarred still rear on high its double row of arched vault but vandalism in the guise of the local shepherd and grass-cutter have claim it as she own and have brick up in the rudest fashion for the shelter of goat and kine the pointed stone arch which be once its pride another noteworthy feature of the summit of the hill be a collection of stone cistern of vary age still contain water the smaller open cistern in which the water be thick and cover with slime be of musalman origin but there be one or two in other part of the hill which clearly date from buddhist age and be coeval with the rock-cell the most important and interesting of all be four large reservoir support on massive pillar and hew out of the side of the hill which date from about 1100 ad and be in all probability build by the yadav dynasty of deogirus one of they know as ganga and jamna be full of clear cool water which the people say be excellent for drinking here again the hand of the vandal have not be idle for such name as gopal ramchandra etc be scrawl in english character over the face of the chief reservoir -- the holiday work no doubt of school-boy from junnar the presence of these four reservoir couple with other disappear clue prove that between the buddhist era and the date of the musulman conquest the hill must have be fortify and hold by hindu chieftain probably the yadava already mention the purely musulman remains include the _ ambarkhana _ a prayer-wall or _ idga _ the skeleton of a mosque with a delicate fly arch and a domed tomb in front of the prayer wall still stand the stone pulpit from which the _ moulvi _ of the fortress preach and intone the daily prayer but neither the prayer-wall nor the mosque have withstand the attack of time as bravely as the tomb for here scarce a stone have become displaced and the four pointed arch which rise upward to the circular dome be as unblemished as on the day when the builder gaze upon he finished work and find it good the _ gazetteer _ speak of it as a man 's tomb but the flat burial-slab within the arch point to it be a woman 's grave and local tradition declare that it be the body of the mother of one daulat khan which lie here have those she leave behind seek to bring peace to she dust they could have choose no more fitting site for she entombment for each face of the grave command a wide prospect of mountain and valley the massive hill rise tier after tier in the distance until they be but faint shadow on the horizon the intense solitude peculiar to mountain-country be break but fitfully by the wild-dove 's lamentation and even when the sun in mid-heaven beat down fiercely upon the grassy barrow of the hill top the breeze blow chill through the open arch and the dome cast a deep shadow over all at a little distance from the flying-arch mosque be two room build of stone in one of which accord to we muhammadan guide shivajus be bear whether it be actually upon the rough wall of this small chamber that shivajus 's eye first rest be open to considerable doubt and probably they be but a small portion of a once spacious mansion which cover the surrounding area now relic-strewn and desolate and in which the family of the chieftain reside these crumble hall the shrine of shivabaus and the outwork at the extreme north point of the hill be the only remain directly connect with maratha supremacy the out-work which overhang the sheer northern scarp perform the same function as the famous tarpeian rock of old rome thence the malefactor of maratha day be hurl down to swift death and history record one instance of seven outlaw be cast unrespited unpitied unreprieved into space from this inaccessible eyrie by a officer of the peshwa view from this point the whole plain seem a vast brown sea streak here and there with green : and the smaller hill rise like island from it they foot fold in the mist which creep across the level to the north beyond the larger range which encircle the valley the peak of harischandragad be dimly visible tower above the sahyadri and across the plain to eastward the suleman range end in the huge rounded shoulder of the ganesh lena spur shivner have know many change it give shelter to the buddhist in the first and second century of the christian era it be excavate and fortify by early hindu king who in turn yield place to the imperial bandit and they hold it until the english come and cry a truce to the old fierce war and all these have leave trace of they sovereignty amid the rock the grass and the rank weed of the hill it be a living illustration of the word of the poet : -- think in this batter would caravanserai whose portal be alternate night and day how sultan after sultan with he pomp abode he destine hour and go he way v the story of imtiazan the scene of she earliest memory be a small room with spotless floor-cloth the window whereof look out upon the foliage of ber and tamarind during the day a black-bearded man would recline upon the cushion idly fondle she and call she piyarus -lrb- dearest -rrb- and at night a pretty young woman would place she in a brightly-painted jhulum -lrb- swinging-cot -rrb- and sing she to sleep then the scene change he of the black beard be away and the form of the beloved lie stark beneath a white sheet while mysterious woman folk go to and fro within the house a kindly-faced old man who in earlier day have help she build little dust-heap beneath the tree take she from the warm cot and hand she over to a woman of stern face and rasp tongue with whom she dwell disconsolate until one fateful day she find herself alone in a market-place weep the passionate tear of the waif and orphan but deliverance be at hand the sight of the weep child touch a chord in the heart of gowhar jan the famous dancing girl of lahore she take the orphan home christen she imtiazan and do she best to blunt the evil memory of she desertion gowhar jan do she duty by the child accord to she light she engage the best gawayya to teach she music the best kath-thak to teach she dancing the best ustad to teach she elocution and deportment and the best of munshi to grind she in urdu and persian _ belle lettre _ so that when imtiazan reach she fifteenth year she accomplishment be noised abroad in the bazaar beautiful too she be with the fair complexion of the border-race slightly aquiline nose large dark eye and raven hair the latter unadorned and draw simply back in accordance with the custom of she mother 's people which forbid the unmarried girl to part she hair or deck it with flower she indo-punjabi dress the loose many-folded trousers the white bodice and the silver-bordered scarf of rise pink -- but add to she charm yet be gowhar jan trouble at heart for the girl be in she eye too modest too retire and care not at all whether she song and dance find favor with the rich landholder sikh sardar and the son of babu millionaire who crowd to gowhar jan 's house alas sigh gowhar jan she will never be like chanda malika gay witty and famous for generation she education have be waste and she name will die but imtiazan only pout and answer i care not to throw good saffron before ass -lrb- illustration : imtiazan -rrb- then fate cast the die she munshus one day bring to the house a musulman dress in the modern attire of young indium who have acquire such skill in play the sitar that he be able straightway and without mistake to accompany imtiazan 's most difficult song thereafter he come often to the house and gradually play himself into the affection of the young girl who after some hesitation consent to marry he and elope with he to a distant city thus imtiazan leave the house of she girlhood and flee with she husband to bombay money they have not where-fore imtiazan not without a pang sell she necklace of gold bead and bravely start house-keeping in the one small room they choose as they home while he go forth to seek employment worthy of he degree at the calcutta university and of he rohillum ancestry but alas work come not to he hand : and as the money slowly dwindle he grow morose and irritable and often make she weep silently as she sit stitch the embroidery design to provide the daily meal she know full well that vain pride baulk he employment and after many a struggle she prevail upon he to become a letter-writer a undergraduate who have read herbert spencer comte and voltaire say he can not demean himself to letter-writing for the public to which she justly reply that a education which prevent a man earn he daily bread must be worthless so in due course he install himself with a ill grace upon the footpath of bhendi bazaar with portfolio and inkhorn writing letter for uneducated musulman petition for candidate and english account for butler and the more he write the more convinced he become that he be sacrifice himself for a woman who could not realize the measure of he fall thus for a time matter remain -- little imtiazan wear she delicate finger out at home he ply he pen in the street until one day a dancing-girl from lucknow call he to she house to write a important missive on she behalf this chance acquaintance ripen into a friendship that bode no good for imtiazan : for within a month amid specious statement of lucrative employment and fair promise of future well-being he bid she prepare to leave the small room and accompany he to a larger house front a main thoroughfare which say he would henceforth be they home the sight of the unscreened window of she new home strike a chill into imtiazan 's heart and when the door open and she be meet by three elderly muhammadan who salute she as they bai-saheb fear take possession of she soul the thin red case hang on the wall tell she that the man be musician and in response to the mute appeal in she eye she husband bid she with almost brutal candor prepare to adopt she old profession of dancing and singing in order to save he from the hateful duty of a public letter-writer for two day imtiazan tend by the musician and they wife be a prey to the blackest despair and then deem it useless to protest she set herself courageously to do she husband 's bidding and to dance as she have dance in the house of gowhar jan but she little know the true depths of she husband 's selfishness money come not fast enough be he perpetual cry and he urge she at first gently but with ever-increasing vehemence to sink still lower the memory of the past and who know what higher instinct help she to withstand he sordid demand for many day but at length realize that this be _ kismet _ and tired of the perpetual upbraid she consent to do he bidding so for three weary year the water close over imtiazan one day she awake to find that she husband have crown he villainy by decamp with she valuable and all she savings she follow and find he and press into he hand a little extra money that he have in he hurry overlook she bid he a bitter farewell for ever she rest a day or two to get herself properly divorce from he and then return alone to the hate life in bombay there fortune smile upon she and wealth pour into she lap two year later by dint of careful inquiry she discover that the stern-faced woman who have abandon she in the lahore market be she uncle 's wife now widow and in poverty and to she she of she bounty give a pension for imtiazan though she never forget could always forgive and have never lose the sense of she duty to relation she also provide for the old man who have help she when a child to build the dust-castle beneath the tree of she old home and then while still young and with enough money leave to keep herself in comparative affluence she turn she back for ever upon the profession which she loathe and devote the rest of she life to the careful rearing of a orphan girl whom the desire for a child of she own and the memory of she own youth urge she to adopt when she die the child who have grow up and under she guidance have marry a respectable merchant mourn for she as one mourn for those who have lovingly shield we infancy and youth and many of the neighbor be sincerely grieve that imtiazan have depart for ever such be the life-history of imtiazan one of the most famous dancing-girls bombay have ever know -- a history that lack not pathos after she final renunciation of the profession of singing and dancing she might have remarry and in fact receive more than one offer from man who be attract by she kindliness of heart and by she beauty but she decline they all with the word marriage be not my _ kismet _ which be but the indian equivalent of my faith have depart and my heart be break surely the earth lie very lightly upon imtiazan vi the bombay mohurrum stray scene the luxury of grief seem common to mankind all the world over and the mourning of the mohurrum find its counterpart in the old lamentation for the slay adonis the emotional tale of sohrab 's death at the hand of he sire rustom and the long-drawn sorrow of the christian passion the persian inclination towards the emotional side of human nature be not slow to discover amid the early martyr of the faith one figure whose pathetic end be powerful to awaken every chord of human pity the picture of the woman and child of high lineage deceive desert and tortured with thirst of the child 's arm lop at the wrist even at the moment they be stretch forth for the blessing of the imam of the noblest chief of islam betray and choose death to dishonor of he last lonely onset he death and mutilation at the hand of a former friend and fellow-champion of the faith -- this picture indeed appeal and still appeal as no other can to the hidden depths of the persian heart the sunnus may object to the choice of hasan and husain as the martyr most worthy of lamentation put forward in they stead omar companion of the prophet himself who linger for three day in the agony of death or othman the third khalifa who die of thirst or the lion of god whose life come to so disastrous a close but the shium while admit that the death of the first martyr may have work severer loss to islam can not admit that they end surpass in pathos the tale of the bitter tenth of mohurrum when the star quiver in a bloody sky and the very wall of the palace of kufa rain tear of blood as the head of the martyr be bear before they he can not also approve the sunnus practice of convert a season of mourning into one of revelry and brawl for he do not realize the influence of the local hindu element upon the mohurrum and can not comprehend that the indian addition to the festival have they root in the deep soil of hindu spirit-belief for to the hindu and to the sunni mahomedan who have borrow somewhat from he all season of death and mourning act as a lode-stone to the unhoused and naked spirit who be ever wander through the silent space of the east some of these spirit we can appease or coax into become guardian-angel by housing they in handsome cenotaph other we can lodge in the horse-shoe or in that great spirit-house the tiger let they sport for a day or two in the body of we man and youth who be adorn with yellow stripe symbolical of they rle while other more malevolent spirit can only be drive away by shout buffeting and drum such as characterize the mohurrum season in bombay the indian element of nervous excitement might in course of age have be sober by the puritanism of islam but for the presence of the african who unite with a firm belief in spirit a phenomenal desire for noise and brawling and it be the union of this jovial african element with the sentimentality of persium and the spirit-worship of pure hinduism which render the bombay mohurrum more lively and more varied than any mahomedan celebration in cairo damascus or constantinople although the regular mohurrum ceremony do not commence until the fifth day of the mohurrum moon the mahomedan quarter of the city be astir on the first of the month from morn till eve the street be fill with band of boy and sometimes girl blow raucous blast on hollow bamboo which be adorn with a tin ` panja ' the sacred open hand emblematical of the prophet he daughter fatima she husband alus and they two martyred son the sacred five in the form of the outstretched hand adorn nearly all mohurrum symbol from the toy trumpet and the top of the banner-pole to the horseshoe rod of the devotee and the ` tazium ' or domed bier youth precede by drummer and clarionet-player wander through the street lay all the shop-keeper under contribution for subscription the well-to-do householder set to build a ` sabil ' or charity-fountain in one corner of he verandah or on a site somewhat remove from the fairway of traffic while a continuous stream of people afflict by the evil-eye flow into the courtyard of the bara imam chillum near the nal bazaar to receive absolution from the peacock-feather brush and sword there preserved meanwhile in almost every street where a ` tabut ' be be prepare elegiac discourse -lrb- ` waaz ' -rrb- be nightly deliver up to the tenth of the month by a _ maulvus _ who draw from r 30 to r 100 for he five night ' description of the martyrdom of husain while but a little distance away boy paint to resemble tiger leap to the rhythm of a drum and the arab mummer with the split bamboo shatter the nerve of the passerby by suddenly crack it behind he back the fact that this arab usually take up a strong position near a ` tazium ' suggest the idea that he must originally have represent a guardian or scapegoat design to break by means of he abuse buffoonery and laughter the spell of the spirit who long for quarter within the rich mimic tomb and the fact that the crowd who come to gaze in admiration on the ` tazium ' never retort or round upon he for the sudden fright or anger that he evoke give one the impression that the crack of the bamboo be in they belief a potent scarer of unhoused and malignant spirit turn off the main thoroughfare and you may perhaps find a lean musalman with a green silk skullcap sit in a raise and well-lighted recess in front of a urn in which frankincense be burn he have take a vow to be a dulum or bridegroom during the mohurrum there he sit crane he neck over the smoke from the urn and sway from side to side while at interval three companion who squat beside he give vent to a cry of bara imam ki dosti yaro din -lrb- cry din for the friendship of the twelve imam -rrb- then on a sudden the friend rise and bind on to the dulum 's chest a pole surmount with the holy hand place in he hand a brush of peacock 's feather and lead he thus bind and ornament out into the highway almost on the threshold of he passage a stout punjabi musulman come forward to consult he away away cry the friend naya jhar haus -lrb- this be a new tree -rrb- meaning thereby that the man be a new spirit-house and have never before be possess a little further on the procession which have now swell to considerable size be stop by a mahomedan from ahmednagar who seek relief he place he hand upon the dulum 's shoulder and ask for a sign repeat the creed mutter the ecstatic bridegroom repeat the durud say the dulum 's supporter and all present commence to repeat the kalmah or creed and the durud or blessing then turn to the mahomedan who stop he the bridegroom of husein cry : sheikh muhammad thou art possess by a jinn -- come to my shrine on Thursday next and with these word set forth again upon he wanderings further down the bhendi bazaar a deccan mhar woman come forward for enlightenment and the dulum after repeat the kalmah promise that she will become a mother before the year expire while close to phulgali a konkani musulman woman who have be possess for six month by a witch -lrb- dakan -rrb- be flick thrice with the peacock-feather brush and bidden to the dulum 's shrine on the follow Thursday so the dulum fare gradually forward now stop by a kunbus with a sick child now by some musulman mill-hand until he reach the bismillah shrine where he fall forward on he face with frothing mouth and convulse body the friend help the spirit which rack he to depart by blow into he ear a few verse of the koran whereat the dulum after a possession of about four hour regain consciousness look around in surprise and retire to he home fatigue but at last sane wherever a tazium or tomb be a-build there gather all the mohurrum performer the nal saheb or lord horse-shoe the tiger and the mummer of protean disguise the spot become a akhada or tryst at which the tomb-builder entertain all comer with draught of sherbet or sugared water but not with betel which have no place in season of mourning here for example come a band of maratha and kamathi with bell upon they ankle who form a ring in front of the tazium while they leader chant in a loud voice : -- alif se allah be se bismillah jum se meri jan tajun imam husein kus nyaz dharun alif for allah b for bismillah j for my life a offering be this to husein the chorus take up the refrain at interval accompany it with the tinkle of the ankle-bell and then as distant drum herald the approach of a fresh party they repeat the mohurrum farewell ishkus husein -lrb- love of husein -rrb- and pass away with the answer of the tryst-folk : yadus husein -lrb- memory of husein -rrb- still ring in they ear the new party be compose of bombay musulman youth the tallest of whom carry a umbrella make out of pink green and white paper under which the rest crowd and sing the follow couplet relate to the wife and daughter of husein : -- bano ne sakinah se kaha tum ko khabar hai baba gae mare bano say unto sakinah have you hear that you father be dead this party in turn yield place to a band of piper and drummer accompany man who whirl torch round they head so skilfully that the eye see nought but a move circle of flame and they be succeed by musulman man and boy disguise as konkanus fisherman and fishwife who chant elegy to husein and keep the rhythm by clap they hand or by swing to and fro small earthen pot pierce to serve as a lamp the last troupe dress in long yellow shirt and loose yellow turban represent swami narayan priest and pass in silence before the glitter simulacrum of the martyr 's tomb the most curious feature of the mohurrum celebration be the roystering and brawling of the _ toli _ or street-band which take place for two or three night after the fifth day of the month each street have its own band ready to parade the various quarter of the city and fight with the band of rival street if the rivalry be good-humoured little harm accrue but if as be sometimes the case feeling of real resentment be cherish head be apt to be break and the leader find themselves consign to the care of the police it be difficult to see the connection between these brawl street-company and the lamentation for hasan and husein but the rivalry of the _ mohollas _ recall the free-fighting which use once to take place between the various quarter of gujarat and kathiawar town during the holus festival while the beat shouting and general pandemonium evoke by the _ toli _ be probably akin to the extravagance once practice at the beating of the bound in england and scotland and be primarily design to scare away evil-spirits from the various quarter of the city the _ toli _ be indeed a relic of pure hinduism -- of aboriginal spirit-belief and have in the course of century be gradually associate with the great mahomedan festival of tear originally they can have have no connection with the mohurrum and be in essence as much divorce from the lamentation over the slaughter at karbalum as be the mummer the nal saheb and the lord of the conchshell -lrb- sain kowra -rrb- of the modern celebration from the true mahomedan who wander back from the sea-shore utter the cry of grief -- albida re albida ya huseini albida farewell farewell ah my husein farewell vii the possession of afiza it be quite evident that something be seriously wrong with abdullum the dhobus he feature have lose they former placidity and wear a aspect of troubled wonder the clothes which he erstwhile wash and return to they owner with such regularity be now bring back long after the proper date and occasionally be not return at all and the easy good temper which once characterize he conversation have yield place to sudden outburst of anger or protracted spell of sulkiness the major-domo consult on the point could only suggest that abdullum 's ill-temper be typical of the inherent badmashus of the dhobi nature and that probably abdullum have take to nocturnal potation while the youngest member of the household unhesitatingly lay down that abdullum have be seize by a bhut or in other word be possess of a devil when the former suggestion be lay before abdullum he contemn it with unmeasured scorn and then turn and rent the spirit of the butler with winged word but the small boy 's opinion seem to give he pause he hold he peace for a moment gaze earthward and rub a small heap of dust towards he with he toe and then on a sudden he burst out into the tale which be here set down in he own word : -- nay saheb i be possess of no devil but my wife afiza be sore trouble by one only three month ago i send for she from my village as she be expect to become a mother and i be desirous of look early upon my first-born child and for six week she dwell contentedly with I in the house which i have rent near the ghat and then the child be bear -- a child without blemish and afiza and i be happy but saheb the shadow of evil be even then draw nigh unto we for on the sixth day after birth when the midwife be about to light the four-wicked lamp for the ` chattus ' ceremony afiza suddenly cast the child from she leap wildly from the couch tear at she hair and sway to and fro as one demented and break the lamp with she hand and the midwife flee from the room cry for help and bring my mother and my sister in to try and soothe she and even while they wrestle with she spirit someone set light to the urn of frankincense for it be the evening of Thursday and as the thick smoke curl upward towards afiza she tremble and gasp out : ` this be my house and this woman have be deliver on the spot where i die in childbirth five year ago i will never cease trouble she for she have forget even to burn a little ` loban ' -lrb- frankincense -rrb- for the repose of my spirit ' so say my wife fall senseless on the ground and remain motionless for thirty minute until the spirit have flee and saheb from that day forward not a evening pass but the ` suwandus ' -lrb- the spirit of a woman who have die in travail -rrb- lay hold upon she and my house have become a place of evil and a byword among the neighbor several exorcist siyana and syed have we consult but all in vain they ministration only make she worse what can be do one can hardly conjecture the ultimate fate of abdullum and he family have not some one who take a interest in the case suggest a final resort to the sye from cambay who some little time ago open in gogharus street a branch of the famous gujarat shrine of miran datar to he abdulla half-hopeful half-desperate repair : and the sye come into he house and give afiza a potion compose of incense-ash and water from the miran shrine but the evil spirit be terribly violent and it require regular treatment of this nature for fully twenty day ere it could be dislodge evening after evening afiza be take into the presence of sye who summon forth the spirit with a drink of the sacrosanct water and at home abdullum and he mother who have be supply with water and ash by the sye be wont likewise to summon the spirit at any hour which they feel would cause it inconvenience thus the struggle between the power of light and darkness for the soul of afiza continue until at length the evil spirit deem it wise to depart and on the twenty-first day when it be rack afiza for the last time it demand as the final price of its departure the liver of a black-goat so abdulla hearken to the spirit 's will and bury the pledge of he wife 's recovery in a new earthen pot just at the spot where the four road meet near he house and afiza be at peace -lrb- illustration : possession of afiza -rrb- since that date nought have occur to disturb abdullum 's peace of mind the syed of gogharus street have earn well-merited fame among the poorer musulman inhabitant of that quarter abdullum have cast off he ill temper as it be a garment afiza the possess have become afiza the self-possessed help abdullum to earn he livelihood and obtain the approval of he master and the child unharmed by the evil eye and beloved of he parent be daily waxing in favor with god and man accord to abdulla the only spirit which occasionally attack he be a spirit of mischief not unknown to the parent of healthy little boy viii a kasumba den wander down one of the greatest artery of the city and you will perhaps notice on the east side of the street a double-storied house bear all the appearance of prolonged neglect and decay enter the low door and take a sharp turn to the right and you will find yourself at length on a ill - smell landing with a creak ladder-like staircase in one corner envelop from top to bottom in darkness so profound that one can almost conjure up vision of sudden death from the assassin 's dagger after a moment 's hesitation you commence to grope you way upward : the staircase sway and creak beneath you foot the air be heavy with strange odour something -- probably a cat -- scuttle past you and nearly upset you balance and put out you hand to steady yourself you finger touch something clammy and corpselike which turn out to be a ghatus labourer naked save for a loin-cloth asleep in the narrow niche between the wall of the ground-floor and the first storey one wonder what he pay for this precarious accommodation in which a sudden movement during sleep may mean a sheer drop down the dark staircase but fortunately he sleep motionless like one physically tire out perchance after drag bale about the dock shed since early morn or wander all day round the city with heavy load upon he head at length on the second storey a half-open door cast a arrow of light upon you path you hail it with joy after the cimmerian gloom of the lower floor and push the door further ajar you find yourself in a square low room light by two window which command a view of the street below it be carpet with cheap date-leaf mat and a fade polychrome dhurrus dirty white cushion be prop against the wall below the window a few square desk-like box lie in front of the cushion and in a semi-recumbent attitude around the room be some 20 or 30 man -- bombay and gujarat mahomedan man from hindustan and one or two daudus bohra the regular customer of the kasumba saloon there be one woman in the room -- a member of the frail sisterhood now turn faithful nursing a elderly and peevish lothario with a cup of sago-milk gruel which opium-eater consider such a delicacy : while the other customer sit in group talk with the preternatural solemnity bear of they favorite drug and now and again pass a remark to the cheery-looking landlord with the white skull-cap and henna-tinged beard each occupant of the room have be provide with a tiny glass of weak opium-water from the large china jar on the landlord 's desk pay a pice per glass for the beverage some drink one glass some two some three or more but as a rule the kasumba drinker confines himself to two glass be ashamed to own even to a brother tiryaki the real quantity of the drug consume by he : while a few strengthen by prolonged habit pay somewhat more than the ordinary price for a thicker and stronger dilution when the glass be empty the company call for desert for the opium-drinker must always have he _ kharbhanjan _ or bitter taste remover and the landlord straightway produce sweet fruit parched grain or sago-gruel know as _ khir _ accord to the taste of he customer hardly have dessert end when a elderly mahomedan in shabby garb fall out of the group and clear he throat to attract attention commence to recite a flowery prelude in verse he be the dastan-shah own brother -lrb- professionally -rrb- of the sammar or story-teller of arabium and the shayir of persium and cairo : and he story which he deliver in a quaint sing-song fashion richly intersperse with quotation from the poet of persium be usually cull from the immortal thousand and one night or be concern with the exploit and adventure of one of the great hero of islam amir-hamza for example be a favorite subject of the imaginative eastern story-teller amir-hamza accord to professor dryasdust die before the prophet but accord to the troubadour of islam be the hero of a thousand stir deed by flood and field and by the might of he right hand convert to the faith the dav and the peri of mount kaf -lrb- the caucasus -rrb- you will hear if you care to of he resourceful and trusty squire umar ayyar owner of the magic zambil or satchel which could contain everything and master of a rude wit similar to that of sancho panza which serve as a agreeable contrast to the somewhat ponderous chivalry of the knight-errant of islam \* \* \* \* \* thus the dastan-shah while away time until about 8 pm when the club break up and the fade aspasium help she fractious pericle down the rotten staircase and out into the night ere the company depart each member subscribe a pice for the story-teller who in this way earn about forty pice a day no inconsiderable income in truth for the mere retail of second-hand fable : and then with a word of peace to the landlord the man troop slowly forth to they home as we pass down the rotten staircase light this time for we benefit with a moribund cocoanut oil lamp we mark the maratha labourer still sleep heavily in he niche dream perhaps amid the heavy odour of the house of the fresh wind-swept upland of he deccan home ix the ganesh cave fifty-six mile to the north of poona lie the old town of junner which owe to its proximity to the historic nana ghat be in the earliest time a important center of trade as early as 100 year before the birth of christ the nana pass be one of the chief highway of trade between aparantaka or the northern konkan and the deccan and although the steep and

a bhandarus mystery -lrb- illustration : a bhandarus mystery -rrb- in the heart of the great palm-grove to the north-west of dadar lie a oart know as borkar 's wadi shaded by tall well-tended tree whose densely-foliaged summit ward off the noon-day sun and form a glistening screen at night what time the moon rise full-faced above the eastern hill not very long ago at a time when cholera have appear in the city and be take a daily toll of life this oart be the scene of a bi-weekly ceremony organize by the bhandari of dadar and mahim and design to propitiate the wrath of the cholera-goddess who have slay several member of that ancient and worthy community for the bhandari be it note know little of western theory of disease and sanitation and such precaution as the boil of water even be there time to boil it and abstention from fruit seem to they utterly beside the mark and valueless so long as the goddess of cholera jarimarus and the thirty-eight cholera mother be wroth with they thus at the time we speak of when many death among they kith and kin have afford full proof that the goddess be enraged they meet in solemn conclave and decide to perform every Sunday and Tuesday night for a month such a ceremony as would delight the heart of that powerful deity and stave off further mortality the limitation of the period of propitiation to one month be base not so much upon religious grounds as upon the fact that a municipality with purely western idea of sanitation and of combate epidemic refuse to allow the maintenance of the shed which be to be the temporary home of jarimarus for more than thirty day yet it matter but little this time-limit : for a month be quite long enough for the complete assuagement of the anger of one who though proverbially capricious be by no means unkindly \* \* \* \* \* let we glance at the ceremony as perform on a Tuesday night towards the middle of the month of propitiation in the darkest portion of the _ wadi _ stand a rude hut contain the emblem of the mother occupy for the time be by rama bhandarus who act as a species of medium between the goddess and he kinsman in front of the hut a space have be clear and level flank on one side by mat for the bhandarus musician singer drummer and cymbal-player and on the other by four or five chair and a few wooden bench for the initiate in the mystery and to the stem of several neighbouring tree lamp have be affix about five foot from the ground which cast weird shadow across the threshold of the goddess 's home rama the high-priest of this woodland rite -- a dark thin man with a look of anxiety upon he face -- enter the hut with he assistant govind while several fresh look bhandarus boy take up they position near the gong cymbal and drum prepare when the hour come to hammer they with might and main a pause -- and rama return bear the symbol or idol of the mother follow by govind carry a light saucer-lamp the idol for such we must perforce style it be nothing more nor less than a bright brass pot full of water set on a wooden stool which be thickly cover with flower in the mouth of the water-pot rest a husked cocoanut with a hole in the upper end into which be thrust the stem of a bouquet of jasmine with long arm of jasmine hang down on either side now the water-pot be the shrine the very home of jarimarus and the thirty-eight cholera mother behind the jasmine-wreathed stool govind place another stool bear a tin tray full of uncooked rice camphor and black and red scented powder and close to it he pile the cocoanut sugar camphor cake betel-nut and marigold which the bhandarus initiate have send as a offering to rama he next produce a pile of incense-sprinkled cinder which he place in front of the goddess and several incense-cone which he light while rama lay down a handful of light cane for use at the forthcoming ceremony and while the rich scented smoke rise in cloud into the still night-air shroud the goddess 's face govind take a little rice from the tray and a few flower and place they on a tulsus or sweet basil shrine which stand a little northward of the hut \* \* \* \* \* all be now ready rama bid the boy sound the note of gathering and at once such a clashing and drum arise as would frighten all the devil of the palm-grove the people come but slowly for many of they work late in the mill and have to go home and cook and eat they evening-meal before they can take part in the rite of the mother but at last group of woman appear out of the darkness barehead save for flower-wreath and a few gold ornament they saris wound tightly round waist and shoulder they cluster silent and close-packed round the door of the hut for they be the woman whom the thirty-eight mother love to possess and to lash into the divine frenzy which only the human form can adequately portray govind stir the incense-heap the dense smoke roll forth again and shroud all there be a feeling of witchery in the air and in the midst of the smoke-pall one can just descry rama bend low before the mother now he rise draw the rattan-cane through he hand and then lean against a palm-tree with eye tightly close and hand quiver as if in pain but hark there be something toward in the hut and out of the darkness dash two young woman right in front of the goddess leap and toss they arm they sway and twist they lithe form in the smoke but utter no word only one can see they breast heave beneath the sari and can catch the sharp hoo hoo of they breathing as they frenzy heighten now from the other end of the hut two more rush forth staggering towards the tulsus shrine and after the same mad gyration dance towards the mother and bury they head in the smoke and they be follow at momentary interval by other who fly some to the tulsus shrine other to the goddess but all mad with frenzy dancing leap sway until they sink overpower by fatigue meanwhile rama be perform a devil dance of he own in the smoke-cloud the gong be ring cymbal clash onlooker shout the tress of the woman have fall down and in the half-light look like black snake writhe in torture the woman themselves be as mad as the bacchante and menad of old fable : in a word it be pandemonium let loose \* \* \* \* \* the noise ebb and flow now die down as the first frenzy fade away now rise more shrill as the spirit of the mother wrack she devotee more fiercely that tall finely-formed young woman who dance like a puppet without will and who never seem to tire be moti leader of the dancer and the favorite choice of jarimarus there behind she be ganga the slightly-built beloved of devus and in the midst of the smoke sway frog-like be godavarus lash to madness by mother ankaus around they dance by two and three the rest of the woman with dishevelled lock and loosen robe whom rama tap from time to time with he cane whenever they show sign of give in but at length nature reassert she sway and the dancer one and all crouch down in the smoke they dark side heave painfully in the dim light like the implement of some ghostly forge now govind appear again with a tray and mark the brow of the woman with a finger-tip of vermilion he own brow be mark by they in turn he place a cake of camphor on the tray and set light to it and as the clear flame burst forth in front of the mother the whole congregation rise and shout devi ki jaya -lrb- victory to the goddess -rrb- then motus take the tray and balance it on she head dance slowly with long swing stride round the mother while the music burst out with renew vigor urge the other woman the human tabernacle of the cholera deity to follow suit thereafter the camphor-cake be hand round to both woman and man in turn who plunge they hand in the ash and smear they face with they and so after distribution of the offering of cocoanut sugar and betel the celebration close a few girl still dance and jerk they shine body before the altar but rama who be get weary touch they with he hand command the frenzy to cease and with a sigh they withdraw one by one into the dark shadow of the palm-grove \* \* \* \* \* such be in brief the ceremony of propitiation of the cholera-goddess what do it signify it appear that accord to bhandari belief the disease be the outcome of neglect of the mother the present condition of life in the cramped and fetid chawl of the city the long hour of work necessitate by higher rental and a higher standard of live leave she devotee but little leisure for she worship she be madden by neglect and in revenge she slay she ten or fifteen in a night yet be she not by nature cruel fashion for she a pleasant shrine flower-decked burn incense before she beat the drum in she honor let the woman offer themselves as the sport and play-thing of she madness and of a surety will she repent she of the evil she have do and will stay the slaughter in spirit-parlance a woman choose by the spirit into whom as into a shrine the mother enter be know as a jhad or tree : for just as a tree yield rustling and quiver to the lightest breath of the gale bend its head and move its branch to and fro so the woman lose all consciousness of self play as the breath of the mother stir they quiver beneath she gentler gust bend they body and toss they arm beneath the stronger blast and cast themselves low with bow head and streaming hair as the full force of the storm enwrap they they be in very truth as tree shake by the wind nay more the mother herself once live in human form : she know the pleasure the comfort of the body and she be fain by enter the body of she female devotee to renew the memory and suggestion of she former life \* \* \* \* \* in conclusion one may briefly record what the bhandari thought of the presence of a european at they sacred rite some fear he as one that contemplate the imposition of a new tax other view he askance as a doctor from the hospital despatch by higher authority to put a end to the ceremony and yet other -- the larger number insooth -- deem that here at last be a saheb who have find physic a failure and have learn that the mother alone have power to allay grievous sickness xi scene in bombay a musulman

\* meanwhile there be some movement toward in the half-light of the inner room from time to time you catch a glimpse of the black sphinx-face immobile and heavy-eyed frame in scarf bear a bold pattern of red monkey and blue palm-tree : and as the din increase the owner of those inscrutable face creep out and sink down upon a strip of china matting on the far side of the room they be the wife and daughter of the community -- some of they young and from the sidus point of view good to look upon other emulate the elephant in bulk but all preternaturally solemn and immovable here and there among the face you miss the well - know type the thick prominent lip yield place to more delicate mouth the shapeless nose to the slightly aquiline for there be half-breed here who take more after they indian father than they african mother and who serve as a living example of the trick that nature can play in the intermingling of race -lrb- illustration : sidi of bombay -rrb- and now the piper in the corner set up a wilder strain the drummer work till they muscle crack now look as if they be undergo torture now turn half-round to have a joke with a fresh arrival until the tension reach breaking-point and with a shout some ten man dash forward and form a ring round the musician commence the wild bomo dance even as they savage ancestor be wont to do in past age round the camp-fire of africa watch they as they move round they be obviously inspire by the noise and be bent heart and soul upon encourage the laggard to join in one of they as he pass shout out that he sail by the p and o dindigul the next day and intend to make a night of it another be wear the south african medal and say he earn it as fireman-serang on a troopship from these shore while a third in deference to the english guest give vent at interval to a resonant hip hip hurrah which almost drown the unmelodious effort of the maestro with the kerosine-tin the bomo dance be follow with scarce a pause by the lewa a kind of festal revel in which the dancer move inwards and outwards as they circle round and this in turn yield place to the bondogaya and two religious figure the damalus and chinughus which be say when properly perform to give man the power of divination long ere the lewa draw to a close the woman have join in first two of the younger woman move from the corner one of they with eye half - close and preserve a curious rigidity of body even while she foot be rythmically tap the floor : then two more join and so on until the circumference of the dancing-circle be expand as far as the size of the room will allow and not a single woman be leave on the china mat some of they be as completely under the spell of the music as the man but they exhibit little sign of pleasure or excitement on they face and be it not for a occasional smile or the weird shriek they raise at interval one might suppose they all to be in a state of hypnotism perchance they be the most vivacious of they all be the old patelnus who since the death of queen sophie have be in almost complete control of the female portion of the sidus community she have no place in the chain of dancing fanatic but stand in the center near the drummer now break into a pas seul on she own account now urge a laggard with all the force of a powerful vocabulary beating time the while upon the shoulder of the nearest drummer so the revel progress sometimes die down into a slow movement in which only the hoarse breathing of the man the tap-tap of female heel be hear and anon breaking into a kind of gallop punctuate with shout of bravo hip hip hurrah and the queer dental shriek which we friendly serang tell we be the peculiar note of the african reveller but at length nature assert she sway and after the dancing have last almost without interruption for three hour the sidus patel hassan give permission for a brief recess during which he introduce to the spectator the son of the sidus chief makanda -- a fine specimen of manhood whose six-foot stature belie the fact that he be still accord to sidi view a minor incapable of look after he own interest at this juncture too a itinerant coffee-seller limp into the room with he tin can and cup and be straightway pounce upon by the breathless performer who apparently find coffee better dancing-powder than any other beverage how much you ask he do you charge per cup saheb come the answer for two rupee you can treat the whole gathering man woman and child to a cup apiece for this coffee be of the best so we pay we footing in kind and bid adieu to the dancer who be prepare to continue the revel till the early hour of the morning as we turn the corner into ripon road we catch a final glimpse of we bemedalled serang execute a fandango on the door-step and of the sidus patel with a cup of hot coffee in he hand shout in broken english good-night god save the king xiv a konkan legend legend and tradition have render many a spot in indium sacrosanct for all time and to no tract perhaps have such tradition cling with greater tenacity than to the western littoral which in the dawn of the century watch the trader of the ancient world sail down from the horizon to barter in its port as with gujarat and the coast of kathiawar so with the konkan it be a broken tale of strange arrival strange building strange trafficking in human and inanimate freight that greet the student of ancient history and bewilder the ethnologist the konkan in which in earliest day the beast with man divide empire claim and which itself be dower with a legendary origin not wholly dissimilar in kind from the story of ramese iii and he naval conquest offer a fair sample of these semi-historical myth in the tale of the arrival of the chitpavan at chiplun in ratnagirus for so run the tale on a day long bury in the abyss of time it chance that a terrific storm gather over the western water and as night draw on the sky black with serried rank of cloud burst into sharp jet of fire the rain pour forth in torrent unquenchable and the shriek of a mighty whirlwind mingle with the deep echo of indra 's thunder drown even the roar of the storm-lashed sea among the ship abroad on that night be one of strange device with high peaked prow man by a crew of fair-skinned and blue-eyed man which be forge its way from a northern port to some fair city of southern indium and when the storm strike she she be not many mile from what we now call the ratnagiri coast bravely do she battle with the tempest bravely do she man essay to keep she on she course bring to play they hereditary knowledge of sea-craft they innate dexterity of brain but all they scheming all they courage prove fruitless as a bridegroom of old time scatter the bridal procession by the might of a powerful right arm the sea sweep away she protector and carry she lone and defenceless on to the surge-beaten shore and when morning break surya rise red above the eastern hill watch the hungry wave cast up beside she fourteen white corpse the remnant of she crew -- silent suppliant for the last great rite which open to man the passage into the next world now at the ebb of the tide the dark people that dwell upon the marge of the sea fare shoreward and find the blue-eyed mariner lie dead beside they vessel and they marvel greatly what manner of man these might have be take counsel among themselves and decide to bestow upon they the last rite of the dead so they build a mighty funeral pyre for they with log of resinous wood hew in the dark forest that stretch inland and they fortify the soul of the dead seaman with prayer and lamentation but lo a miracle : for as the flame hiss upward purge the body of all earthly taint life return to they by the grace of parashurama and they rise one and all from the pyre and praise he of the axe in that he have raise they from the dead and make they truly chitta-pavana or the pyre purify and they dwell henceforth in the land of the arrow of they deliverer and be at peace forget they former home and they drear wander over the pathless sea and take perchance unto themselves wife from among the ancient holder of the soil now the place where they abide be call chittapolana or chiplun unto this day -lrb- illustration : parashurama and the chitpavan -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* and it come to pass in the fulness of time as the sahyadri-khand tell that parashurama call all brahman to a great festival in the new land which he have create between the mountain and the sea but the twice-born hearken not to he word whereas the god wax wroth determine to create new brahman who would not turn a deaf ear to he counsel revolve this decision in he heart he walk down to the shore and there in the seaward-gazing burning-ground he meet a stranger-people white-skinned blue-eyed and fair to look upon and ask they who they be and whence they come fisherman -lrb- or hunter -rrb- be we they answer and dwell upon the seashore sixty family of we in all and the god be please with they and raise they to the rank of brahman divide they into fourteen gotra and make they a solemn promise that should they ever call he to mind in any real emergency he would come to they assistance so they dwell for many a day waxing by the favor of god both numerous and learn until by ill-hap they hearken into evil counsel and call upon the god without just reason and he when he learn what they have do be exceed wroth and curse they doom they to sorrow and to the service of other man so long as the sun and moon should endure thus the chitpavan gain they brahmanhood but lose they right to superiority in that they flout the promise of they god such be the legend popular and puranic of the come of the chitpavan to western indium that some historic truth lie below the garbled tale of shipwreck and resurrection be partly prove by the physical trait of they descendant -- of those man in fact whose immediate ancestor employ at first as messenger or spy of maratha chieftain by innate cleverness tact and faculty for management gradually weld together the loose maratha confederacy and become director of the internal and external politics of the peshwa 's dominion for to this day the true chitpavan perserve the fair skin the strange gray eye the aspect of refined strength and intelligence which must have characterize the shipwrecked mariner of old fable and mark they out in later year as stranger in a strange land but whence come they these foreign immigrant who after long sojourn in the country of they adoption move upward to the deccan and stand within the shadow of the peshwa 's throne much have be write of they origin much that be but empty theory : but as ` historicus ' have remark in the column of a local journal the lesson to be learn from they home dialect and from they strange surname -- gogte lele karve gadre hingne and so on -- be that the chitpavan brahman of western indium come in legendary age from gedrosium kirman and the makran coast and that prior to they domicile in those latitudes they probably form part of the population of ancient egypt or africa that they be once a seafaring and fishing people be prove by the large number of word of oceanic origin which still characterize they home-speech while accord to the authority above mention the chandrakant which they recognize be not the sweating crystal of northern indium and ancient sanskrit lore but a fossil coral find upon the makran coast forty year ago rao saheb v n mandlik remark that the ancestor of the tribe probably come by ship either from some other port in indium or from the opposite coast of africa and in these later day he theory be corroborate by general haig who trace they back to the great mart on the indus and thence still further back to the persian gulf and egypt why or at what date they leave the famous country of the pharaoh none can say : but that these white-skinned brahman be descendant of such people as the berber who belong of right to the european race seem the most plausible theory of they origin yet put forward and serve as a additional proof of the enormous influence exercise upon posterity by the famous country of the nile thus perhaps the legend of storm and shipwreck be not false but record in poetic diction the arrival on these shore of man who presumably have in some degree inherit the genius of the most famous and most civilized country of prehistoric age and who have by long trafficking in dangerous water and by the hardship of long migration acquire that self-reliance and love of mastery which have be bequeath almost unchanged to they brahmanised descendant the chitpavan be indeed the child of the storm and something of the spirit of the storm live in they still some trace be theirs of the old obstinacy which teach those pale ancestor to fight against insuperable force until they be cast naked and broken upon the seashore and peradventure the secret lesson of the ancient folk-tale be this that the god of the axe despite the curse be still at hand to help they along the path to new birth provide always that they cause be fair that they invoke not he aid for trivial or unjust end and that they have be truly purify in the pyre of affliction xv nur jan the singer only sing the joy of life for all too well alas the singer know how hard the daily toil how keen the strife how salt the fall tear the joy how few nay saheb i accept no money for my song from you and you friend for you have take a kindly interest in I and my past history and have shew I the respect which my birth warrant but which alas my occupation have make forfeit in the eye of the world but -- if you have find satisfaction in my singing then write somewhat of I and of my mimi to the paper even as you do of imtiazan that thus you people -- the people who know not the inner life of indium may learn that i be not bear amid the saringi and the bell and that i the singer hide within my heart a life-long regret -lrb- illustration : nur jan -rrb- so she speak seat on the clean white floor-cloth of the brightly-lighted diwankhana like some delicate flower cradle on a crystal lake we have see she once before at the house of a indian friend who have hospitably invite a company to witness she song and dance we have hear she chant the subtle melody of hindustan and even old english roundelay for the special delectation of the english guest we have remark she delicate hand the great dark eye the dainty profile the little ivory foot and above all the gentle voice and courteous bearing and we realize that nur jan have not be breed to this uncurtained life but must once have know the care affection and the gentle training of a patrician home by what caprice of evil fortune have she come to this hire out she voice and she nimble foot to enhance the pleasure of a chance entertainment far from she own people and from she northern indian home what secret lay in the song of the frail maiden on the bank of the jamna in the earnest request she make to we not to mention the name of dead royalty before she attendant-musician the mystery remain unsolved for that evening and it be not till some week later that the chance of a official enquiry bring we face to face again but this time the ill-starred dancing-skirt and bell have be lock away and in they stead we see the silken jacket the spangled pale-blue sari cover by a diaphanous black veil like a thin cloud half-veiling the summer heaven the necklace of pearl round the olive pillar of she throat and above they the calm face and the wealth of dark hair that scorn all artificial adornment there she sit in she own house singing to two rich arab and a subordinate agent of one of the greatest ruler of asia while behind she mimi aged two year -- the legacy of a dead affection croon and try to clap she small hand in rythm with she mother 's song and in the pause of she singing while the musician tighten they bow and the silver pan-box be pass round to she indian-guest she lift a little way a very little way the curtain of the past yea saheb you have rightly speak i come of a good family and as a child i be send to school in calcutta and learn you english tongue when i grow to girlhood i determine to study medicine and serve the woman of my faith as a doctor but barely have i commence the preliminary lesson of compound when the trouble come upon we house and my sister and i be bring away from the old home to bombay and bidden to find the wherewithal to support those to whom we owe respect and affection saheb with we the word of near relation be law and they support a sacred duty what could we gently-bred mahomedan girl do in a strange city we have always like singing and have take lesson in we home and it seem that herein lay the only chance of support ourselves and other therefore not without hesitation not without tear we bid adieu to the ` pardah ' of we people and cast the pearl of we singing before the public thus have it be since that day my sister by good-hap have marry well and regain the shelter of the curtain : but i be still unwed and must sing until the end come how can i seek help of my grandsire have i not disgrace he name by adopt this life and be i mean enough to ask he favor would he not first insist that i become once more ` pardahnashin ' i can not live again behind the screen for too long have i be independent the filly that have once run free care not afterwards for the stall and bridle it have be a evil mistake saheb but one not of my make i sometimes loathe the light the tinsel the bell aye even the old song for they remind I of what i might have be but for another 's fault and of what i be you ask of mimi 's future so long as i live she never shall play a part in this work mate with a good man of mine own faith she will never know regret that be my great wish saheb the issue lie with allah so the tale run on with its accompaniment of song its suggestion of regret once in the middle of a ballad a funeral pass in the street below the mourner 's chant sound above the bourdon of the tom-tom the wail of the saringis hush hush cry nur jan let the dead pass in peace it be not meet that the song of the dancing-girl should be hear upon the final journey one more refrain one more question on the mystery of she birth and we ask permission to depart offering at the same time some small token of we approval of she song to which she reply in the word that commence this chapter we catch a last glimpse of she bidding we good-bye in the gentle manner that tell its own tale and of mimi croon to herself and try to push a much-crumpled playing-card -- the queen of heart -- into the cinglet of she small pyjamas xvi governor and kolus a fisherman 's legend a friend have supply I with the follow quaint history of a well-known marathus ballad which be widely chant by the lower class in and around bombay compose originally as a song of seed-time it have now lose its primary significance and be sing by man at they work or by mother hush they child in the dark alley of the city the verse run thus : -- nakhwa kolus jat bholi ghara madhye dravya mahamar topiwalyane hukum kelum batliwalyachya barabar which may be rudely interpret as follow : -- seaman kolus of simple mould have in he house great store of gold lo at the order of topiwalum kolus be peer of batliwalum now the word topiwalum mean a englishman and batliwalum be a reference to the first parsus baronet sir jamsetjus jeejeebhoy : albeit the word be often use as a synonym for millionaire in much the same way as shankershet have creep into marathi parlance as the equivalent of rich and prosperous the story which the koli relate with pride refer to the great wealth of zuran patel the ancestor of mahadev dharma patel who at this moment be the headman and leader of the christian koli of bombay that zuran patel be a rich man can be prove from the ancient document relate to the property recently acquire by the improvement trust in and around mandvus for he name appear as chief owner in many of they and it seem clear that the spoil which he gather from the sea form the basis of a goodly heritage upon dry land he be a intimate friend of a certain parsus millionaire whom the composer of the ballad have suppose to be sir jamserjus jeejeebhoy but who be more probably a member of the great family of wadium -- the original ship-builder and dock-master of the east indium company it chance one day that the governor of bombay -lrb- perhaps lord falkland or lord elphinstone -rrb- wander into mandvus koliwada and come suddenly upon the parsus and the kolus patel sit in converse with one another up rise the parsus millionaire and make obeisance but the kolus quite indifferent and not recognize the solitary topiwalum remain in he seat he excellency 's curiosity be arouse and ask the parsus the name of he scantily-clad comrade he be inform that the man be a rich fisherman who from time to time be accustom to spread out he pile of gold and silver in the street to dry and add the parsus so simple and guileless be he that the people walk over the glittering heap with wax on they foot thus rob he in open daylight and yet he do nought believe that the pile of wealth must shrink even as he pile of fish shrink when place in the sun to dry interested in the man 's personality the governor ask the parsus to introduce the patel to he and enquire whether he would grant some portion of he wealth to government yes as much as the government may desire be the ready answer but quoth he excellency what will you ask of government in return only this answer the kolus that government will grant I the exclusive privilege of roofing my house with silver tile after some little discussion a compromise be effect and zuran patel receive permission as a special mark of favor to place a few copper tile above he house the house in dongri street where mahadev dharma patel now reside be repute to be the identical house upon which the copper tile be once fix but many alteration have take place and the tile have disappear for many year so run the tale they be preserve as a sort of family escutcheon be take off the roof and fix in a conspicuous position in the wall perhaps they be steal perhaps they be wear away by constant polishing who can say they have pass beyond the realm of fact to that of legend suffice it to say that the koli firmly believe the whole story and add that zuran patel 's house be the only real strong-house in bombay at that epoch the wall be build upon a framework of iron girder and the cellar contain the pile of silver be stouter than a modern safe it seem not improbable that the old cellar of mandvus kolivada be originally the colouring-pond of the fisherman which as building progress and crowd set in be enclose with tile and brick and mortar and utilise as store-room such be the history of the quaint ballad of the english governor the parsus millionaire and the kolus patel it seem to we to crystallise the honorable connection and friendship which have exist from the earliest day of british rule in bombay between the aboriginal-fishermen the parsus pioneer of commerce and the english government in the person of its highest representative it recall to we the day of siege and warfare when the governor of the struggle settlement seek the help of the sturdy fisherman and when rustom dorabjus put himself at they head form they into a rudely-drilled corps and drive the sidus off the island it recall the action of the honorable thoma hodge in they behalf a century and a half ago and the subsequent confirmation of they ancient rights by sir jame fergusson and sir bartle frere and lastly it represent a belief which have attain almost the sanctity of religion in the heart of kolidom that between themselves and the king 's representative in bombay there exist a bond of good-feeling and respect which date as it do from 1675 have be weld firm by time and shall never be break -lrb- illustration : a kolus -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* xvii the tribe errant -lrb-

of the early fakir or mahomedan beggar whose object be not so much to wake the faithful and bid they remember the prayer that be better than sleep as to be the earliest bird to catch the mouthful of

generosity of ali set to verse for the special behoof of he brotherhood by some needy poetaster like the famous nazir of agra he be follow by another who chant in deep bass tone a legend explanatory of the virtue of the great saint of baghdad but alus be the favorite of the beggar-tribe because forsooth the beggar run no risk in singing he praise if one glorify the other three khalifa in a sunni quarter it be well with one but not so in a area devote to the shia population : and so the beggar choose alus 's name as a convenient and fitting means of open the purse-string of both the great

-lrb- b c 110 -rrb- when the great monk -lrb- sramana -rrb- fashion the nineteenth cave in the reign of krishna the satakarnus nor have vandalism in the guise of the mahayana school be alone at work here the tenth cave once contain a relic-shrine or _ dagoba _ similar to the relic-shrine at karlus shivner and ganesh lena but in its place now stand a hideous figure of bhairav aflame with red-lead and nought remain to testify to the former presence of the shrine save the buddhist t capital the umbrella and the flag which surmount it the eleventh cave bear trace of jain sacrilege in the blue figure of the tirthankar or hierach who sit cross-legged in the back wall and in the figure of ambika on the right but the most conspicuous example of the alteration of ancient monument to suit the need of late comer be the twentieth cave where the colossal buddha who muse with he attendant in the dense darkness of the inner shrine have be smear with black pigment and adorn with gold tinsel and be proudly introduce to you by the local _ pujarus _ as dharmaraja the eldest of the five pandava the surrounding bodhisattva be metamorphose into nakulum sahadeva bhima arjuna krishna and draupadus the joint wife of the five alas for the perfect one in whose honor as the inscription tell we the wife of the great war-lord bhavagopa commence build the cave in bc 50 he have long be forget and the hand which he uplift in token of the four verity discover after great agony and temptation beneath the tree of wisdom be now point out as the wrathful hand of the demi-god of the mahabhara once and once only in these later day have the buddha evince he displeasure at the modernization of he ancient shrine about the year 1880 come hither a bairagus naked and wild who wall off a corner of the cave and raise a clay altar to he puny god sacrilege intolerable and the buddha through the hand of a avaricious kolus smite he unto death and hurl he naked corpse down hill the titanic figure be still worship by the hindu : flower and light lamp be daily offer up to he by the ignorant hindu priest but he sit immutable inarticulate content in the knowledge that to they that have understand he real message of humanitarianism speak through the cloud of falsehood which now enwrap he presence much might be write of the strange medley of creed which be symbolise in these cave the nagdeva with they serpent-canopy which be relic of a primordial sun and serpent worship totally foreign to pure buddhism appear side by side with the swastika or life-symbol of the greater creed with the lotus and other symbol of a phallic cult and as in the small cistern near cave 14 with the female face represent the low-class hindu belief in the divinity of the smallpox jain image of a later school of buddhism date from the 5th or 6th century after christ have help to rob these home of buddhist mendicant of they original simplicity and severity and have render it almost impossible for any save the wise man of the east to read they chequered history aright in almost the last cave we enter where two stand figure on the right and leave mount guard over the well-known image of the master we footstep rouse a large female rat and she young which crawl up the silent seat figure and take refuge on the very crown of its head sanctuary so we turn aside to scrutinise the strange symbolical figure of the twenty-fourth cave and the story of the chaste and unchaste wife which be hew in the ornamental gateway of the third from the terrace in front of the cave a fine panorama greet the eye below commence the wide plain which creep northwards to the rugged hill comprise the weird couch-shaped summit of ramsej and the solitary cone of the chambhar hill embosome the great jain cave of the 12th century beyond the chambhar cone climb heavenwards the castellated pinnacle of the chandor range mist-shrouded in this monsoon season in the nearer distance the primeval brahman settlement of govardhan sleep amid she mango-grove and opposite to it the modern christian village of sharanpur mark the threshold of that tract of fair woodland and fairer garden which be nasik 's pride here and there a red roof catch the sun 's ray and shew a splash of orange amid the green but save for this the picture have but two tint the warm green of the plain country in the foreground and the gray of the mighty mountain-range which stand sentinel behind it you foot rest upon soil hallowed by the memory of two thousand year upon ground which bear the sign-manual of early and late buddhist of jain and lastly of maratha who use the hill as a muster-ground of warrior and bored hole in the graven image for the tethering of he cattle and steed by some divine decree the imperial bandit keep they impious hand from the famous inscription which be the real glory of these cave and form the connecting-link between ourselves and that great king whose face be as the sun-kissed lotus whose army drink the water of three ocean shrus gautamiputra the satakarnus and so end we morning 's exploration one last visit to the silent keeper of these message from dead monarch -- and we pass down to the high road whence we look back once more upon trirashmus the casket of jewel without price and she twin sister gleam in the morning light like the triple prong of some giant trident set there by nature in honor of the great apostle of humanity xix fateh muhammad we have wander off the main thoroughfare where the tram hurtle past the iranus 's tea shop drown from time to time the chatter of khoda behram 's clientele and skirt a group of mahomedan who nightly sit in solemn conclave some on the ` otla ' other on charpoy or chair place well in the fairway of traffic we reach at length a sombre and narrow ` galus ' seemingly untenanted save by the shadow here a sheeted form lay prone on the roadside there a flicker lamp disclose through the half-open door a mother croon to she child while she master smoke the hubble-bubble with the clay bowl and ruminate over the event of the day -- the villainy of the landlord who contemplate the raising of the rent and the still greater rascality of the landlord 's ` bhaya ' who insist upon he own ` dasturus ' as well here a famished cat crouch over a pile of garbage hard by the sweeper 's ` galus ' there on the opposite side of the road a marwadus with the feature of mephistophele doze over he account book and a little further away a naked child be dip she toe in a pool of sullage water that have drip from the broken pipe athwart the house wall darkness reign on the upper floor at interval a faint glimmer might be discern behind the sodden ` chick ' which shroud the window and once the stillness be break by a voice hum a refrain from a indian drama : jahan jahan mukam rahe amne jhulakiram rahe safarse ghar ko to phire aman-chaman khuda rakhe which be interpret run : -- wheresoever thou mayst halt may god protect thee when thou hast return may god give thee he peace the singer be invisible but around the word of she song one could conjure up picture of the sturdy serang asleep in the foc ` sle of some westward-flying steamer or haply of the bearded trader afare through the pass of the north-west frontier the while he wife in the small upper room wait with prayer for he home-coming even as the lady of ithaca wait for the man of many wiles at length we reach a small doorway which open into a cavern black as erebus for a moment we pause undecided and then out of the darkness crawl a aged mahomedan bear a tiny cocoanut-oil lamp lift it above he head he point silently to a rickety staircase in the far corner up which we grope we way with the help of a rope pendent from a upper beam up and up we mount now round a sharp corner now down a narrow passage : the stair sway and shake the air be heavy with a mixture of frankincense and sullage until at last we crawl through a trap-door that open as by magic and find ourselves at we journey 's end -lrb- illustration : fateh muhammad -rrb- imagine a small attic some fifteen foot by ten under the very eave of the ` chal ' fill with the smoke of frankincense so pungent that the eye at once commence to water nor cease until we be once again in the open air in one corner be spread a coarse sheet with a couple of pillow against the wall upon which the silent mahomedan bid we by a sign recline in the opposite corner a ` panja ' a species of altar smother in jasmine wreath and surmount by a bunch of peacock 's feather and immediately in front of this a earthen brazier of live charcoal behind the brazier sit three person fateh muhammad a musalman youth with curiously large and dreamy eye and two old musalman beldam either of whom might have sit as a model for the witch of endor the three sit unmoved blinking into the live charcoal save at rare interval when the elder of the two woman cast a handful of fragrance upon the brazier and wrap we all in a fresh pall of smoke which billow round the room and lap the interstice of the rotten tile only the peacock 's eye in the corner never lose they lustre stare wickedly through the smoke-wreath like the head of argus then on a sudden the youth shiver fall forward with he face over the brazier and rise again to a sit posture with eye close and every muscle in he body taut as though stricken by a sudden paralysis the spirit have enter whisper my friend and even as he speak i see the youth 's throat work as if a unseen hand be knead the muscle and forth from he lip echo the word la illaha illallah illahus laho he be deep in a trance the curtain of he eye half-dropped look as one that be dead and the voice with which he speak be not the voice of fateh muhammad la illaha illallah illahus laho and as the word die away one that be present pass two green lime into he left hand and ask for a sign i be fain to journey to lahore start on Tuesday next will it be well he say and after a pause come the answer set not forth on Tuesday for the star be against thy journey but send thine agent on Thursday and go thyself if need be two day later as the message die away the trap-door in the floor be slowly tilted upward and through the opening crawl a obvious member of the dhobus class he slide forward almost to the foot of the dream youth and place as before two green lime in he hand speak say master my wife have write from we country bidding I to go unto she nor tarry by the road but there be work toward here and the purse be light be it that i should go la illaha illallah illahus laho aye go unto she lest evil haply befall thee for much be there that be hide from thine eye thus the seance go forward for twenty minute or more odd waif and stray of humanity crawl in through the trap-door obtain they message of good or ill and depart into the shadow as silently as they have come among they be several woman one of whom seek a cure for she sick child whimper over the symptom of he malady meningitis i expect muttered my friend the doctor but the answer come swift and sure bind thou the ` tawiz ' round he brow and carry he to the shrine of miran datar whence cometh thy help la illaha illallah illahi laho the end come suddenly after the last visitor have vanish through the floor there be dead silence for three minute while fateh muhammad wrestle with the spirit within he and then with chest heaving and hand convulsively grasp the heavy air he fall prone upon he face and lay still the two old woman move forward and commence make pass over he body murmur the while some charm and as they wave the seven-knotted handkerchief above he head he regain consciousness and sit slowly up breathe like one that have a evil dream and bearing upon he feature the sign of deathly fatigue by this time the attic be almost clear of smoke the gutter wick of the only oil-lamp be nearly burn through and fateh muhammad be fain to sleep wherefore we thank he for permit we this glance behind the curtain of he daily life then crawl through the trap slide down the reek staircase and gain the street one last glance as my eye reach the floor-level of the trap show I that the room be untenanted save by the prostrate form of the visionary above whom the eye of the peacock still glint with something of mockery in they blue depths as we pass homewards down the street we hear the woman in the upper chamber still sing she prayer but with a note of hope in its cadence : -- o dilruba tu gam na kho khuda haman baham kare janejahan bhulo nahi karim sada karam kare grieve not heart of my heart for god will order we meeting soul of the world forget not and may the peace of god be on we twain perchance she also like fateh muhammad 's guest have catch a message of good hap from out the darkness and so back to the light and the noise of the city 's greatest artery xx the tilak riot a reminiscence -lrb- _ write August _ 1908 -rrb- affair in the city may now be regard as have resume they normal course and the chance of further disorder seem for the present to have be obviate one of the most curious feature of the disturbance be the difference of feeling exhibit by the two class of mill-operative namely the ghati and the malwani of the whole mill-population one would have assume that the kunbi from the deccan where tilak be state to have so great a follow would have show a greater disposition to riot in consequence of he arrest and conviction than the man from ratnagirus and yet so far as i could judge the ghati be far less interested in the trial and be much less disposed to express they resentment than the latter class which comprise one or two extremely hot-headed and uncompromising individual the ghati of sewrus indeed at the very height of the riot inform a englishman with whom they be familiar that they would sooner die for he than do he any harm and they word carry home the conviction that they feel no personal sorrow at tilak 's well-deserved fate and that they would be ready in a emergency as they have often be in past history to stand staunchly by the side of any individual whom they know and who have be kind to they the attitude of the ratnagiri hand must in my opinion have be engender by continuous and careful tuition and this be particularly the case in the currey road and delisle road area where agent belong to they own native district have be suborn by the seditionary party to stir up trouble no less remarkable be the quaint juxtaposition during the height of the riot of seething disorder and the quiet prosecution of they daily avocation by the bulk of the people a officer of one of the regiment quarter on the city during the trial in the high court give expression to this fact in the follow word : -- warfare i understand but this sort of business beat I altogether at the top of the street there be a native ` tamasha ' with people singing and beating tom-tom half-way down the street there be stone-throwing and firing and at the bottom of the street there be people european and native shop he be strike as i be by the incongruity of the whole business at jacob 's circle there be a great display of military and magisterial strength tommy atkin have take up a strong position at the corner of clerk road sentry pace up and down by day and night machine gun gape upon the fountain erect to the memory of le grand jacob at interval a squadron of cavalry dash into the open halted for a space and then as suddenly disappear and they be follow by motor car and carriage contain commissioner deputy commissioner police subordinate special magistrate and miscellaneous european sightseer all the pomp and circumstance of law and order be represent there and there could scarcely have be a greater display of armed force more secret consultation more wild dash hither and thither more troubled parley if the entire city north of jacob 's circle have be in flame and yet behind it and around it the daily life of the people move forward in its accustomed channel the bhandarus 's liquor-shop at the corner have its full complement of patron and the bhandarus himself might be see pull out handful of thirst-producing parched grain for those of he customer who desire a relish with they liquor member of that degraded class which follow one of the immemorial vice of the east wandered round the marwari ' shop beg and clap they hand in the manner peculiar to they and across the diameter of the circle stray a group of barot -- those strange semi-gipsy look man from kathiawar who act as priest and magician to the bhangi population see the military and police they halt for a moment and give one time to have a word with they : -- whither go ye we ask and they reply that they be bind to the big bhangus settlement that lie not far from the circle one of they carry a bina a second a ordinary school-slate cover with crude cabalistic sign and a third a rude book something like a vanus 's chopda fill with marathi character which doubtless play a part in the fortune-telling and spirit-scaring that form the stock-in-trade of these wander hierophant hardly have they disappear than four sadhu heave in sight one of they who be smear with ash from head to foot the lobe of whose ear have be pierce and drag down till they nearly touch he shoulder and who wear a enormous rosary of rudraksha berry act as the spokesman of the party and state that they be on they way to nasik they have come from benare he say and have spend a week in the shady compound of the mahalaksmus temple where all the bairagi gosavi and fakir of the indian continent from time to time congregate do you walk to nasik or go by rail we ask by rail reply the silver-man but surely the true sadhu should walk take no heed of horse-vehicle or fire-carriage whereat the little fat ascetic with the gourd smile pleasantly and make some remark to the effect that all method of conveyance be permit to the truly devout so they pass down ripon road towards the heart of the city follow a couple of muhammadan kasai drive a small flock of sheep dye pink and blue in patch which they urge forward in approve native fashion by drive the finger into the base of the hindmost animal 's spine and after they wander a sye in a fade green silk robe and cap carry the inevitable peacock feather brush which play so large a part in exorcism and divination later in the day a hindu lady-doctor hurry past on she way home and four youth of the student-class who have leave they legal study in the fort to see what be toward in the northern portion of the island a municipal sweeper lurch across the open and proceed to spend twenty minute in brushing the grate of a drain leave the accumulate filth of the adjoining gutter to fester and pollute the surroundings and two elderly cooly-women each carry a phenomenal head-load of dung - cake become suddenly aware of the presence of troops and thereby strike with terror collide violently with one another and shoot the entire contents of they basket on to the road this cause some amusement to the passer-by particularly to a pathan who have just take a very complete bath under one of the tap of the memorial fountain but the trouble be soon mend by a small boy who bribe by the offer of one dung cake help the old lady to repack they burden and replace they on they head next come a swarthy gentleman from palanpur who say he be a hawker of glass sugar-bowl and produce one bowl without a top as proof of he profession he strike I as be uncommonly and perhaps designedly vacant in speech and appearance and seem to have no stock of glassware whatever i be still wonder whether that topless bowl be really he own or whether he may not have filch it from some convenient
