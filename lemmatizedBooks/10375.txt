publish in 1868 preface in this book i have seek to trace the course of we religious poetry from a early period of we literary history this could hardly be do without reference to some of the principal phase of the religious history of the nation to give anything like a full history of the religious feeling of a single county would require a large book and -- not to mention sermon -- would involve a thorough acquaintance with the hymn of the country -- a very wide subject which i have not consider of sufficient importance from a literary point of view to come within the scope of the volume but if its poetry be the cream of a people 's think some true indication of the history of its religious feeling must be find in its religious verse and i hope i have not altogether fail in set forth these indication my chief aim however will show itself to have be the mediate towards a intelligent and cordial sympathy betwixt my reader and the writer from whom i have quote in this i have some confidence of success heartily do i throw this my small pebble at the head of the great sabbath-breaker _ schism _ contents introduction chapter i sacred lyric of the thirteenth century chapter

implicit insight of the heart chapter xxiii the question fervor england 's antiphon introduction if the act of worship be the highest human condition it follow that the highest human art must find material in the mode of worship the first poetry of a nation will not be religious poetry : the nation must have a history at least before it can possess any material capable of be cast into the mould of religious utterance but the nation once possess of this material poetry be the first form religious utterance will assume the earliest form of literature be the ballad which be the germ of all subsequent form of poetry for it have in itself all they element : the _ lyric _ for it be first chant to some stringed instrument the _ epic _ for it tell a tale often of solemn and ancient report the _ dramatic _ for its actor be ever ready to start forward into life snatch the word from the mouth of the narrator and speak in they own person all these form have be use for the utterance of religious thought and feeling of the lyrical poem of england religion possess the most of the epic the best of the dramatic the oldest of each of these i shall have occasion to speak but as the title of the book imply -- for _ antiphon _ mean the responsive song of the parted choir -- i shall have chiefly to do with the lyric or song form for song be the speech of feeling even the prose of emotion always wander into the rhythmical hence as well as for other reason belong to its nature it be one chief mode in which man unite to praise god for in thus praise they hold communion with each other and the praise expand and grow the _ individual _ heart however must first have be uplift into praiseful song before the common ground and form of feeling in virtue of which man might thus meet could be supply but the vocal utterance or the bodily presence be not at all necessary for this communion when we read rejoicingly the true song-speech of one of we singing brethren we hold song-worship with he and with all who have thus at any time share in he feeling even if he have pass century ago into the high country of song my object be to erect as it be in this book a little auricle or spot of concentrated hearing where the heart of my reader may listen and join in the song of they country 's singing man and singing woman i will build it if i may like a chapel in the great church of england 's worship gather the sound of its never-ceasing choir heart after heart lift up itself in the music of speech heart after heart respond across the age hear we worship with they for we must not forget that although the individual song spring from the heart of the individual the song of a country be not merely cumulative : it be vital in its growth and therefore compose of historically dependent member no man could sing as he have sing have not other sing before he deep answereth unto deep face to face praise to praise to the sound of the trumpet the harp return its own vibrate response -- alike but how different the religious song of the country i say again be a growth rooted deep in all its story besides the fact that the lyric chiefly will rouse the devotional feeling there be another reason why i should principally use it : i wish to make my book valuable in its part as in itself the value of a thing depend in large measure upon its unity its wholeness in a work of these limit that form of verse alone can be available for its unity which be like the song of the bird -- a warble and then a stillness however valuable a extract may be -- and i shall not quite eschew such -- a entire lyric i have almost say _ however inferior _ if worthy of a place at all be of greater value especially if regard in relation to the form of set with which i hope to surround it there be a sense in which i may without presumption adopt the name of choragus or leader of the chorus in relation to these singer : i must take upon I to order who shall sing when he shall sing and which of he song he shall sing but i would rather assume the office of master of the hearing for my aim shall be to cause the song to be truly hear to set forth worthy point in form in matter and in relation to say with regard to the singer himself he time its mode its belief such thing as may help to set the song in its true light -- its relation namely to the source whence it spring which alone can secure its right reception by the heart of the hearer for my chief aim will be the heart see that although there be no divide of the one from the other the heart can do far more for the intellect than the intellect can do for the heart we must not now attempt to hear the singer of time so old that they language be unintelligible without labor for this there be not room even if otherwise it be desirable that such should divide the volume we must leave anglo-saxon behind we in early english i shall give a few valuable lyric but they shall not be so far remove from we present speech but that with a reasonable amount of assistance the nature and degree of which i shall set forth they shall not only present themselves to the reader 's understanding but commend themselves to he imagination and judgment chapter i sacred lyric of the thirteenth century in the midst of war and rumor of war the strife of king and baron and persistent effort to subdue neighbouring country the mere effervescence of the life of the nation let we think for a moment of that to which the poem i be about to present bear good witness -- the true life of the people grow quietly slowly unperceived -- the leaven hide in the meal for what be the true life of a nation that i answer in its mode of think its manners and habit which favor the growth within the individual of that kingdom of heaven for the sake only of which the kingdom of earth exist the true life of the people as distinguish from the nation be simply the growth in its individual of those eternal principle of truth in proportion to whose power in they they take rank in the kingdom of heaven the only kingdom that can endure all other be but as the mimicry of child play at government little as they then know of the relation of the wonderful story on which they faith be build to everything human the same truth be at work then which be now -- poor as the recognition of these relation yet be -- slowly set man free in the hardest winter the root be still alive in the frozen ground in the silence of the monastery unnatural as that life be germinate much of this deeper life as we must not judge of the life of the nation by its king and mighty man so we must not judge of the life in the church by those who be call rabbi the very notion of the kingdom of heaven imply a secret growth secret from no affectation of mystery but because its goings-on be in the depths of the human nature where it hold communion with the divine in the church as in society we often find that that which show itself uppermost be but the froth a sign it may be of life beneath but in itself worthless when the man arise with a servant 's heart and a ruler 's brain then be the summer of the church 's content but whether the man who write the follow song move in some shine orbit of rank or only knelt in some dim chapel and walk in some pale cloister we can not tell for they have leave no name behind they my reader will observe that there be little of theory and much of love in these lyric the recognition of a living master be far more than any notion about he in the worship of he a thousand truth be work unknown and yet active which embody in theory and dissociate from the living mind that be in christ will as certainly breed worm as any omer of hoard manna hold the skirt of he garment in one hand we shall in the other hold the key to all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge i think almost all the earliest religious poetry be about he and he mother they longing after he humanity make they idolize he mother if we forget that only through he humanity can we approach he divinity we shall soon forget likewise that he mother be bless among woman i take the poem from one of the percy society publication edit by mr wright from a manuscript in the british museum he adjudge they to the reign of edward i perhaps we may find in they a sign or two that in cultivate we intellect we have in some measure neglect we heart but first as to the mode in which i present they to my reader : i have follow these rule : -- 1 wherever a word differ from the modern word only in spelling i have for the sake of readier comprehension substitute the modern form with the follow exception : -- where the spelling indicate a different pronunciation necessary for the rhyme or the measure i retain such part of the older form mark with a acute accent any vowel now silent which must be sound 2 where the word use be antique in root i give the modern synonym in the margin antique phrase i explain in foot-note it must be bear in mind that we modern pronunciation can hardly fail in other case as well to injure the melody of the verse the modern reader will often find it difficult to get a rhythm out of some of they this may arise from any of several cause in the first place many final _ e _ 's be then sound which be now silent and it be not easy to tell which of they to sound again some word be pronounce as dissyllable which we treat as monosyllable and other as monosyllable which we treat as dissyllable i suspect besides that some of the old writer be content to allow a prolonged syllable to stand for two short one a mode not without great beauty when sparingly and judiciously employ short supernumerary syllable be likewise allow considerable freedom to come and go a good deal must however be put down to the carelessness and presumption of the transcriber who may very well have be incapable of detect they own blunder one of these ancient mechanic of literature cause chaucer endless annoyance with he corruption as a humorous little poem the last in he work sufficiently indicate from the same source no doubt spring as well most of the variation of text in the manuscript the first of the poem be chiefly a conversation between the lord on the cross and he mother standing at its foot a few prefatory remark in explanation of some of its allusion will help my reader to enjoy it it be at one time a common belief and the notion have not yet i think altogether vanish that the die be hold back from repose by the love that be unwilling to yield they up hence in the third stanza the lord pray he mother to let he die in the fifth he reason against she overwhelming sorrow on the ground of the deliverance he suffering will bring to the human race but she can only feel she own misery to understand the seventh and eighth it be necessary to know that among other strange thing accept by the early church it be believe that the mother of jesus have no suffering at he birth this of course render she incapable of perfect sympathy with other mother it be a lovely invention then that he should thus commend mother to he mother tell she to judge of the pain of motherhood by those which she now endure still he fail to turn aside she thought she be think still only of she own and she son 's suffering while he continue bent on make she think of other until at last forth come she prayer for all woman this seem to I a tenderness grand as exquisite the outburst of the chorus of the faithful in the last stanza but one -- when he rise then fall she sorrow be as fine as anything i know in the

simplicity the tenderness the devotion of these lyric be to I wonderful observe they realism as for instance in the word : the stone beoth al wete a realism as far remove from the coarseness of a ruben as from the irreverence of too many religious teacher who will repeat and repeat again the most sacred word for the merest logical end until the tympanum of the moral ear hear without hear the sound that ought to be feel as well as hold holiest they bear strongly too upon the outcome of feeling in action although doubtless there be the same tendency then as there be now to regard the observance of church-ordinance as the service of christ instead of as a means of gather strength wherewith to serve he by be in the world as he be in the world from a poem of forty-eight stanza i choose five partly in order to manifest that although there be in it a occasional appearance of what we should consider sentimentality ally in nature to that worship of the virgin which be more a sort of french gallantry than a feeling of reverence the sense of duty to the master keep pace with the profession of devotedness to he there be so little continuity of think in it that the stanza might almost be arrange anyhow jesu thy love be all my thought of other thing ne reck i nought _ reckon _ i yearn to have thy will y-work for thou I hast well dear y-bought jesu well may mine hearté see that mild and meek he must be all unthew and lustés flee _ bad habit _ that feelen will the bliss of thee _ feel _ for sinful folk sweet jesus thou lightest from the high house poor and low thou wert

and in that dreadful out-wending _ go forth of the spirit _ send my soul good weryyng _ guard _ that i ne dread none evil thing i shall next present a short lyric display more of art than this last give it now in the old form and afterwards in a new one that my reader may see both how it look in its original dress and what it mean wynter wakeneth al my care nou this leve waxeth bare ofte y sike

the grain now it yelloweth all again : jesus give we help amain and shield we from hell for when or whither i go i can not tell there be no doubt many religious poem in a certain amount of circulation of a different cast from these some a metrical recount of portion of the bible history -- a kind unsuited to we end other a setting forth of the doctrine and duty then believe and teach of the former class be one of the oldest anglo-saxon poem we have that of caedmon and there be many specimen to be find in the fourteenth and fifteenth century they could however have be of little service to the people so few of whom could read or could have procure manuscript if they have be able to use they a long and elaborate composition of the latter class be write in the reign of edward ii by william de shoreham vicar of chart-sutton in kent he probably teach he own verse to the people at he catechising the intention be no doubt by the aid of measure and rhyme to facilitate the remembrance of the fact and doctrine it consist of a long poem on the seven sacrament of a shorter associate the canonical hour with the principal event of the close of we lord 's life of a exposition of the ten commandment follow by a kind of treatise on the seven cardinal sin : the fifth part describe the different joy of the virgin the sixth in praise of the virgin be perhaps the most poetic the last be less easy to characterize the poem be write in the kentish dialect and be difficult i shall now turn into modern verse a part of the canonical hour give its represent foundation of the various act of worship in the romish church throughout the day from early in the morning to the last service at night after every fact concern we lord follow a apostrophe to he mother which i omit be compel to choose father 's wisdom lift high lord of we aright -- god and man take be at matin-time by night the disciple that be he anon they he forsake sell to jew and betray to torture he take at the prime jesus be lead in presence of pilate where witness false and fall laugh at he for hate in the neck they he smite bind he hand of might spit upon that sweet face that heaven and earth do light crucify he crucify they cry at nine o'clock a purple cloth they put on he -- to stare at he and mock they upon he sweet head stick a thorny crown to calvary he cross he bear pitiful from the town jesus be nail on the cross at the noon-tide strong thief they hang up one on either side in he pain he strong thirst quench they with gall so that god 's holy lamb from sin wash we all at the none jesus christ feel the hard death he to he father elous cry gan up yield he breath a soldier with a sharp spear pierce he right side the earth shake the sun grow dim the moment that he die he be take off the cross at even-song 's hour the strength leave and hide in god of we savior such death he undergo of life the medicine alas he be lay adown -- the crown of bliss in pine at compline it be bear away to the bury that noble corpse of jesus christ hope of life 's come anointed richly it be fulfil he holy book : i pray lord thy passion in my mind lock childlike simplicity realism and tenderness will be evident in this as in precede poem especially in the choice of adjective but indeed the combination of certain word have become conventional as the hard tree the nail great and strong and such like i know i have spoil the poem in half-translating it thus but i have render it intelligible to all my reader have not wander from the original and have retain a degree of antiqueness both in the tone and the expression chapter ii the miracle play and other poem of the fourteenth century the oldest form of regular dramatic representation in england be the miracle play improperly call mystery after the french to these play the people of england in the fourteenth and fifteenth century owe a very large portion of what religious knowledge they possess for the prayer be in a unknown tongue the sermon be very few and printing be uninvented the play themselves introduce into the country by the norman be in the foolish endeavor to make norman of anglo-saxon represent in norman french -lrb- 14 -rrb- until the year 1338 when permission be obtain from the pope to represent they in english the word _ miracle _ in they case mean anything record in scripture the miracle play have for they subject the chief incident of old and new testament history not merely however of this history as accept by the reform church but of that contain in the apocryphal gospel as well a entire series of these _ miracle _ consist of short dramatic representation of many single passage of the sacred story the whole would occupy about three day it begin with the creation and end with the judgment that for which the city of coventry be famous consist of forty-two subject with a long prologue compose by ecclesiastic the play would seem to have be first represent by they only although afterwards it be not always consider right for the clergy to be concern with they the hypocritical franciscan friar in pier ploughman 's creed a poem of the close of the same century claim as a virtue for he order -- at market and miracle we meddleth we never they would seem likewise to have be first represent in church and chapel sometimes in churchyard later when the actor chiefly belong to city-guild they be generally represent in the street and square it must be bear in mind by any who would understand the influence of these play upon the people that much in they appear to we grotesque childish absurd and even irreverent have no such appearance in the eye of the spectator a certain amount of the impression of absurdity be simply the consequence of antiquity and even that which be rightly regard as absurd in the present age will not at least have produce the discomposing effect of absurdity upon the less developed beholder of that age just as the quaint picture with which they church be decorate may make we smile but be by they regard with awe and reverence from they infancy it must be confess that there be in they even occasional coarseness but that the devil for instance should always be represent as a baffled fool and make to play the buffoon sometimes after a disgusting fashion be to they only the treatment he deserve : it be they notion of poetic justice while most of they be too childish to be shock at the discord thus introduce and many we may well hope too childlike to lose they reverence for the holy because of the proximity of the ridiculous there seem to I considerably more of poetic worth scatter through these play than be generally recognize and i be glad to be able to do a little to set forth the fact i can not doubt that my reader will be interested in such fragment as the scope and design of my book will allow I to offer have there be no such passage i might have regard the play as but remotely connect with my purpose and mention they merely as a dramatic form of religious versification i quote from the _ coventry miracle _ better know than either of the other two set in existence the chester play and those of widkirk abbey the manuscript from which they have be edit by mr halliwell one of those student of we early literature to whom we be endlessly indebted for put valuable thing within we reach be by no means so old as the play themselves it bear date 1468 a hundred and thirty year after they appear in they english dress they language be considerably modernize a process constantly go on where transcription be the means of transmission -- not to mention that the actor would of course make many change to the speech of they own time i shall modernize it a little further but only as far as change of spelling will go the first of the course be _ the creation _ god and angel and lucifer appear that god should here utter i can not say announce the doctrine of the trinity may be defend on the ground that he do so in a soliloquy but when we find afterwards that the same doctrine be one of the subject upon which the boy jesus converse with the doctor in the temple we can not help remark the strange anachronism two remarkable line in the say soliloquy be these : and all that ever shall have be it be close in my mind the next scene be the _ fall of man _ which be full of poetic feeling and expression both i must content myself with a few passage here be part of eve 's lamentation when she be conscious of the death that have lay hold upon she alas that ever that speech be speak that the false angel say unto I alas we maker 's bidding be break for i have touch he own dear tree we fleshly eye be all unlokyn _ unlock _ naked for sin ourself we see that sorry apple that we have sokyn _ suck _ to death have bring my spouse and I when the voice of god be hear say adam that with my hand i make where art thou now what hast thou work adam reply in two line contain the whole truth of man 's spiritual condition ever since : ah lord for sin we flower do fade : i hear thy voice but i see thee nought the vision have vanish but the voice remain for they that hear shall live and to the pure in heart one day the vision shall be restore for they shall see god there be something wonderfully touch in the quaint simplicity of the follow word of god to the woman : unwise woman say I why that thou hast do this foul folly and i make thee a great lady in paradise for to play as they leave the gate the angel with the flaming sword end he speech thus : this bliss i spere from you right fast _ bar _ herein come ye no more till a child of a maid be bear and upon the rood rent and tear to save all that ye have forlorn _ lose _ you wealth for to restore eve lament bitterly and at length offer she throat to she husband pray he to strangle she : now stumble we on stalk and stone my wit away from I be go writhe on to my neck-bone with hardness of thine hand adam reply -- not over politely -- wife thy wit be not worth a rush and go on to make what excuse for themselves he can in a very simple and touching manner : we hap be hard we wit be nesche _ soft weak _ still in use in to paradise when we be bring : -lrb- some province my weep shall be long fresh short liking shall be long buy _ pleasure _ the scene end with these word from eve : alas that ever we work this sin we bodily sustenance for to win ye must delve and i shall spin in care to lead we life _ cain and abel _ follow then _ noah 's flood _ in which god say they shall not dread the flood 's flow then _ abraham 's sacrifice _ then _ mose and the two table _ then _ the prophet _ each of whom prophesy of the come savior after which we find ourselves in the apocryphal gospel in the midst of much nonsense about anna and joachim the parent of mary about joseph and mary and the birth of jesus till we arrive at _ the shepherd _ and _ the magus the purification the slaughter of the innocent the disputing in the temple the baptism the temptation _ and _ the woman take in adultery _ at which point i pause for the sake of the remarkable tradition embody in the scene -- that each of the woman 's accuser think jesus be write he individual sin on the ground while he be write the second time the pharisee the accuser and the scribe who have chiefly sustain the dialogue hitherto separate each go into a different part of the temple and soliloquize thus : _ pharisee _ alas alas i be ashamed i be afear that i shall die all my sin even properly name yon prophet do write before mine eye if that my fellow that do espy they will tell it both far and wide my sinful living if they outcry i wot not where my head to hide _ accuser _ alas for sorrow mine heart doth bleed all my sin yon man do write if that my fellow to they take heed i can not I from death acquite i would i be hide somewhere out of sight that man should I nowhere see nor know if i be take i be aflyght _ afraid _ in mekyl shame i shall be throwe _ much _ _ scribe _ alas the time that this betyd _ happen _ right bitter care doth I embrace all my sin be now unhid yon man before I they all doth trace if i be once out of this place to suffer death great and vengeance able -lrb- 15 -rrb- i will never come before he face though i should die in a stable upon this follow _ the raising of lazarus _ next _ the council of the jew _ to which the devil appear as a prologue dress in the extreme of the fashion of the day which he set forth minutely enough in he speech also _ the entry into jerusalem the last supper the betrayal king herod the trial of christ pilate 's wife 's dream _ come next to the subject of the last of which the curious but generally accept origin be give that it be inspire by satan anxious that jesus should not be slay because he dread the mischief he would work when he enter hade or hell for there be no distinction between they either here or in the apocryphal gospel whence the _ descent into hell _ be take then follow _ the crucifixion _ and _ the descent into hell _ -- often call the _ harrowing of hell _ -- that be the _ make war upon _ or _ despoiling of hell _ -lrb- 16 -rrb- for which the authority be a passage in the gospel of nicodemus full of a certain florid eastern grandeur i need hardly remind my reader that the apostle ' creed as it now stand contain the same legend in the form of a article of faith the allusion to it be frequent in the early literature of christendom the soul of christ come to the gate of hell and say : undo you gate of sorwatorie _ place of sorrow _ on man 's soul i have memorie there cometh now the king of glory these gate for to breke ye devil that be here within hell gate ye shall unpin i shall deliver man 's kin -- from woe i will they wreke _ avenge _ \* \* \* \* \* against I it be but

the burial the resurrection the three marie christ appear to mary the pilgrim of emmaus the ascension the descent of the holy ghost the assumption of the virgin _ and _ doomsday _ close the series i have quote enough to show that these play must in the condition of the people to whom they be present have have much to do with they religious education this fourteenth century be a wonderful time of outbursting life although we can not claim the _ miracle _ as entirely english product be in all probability translation from the norman-french yet the fact that they be thus translate be one remarkable amongst many in this dawn of the victory of england over she conqueror from this time english prosper and french decayed they own language be now so far authorize as the medium of religious instruction to the people while a similar change have pass upon process at law and most significant of all the greatest poet of the time and one of the three greatest poet as yet of all english time write although a courtier in the language of the people before select some of chaucer 's religious verse however i must speak of two or three poem by other writer the first of these be _ the vision of william concern pier plowman _ -- a poem of great influence in the same direction as the writings of wycliffe it be a vision and a allegory wherein the vice of the time especially those of the clergy be unsparingly deal with towards the close it lose itself in a metaphysical allegory concern dowel dobet and dobest -lrb- 17 -rrb- i do not find much poetry in it there be more to my mind in another poem write some thirty or forty year later the author of which be unknown perhaps because he be a imitator of william langland the author of the _ vision _ it be call _ pierce the plough-man 's crede _ both be write after the fashion of the anglo-saxon poetry and not after the fashion of the anglo-norman of which distinction a little more presently its object be to contrast the life and character of the four order of friar with those of a simple christian there be considerable humor in the work plan of the poem a certain poor man say he have succeed in learn he a b c he paternoster and he ave mary but he can not do what he will learn he creed he set out therefore to find some one whose life accord with he profession may give he a hope that he will teach he he creed aright he apply to the friar one after another every order abuse the other nor this only but for money offer either to teach he he creed or to absolve he for ignorance of the same he find no helper until he fall in with pierce the ploughman of whose poverty he give a most touching description i shall however only quote some line of _ the believe _ as teach by the ploughman and this principally to show the nature of the versification : leve thou on we lord god that all the world wroughté _ believe _ holy heaven upon high wholly he form and be almighty himself over all he workés and work as he will be the world and the heaven and on gentle jesus christ engender of himselven he own only son lord over all y-knowen \* \* \* \* \* with thorn y-crowned crucify and on the cross diéd and sythen he bless body be in a stone bury _ after that _ and descend adown to the dark hellé and fetch out we forefather and they full fain weren _ glad _ the third day readily himself rise from death and on a stone there he stand he stey up to heaven _ where : ascend _ here there be no rhyme there be measure -- a dance-movement in the verse and likewise in most of the line what be essential to anglo-saxon verse -- three or more word begin with the same sound this be somewhat of the nature of rhyme and be all we anglo-saxon forefather have of the kind they norman conqueror bring in rhyme regularity of measure and division into stanza with many refinement of versification now regard with some justice and a little more injustice as peurility strange as it may seem the peculiar rhythmic movement of the anglo-saxon verse be even yet the most popular of all measure its representative be now that kind of verse which be measure not by the number of syllable but by the number of _ accent _ syllable the bulk of the nation be yet anglo-saxon in its blind poetic taste before take my leave of this mode i would give one fine specimen from another poem lately print for the first time in full from bishop percy 's manuscript it may chronologically belong to the beginning of the next century : its proper place in my volume be here it be call _ death and liffe _ like langland 's poem it be a vision but short as it be in comparison there be far more poetry in it than in _ pier plowman _ life be thus describe : she be brighter of she blee -lrb- 18 -rrb- than be the bright sun she rudd -lrb- 19 -rrb- redder than the rose that on the rise -lrb- 20 -rrb- hangeth meekly smile with she mouth and merry in she look ever laugh for love as she like would everything burst into life and blossom at she presence and the grass that be gray green belive _ forthwith _ but the finest passage be part of life 's answer to death who have be triumph over she : how didst thou joust at jerusalem with jesu my lord where thou deemedst he death in one day 's time _ judgedst _ there wast thou shame and shent and strip for aye _ rebuke _ when thou see the king come with the cross on he shoulder on the top of calvary thou camest he against like a traitor untrue treason thou think thou lay upon my liege lord loathful hand sithen beat he on he body and buffet he rightly _ then _ till the railing red blood run from he side _ pour down _ sith rent he on the rood with full red wound : _ then _ to all the woe that he waste i wot not few then deemedst -lrb- he -rrb- to have be dead and dress for ever but death how didst thou then with all thy derffe word _ fierce _ when thou prick at he pap with the point of a spear and touch the tabernacle of he true heart where my bower be bigg to abide for ever _ build _ when the glory of he godhead glint in thy face then be thou fear of this fare in thy false heart _ affair _ then thou hie into hell-hole to hide thee belive _ at once _ thy falchion fly out of thy fist so fast thou thee hie thou durst not blush once back for better or worse _ look _ but draw thee down full in that deep hell and bid they bar bigly belzebub he gate _ greatly strongly _ then thou tell they tiding that teen they sore _ grieve _ how that king come to kithen he strength _ show _ and how she -lrb- 21 -rrb- have beat thee on thy bent -lrb- 22 -rrb- and thy brand take with everlasting life that long he till _ belong to he _ when life have end she speech to death she turn to she own follower and say : -- therefore be not abashed my barne so dear _ child _ of she falchion so fierce nor of she fell word she have no might nay no means no more you to grieve nor on you comely corse to clap once she hand i shall look you full lively and latch full well _ search for : and keere ye further of this kithe -lrb- 23 -rrb- above -lrb- lay hold of _ the clear sky i now turn from those poem of national scope and wide social interest bear they share doubtless in the growth of the great change that show themselves at length more than a century after and from the poem i have just quote of a yet wider human interest to one of another tone spring from the grief that attend love and the aspiration bear of the grief it be nevertheless wide in its scope as the conflict between death and life although deal with the individual and not with the race the former poem name of pierce ploughman be the cry of john the baptist in the english wilderness this be the longing of hannah at home have leave she little son in the temple the latter _ seem _ a poorer matter but it be a easier thing to utter grand word of just condemnation than in the silence of the chamber or with the well-known household-life around force upon the consciousness only the law of thing see to regard with steadfastness the blank leave by a beloved form and believe in the unseen the marvellous the eternal in the midst of the light of common day with all the persistently common thing press upon the despairing heart to hold fast after what fashion may be possible the vanish song that have change its key be indeed a victory over the flesh however childish the form in which the faith may embody itself however weak the logic with which it may defend its intrenchment the poem which have lead I to make these remark be in many respects noteworthy it be very different in style and language from any i have yet give there be little communication to blend the different mode of speech prevail in different part of the country it belong -lrb- 24 -rrb- accord to student of english to the midland dialect of the fourteenth century the author be beyond conjecture it be not merely the antiquity of the language that cause its difficulty but the accumulate weight of artistically fantastic and puzzling requirement which the writer have lay upon himself in its composition the nature of these i shall be enable to show by print the first twelve line almost as they stand in the manuscript perle plesaunte to prynce paye to clanly clo in golde so clere oute of oryent i hardyly saye ne proued i neuer she precio pere so rounde so reken in vche araye so smal so smothe she syde be quere-so-euer i

will be observe that the norman mode -- that of rhyme -- be employ and that there be a far more careful measure in the line that be find in the poem last quote but the rhyming be carry to such a excess as to involve the necessity of constant invention of phrase to meet its requirement -- a fertile source of obscurity the most difficult form of stanza in respect of rhyme now in use be the spenserian in which consist of nine line four word rhyme together three word and two word but the stanza in the poem before we consist of twelve line six of which two of which four of which rhyme together this we should count hard enough but it do not nearly exhaust the tyranny of the problem the author have undertake i have already say that one of the essential of the poetic form in anglo-saxon be the commencement of three or more word in the line with the same sound : this peculiarity he have exaggerate : every line have as many word as possible commence with the same sound in the first line for instance -- and it must be remember that the author 's line be much shorter than the anglo-saxon line -- there be four word begin with _ p _ in the second three begin with _ cl _ and so on this of course necessitate much not merely of circumlocution but of contrivance involve endless obscurity he have go on to exaggerate the peculiarity of norman verse as well but i think it better not to run the risk of weary my reader by point out more of he oddity i will now betake myself to what be far more interesting as well as valuable the poem set forth the grief and consolation of a father who have lose he daughter it be call _ the pearl _ here be a literal rendering line for line into modern english word not modern english speech of the stanza which i have already give in its original form : pearl pleasant to prince 's pleasure most cleanly close in gold so clear out of the orient i boldly say i never prove she precious equal so round so beautiful in every point so small so smooth she side be wheresoever i judge gemme gay i set she singly in singleness alas i lose she in a arbor through the grass to the ground it from I go i pine sorely wound by dangerous love of that especial pearl without spot the father call himself a jeweller the pearl be he daughter he have lose the pearl in the grass it have go to the ground and he can not find it that be he daughter be dead and bury perhaps the most touching line be one in which he say to the grave : o moul thou marrez a myry mele -lrb- o mould thou marrest a merry talk -rrb- the poet who be surely the father himself can not always keep up the allegory he heart burn hole in it constantly at one time he say _ she _ at another _ it _ and between the girl and the pearl the poem be bewildered but the allegory help he out with what he mean notwithstanding for although the highest aim of poetry be to say the deepest thing in the simplest manner humanity must turn from mode to mode and try a thousand ere it find the best the individual in he new endeavor to make the word cousin to the deed must take up the form he father have leave he and add to they if he may new form of he own in both the great revival of literature the very material of poetry be allegory the father fall asleep on he child 's grave and have a dream or rather a vision of a country where everything -- after the childish imagination which invent difference instead of discover harmony -- be super-naturally beautiful : rich rock with a gleaming glory crystal cliff wood with blue trunk and leaf of burnish silver gravel of precious orient pearl form the landscape in which be delicious fruit and bird of flame color and sweet song : its loveliness no man with a tongue be worthy to describe he come to the bank of a river : swing sweet the water do sweep with a whisper speech flow adown -lrb- wyth a rownande rourde raykande aryght -rrb- and the stone at the bottom be shine like star it be a noteworthy specimen of the mode in which the imagination work when invention be dissociate from observation and faith but the sort of way in which some would improve the world now if they might be not so very far in advance of this would-be glorification of nature the barest heath and sky have loveliness infinitely beyond the most gorgeous of such phantasmagoric idealization of she beauty and the most wretched condition of humanity struggle for existence contain element of worth and future development inappreciable by the philanthropy that would elevate they by cultivate they self-love at the foot of a crystal cliff on the opposite side of the river which he can not cross he see a maiden sit clothed and crown with pearl and wear one pearl of surpass wonder and spotlessness upon she breast i now make the spelling and form of the word as modern as i may alter the text no further o pearl quoth i in perlés pight _ pitch dress _ art thou my pearl that i have plain _ mourn _ regret by myn one on night _ by myself _

have be speak and she tell he to walk along the bank until he come to a hill in record what he see from the hill he follow the description of the new jerusalem give in the book of the revelation he see the lamb and all he company and with they again he lose pearl but it be not he prince 's pleasure that he should cross the stream for when he eye and ear be so fill with delight that he could no

cry of bereavement mingle with the prayer for hope : we hear and lo it be the cry and the prayer of a man like ourselves from the word of the greatest man of he age let I now gather two rich blossom of utterance present a embodiment of religious duty and aspiration after a very practical fashion i refer to two short lyric little note although full of wisdom and truth they must be accept as the conclusion of as large a knowledge of life in diversified mode as ever fall to the lot of man good counsel of chaucer fly from the press and dwell with soothfastness _ truthfulness _ suffice -lrb- 29 -rrb- unto thy good though it be small for hoard have hate and climb tickleness -lrb- 30 -rrb- praise have envy and weal be blent over all -lrb- 31 -rrb- savor -lrb- 32 -rrb- no more than thee behové shall rede well thyself that other folk shall rede _ counsel _ and truth thee shall deliver -- it be no drede _ there be no doubt _ paine thee not each crooked to redress _ every crooked thing _ in trust of she that turneth as a ball : fortune great rest standeth in little busi-ness beware also to spurn against a nail _ nail -- to kick against strive not as doth a crocké with a wall -lrb- the prick _ demé thyself that demest other ' deed _ judge _ and truth thee shall deliver -- it be no drede that thee be send receive in buxomness : _ submission _ the wrestling of this world asketh a fall _ tempt destruction _ here be no home here be but wilderness : forth pilgrim forth -- beast out of thy stall look up on high and thanké god of -lrb- 33 -rrb- all waivé thy lust and let thy ghost -lrb- 34 -rrb- thee lead and truth thee shall deliver -- it be no drede this need no comment even the remark that every line be worth meditation may well appear superfluous one little fact only with regard to the rhyme common to this and the next poem and usual enough in norman verse may be point out namely that every line in the stanza end with the same rhyme-sound as the corresponding line in each of the other stanza a reference to either of the poem will at once show what i mean the second be superior inasmuch as it carry one think through the three stanza it be entitle _ a balade make by chaucer teaching what be gentilnesse or whom be worthy to be call gentill _ the first stock-father of gentleness -- _ ancestor of the race what man desireth gentle for to be -lrb- of the gentle _ must follow he trace and all he wittés dress _ track footstep : virtue to love and vice for to flee -lrb- apply _ for unto virtue longeth dignity _ belongeth _ and not the reverse falsely dare i deem -lrb- 35 -rrb- all wear he mitre crown or diadem _ although he wear _ the first stock be full of righteousness _ the progenitor _ true of he word sober piteous and free clean of he ghost and love busi-ness _ pure in he spirit _ against the vice of sloth in honesty and but he heir love virtue as do he _ except _ he be not gentle though he rich seem all wear he mitre crown or diadem vicesse may well be heir to old richesse _ vice : riches _ but there may no man as man may well see bequeath he heir he virtue 's nobleness that be appropry unto no degree _ rank _ but to the first father in majesty that maketh he heirés they that he queme _ please he _ all wear he mitre crown or diadem i can come to no other conclusion than that by _ the first stock-father _ chaucer mean we lord jesus chapter iii the fifteenth century after the birth of a chaucer a shakspere or a milton it be long before the genial force of a nation can again culminate in such a triumph : time be require for the growth of the condition between the birth of chaucer and the birth of shakspere he sole equal a period of more than two century have to elapse it be but small compensation for this that the more original that be simple natural and true to he own nature a man be the more certain be he to have a crowd of imitator i do not say that such be of no use in the world they do not indeed advance art but they widen the sphere of its operation for many will talk with the man who know nothing of the master too often intend but they own glory they point the way to the source of it and be straightway themselves forget very little of the poetry of the fifteenth century be worthy of a different fate from that which have befall it possibly the war of the rose may in some measure account for the barrenness of the time but i do not think they will explain it in the midst of the commotion of the seventeenth century we find milton the only english poet of whom we be yet sure as worthy of be name with chaucer and shakspere it be in quality however and not in quantity that the period be deficient it have a good many writer of poetry some of they prolific john lydgate the monk of bury a great imitator of chaucer be the principal of these and write a enormous quantity of verse we shall find for we use enough as it be to keep we alive in pass through this desert to the paradise of the sixteenth century -- a land indeed flow with milk and honey for even in the desert of the fifteenth be spot luxuriant with the rich grass of language although they greet the eye with few flower of individual thought or graphic speech rather than give portion of several of lydgate 's poem i will give one entire -- the best i know it be entitle _ thonke god of alle _ -lrb- 36 -rrb- thank god for all by a way wander as i go well sore i sorrowed for sigh sad of hard hap that i have hent mourning I make almost mad -lrb- 37 -rrb- till a letter all one I lad -lrb- 38 -rrb- that well be write on a wall a blissful word that on i rad -lrb- 39 -rrb- that alway say ` thank god for -lrb- 40 -rrb- all ' and yet i read furthermore -lrb- 41 -rrb- -- full good intent i take there till -lrb- 42 -rrb- : christ may well you state restore nought be to strive against he will _ it be useless _ he may we spare and also spill : think right well we be he thrall _ slave _ what sorrow we suffer loud or still alway thank god for all though thou be both blind and lame or any sickness be on thee set thou think right well it be no shame -- _ think thou _ the grace of god it have thee gret -lrb- 43 -rrb- in sorrow or care though ye be knit _ snare _ and worldés weal be from thee fall _ fall _ i can not say thou mayst do bet _ better _ but alway thank god for all though thou wield this world 's good and royally lead thy life in rest well shape of bone and blood none the like by east nor west think god thee send as he lest _ as it please he _ riches turneth as a ball in all manner it be the best _ in every condition _ alway to thank god for all if thy good beginneth to pass and thou wax a poor man take good comfort and bear good face and think on he that all good wan _ do win _ christ himself forsooth begin -- he may renew both bower and hall : no better counsel i ne kan _ be capable of _ but alway thank god for all think on job that be so rich he wax poor from day to day he beastés die in each ditch he cattle vanish all away he be put in poor array neither in purple nor in pall but in simple weed as clerke say _ clothes : learn man _ and alway he thank god for all for christés love so do we -lrb- 44 -rrb- he may both give and take in what mischief that we in be _ whatever trouble we he be mighty enough we sorrow to slake -lrb- be in _ full good amends he will we make and we to he cry or call : _ if _ what grief or woe that do thee thrall -lrb- 45 -rrb- yet alway thank god for all though thou be in prison cast or any distress man do thee bede _ offer _ for christés love yet be steadfast and ever have mind on thy creed think he faileth we never at need the dearworth duke that deem we shall -lrb- 46 -rrb- when thou art sorry thereof take heed -lrb- 47 -rrb- and alway thank god for all though thy friende from thee fail and death by rene hend -lrb- 48 -rrb- they life why shouldest thou then weep or wail it be nought against god to strive : _ it be useless _ himself make both man and wife -- to he bliss he bring we all : _ may he bring _ however thou thole or thrive _ suffer _ alway thank god for all what diverse sonde -lrb- 49 -rrb- that god thee send here or in any other place take it with good intent the sooner god will send he grace though thy body be bring full base _ low _ let not thy heart adown fall but think that god be where he be and alway thank god for all though thy neighbor have world at will and thou far ` st not so well as he be not so mad to think he ill _ wish _ -lrb- -rrb- for he wealth envious to be : the king of heaven himself can see who take he sonde -lrb- 50 -rrb- great or small thus each man in he degree i rede thanké god for all _ counsel _ for cristés love be not so wild but rule thee by reason within and without and take in good heart and mind the sonde that god send all about _ the gospel _ -lrb- -rrb- then dare i say withouten doubt that in heaven be make thy stall _ place seat room _ rich and poor that low will lowte _ bow _ alway thank god for all i can not say there be much poetry in this but there be much truth and wisdom there be the finest poetry however too in the line -- i give it now letter for letter : -- but think that god y ther he be there be poetry too in the line if i interpret it rightly as intend the gospel -- the sonde that god send al abowte i shall now make a few extract from poem of the same century whose author be unknown -lrb- 51 -rrb- a good many such be extant with regard to the similarity of those i choose i would remark that not only will the poem of the same period necessarily resemble each other but where the preservation of any have depend upon the choice and transcription of one person these will in all probability resemble each other yet more here be a few verse from a hymn head _ the sweetness of jesus _ : -- if i for kindness should love my kin _ for natural reason then I thinketh in my thought -lrb- kind be nature _ by kindly skill i should begin _ by natural judgment _ at he that have I make of nought he likeness he set my soul within and all this world for I have work as father he fondid my love to win _ set about _ for to heaven he have I bring we brother and sister he be by skill _ reason _ for he so say and lerid we that lore _ teach _ that whoso work he father 's will brethren and sister to he they wear _ be _ my kind also he take ther-tille _ my nature also he take full truly trust i he therefore -lrb- for that purpose _ that he will never let I spill _ perish _ but with he mercy salve my sore with lovely lore he work to fill _ fulfil _ well ought i wretch if i be kind -- _ natural _ night and day to work he will and ever have that lord in mind but ghostly foe grieve I ill _ spiritual _ and my frail flesh maketh I blind therefore he mercy i take I till _ betake I to _ for better bote can i none find _ aid _ in my choice of stanza i have to keep in view some measure of completeness in the result these poem however be mostly very loose in structure this while it render choice easy render closeness of unity impossible from a poem head -- again from the last line of each stanza -- _ be my comfort christ jesus _ i choose the follow four each possess some remarkable flavor tone or single touch note the alliteration in the lovely line begin bairn y-born the whole of the stanza in which we find it sound so strangely fresh in the midst of its antiquated tone that we can hardly help ask whether it can be only the quaintness of the expression that make the feeling appear more real or whether in very truth man be not in those day nearer in heart as well as in time to the marvel of the nativity in the next stanza how oddly the writer forget that jesus himself be a jew when embody the detestation of christian century in one line he say and torment with many a jew in the third stanza i consider the middle quatrain that be the four line begin out of this world perfectly grand the oddness of the last line but one of the fourth stanza be redeem by the wonderful reality it give to the faith of the speaker : see my sorrow and say ho stop it as one would call after a man and stop he jesus thou art wisdom of wit _ understanding _ of thy father full of might man 's soul -- to save it in poor apparel thou wert pight _ pitch place jesus thou wert in cradle knit -lrb- dress _ in weed wrap both day and night originally _ dress of

that sweet light so be my comfort christ jesus jesus that wert of yearis young fair and fresh of hide and hue when thou wert in thraldom throng _ drive _ and torment with many a jew when blood and

man make no more moan -- for man it be thou wroughtest thus and god with man be make at one so be my comfort christ jesus jesu my sovereign savior almighty god there ben no mo : _ there be no more --

here and wisse thou I when I be woe _ think on I _ lord thou makest friend of foe let I not live in languor thus but see my sorrow and say now ho and be my comfort christ jesus of fourteen stanza call _ richard de castre 's prayer to jesus _ i choose five from the latter half where the prayer pass from he own spiritual necessity very tenderly embody to those of other it do we heart good to see the clouded sun of prayer for oneself break forth in the gladness of bless entreaty for all man for they that make he angry for saint in trouble for the country tear by war for the whole body of christ and its unity after the stanza -- jesus for the deadly tear that thou sheddest for my guilt hear and speed my prayérs and spare I that i be not spill the best that be in the suppliant shine out thus jesu for they i thee beseech that wrathen thee in any wise withhold from they thy hand of wreche _ vengeance _ and let they live in thy service jesu most comfort for to see of thy sainti every one comfort they that careful be and help they that be woe-begone jesu keep they that be good and amend they that have grieve thee and send they fruit of earthly food as each man needeth in he degree jesu that art withouten lee _ lie _ almighty god in trinity cease these war and send we peace with lasting love and charity jesu that art the ghostly stone _ spiritual _ of all holy church in middle-erde _ the world _ bring thy fold and flock in one and rule they rightly with one herd we now approach the second revival of literature precede in england by the arrival of the art of printing after which we find ourselves walk in a morning twilight know something of the author as well as of they work i have little more to offer from this century there be a few religious poem by john skelton who be tutor to henry viii but such poetry though he be a clergyman be not much in skelton 's manner of mind we have far better of a similar sort already a new sort of dramatic representation have by this time greatly encroach upon the old miracle play the fresh growth be call moral or moral play in they we see the lose victory of invention over the imagination that work with give fact no doubt in the moral play there be more exercise of intellect as well as of ingenuity for they consist of metaphysical fact turn into individual existence by personification and they relation then dramatize by allegory but they poetry be greatly inferior both in character and execution to that of the miracle they have a religious tendency as everything moral must have and sometimes they go even farther as in one for instance call _ the castle of perseverance _ in which we have all the cardinal virtue and all the cardinal sin contend for the possession of _ humanum genus _ the _ human race _ be present as a new-born child who grow old and die in the course of the play but it be a great stride in art when human nature and human history begin again to be exemplify after a simple human fashion in the story that be of real man and woman instead of by allegorical personification of the analyze and abstracted constituent of they allegory have she place and a lofty one in literature but when she plant cover the garden and run to seed allegory herself be ashamed of she child : the loveliest among they be despise for the general obtrusiveness of the family imitation not only bring the thing imitate into disrepute but tend to destroy what original faculty the imitator may have possess chapter iv introduction to the elizabethan era poet now begin to write more smoothly -- not a great virtue but indicative of a grow desire for finish which in any art be a great virtue no doubt smoothness be often confound with and mistaken for finish but you might have a mirror-like polish on the surface of a statue for instance and yet the marble be full of inanity or vagueness or even vulgarity of result -- irrespective altogether of its idea the influence of italian poetry revive once more in the country rouse such man as wyat and surrey to polish the sound of they verse but smoothness i repeat be not melody and where the attention pay to the outside of the form result in flatness and still worse in obscurity as be the case with both of these poet little be gain and much be lose each have paraphrase portion of scripture but with result of little value and there be nothing of a religious nature i care to quote from either except these five line from a epistle of sir thoma wyat 's : thyself content with that be thee assign and use it well that be to thee allotted then seek no more out of thyself to find the thing that thou hast seek so long before for thou shalt feel it stick in thy mind student of versification will allow I to remark that sir thoma be the first english poet so far as i know who use the _ terza rima _ dante 's chief mode of rhyming : the above be too small a fragment to show that it belong to a poem in that manner it have never be popular in england although to my mind it be the finest form of continuous rhyme in any language again we owe he friend surrey far more for be the first to write english blank verse whether invent by himself or not than for any matter he have leave we in poetic shape this period be somewhat barren of such poetry as we want here be a portion of the fifty-first psalm translate amongst other into english verse by john croke

justice and of pure intent and all thing else thou wilt well take that we shall offer or present in the work of george gascoigne i find one poem fit for quote here he be not a interesting writer and although he verse be very good there be little likelihood of its ever be read more than it be now the date of he birth be unknown but probably he be in he teens when surrey be behead in the year 1547 he be the only poet whose style remind I of he although the _ wherefore _ will hardly be evident from my quotation it be equally flat but more articulate i need not detain my reader with remark upon he the fact be i be glad to have something if not a cart-load of wholesome instruction to cast into this slough of despond should it be only to see it vanish the poem be call gascoigne 's good morrow you that have spend the silent night in sleep and quiet rest and joy to see the cheerful light that riseth in the east now clear you voice now cheer you heart come help I now to sing each willing wight come bear a part to praise the heavenly king and you whom care in prison keep or sickness doth suppress or secret sorrow break you sleep or dolor do distress yet bear a part in doleful wise yea think it good accord and acceptable sacrifice each sprite to praise the lord the dreadful night with darksomeness have overspread the light and sluggish sleep with drowsiness have overpress we might : a glass wherein you may behold each storm that stop we breath we bed the grave we clothes like mould and sleep like dreadful death yet as this deadly night do last but for a little space and heavenly day now night be past doth shew he pleasant face so must we hope to see god 's face at last in heaven on high when we have change this mortal place for immortality this be not so bad but it be enough there be six stanza more of it i transcribe yet another that my reader may enjoy a smile in pass he be moralize the aspect of morning : the carrion crow that loathsome beast which cry against the rain both for he hue and for the rest the devil resembleth plain and as with gun we kill the crow for spoil we relief the devil so must we overthrow with gunshot of belief so fare the wit when it walk abroad to do its business without the heart that should inspire it here be one good stanza from he _ de profundis : _ but thou art good and hast of mercy store thou not delight ` st to see a sinner fall thou hearkenest first before we come to call thine ear be set wide open evermore before we knock thou comest to the door thou art more prest to hear a sinner cry _ ready _ than he be quick to climb to thee on high thy mighty name be praise then alway : let faith and fear true witness bear how fast they stand which on thy mercy stay here follow two of unknown authorship belong apparently to

with a ideal but instead of behold that ideal in the future where it lie it throw it into the past hence the lapse of the nation must appear tremendous even when she be make she best progress chapter v spenser and he friend we have now arrive at the period of english history in every way fullest of marvel -- the period of elizabeth as in a northern summer the whole region burst into blossom at once so with the thought and feeling of england in this glorious era the special development of the national mind with which we be now concerned however do not by any means arrive at its largest and clearest result until the following century still its progress be sufficiently remarkable for while everything that bear upon the mental development of the nation must bear upon its poetry the fresh vigor give by the doctrine of the reformation to the sense of personal responsibility and of immediate relation to god with the grand influence both literary and spiritual of the translate print and study bible operate more immediately upon its devotional utterance towards the close of the sixteenth century we begin to find such verse as i shall now present to my reader only i must first make a few remark upon the great poem of the period : i mean of course _ the faerie queen _ i dare not begin to set forth after any fashion the profound religious truth contain in this poem for it would require a volume larger than this to set forth even that of the first book adequately in this case it be well to remember that the beginning of comment as well as of strife be like the let out of water the direction in which the wonderful allegory of the latter move may be gather from the follow stanza the first of the eighth canto : ay I how many peril do enfold the righteous man to make he daily fail be not that heavenly grace doth he uphold _ it _ understand and steadfast truth acquit he out of all she love be firm she care continual so oft as he through he own foolish pride or weakness be to sinful band make thrall : else should this redcross knight in band have die for whose deliverance she this prince doth thither guide nor do i judge it good to spend much of my space upon remark personal to those who have not be especially writer of sacred verse when we come to the master of such song we can not speak of they word without speaking of themselves but when in the midst of many word those of the kind we seek be few the life of the writer do not justify more than a pass notice here we know but little of spenser 's history : if we might know all i do not fear that we should find anything to destroy the impression make by he verse -- that he be a christian gentleman a noble and pure-minded man of highest purpose and aim he style be injure by the artistic falsehood of produce antique effect in the midst of modern feeling -lrb- 54 -rrb- it be scarcely more justifiable for instance in spenser 's time than it would be in ours to use _ glitterand _ for _ glitter _ or to return to a large use of alliteration three four sometimes even five word in the same line begin with the same consonant sound everything should look like what it be : prose or verse should be write in the language of its own era no doubt the wide-spreading root of poetry gather to it more variety of expression than prose can employ and the very nature of verse will make it free of time and season harmonize many opposite hence through its mediation without discord many fine old word by the loss of which the language have grow poorer and feebler might be honourably entice to return even into we prose but nothing ought to be bring back _ because _ it be old that it be out of use be a presumptive argument that it ought to remain out of use : good reason must be at hand to support its reappearance i must not however enlarge upon this wide-reaching question for of the two portion of spenser 's verse which i shall quote one of they be not at all the other not so much as he great poem affect with this whim the first i give be a sonnet one of eighty-eight which he write to he wife before they marriage apparently disappoint in early youth he do not fall in love again -- at least there be no sign of it that i know -- till he be middle-aged but then -- woman be never more grandly woo than be he elizabeth i know of no marriage-present worthy to be compare with the epithalamion which he give she in lieu of many ornament -- one of the most stately melodious and tender poem in the world i fully believe but now for the sonnet -- the sixty-eighth of the _ amorettus _ : most glorious lord of life that on this day didst make thy triumph over death and sin and have harrow hell didst bring away captivity thence captive we to win : this joyous day dear lord with joy begin and grant that we for whom thou diddest die be with thy dear blood clean wash from sin may live for ever in felicity and that thy love we weigh worthily may likewise love thee for the same again and for thy sake that all like dear didst buy with love may one another entertain so let we love dear love like as we ought : love be the lesson which the lord we teach those who have never feel the need of the divine enter by the channel of will and choice and prayer for the uphold purifying and glorifying of that which itself first create human will consider this poem untrue have its origin in religious affectation other will think otherwise the greater part of what i shall next quote be tolerably know even to those who have make little study of we earlier literature yet it may not be omit here it be from _ a hymne of heavenly love _ consist of forty-one stanza write in what be call _ rime royal _ -- a favorite with milton and next to the spenserian in my opinion the finest of stanza its construction will reveal itself i take two stanza from the beginning of the hymn then one from the heart of it and the rest from the close it give no feeling of a outburst of song but rather of a brooding chant most quiet in virtue of the depth of its thoughtfulness indeed all he rhythm be like the melody of water and i could quote at least three passage in which he speak of rhythmic movement and watery progression together he thought and hence he word flow like a full peaceful stream diffuse with plenteousness unrestrained a hymn of heavenly love before this world 's great frame in which all thing be now contain find any be place ere flitting time could wag he eya -lrb- 55 -rrb- wing about that mighty bind which doth embrace the rolling sphere and part they hour by space that high eternal power which now doth move in all these thing move in itself by love it love itself because itself be fair for fair be loved and of itself beget like to itself he eldest son and heir eternal pure and void of sinful blot the firstling of he joy in whom no jot of love 's dislike or pride be to be find whom he therefore with equal honor crown \* \* \* \* \* out of the bosom of eternal bliss in which he reignéd with he glorious sire he down descend like a most demisse _ humble _ and abject thrall in flesh 's frail attire that he for he might pay sin 's deadly hire and he restore unto that happy state in which he stand before he hapless fate \* \* \* \* \* o bless well of love o flower of grace o glorious morning-star o lamp of light most lively image of thy father 's face eternal king of glory lord of might meek lamb of god before all world behight _ promise _ how can we thee requite for all this good or what can prize that thy most precious blood _ equal in value _ yet nought thou ask ` st in lieu of all this love but love of we for guerdon of thy pain : ay I what can we less than that behove -lrb- 56 -rrb- have he require life of -lrb- 57 -rrb- we again have it be wrong to ask he own with gain he give we life he it restore lose then life be least that we so little cost but he we life have left unto we free -- free that be thrall and bless that be ban _ enslave cursed _ nor aught demand but that we loving be as he himself have love we aforehand and bind thereto with a eternal band -- he first to love that we -lrb- 58 -rrb- so dearly buy and next we brethren to he image work he first to love great right and reason be who first to we we life and be give and after when we faréd have amiss we wretch from the second death do save and last the food of life which now we have even he himself in he dear sacrament to feed we hungry soul unto we lend then next to love we brethren that be make of that self mould and that self maker 's hand that -lrb- 59 -rrb- we and to the same again shall fade where they shall have like heritage of land _ the same grave-room _ however here on higher step we stand which also be with selfsame price redeem that we however of we light esteemed _ as _ and be they not yet since that loving lord command we to love they for he sake even for he sake and for he sacred word which in he last bequest he to we speak we should they love and with they need partake _ share they know that whatsoe'er to they we give -lrb- need _ we give to he by whom we all do live such mercy he by he most holy rede _ instruction _ unto we teach and to approve it true ensample it by he most righteous deed shew we mercy miserable crew that we the like should to the wretch -lrb- 60 -rrb- shew and love we brethren thereby to approve how much himself that love we we love then rouse thyself o earth out of thy soil in which thou wallowest like to filthy swine and dost thy mind in dirty pleasure moyle _ defile _ unmindful of that dearest lord of thine lift up to he thy heavy clouded eyne that thou this sovereign bounty mayst behold and read through love he mercy manifold begin from first where he encradle be in simple cratch wrapt in a wad of hay _ a rack or crib _ between the toilful ox and humble ass and in what rag and in what base array the glory of we heavenly riches lay when he the silly -lrb- 61 -rrb- shepherd come to see whom greatest prince seek on lowest knee from thence read on the story of he life he humble carriage he unfaulty way he cankered foe he fight he toil he strife he pain he poverty he sharp assay _ temptation _ or _ trial _ through which he pass he miserable day offend none and do good to all yet be malice both by great and small and look at last how of most wretched wight he take be betray and false accuse how with most scornful taunt and fall despite he be revile disgraced and foul abused how scourge how crown how buffet how bruise and lastly how ` twixt robber crucify with bitter wound through hand through foot and side \* \* \* \* \* with sense whereof whilst so thy softened spirit be inly touch and humble with meek zeal through meditation of he endless merit lift up thy mind to th ' author of thy weal and to he sovereign mercy do appeal learn he to love that lovéd thee so dear and in thy breast he bless image bear with all thy heart with all thy soul and mind thou must he love and he behest embrace _ command _ all other love with which the world doth blind weak fancy and stir up affection base thou must renounce and utterly displace and give thyself unto he full and free that full and freely give himself to thee \* \* \* \* \* thenceforth all world 's desire will in thee die and all earth 's glory on which man do gaze seem dust and dross in thy pure-sighted eye compare to that celestial beauty 's blaze whose glorious beam all fleshly sense do daze with admiration of they pass light blind the eye and lumine the sprite then shalt thy ravished soul inspiréd be with heavenly thought far above human skill _ reason _ and thy bright radiant eye shall plainly see the idea of he pure glory present still before thy face that all thy spirit shall fill with sweet enragement of celestial love kindle through sight of those fair thing above there be a companion to the poem of which these verse be a portion call _ a hymne of heavenly beautie _ fill like this and like two other on beauty and love with platonic form both of thought and expression but i have prefer quote a longer part of the former to give portion of both my reader will recognize in the extract a fuller force of intellect bring to bear on duty although it would be unwise to take a mind like spenser 's for a type of more than the highest class of the age doubtless the division in the country with regard to many of the church 's doctrine have its part in bring out and strengthen this tendency to reasoning which be so essential to progress where religion itself be not the most important thing with the individual all reasoning upon it must indeed degenerate into strife of word _ vermiculate _ question as lord bacon call they -- such namely as like the hoard manna reveal the character of the owner by breeding of worm -- yet on no question may the light of the candle of the lord that be the human understanding be cast with greater hope of discovery than on those of religion those namely that bear upon man 's relation to god and to he fellow the most partial illumination of this region the very cause of whose mystery be the height and depth of its _ truth _ be of more awful value to the human being than perfect knowledge if such be possible concern everything else in the universe while in fact in this very region discovery may bring with it a higher kind of conviction than can accompany the result of investigation in any other direction in these grandest of all thinking the great man of this time show a grandeur of thought worthy of they surpass excellence in other noblest field of human labor they think greatly because they aspire greatly sir walter raleigh be a personal friend of edmund spenser they be almost of the same age the former bear in 1552 the latter in the following year a writer of magnificent prose itself full of religion and poetry both in thought and expression he have not distinguish himself greatly in verse there be however one remarkable poem fit for my purpose which i can hardly doubt to be he it be call _ sir walter raleigh 's pilgrimage _ the probability be that it be write just after he condemnation in 1603 -- although many year pass before he sentence be carry into execution give I my scallop-shell -lrb- 62 -rrb- of quiet my staff of faith to walk upon my scrip of joy immortal diet my bottle of salvation my gown of glory hope 's true gage and thus i 'll take my pilgrimage blood must be my body 's balmer -- no other balm will there be give -- whilst my soul like quiet palmer travelleth towards the land of heaven over the silver mountain where spring the nectar fountain -- there will i kiss the bowl of bliss and drink mine everlasting fill upon every milken hill : my soul will be a-dry before but after it will thirst no more then by that happy blissful day more peaceful pilgrim i shall see that have cast off they rag of clay and walk apparel fresh like I : i 'll take they first to quench they thirst and taste of nectar 's sucket _ sweet thing -- thing to suck _ at those clear well where sweetness dwell draw up by saint in crystal bucket and when we bottle and all we be fill with immortality then the bless path we 'll travel strow with ruby thick as gravel ceiling of diamond sapphire floor high wall of coral and pearly bower -- from thence to heaven 's bribeless hall where no corrupted voice brawl no conscience molten into gold no forge accuser buy or sell no cause defer no vain-spent journey for there christ be the king 's attorney who plead for all without degree _ irrespective of rank _ and he have angel but no fee and when the grand twelve million jury of we sin with direful fury ` gainst we soul black verdict give christ plead he death and then we live be thou my speaker taintless pleader unblotted lawyer true proceeder thou giv ` st salvation even for alms -- not with a bribéd lawyer 's palm and this be my eternal plea to he that make heaven earth and sea that since my flesh must die so soon and want a head to dine next noon -- just at the stroke when my vein start and spread set on my soul a everlasting head : then be i ready like a palmer fit to tread those blest path which before i writ of death and judgment heaven and hell who oft doth think must need die well this poem be a somewhat strange medley with a confusion of figure and a repeated failure in dignity which be very far indeed from be worthy of raleigh 's prose but it be very remarkable how wretchedly some man will show who do they own work well attempt that for which practice have not -- to use a word of the time -- _ enable _ they there be real power in the poem however and the confusion be far more indicative of the pleased success of a unaccustomed hand than of incapacity for harmonious work some of the imagery especially the crystal bucket will suggest those grotesque drawing call _ emblem _ which be much in use before and after this period and indeed be only a put into visible shape of such metaphor and simile as some of the most popular poet of the time especially doctor donne indulge in while the profusion of earthly riches attribute to the heavenly path and the place of repose on the journey may well recall raleigh 's own description of south american glory englishman of that era believe in a earthly paradise beyond the atlantic the wonderful report of whose magnificence have no doubt a share in lift the imagination and hope of the people to the height at which they now stand there may be a appearance of irreverence in the way in which he contrast the bribeless hall of heaven with the proceedings at he own trial where he be browbeat abused and from the very commencement treat as a guilty man by sir edward coke the king 's attorney he even pun with the word _ angel _ and _ fee _ burn from a sense of injustice however and with the solemnity of death before he he could not be guilty of _ conscious _ irreverence at least but there be another remark i have to make with regard to the matter which will bear upon much of the literature of the time : even the great writer of that period have such a delight in word and such a command over they that like they skilful horseman who enjoy make they steed show off the fantastic pace they have teach they they play with the word as they pass through they hand toss they about as a juggler might he ball but even herein the true master of speech show he masterdom : he play must not be by-play it must contribute to the truth of the idea which be take form in those word we shall see this more plainly when we come to transcribe some of sir philip sidney 's work there be no irreverence in it nor can i take it as any sign of hardness that raleigh should treat the visual image of he own anticipated death with so much coolness if the writer of a little elegy on he execution when raleigh be fourteen year older than at the presumed date of the foregoing verse describe he truly when he say : i saw in every stander-by pale death life only in thy eye the follow hymn be also attribute to raleigh if it have less brilliance of fancy it have none of the fault of the precede and be far more artistic in construction and finish notwithstanding a degree of irregularity rise oh my soul with thy desire to heaven and with divinest contemplation use thy time where time 's eternity be give and let vain thought no more thy thought abuse but down in darkness let they lie : so live thy better let thy worse thought die and thou my soul inspire with holy flame view and review with most regardful eye that holy cross whence thy salvation come on which thy savior and thy sin do die for in that sacred object be much pleasure and in that savior be my life my treasure to thee o jesus i direct my eye to thee my hand to thee my humble knee to thee my heart shall offer sacrifice to thee my thought who my thought only see -- to thee myself -- myself and all i give to thee i die to thee i only live see what a effect of stately composure quiet artistic care produce and how it leave the ear of the mind in a satisfied peace there be a few fine line in the poem the last two line of the first stanza be admirable the last two of the second very weak the last stanza be good throughout but it would be very unfair to judge sir walter by he verse he prose be infinitely better and equally display the devout tendency of he mind -- a tendency common to all the great man of that age the worst i know of he be the selfishly prudent advice he leave behind for he son no doubt he have he fault but we must not judge a man even by what he say in a over-anxiety for the prosperity of he child another remarkable fact in the history of those great man be that they be all man of affair raleigh be a soldier a sailor a discoverer a politician as well as a author he friend spenser be first secretary to lord gray when he be governor of ireland and afterwards sheriff of cork he have write a large treatise on the state of ireland but of all the man of the age no one be more variously gifted or exercise those gift in more differ direction than the man who of they all be most in favor with queen court and people -- philip sidney i could write much to set forth the greatness culture balance and scope of this wonderful man renown over europe for he person for he dress for he carriage for he speech for he skill in arm for he horsemanship for he soldiership for he statesmanship for he learn he be beloved for he friendship he generosity he steadfastness he simplicity he conscientiousness he religion amongst the lamentation over he death print in spenser 's work there be one poem by matthew roydon a few verse of which i shall quote be no vain eulogy describe he personal appearance he say : a sweet attractive kind of grace a full assurance give by look continual comfort in a face the lineament of gospel book -- i trow that countenance can not lie whose thought be legible in the eye be ever eye do see that face be ever ear do hear that tongue be ever mind do mind he grace that ever think the travel long but eye and ear and every thought be with he sweet perfection catch he _ arcadium _ be a book full of wisdom and beauty none of he writings be print in he lifetime but the _ arcadium _ be for many year after he death one of the most popular book in the country he prose as prose be not equal to he friend raleigh 's be less condensed and stately it be too full of fancy in thought and freak in rhetoric to find now-a-days more than a very limited number of reader and a good deal of the verse that be set in it be obscure and uninteresting partly from some false notion of poetic composition which he and he friend spenser entertain when young but there be often a exquisite art in he other poem the first i shall transcribe be a sonnet to which the latin word print below it might be prefix as a title : _ splendidi longum valedico nugi _ a long farewell to glitter trifle leave I o love which reachest but to dust and thou my mind aspire to higher thing grow rich in that which never taketh rust : what ever fade but fading pleasure bring draw in thy beam and humble all thy might to that sweet yoke where lasting freedom be which break the cloud and open forth the light that doth both shine and give we sight to see oh take fast hold let that light be thy guide in this small course which birth draw out to death and think how evil -lrb- 63 -rrb- becometh he to slide who seeketh heaven and come of heavenly breath then farewell world thy uttermost i see : eternal love maintain thy life in I before turn to the treasury of he noblest verse i shall give six line from a poem in the _ arcadium _ -- chiefly for the sake of instance what great question those mighty man delighted in : what essence destiny have if fortune be or no whence we immortal soul to mortal earth do stow -lrb- 64 -rrb- : what life it be and how that all these life do gather with outward maker 's force or like a inward father such thought I think i think and strain my single mind then void of nearer care the depth of thing to find lord bacon be not the only one in such a age to think upon the mighty relation of physics and metaphysics or as sidney would say of naturall and supernaturall philosophic for a man to do he best he must be uphold even in he speculation by those around he in the specimen just give we find that we religious poetry have go down into the deep there be indication of such a tendency in the older time but neither then be the question so articulate nor be the questioner so troubled for a answer the alternative express in the middle couplet seem to I the most imperative of all question -- both for the individual and for the church : be man fashion by the hand of god as a potter fashioneth he vessel or do we indeed come forth from he heart be power or love the making might of the universe he who answer this question aright possess the key to all righteous question sir philip and he sister mary countess of pembroke make between they a metrical translation of the psalm of david it can not be determine which be hers and which be he but if i may conclude anything from a poem by the sister to which i shall by and by refer i take those i now give for the brother 's work the soul of the follow psalm have in the version i present transmigrate into fairer form than i have find they occupy elsewhere here be a grand hymn for the whole world : _ sing unto the lord _ psalm xcvi sing and let you song be new unto he that never endeth sing all earth and all in you -- sing to god and bless he name of the help the health he sendeth day by day new ditty frame make each country know he worth : of he act the wonder story paint unto each people forth for jehovah great alone all the god for awe and glory far above doth hold he throne for but idol what be they whom besides mad earth adoreth he the sky in frame do lay grace and honor be he guide majesty he temple storeth might in guard about he bide kindred come jehovah give -- o give jehovah all together force and fame whereso you live give he name the glory fit : take you off ` ring get you thither where he doth enshrine sit go adore he in the place where he pomp be most display earth o go with quake pace go proclaim jehovah king : stayless world shall now be stay righteous doom he rule shall bring starry roof and earthy floor sea and all thy wideness yieldeth now rejoice and leap and roar leafy infant of the wood field and all that on you feedeth dance o dance at such a good for jehovah cometh lo lo to reign jehovah cometh under whom you all shall go he the world shall rightly guide -- truly as a king becometh for the people 's weal provide attempt to give a ascend scale of excellence -- i do not mean in subject but in execution -- i now turn to the national hymn _ god be we refuge _ psalm xliv god give we strength and keep we sound -- a present help when danger call then fear not we let quake the ground and into sea let mountain fall yea so let sea withal in watery hill arise as may the earthly hill appal with dread and dash cry for lo a river streaming joy with purling murmur safely slide that city wash from annoy in holy shrine where god reside god in she center bide : what can this city shake god early aid and ever guide : who can this city take when nation go against she bent and king with siege she wall enround the void of air he voice doth rent earth fail they foot with melting ground to strength and keep we sound the god of army arm we rock on jacob 's god we find above the reach of harm o come with I o come and view the trophy of jehovah 's hand what wreck from he we foe pursue how clearly he have purge we land by he war silent stand : he brake the archer 's bow make chariot 's wheel a fiery brand and spear to shiver go be still saith he know god be i know i will be with conquest crown above all nation -- raiséd high high raise above this earthly round to strength and keep we sound the god of army arm we rock on jacob 's god we find above the reach of harm the god of army arm be a grand line now let we have a hymn of nature -- a far finer i think than either of the precede : _ praise waiteth for thee _ psalm lxv sion it be where thou art praiséd sion o god where vow they pay thee : there all man 's prayer to thee raiséd return possess of what they pray thee there thou my sin prevail to my shame dost turn to smoke of sacrifice flame oh he of bliss be not deceivéd _ disappointed _ whom choose thou unto thee takest and whom into thy court receivéd thou of thy checkrole -lrb- 65 -rrb- number makest : the dainty viand of thy sacred store shall feed he so he shall not hunger more from thence it be thy threat ` ning thunder -- lest we by wrong should be disgracéd -- doth strike we foe with fear and wonder o thou on whom they hope be placéd whom either earth doth stedfastly sustain or cradle rock the restless wavy plain thy virtue stay the mighty mountain _ power _ gird with power with strength abound the roar dam of watery fountain _ the dam of fountain thy beck doth make surcease she sound -lrb- be the ocean

affright they and in thy praise they voice spend both house of the sun delight they -- both whence he come when early he awake and where he go when evening rest he take thy eye from heaven this land beholdeth such fruitful dew down on it rain that storehouse-like she lap enfoldeth assuréd hope of ploughman 's gain : thy flow stream she drought doth temper so that bury seed through yield grave

valley clotheth desert and hill and field and valley all rejoice shout sing and on thy name do call the first stanza seem to I very fine especially the verse return possess of what they pray thee the third stanza might have be write after the spanish philip 's armada but both king david and sir philip sidney be dead before god brake that archer 's bow -lrb- 66 -rrb- the fourth line of the next stanza be a noteworthy instance of the sense gathering to itself the sound and be in lovely contrast with the closing line of the same stanza one of the most remarkable specimen i know of the play with word of which i have already speak as common even in the serious writings of this century be to be find in the next line : where earth doth end with endless end david regard the world as a flat disc speak of the _ end _ of the earth : sidney know it to be a globe use the word of the psalmist but re-mould and change the form of it with a power fantastic almost capricious in its wilfulness yet cause it to express the fact with a marvel of precision we _ see _ that the earth end we can not reach the end we see therefore the earth doth end with endless end it be a case of that contradiction in the form of the word use which bring out a truth in another plane as it be -- a paradox in word not in mean for the word can bear no meaning but the one which reveal its own reality the follow little psalm _ the lord reigneth _ be a thunderous organ-blast of praise the repetition of word in the beginning of the second stanza produce a remarkably fine effect psalm xciii clothe with state and girt with might monarch-like jehovah reign he who earth 's foundation pight -- _ pitch _ pight at first and yet sustain he whose stable throne disdain motion 's shock and age 's flight he who endless one remain one the same in changeless plight river -- yea though river roar roar though sea-billow rise vex the deep and break the shore -- stronger art thou lord of sky firm and true thy promise lie now and still as heretofore : holy worship never die in thy house where we adore i close my selection from sidney with one which i consider the best of all : it be the first half of _ lord thou hast search I _ psalm cxxxix o lord in I there lieth nought but to thy search reveal lie for when i sit thou markest it no less thou notest when i rise : yea closest closet of my thought have open window to thine eye thou walkest with I when i walk when to my bed for rest i go i find thee there and every where : not youngest think in I doth grow no not one word i cast to talk but yet unuttered thou dost know if forth i march thou goest before if back i turn thou com ` st behind : so forth nor back thy guard i lack nay on I too thy hand i find well i thy wisdom may adore but never reach with earthy mind to shun thy notice leave thine eye o whither might i take my way to starry sphere thy throne be there to dead man 's undelightsome stay there be thy walk and there to lie unknown in vain i should assay o sun whom light nor flight can match suppose thy lightful flightful wing thou lend to I and i could flee as far as thee the evening bring : ev 'n lead to west he would I catch nor should i lurk with western thing do thou thy best o secret night in sable veil to cover I : thy sable veil shall vainly fail : with day unmask my night shall be for night be day and darkness light o father of all light to thee note the most musical play with the word _ light _ and _ flight _ in the fifth stanza there be hardly a line that be not delightful they be a wonderful family those sidney mary for whom philip write he chief work thence call the countess of pembroke 's _ arcadium _ be a woman of rare gift the chief poem know to be hers be call _ we savior 's passion _ it be full of the fault of the age sir philip 's sport with word be so graceful and order as to subserve the utterance of the thought : he sister 's fanciful convolution appear to be there for they own sake -- certainly be there to the obscuration of the sense the difficulty of the poem arise in part i believe from corruption but chiefly from a certain fantastic way of deal with think as well as word of which i shall have occasion to say more when we descend a little further it be in the main a lamentation over we savior 's suffering in which the countess be largely guilty of the very feminine fault of seek to convey the intensity of she emotion by force word accumulate form and exaggerate description this may indeed convince as to the presence of feeling but can not communicate the feeling itself _ the _ right word will at once generate a sympathy of which all agony of utterance will only render the willing mind more and more incapable the poem be likewise very diffuse -- again a common fault with woman of power for indeed the faculty of compress think into crystalline form be one of the rarest gift of artistic genius it consist of a hundred and ten stanza from which i shall gather and arrange a few he place all rest and have no rest place he heal each pain yet live in sore distress deserve all good yet live in great disgrace give all heart joy himself in heaviness suffer they live by whom himself be slay : lord who can live to see such love again whose mansion heaven yet lay within a manger who give all food yet suck a virgin 's breast who could have kill yet flee a threatening danger who seek all quiet by he own unrest who die for they that highly do offend he and live for they that can not comprehend he who come no further than he father send he and do fulfil but what he do command he who pray for they that proudly do torment he for tell truly of what they do demand he who do all good that humbly do intreat he and bare they blow that do unkindly beat he have i but see he as he servant do at sea at land in city or in field though in himself he have he glory hide that in he grace the light of glory hold then might my sorrow somewhat be appeaséd that once my soul have in he sight be pleaséd no i have run the way of wickedness forget what my faith should follow most i do not think upon thy holiness nor by my sin what sweetness i have lose oh sin for sin have compass I about that lord i know not where to find thee out where he that sit on the supernal throne in majesty most glorious to behold and hold the sceptre of the world alone have not he garment of imbroidered gold but he be clothe with truth and righteousness where angel all do sing with joyfulness where heavenly love be cause of holy life and holy life increaseth heavenly love where peace establish without fear or strife doth prove the blessing of the soul 's behove -lrb- 67 -rrb- where thirst nor hunger grief nor sorrow dwelleth but peace in joy and joy in peace excelleth have all the poem be like these stanza i should not have speak so strongly concern its fault there be a few more such in it it close with a very fantastic use of musical term follow upon a curious category of the work of nature as praise god to which i refer for the sake of one stanza or rather of one line in the stanza : to see the greyhound course the hound in chase _ whilst little dormouse sleepeth out she eyne _ the lamb and rabbit sweetly run at base -lrb- 68 -rrb- whilst highest tree the little squirrel climb the crawl worm out creep in the shower and how the snail do climb the lofty tower what a love of animated nature there be in the lovely lady i be all but confident however that second line come to she from watch she child asleep she have one child at least : that william herbert who be generally and with weight believe the wh of shakspere 's sonnet a grander honor than the earldom of pembroke or even the have philip sidney to he uncle : i will not say grander than have mary sidney to he _ mother _ let I now turn to sidney 's friend sir fulk grevill lord brooke who afterwards write he life as a intended preface to all he monument to the memory of sir philip sidney the say _ monument _ be lord brooke 's own poem my extract be from _ a treatise of religion _ in which if the reader do not find much of poetic form he will find at least some grand spiritual philosophy the stuff whereof all highest poetry be fashion it be one of the first poem in which the philosophy of religion and not either its doctrine feeling or history predominate it be as a whole poor chiefly from its be so loosely write there be man and man whose thought be of great worth to whom it never seem to occur that they may utter very largely and convey very little that what be clear to themselves be in they speech obscure as a late twilight they utterance be rarely articulate : they spiritual mouth talk with but half-movement of its lip it do not model they thought into clear-cut shape such as the spiritual ear can distinguish as they enter it of such be lord brooke these few stanza however my reader will be glad to have : what be the chain which draw we back again and lift man up unto he first creation nothing in he he own heart can restrain he reason live a captive to temptation example be corrupt precept be mixed all fleshly knowledge frail and never fix it be a light a gift a grace inspire a spark of power a goodness of the good desire in he that never be desire a unity where desolation stand in we not of we a spirit not of earth fashion the mortal to immortal birth \* \* \* \* \* sense of this god by fear the sensual have distresséd nature cry unto grace for sovereign reason then become a slave and yield to servile sense she sovereign place when more or other she affect to be than seat or shrine of this eternity yea prince of earth let man assume to be nay more -- of man let man himself be god yet without god a slave of slave be he to other wonder to himself a rod restless despair desire and desolation the more secure the more abomination then by affect power we can not know he by know all thing else we know he less nature contain he not art can not show he opinion idol and not god express without in power we see he everywhere within we rest not till we find he there then seek we must that course be natural -- for ownéd soul to find they owner out we free remorse when we nature fall -- when we do well we heart make free from doubt -- prove service due to one omnipotence and nature of religion to have sense question again which in we heart arise -- since loving knowledge not humility -- though they be curious godless and unwise yet prove we nature feel a deity for if these strife rise out of other grounds man be to god as deafness be to sound \* \* \* \* \* yet in this strife this natural remorse if we could bend the force of power and wit to work upon the heart and make divorce there from the evil which preventeth it in judgment of the truth we should not doubt good life would find a good religion out if a fair proportion of it be equal to this the poem would be a fine one not for its poetry but for its spiritual metaphysics i think the fourth and fifth of the stanza i have give profound in truth and excellent in utterance they be worth ponder we now descend a decade of the century to find another group of name within the immediate threshold of the sixty chapter vi lord bacon and he coeval except it be milton 's there be not any prose fuller of grand poetic embodiment than lord bacon 's yet he always write contemptuously of poetry have in he eye no doubt the commonplace kind of it which will always occupy more bulk and hence be more obtrusive than that which be true in its nature and rare in its workmanship towards the latter end of he life however be in ill health at the time he translate seven of the psalm of david into verse dedicate they to george herbert the best of they be psalm civ -- just the one upon which we might suppose from he love to the law of nature he would dwell with the greatest sympathy partly from the wish to hear he voice amongst the rest of we singer partly for the merit of the version itself which have some remarkable line i have resolve to include it here it be the first specimen i have give in the heroic couplet father and king of power both high and low whose sound fame all creature serve to blow my soul shall with the rest strike up thy praise and carol of thy work and wondrous way but who can blaze thy beauty lord aright they turn the brittle beam of mortal sight upon thy head thou wear ` st a glorious crown all set with virtue polish with renown : thence round about a silver veil doth fall of crystal light mother of color all the compass heaven smooth without grain or fold all set with spang of glitter star untold and striped with golden beam of power unpent be raiséd up for a remove tent vault and archéd be he chamber beam upon the sea the water and the stream the cloud as chariot swift do scour the sky the stormy wind upon they wing do fly he angel spirit be that wait he will as flame of fire he anger they fulfil in the beginning with a mighty hand he make the earth by counterpoise to stand never to move but to be fix still yet have no pillar but he sacred will this earth as with a veil once cover be the water overflowéd all the mass but upon he rebuke away they flee and then the hill begin to show they head the vale they hollow bosom open plain the stream run tremble down the vale again and that the earth no more might drown be he set the sea he bound of liberty and though he wave resound and beat the shore yet it be bridle by he holy lore then do the river seek they proper place and find they head they issue and they race the spring do feed the river all the way and so the tribute to the sea repay : run along through many a pleasant field much fruitfulness unto the earth they yield that know the beast and cattle feed by which for

refresh the shady tree along they bank do spring in which the bird do build and sit and sing stroke the gentle air with pleasant note plain or chirp through they warble throat the higher grounds where

conscious of man 's hatred leave they den and range abroad secure from sight of man then do the forest ring of lion roar that ask they meat of god they strength restore but when the day appear they back do fly and in they den again do lurk lie then man go forth to labor in the field whereby he grounds more rich increase may yield o lord thy providence sufficeth all thy goodness not restrained but general over thy creature the whole earth doth flow with thy great largeness pour forth here below nor be it earth alone exalt thy name but sea and stream likewise do spread the same the roll sea unto the lot do fall of beast innumerable great and small there do the stately ship plough up the flood the greater navy look like walk wood the fish there far voyage do make to diver shore they journey they do take there hast thou set the great leviathan that make the sea to seethe like boil pan : all these do ask of thee they meat to live which in due season thou to they dost give : ope thou thy hand and then they have good fare shut thou thy hand and then they trouble be all life and spirit from thy breath proceed thy word doth all thing generate and feed : if thou withdraw ` st it then they cease to be and straight return to dust and vanity but when thy breath thou dost send forth again then all thing do renew and spring amain so that the earth but lately desolate doth now return unto the former state the glorious majesty of god above shall ever reign in mercy and in love god shall rejoice all he fair work to see for as they come from he all perfect be the earth shall quake if aught he wrath provoke let he but touch the mountain they shall smoke as long as life doth last i hymn will sing with cheerful voice to the eternal king as long as i have be i will praise the work of god and all he wondrous way i know that he my word will not despise : thanksgiving be to he a sacrifice but as for sinner they shall be destroy from off the earth -- they place shall be void let all he work praise he with one accord oh praise the lord my soul praise ye the lord he hundred and forty-ninth psalm be likewise good but i have give enough of lord bacon 's verse and proceed to call up one who be a poet indeed although little known as such be a roman catholic a jesuit even and therefore in elizabeth 's reign a traitor and subject to the penalty accord robert southwell thirteen time most cruelly tortured could not be induce to confess anything not even the color of the horse whereon on a certain day he ride lest from such indication he adversary might conjecture in what house or in company of what catholic he that day be i quote these word of lord burleigh lest any of my reader discover weakness in he verse should attribute weakness to the man himself it be no doubt on political grounds that these torture and the death that follow they be inflict but it be for the truth _ as he see it _ that be for the sake of duty that southwell thus endure we must not impute all the evil of a system to every individual who hold by it it may be find that a man have for the sole sake of self-abnegation yield homage where if he object have be personal aggrandizement he might have wield authority southwell if that which come from within a man may be take as the test of he character be a devout and humble christian in the choir of we singer we only ask : dost thou lift up thine heart southwell 's song answer for he : i lift it up unto the lord he chief poem be call _ st peter 's complaint _ it be of considerable length -- a hundred and thirty-two stanza it remind we of the countess of pembroke 's poem but be far more articulate and far superior in versification perhaps its chief fault be that the pause be so measure with the line as to make every line almost a sentence the effect of which be a considerable degree of monotony like all writer of the time he be of course fond of antithesis and abound in conceit and fancy whence he attribute a multitude of expression to st peter of which never possibly could the substantial idea have enter the apostle 's mind or probably any other than southwell 's own there be also a good deal of sentimentalism in the poem a fault from which i fear modern catholic verse be rarely free probably the italian poetry with which he must have be familiar in he youth during he residence in rome accustom he to such irreverence of expression as this sentimentalism give occasion to and which be very far from indicate a correspondent state of feeling sentiment be a poor ape of love but the love be true notwithstanding here be a few stanza from _ st peter 's complaint _ : title i make untruth : be i a rock that with so soft a gale be overthrow be i fit pastor for the faithful flock to guide they soul that murder thus mine own a rock of ruin not a rest to stay a pastor -- not to feed but to betray parting from christ my fainting force decline with linger foot i follow he aloof base fear out of my heart he love unshrined huge in high word but impotent in proof my vaunt do seem hatch under samson 's lock yet woman 's word do give I murder knock \* \* \* \* \* at sorrow 's door i knock : they crave my name i answer one unworthy to be know what one say they one worthiest of blame but who a wretch not god 's nor yet he own a man oh no a beast much worse what creature a rock how call the rock of scandal peter \* \* \* \* \* christ health of fevered soul heaven of the mind force of the feeble nurse of infant love guide to the wander foot light to the blind whom weep win repentant sorrow move father in care mother in tender heart revive and save I slay with sinful dart if king manasseh sink in depth of sin with plaint and tear recover grace and crown a worthless worm some mild regard may win and lowly creep where fly throw it down a poor desire i have to mend my ill i should i would i dare not say i will i dare not say i will but wish i may my pride be check : high word the speaker spill my good o lord thy gift -- thy strength my stay -- give what thou bidst and then bid what thou wilt work with I what of I thou dost request then will i dare the worst and love the best here from another poem be two little stanza worth preserve : yet god 's must i remain by death by wrong by shame i can not blot out of my heart that grace work in he name i can not set at nought whom i have hold so dear i can not make he seem afar that be indeed so near the follow poem in style almost as simple as a ballad be at once of the quaintest and truest common mind which must always associate a certain conventional respectability with the form of religion will think it irreverent i judge its reverence profound and such none the less that it be pervade by a sweet and delicate tone of holy humor the very title have a glimmer of the glowing heart of christianity : new prince new pomp behold a silly -lrb- 69 -rrb- tender babe in freezing winter night in homely manger tremble lie alas a piteous sight the inn be full no man will yield this little pilgrim bed but force he be with silly beast in crib to shroud he head despise he not for lie there first what he be inquire : a orient pearl be often find in depth of dirty mire weigh not he crib he wooden dish nor beast that by he feed weigh not he mother 's poor attire nor joseph 's simple weed this stable be a prince 's court the crib he chair of state the beast be parcel of he pomp the wooden dish he plate the person in that poor attire he royal livery wear the prince himself be come from heaven : this pomp be praise there with joy approach o christian wight do homage to thy king and highly praise this humble pomp which he from heaven doth bring another on the same subject he call _ new heaven new war _ it be fantastic to a degree one stanza however i like much : this little babe so few day old be come to rifle satan 's fold all hell doth at he presence quake though he himself for cold do shake for in this weak unarmed wise the gate of hell he will surprise there be profoundest truth in the symbolism of this here be the latter half of a poem call _ st peter remorse _ : do mercy spin the thread to weave injustice ' loom wert then a father to conclude with dreadful judge 's doom it be a small relief to say i be thy child if as a ill-deserving foe from grace i be exile i be i have i could -- all word import want they be but dust of dead supplies where needful help be scant once to have be in bliss that hardly can return doth but bewray from whence i fall and wherefore now i mourn all thought of pass hope increase my present cross like ruin of decayed joy they still upbraid my loss o mild and mighty lord amend that be amiss my sin my sore thy love my salve thy cure my comfort be confirm thy former deed reform that be defile i be i be i will remain thy charge thy choice thy child here be some neat stanza from a poem he call content and rich my conscience be my crown contented thought my rest my heart be happy in itself my bliss be in my breast my wish be but few all easy to fulfil i make the limit of my power the bound unto my will sith sail of largest size the storm doth soonest tear i bear so small and low a sail as freeth I from fear and teach with often proof a temper calm i find to be most solace to itself best cure for angry mind no chance of fortune 's calm can cast my comfort down when fortune smile i smile to think how quickly she will frown and when in froward mood she prove a angry foe : small gain i find to let she come less loss to let she go there be just one stanza in a poem of daniel who belong by birth to this group which i should like to print by itself if it be only for the love coleridge have to the last two line of it it need little stretch of scheme to let it show itself amongst religious poem it occur in a fine epistle to the countess of cumberland daniel 's writing be full of the practical wisdom of the inner life and the stanza which i quote have a certain wordsworthian flavor about it it will not make a complete sentence but must yet stand by itself : know the heart of man be set to be the center of this world about the which these revolution of disturbance still roll where all th ' aspect of misery predominate whose strong effect be such as he must bear be powerless to redress and that unless above himself he can erect himself how poor a thing be man later in the decade come sir henry wotton it will be see that i have arrange my singer with reference to they birth not to the point of time at which this or that poem be write or publish the poetic influence which work on the shaping fantasy be chiefly feel in youth and hence the predominant mode of a poet 's utterance will be determine by what and where and amongst whom he be during that season the kind of the various poem will therefore probably fall into natural sequence rather after the date of the youth of the writer than after the year in which they be write wotton be better know in he day as a politician than as a poet and chiefly in ours as the subject of one of izaak walton 's biography something of artistic instinct rather than finish be evident in he verse here be the best and the best-known of the few poem recognize as he : the character of a happy life how happy be he bear and teach that serveth not another 's will whose armor be he honest thought and silly truth he highest skill whose passion not he master be whose soul be still prepare for death untiéd to the world with care of prince 's grace or vulgar breath who have he life from humor free whose conscience be he strong retreat whose state can neither flatterer feed nor ruin make accuser great who envieth none whom chance doth raise or vice who never understand how sword give slighter wound than praise nor rule of state but rule of good who god doth late and early pray more of he grace than gift to lend and entertain the harmless day with a well-chosen book or friend this man be free from servile band of hope to rise or fear to fall : lord of himself though not of land and have nothing yet have all some of my reader will observe that in many place i have give a reading different from that in the best-known copy of the poem i have follow a manuscript in the handwriting of ben jonson -lrb- 70 -rrb- i can not tell whether jonson have put the master 's hand to the amateur 's work but in every case i find he read the best sir john davy must have be about fifteen year younger than sir fulk grevill he be bear in 1570 be breed a barrister and rise to high position through the favor of jame i -- gain it be say by the poem which the author call _ nosce teipsum _ -lrb- 71 -rrb- but which be generally entitle _ on the immortality of the soul _ intend by _ immortality _ the spiritual nature of the soul result in continuity of existence it be a wonderful instance of what can be do for metaphysics in verse and by means of imagination or poetic embodiment generally argumentation can not of course naturally belong to the region of poetry however well it may comport itself when there naturalized and consequently although there be most poetic no less than profound passage in the treatise a light scruple arise whether its constituent matter can properly be call poetry at all event however certain of the more prosaic measure and stanza lend themselves readily and with much favor to some of the more complex of logical necessity and it must be remember that in human speech as in the human mind there be no absolute division : power shades off into feeling and the driest logic may find the heroic couplet render it good service sir john davy 's treatise be not only far more poetic in image and utterance than that of lord brooke but be far more clear in argument and firm in expression as well here be a fine invocation : o light which mak ` st the light which make the day which sett ` st the eye without and mind within lighten my spirit with one clear heavenly ray which now to view itself doth first begin \* \* \* \* \* thou like the sun dost with a equal ray into the palace and the cottage shine and show ` st the soul both to the clerk and lay _ learn and by the clear lamp of th ' oracle divine -lrb- unlearned _ he be puzzle enough to get the theology of he time into harmony with he philosophy and i can not say that he be always triumphant in the attempt but here at least be good argument in justification of the freedom of man to sin if by he word he have the current stay of adam 's will which be by nature free it have be one as if he word have say i will henceforth that man no man shall be \* \* \* \* \* for what be man without a move mind which have a judge wit and choosing will now if god 's pow ' r should she election bind she motion then would cease and stand all still \* \* \* \* \* so that if man would be unvariable he must be god or like a rock or tree for ev 'n the perfect angel be not stable but have a fall more desperate than we the poem contain much excellent argument in mental science as well as in religion and metaphysics but with that department i have nothing to do i shall now give a outlook from the highest peak of the poem -- to any who be willing to take the trouble necessary for see what another would show they the section from which i have gather the follow stanza be devote to the more immediate proof of the soul 's immortality she only end be never-ending bliss which be the eternal face of god to see who last of end and first of cause be and to do this she must eternal be again how can she but immortal be when with the motion of both will and wit she still aspireth to eternity and never rest till she attain to it water in conduit-pipe can rise no higher than the well-head from whence it first doth spring then since to eternal god she doth aspire she can not but be a eternal thing at first she mother-earth she holdeth dear and doth embrace the world and worldly thing she fly close by the ground and hover here and mount not up with she celestial wing yet under heaven she can not light on ought that with she heavenly nature doth agree she can not rest she can not fix she thought she can not in this world contented be for who do ever yet in honor wealth or pleasure of the sense contentment find whoever cease to wish when he have health or have wisdom be not vex in mind then as a bee which among weed doth fall which seem sweet flower with lustre fresh and gay -- she light on that and this and tasteth all but please with none doth rise and soar away so when the soul find here no true content and like noah 's dive can no sure footing take she doth return from whence she first be send and fly to he that first she wing do make wit seek truth from cause to cause ascend and never rest till it the first attain will seek good find many middle end but never stay till it the last do gain now god the truth and first of cause be god be the last good end which lasteth still be alpha and omega name for this : alpha to wit omega to the will since then she heavenly kind she doth display in that to god she doth directly move and on no mortal thing can make she stay she can not be from hence but from above one passage more the conclusion and practical sum up of the whole : o ignorant poor man what dost thou bear lock up within the casket of thy breast what jewel and what riches hast thou there what heavenly treasure in so weak a chest think of she worth and think that god do mean this worthy mind should worthy thing embrace : blot not she beauty with thy thought unclean nor she dishonor with thy passion base kill not she quickening power with surfeiting mar not she sense with sensuality cast not she serious wit on idle thing make not she free-will slave to vanity and when thou think ` st of she eternity think not that death against we nature be think it a birth and when thou go ` st to die sing like a swan as if thou go ` st to bliss and if thou like a child didst fear before be in the dark where thou didst nothing see now i have bring thee torch-light fear no more now when thou diest thou canst not hood-wink would be and thou my soul which turn ` st with curious eye to view the beam of thine own form divine know that thou canst know nothing perfectly while thou art cloud with this flesh of mine take heed of over-weening and compare thy peacock 's foot with thy gay peacock 's train : study the best and highest thing that be but of thyself a humble thought retain cast down thyself and only strive to raise the story of thy maker 's sacred name : use all thy power that bless power to praise which give the power to be and use the same in look back over we path from the point we have now reach the first thought that suggest itself be -- how much the reflective have supplant the emotional i do not mean for a moment that the earliest poem be without thought or that the latest be without emotion but in the former there be more of the skin as it be -- in the latter more of the bone of worship not that in the one the worship be but skin-deep or that in the other the bone be dry to look at the change a little more closely : we find in the earliest time feeling work on historic fact and on what be receive as such and the result simple aspiration after goodness the next stage be good _ doctrine _ -- i use the word as st paul use it for instruction in righteousness -- chiefly by means of allegory all attempt at analysis be make through personification of quality here the general form be frequently more poetic than the matter after this we have a period principally of imitation sometimes good sometimes indifferent next with the reformation and the revival of literature together come more of art and more of philosophy to the detriment of the lyrical expression people can not think and sing : they can only feel and sing but the philosophy go farther in this direction even to the put in abeyance of that from which song take its rise -- namely feel itself as to the former amongst the verse of the period i have give there be hardly anything to be call song but sir philip sidney 's psalm and for they we be more indebted to king david than to sir philip as to the latter even in the case of that most mournful poem of the countess of pembroke it be to quite a unhealthy degree occupy with the attempt to work upon she own feeling by the contemplation of they instead of with the utterance of those arouse by the contemplation of truth in she case the metaphysics have begin to prey upon and consume the emotion besides that age be essentially a dramatic age as even its command of language especially as show in the prank it play with it would almost indicate and the dramatic impulse be less favourable though not at all oppose to lyrical utterance in the case of sir fulk grevill and sir john davy the feeling be assuredly profound but in form and expression the philosophy have quite the upper hand we must not therefore suppose however that the cause of religious poetry have be a lose one the last wave must sink that the next may rise and the whole tide flow shoreward the man must awake through all he soul all he strength all he mind that he may worship god in unity in the one harmonious utterance of he be : he heart must be unite to fear he name and for this final perfection of the individual the race must awake at this season and that season this power or that power must be chiefly develop in she elect and for its sake the growth of other must for a season be delay but the next generation will inherit all that have go before and its elect if they be themselves pure in heart and individual that be original in mind will more or less thoroughly embody the result in subservience to some new development essential in its turn to further progress even the fallow time which we be so ready to call barren must have they share in work the one needful work they may be to the nation that which sickness so often be to the man -- a time of refresh from the lord a nation 's life do not lie in its utterance any more than in the thing which it possess : it lie in its action the utterance be a result and therefore a sign of life but there may be life without any _ such _ sign to do justice to love mercy to walk humbly with god be the highest life of a nation as of a individual and when the time for speech come it will be such life alone that cause the speech to be strong at once and harmonious when at last there be not ten righteous man in sodom sodom can neither think act nor say and she destruction be at hand while the wave of the dramatic be sink the wave of the lyric be grow in force and rise in height especially as regard religious poetry we be as yet only approach the lyrical jubilee fact and faith self-consciousness and metaphysics all be needful to the lyric of love modesty and art find they grandest simplest labor in rightly subordinate each of those to the other how could we have a george herbert without metaphysics in those poem i have just give the way of metaphysics be prepare for he that which overcolor one age to the injury of its harmony will in the next or the next fall into its own place in the seven-chorded rainbow of truth chapter vii dr donne we now come to dr john donne a man of justly great respect and authority who bear in the year 1573 the fifteenth of queen elizabeth die dean of st paul 's in the year 1636 but although even ben jonson address he as the delight of phoebus and each muse we be too far beyond the power of he social presence and the influence of he public utterance to feel that admiration of he poem which be so largely express during he lifetime of many of those that be write in he youth izaak walton say dr donne wish that he own eye have witness they funeral faulty as they be however they be not the less the work of a great and earnest man breed to the law but never have practice it he lose he secretaryship to the lord chancellor ellesmere through the revenge of sir george more whose daughter donne have marry in secret because of she father 's opposition dependent thereafter for year on the generous kindness of unrelated friend he yet for conscience ' sake refuse to take order when a good living be offer he and it be only after prolonged thought that he yield to the importunity of king jame who be so convinced of he surpass fitness for the church that he would speed he towards no other goal when at length he dare hope that god might have call he to the high office never man give himself to its duty with more of whole-heartedness and devotion and none have prove themselves more clean of the sacrilege of serve at the altar for the sake of the thing offer thereon he be represent by dr johnson as one of the chief example of that school of poet call by himself the _ metaphysical _ a epithet which as a definition be almost false true it be that donne and he follower be always ready to deal with metaphysical subject but it be from they mode and not they subject that dr johnson class they what this mode be we shall see presently for i shall be justify in set forth its strangeness even absurdity by the fact that dr donne be the dear friend of george herbert and have much to do with the formation of he poetic habit just twenty year older than herbert and the value and intimate friend of he mother donne be in precisely that relation of age and circumstance to influence the other in the highest degree the central thought of dr donne be nearly sure to be just : the subordinate thought by means of which he unfold it be often grotesque and so wildly associate as to remind one of the lawlessness of a dream wherein mere suggestion without choice or fitness rule the sequence as some of the writer of whom i have last speak would play with word dr donne would sport with idea and with the visual image or embodiment of they certainly in he case much knowledge reveal itself in the association of he idea and great facility in the management and utterance of they true likewise he say nothing unrelated to the main idea of the poem but not the less certainly do the whole resemble the speech of a child of active imagination to whom judgment as to the character of he suggestion be impossible he taste be equally gratified with a lovely image and a brilliant absurdity : a butterfly and a shine potsherd be to he similarly desirable whatever wild thing start from the thicket of think all be worthy game to the hunting intellect of dr donne and be follow without question of tone keep or harmony in he play with word sir philip sidney keep good heed that even that should serve the end in view in he play with idea dr john donne so far from serve the end sometimes obscure it almost hopelessly : the hart escape while he follow the squirrel and weasel and bat it be not surprising that they author be so inartistic with regard to they object he verse themselves should be harsh and unmusical beyond the worst that one would imagine fit to be call verse he enjoy the unenviable distinction of have no rival in ruggedness of metric movement and associate sound this be clearly the result of indifference a indifference however which grow very strange to we when we find that he _ can _ write a lovely verse and even a exquisite stanza greatly for its own sake partly for the sake of illustration i quote a poem contain at once he best and he worst the result be such a incongruity that we wonder whether it might not be call he best _ and _ he worst because we can not determine which he call it _ hymn to god my god in my sickness _ the first stanza be worthy of george herbert in he best mood since i be come to that holy room where with the choir of saint for evermore i shall be make thy music as i come i tune the instrument here at the door and what i must do then think here before to recognize its beauty leave aside the depth and truth of the phrase where i shall be make thy music we must recall the custom of those day to send out for a noise of musician hence he imagine that he have be summon as one of a band already go in to play before the king of the high country : he be now at the door where he be listen to catch the tone that he may have he instrument tune and ready before he enter but with what a jar the next stanza break on heart mind and ear whilst my physician by they love be grow cosmographer and i -lrb- 72 -rrb- they map who lie flat on this bed that by they may be show that this be my south-west discovery _ per fretum febri _ -- by these strait to die -- here in the midst of compare himself to a map and he physician to cosmographer consult the map he change without warn into a navigator whom they be try to follow upon the map as he pass through certain strait -- namely those of the fever -- towards he south-west discovery death grotesque as this be the absurdity deepen in the end of the next stanza by a return to the former idea he be alternately a map and a man sailing on the map of himself but the first half of the stanza be lovely : my reader must remember that the region of the west be at that time the land of promise to england i joy that in these strait i see my west for though those current yield return to none what shall my west hurt I as west and east in all flat map -lrb- and i be one -rrb- be one so death doth touch the resurrection it be hardly worth while except for the strangeness of the phenomenon to spend any time in elucidate this once more a map he be that of the two hemisphere in which the east of the one touch the west of the other could anything be much more unmusical than the line in all flat map -lrb- and i be one -rrb- be one but the next stanza be worse be the pacific sea my home or be the eastern riches be jerusalem anvan and magellan and gibraltar all strait and none but strait be way to they whether where japhet dwelt or cham or sem the meaning of the stanza be this : there be no earthly home : all these place be only strait that lead home just as they themselves can not be reach but through strait let my reader now forget all but the first stanza and take it along with the follow the last two : we think that paradise and calvary christ 's cross and adam 's tree stand in one place : look lord and find both adam meet in I as the first adam 's sweat surround my face may the last adam 's blood my soul embrace so in he purple wrap receive I lord by these he thorn give I he other crown and as to other ' soul i preach thy word be this my text my sermon to mine own : _ therefore that he may raise the lord throw down _ surely these be very fine especially the middle verse of the former and the first verse of the latter stanza the three stanza together make we lovingly regret that dr donne should have ride he pegasus over quarry and housetop instead of teach he he pace the next i quote be artistic throughout perhaps the fact of which we be inform by izaak walton that he cause it to be set to a grave and solemn tune and to be often sing to the organ by the chorister of st paul 's church in he own hearing especially at the evening service may have something to do with its degree of perfection there be no sign of he usual haste about it it be even elaborately rhyme after norman fashion the rhyme in each stanza be consonant with the rhyme in every stanza a hymn to god the father wilt thou forgive that sin where i begin which be my sin though it be do before -lrb- 73 -rrb- wilt thou forgive that sin through which i run -lrb- 74 -rrb- and do run still though still i do deplore -- when thou hast do thou hast not do for i have more wilt thou forgive that sin which i have win other to sin and make my sin they door -lrb- 75 -rrb- wilt thou forgive that sin which i do shun a year or two but wallow in a score -- when thou hast do thou hast not do for i have more i have a sin of fear that when i have spin my last thread i shall perish on the shore but swear by thyself that at my death thy son shall shine as he shine now and heretofore and have do that thou hast do : i fear no more in those day even a pun might be a serious thing : witness the play in the last stanza on the word _ son _ and _ sun _ -- not a mere pun for the son of the father be the sun of righteousness : he be life _ and _ light what the doctor himself say concern the hymn appear to I not only interesting but of practical value he do occasionally say to a friend ` the word of this hymn have restore to I the same thought of joy that possess my soul in my sickness when i compose it ' what a help it would be to many if in they more gloomy time they would but recall the vision of truth they have and be assure of in better moment here be a somewhat strange hymn which yet possess rightly understand a real grandeur : a hymn to christ _ at the author 's last go into germany _ -lrb- 76 -rrb- in what tear ship soever i embark that ship shall be my emblem of thy ark what sea soever swallow I that flood shall be to I a emblem of thy blood though thou with cloud of anger do disguise thy face yet through that mask i know those eye which though they turn away sometimes -- they never will despise i sacrifice this island unto thee and all whom i love here and who love I : when i have put this flood ` twixt they and I put thou thy blood betwixt my sin and thee as the tree 's sap doth seek the root below in winter in my winter -lrb- 77 -rrb- now i go where none but thee the eternal root of true love i may know nor thou nor thy religion dost control the amorousness of a harmonious soul but thou wouldst have that love thyself : as thou art jealous lord so i be jealous now thou lov ` st not till from love more thou free my soul : who ever give take liberty : oh if thou car ` st not whom i love alas thou lov ` st not I seal then this bill of my divorce to all on whom those fainter beam of love do fall marry those love which in youth scatter be on face wit hope -lrb- false mistress -rrb- to thee church be best for prayer that have least light : to see god only i go out of sight and to ` scape stormy day i choose a everlasting night to do justice to this poem the reader must take some trouble to enter into the poet 's mood it be in a measure distressing that while i grant with all my heart the claim of he muse 's white sincerity the taste in -- i do not say _ of _ -- some of he best poem should be such that i will not present they out of twenty-three _ holy sonnet _ every one of which i should almost say possess something remarkable i choose three rhyme after the true petrarchian fashion they rhythm be often as bad as it can be to be call rhythm at all yet these be very fine thou hast make I and shall thy work decay repair I now for now mine end doth haste i run to death and death meet I as fast and all my pleasure be like yesterday i dare not move my dim eye any way despair behind and death before doth cast such terror and my feeble flesh doth waste by sin in it which it towards hell doth weigh only they art above and when towards thee by thy leave i can look i rise again but we old subtle foe so tempteth I that not one hour myself i can sustain : thy grace may wing I to prevent he art and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart if faithful soul be alike glorified as angel then my father 's soul doth see and add this even to full felicity that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride : but if we mind to these soul be descry by circumstance and by sign that be apparent in we -- not immediately -lrb- 78 -rrb- -- how shall my mind 's white truth by they be try they see idolatrous lover weep and mourn and style blasphemous conjuror to call on jesu 's name and pharisaical dissembler feign devotiön then turn o pensive soul to god for he know best thy grief for he put it into my breast death be not proud though some have calléd thee mighty and dreadful for thou art not so for those whom thou think ` st thou dost overthrow die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill I from rest and sleep which but thy picture be much pleasure then from thee much more must flow and soonest -lrb- 79 -rrb- we best man with thee do go rest of they bone and soul 's delivery thou ` rt slave to fate chance king and desperate man and dost with poison war and sickness dwell and poppy or charm can make we sleep as well and better than thy stroke why swell ` st -lrb- 80 -rrb- thou then one short sleep past we wake eternally and death shall be no more : death thou shalt die in a poem call _ the cross _ full of fantastic conceit we find the follow remarkable line embody the profoundest truth as perchance carver do not face make but that away which hide they there do take : let cross so take what hide christ in thee and be he image or not he but he one more and we shall take we leave of dr donne it be call a fragment but it seem to I complete it will serve as a specimen of he best and at the same time of he most characteristic mode of present fine thought grotesquely attire resurrection sleep sleep old sun thou canst not have re-past -lrb- 81 -rrb- as yet the wound

intend here be a substance whose touch would turn the basest metal into gold through he poem be scatter many fine passage but not even he large influence on the better poet who follow be sufficient to justify we listen to he longer now chapter viii bishop hall and george sandys joseph hall bear in 1574 a year after dr donne bishop first of exeter next of norwich be best know by he satire it be not

the nature of they adopt mode we can not look for much poetry of a devotional kind from the dramatist that mode admit of no utterance personal to the author and require the scope of a play to bring out the intended truth it be no wonder that even in the drama of shakspere profound as be the teaching they contain we should find nothing immediately suitable to we purpose while neither have he leave anything in other form approach in kind what we seek ben jonson however bear in 1574 who may be regard as the sole representative of learn in the class have leave amongst a large number of small piece three _ poem of devotion _ whose merit may not indeed be great but whose feeling be i think genuine whatever be he fault and they be not few hypocrisy be not one of they he nature be fierce and honest he might boast but he could not pretend he oscillation between the reform and the romish church can hardly have have other cause than a vacillate conviction it could not have serve any

formal and artificial no doubt rugged at the same time like he who write they when a man would utter that concern which he have only feel not think he can express himself only in the form he have be teach conventional or traditional let he power be ever so much develop in respect of other thing here where he have not meditate he must understand as a child think as a child speak as a child he can as yet generate no sufficing or worthy form natural to himself but the utterance be not therefore untrue there be no professional bias to cause the stream of ben jonson 's verse to flow in that channel indeed feel without thought and the consequent combination of impulse to speak with lack of matter be the cause of much of that common-place utterance concern thing of religion which be so wearisome but which therefore it be not always fair to despise as cant about the same age as ben jonson though the date of he birth be unknown i now come to mention thoma heywood a most voluminous writer of play who write also a book chiefly in verse call _ the hierarchy of the bless angel _ a strange work in which amongst much that be far from poetic occur the follow remarkable metaphysico-religious verse he have strong platonic tendency interesting himself chiefly however in those question afterwards pursue by dr henry more concern witch and such like subject which may be call the shadow of platonism i have wander like a sheep that be lose to find thee out in every coast : _ without _ i have long seek bin _ be _ whilst thou the while abid ` st _ within _ through every

smell none such i relish say my taste and therefore I he never pass my feeling tell I that none such there enter for he none do touch resolve by they how should i be since none of all these be in thee in thee my god thou hast no hue that man 's frail optic sense can view no sound the ear hear odour none the smell attract all taste be go at thy appearance where doth fail a body how can touch prevail what even the brute beast comprehend -- to think thee such i should offend yet when i seek my god i enquire for light than sun and moon much higher more clear and splendrous ` bove all light which the

be there even those who can not enter into the philosophy of they which rank he among the mystic of whom i have yet to speak will understand a good deal of it symbolically : for how could he be expect to keep he poetry and he philosophy distinct when of themselves they be so ready to run into one or in verse to define carefully betwixt degree and kind when kind themselves may rise by degree to distinguish without separate to be able to see that what in they effect upon we be quite different may yet be a grand flight of ascend step to stop -- no record have tell where belong to the philosopher who be not bear mutilate but be a poet as well john fletcher likewise a dramatist the author of the follow poem be two year younger than ben jonson it be so far as i be aware the sole non-dramatic voice he have leave behind he its opening be a indignant apostrophe to certain man of pretended science who in he time be much consult -- the astrologer upon a honest man 's fortune you

not religious but they express a true philosophy and a triumph of faith in god the word _ honest _ be here equivalent to _ true _ i be not certain whether i may not now be call up a singer whose song will appear hardly to justify he presence in the choir but its teaching be of high import namely of content and cheerfulness and courage and be both worthy and melodious it gravitate heavenward the singer be yet another dramatist : i presume he to be thomas dekker i can not be certain because other be concern with he in the writing of the drama from which i take it he it be who in a often-quoted passage style we lord the first true gentleman that ever breathe just as chaucer in a poem i have give call he the first stock-father of gentleness we may call the little lyric a song of labor art

x sir john beaumont and drummond of hawthornden sir john beaumont bear in 1582 elder brother to the dramatist who write along with fletcher have leave amongst he poem a few fine religious one from they i choose the following : of the epiphany fair eastern star that art ordain to run before the sage to the rise sun here cease thy course and wonder that the cloud of this poor stable can thy maker shroud : ye heavenly body glory to be bright and be esteem as ye be rich in light but here on earth be teach a different way since under this low roof the highest lay jerusalem erect she stately tower display she window and adorn she bower yet there thou must not cast a tremble spark : let herod 's palace still continue dark each school and synagogue thy force repel there pride enthrone in misty error dwell the temple where the priest maintain they choir shall taste no beam of thy celestial fire while this weak cottage all thy splendor take : a joyful gate of every chink it make here shine no golden roof no ivory stair no king exalt in a stately chair girt with attendant or by herald style but straw and hay enwrap a speechless child yet sabae 's lord before this babe unfold they treasure offer incense myrrh and gold the crib become a altar : therefore die no ox nor sheep for in they fodder lie the prince of peace who thankful for he bed destroy those rite in which they blood be shed : the quintessence of earth he take and -lrb- 87 -rrb- fee and precious gum distil from weep tree rich metal and sweet odour now declare the glorious blessing which he law prepare to clear we from the base and loathsome flood of sense and make we fit for angel ' food who lift to god for we the holy smoke of fervent prayer with which we he invoke and try we action in that search fire by which the seraphim we lip inspire : no muddy dross pure mineral shall infect we shall exhale we vapor up direct : no storm shall cross nor glittering light deface perpetual sigh which seek a happy place the creature no longer offer on he altar stand around the prince of life to whom they have give a bed be a lovely idea the end be hardly worthy of the rest though there be fine thought involve in it the follow contain a utterance of personal experience the truth of which will be recognize by all to whom heavenly aspiration and needful disappointment be not unknown in desolation o thou who sweetly bend ` st my stubborn will who send ` st thy stripe to teach and not to kill thy cheerful face from I no longer hide withdraw these cloud the scourge of my pride i sink to hell if i be lower throw : i see what man be be leave alone my substance which from nothing do begin be worse than nothing by the weight of sin : i see myself in such a wretched state as neither thought conceive nor word relate how great a distance part we for in thee be endless good and boundless ill in I all creature prove I abject but how low thou only know ` st and teachest I to know to paint this baseness nature be too base this darkness yield not but to beam of grace where shall i then this pierce splendor find or find how shall it guide I be blind grace be a taste of bliss a glorious gift which can the soul to heavenly comfort lift : it will not shine to I whose mind be drown in sorrow and with worldly trouble bind it will not deign within that house to dwell where dryness reign and proud distraction swell perhaps it seek I in those lightsome day of my first fervor when few wind do raise the wave and ere they could full strength obtain some whispering gale straight charm they down again when all seem calm and yet the virgin 's child on my devotions in he manger smile while then i simply walk nor heed could take of complacence that sly deceitful snake when yet i have not dangerously refuse so many call to virtue nor abused the spring of life which i so oft enjoy nor make so many good intention void deserving thus that grace should quite depart and dreadful hardness should possess my heart : yet in that state this only good i find that fewer spot do then my conscience wound though who can censure whether in those time _ judg _ the want of feeling seem the want of crime if solid virtue dwell not but in pain i will not wish that golden age again because it flow with sensible delight of heavenly thing : god have create night as well as day to deck the varied globe grace come as oft clothe in the dusky robe of desolation as in white attire which better fit the bright celestial choir some in foul season perish through despair but more through boldness when the day be fair this then must be the medicine for my woe -- to yield to what my savior shall dispose to glory in my baseness to rejoice in mine affliction to obey he voice as well when threatening my defect reprove as when i cherish be with word of love to say to he in every time and place withdraw thy comfort so thou leave thy grace surely this be as genuine a utterance whatever its merit as a poem -- and those i judge not small -- as ever flow from christian heart chiefly for the sake of its beauty i give the last passage of a poem write upon occasion of the feast of the annunciation and the resurrection fall on the same day let faithful soul this double feast attend in two procession let the first descend the temple 's stair and with a downcast eye upon the lowest pavement prostrate lie : in creep violet white lily shine they humble thought and every pure design the other troop shall climb with sacred heat the rich degree of solomon 's bright seat : _ step _ in glowing rose fervent zeal they bear and in the azure flower-de-li appear celestial contemplation which aspire above the sky up to the immortal choir william drummond of hawthornden a scotchman bear in 1585 may almost be look upon as the harbinger of a fresh outburst of word-music no doubt all the great poet have now and then broken forth in lyrical jubilation ponderous ben jonson himself when he take to song will sing in the joy of the very sound but great man have always so much graver work to do that they comparatively seldom indulge in this kind of melody drummond excel in madrigal or canzonet -- baby-ode or song -- which have more of wing and less of thought than sonnet through the greater part of he verse we hear a certain muffle tone of the sweetest like the music that ever threaten to break out clear from the brook from the pine from the rain-shower -- never do break out clear but remain a suggest etherially vanish tone he be a _ voix voilée _ or veil voice of song it be true that in the time we be now approach far more attention be pay not merely to the smoothness but to the melody of verse than any except the great master have pay before but some be at the door who not be great master yet do they inferior part nearly as well as they they higher utter a music of marvellous and individual sweetness which no mere musical care could secure but which spring essentially from music in the thought gathering to itself musical word in melodious division and thus fashion for itself a fitting body the melody of they verse be all they own -- as original as the greatest art-form of the master of drummond then here be two sonnet on the nativity the first speak by the angel the second by the shepherd _ the angel _ run shepherd run where bethlehem blest appear we bring the best of news be not dismayed : a savior there be bear more old than year amidst heaven 's roll height this earth who stay in a poor cottage inn a virgin maid a weakling do he bear who all upbear there be he poorly swaddle in manger lay to whom too narrow swaddling be we sphere : run shepherd run and solemnize he birth this be that night -- no day grow great with bliss in which the power of satan break be : in heaven be glory peace unto the earth thus sing through the air the angel swim and cope of star re-echoëd the same _ the shepherd _ o than the fairest day thrice fairer night night to best day in which a sun doth rise of which that golden eye which clear the sky be but a sparkling ray a shadow-light and bless ye in silly pastor ' sight _ simple _ mild creature in whose warm -lrb- 88 -rrb- crib now lie that heaven-sent youngling holy-maid-born wight midst end beginning of we prophecy blest cottage that have flower in winter spread though wither -- bless grass that have the grace to deck and be a carpet to that place thus sing unto the sound of oaten reed before the babe the shepherd bow on knee and spring run nectar honey drop from tree no doubt there be a touch of the conventional in these especially in the close of the last there be a attempt to glorify the true by the homage of the false but verse which make we feel the marvel afresh -- the marvel visible and credible by the depth of its heart of glory -- make we at the same time easily forget the discord in themselves the follow not a sonnet although it look like one measure the lawful fourteen line be the closing paragraph of a poem he call _ a hymn to the fairest fair _ o king whose greatness none can comprehend whose boundless goodness doth to all extend light of all beauty ocean without ground that stand flowest give dost abound rich palace and indweller ever blest never not work ever yet in rest what wit can not conceive word say of thee here where as in a mirror we but see shadow of shadow atom of thy might still owly-eyed while stare on thy light grant that release from this earthly jail and free of cloud which here we knowledge veil in heaven 's high temple where thy praise ring i may in sweeter note hear angel sing that be may i in heaven hear angel sing what wit can not conceive here drummond excel in nobility of speech and especially in the fine line and phrase so justly but disproportionately prize in the present day i give a instance of each : here do seraph burn with immortal love there cherubim _ with other noble people of the light _ as eaglet in the sun delight they sight \* \* \* \* \* like to a lightning through the welkin hurl _ that score with flame the way _ and every eye with terror dazzle as it swimmeth by here be six fine verse in the heroic couplet from _ a hymn of the resurrection _ so a small seed that in the earth lie hide and die -- revive burst she cloddy side adorn with yellow lock of new be bear and doth become a mother great with corn of grain bring hundred with it which when old enrich the furrow with a sea of gold but i must content myself now with a little madrigal the only one fit for my purpose those which would best support what i have say of he music be not of the kind we want unfortunately the end of this one be not equal to the beginning change should breed change new doth the sun appear the mountain ' snow decay crown with frail flower come forth the baby year my soul time post away and thou yet in that frost which flower and fruit have lose as if all here immortal be dost stay for shame thy power awake look to that heaven which never night make black and there at that immortal sun 's bright ray deck thee with flower which fear not rage of day chapter xi the brother fletcher i now come to make mention of two gifted brother gile and phinea fletcher both clergymen the son of a clergyman and nephew to the bishop of bristol therefore the cousin of fletcher the dramatist a poem by whom i have already give gile the eldest be suppose to have be bear in 1588 from he poem _ christ 's victory and triumph _ i select three passage to understand the first it be necessary to explain that while christ be on earth a dispute between justice and mercy such as be often represent by the theologian take place in heaven we must allow the unsuitable fiction attribute distraction to the divine unity for the sake of the word in which mercy overthrow the argument of justice for the poet unintentionally nullify the symbolism of the theologian represent justice as defeat he forget that the grandest exercise of justice be mercy the confusion come from the fancy that justice mean _ vengeance upon sin _ and not _ the do of what be right _ justice can be at no strife with mercy for not to do what be just would be most unmerciful mercy first sum up the argument justice have be employ against she in the follow stanza : he be but dust why fear he not to fall and be fall how can he hope to live can not the hand destroy he that make all could he not take away as well as give should man deprave and should not god deprive be it not all the world 's deceive spirit -lrb- that bladder up with pride of he own merit fall in he rise -rrb- that he of heaven do disinherit to these she then proceed to make reply : he be but dust : how could he stand before he and be fall why should he fear to die can not the hand that make he first restore he deprave of sin should he deprivéd lie of grace can he not find infirmity that give he strength -- unworthy the forsake he be whoever weigh -lrb- without mistake -rrb- or maker of the man or manner of he making -lrb- 89 -rrb- who shall thy temple incense any more or to thy altar crown the sacrifice or strew with idle flower the hallowed floor or what should prayer deck with herb and spice _ why _ she vial breathe orison of price if all must pay that which all can not pay o first begin with I and mercy slay and thy thrice honor son that now beneath doth stray but if or he or i may live and speak and heaven can joy to see a sinner weep oh let not justice ' iron sceptre break a heart already break that low doth creep and with prone humbless she foot 's dust doth sweep must all go by desert be nothing free ah if but those that only worthy be none should thee ever see none should thee ever see what have man do that man shall not undo since god to he be grow so near akin do he foe slay he he shall slay he foe have he lose all he all again shall win be sin he master he shall master sin too hardy soul with sin the field to try the only way to conquer be to fly but thus long death have live and now death 's self shall die he be a path if any be mislead he be a robe if any naked be if any chance to hunger he be bread if any be a bondman he be free if any be but weak how strong be he to dead man life he be to sick man health to blind man sight and to the needy wealth a pleasure without loss a treasure without stealth who can forget -- never to be forget -- the time that all the world in slumber lie when like the star the singing angel shoot to earth and heaven awakéd all he eye to see another sun at midnight rise on earth be never sight of peril fame _ pareil : equal _ for god before man like himself do frame but god himself now like a mortal man become \* \* \* \* \* the angel carol loud they song of peace the cursed oracle be stricken dumb to see they shepherd the poor shepherd press to see they king the kingly sophy come and they to guide unto he master 's home a star come dance up the orient that spring for joy over the strawy tent where gold to make they prince a crown they all present no doubt there be here touch of execrable taste such as the punning trick with _ man _ and _ manners _ suggest a false antithesis or the opposition of the word _ deprave _ and _ deprive _ but we have in they only a instance of how the meretricious may co-exist with the lovely the passage be fine and powerful notwithstanding its fault and obscurity here be another yet more beautiful : so down the silver stream of eridan -lrb- 90 -rrb- on either side bank with a lily wall whiter than both ride the triumphant swan and sing he dirge and prophesy he fall diving into he watery funeral but eridan to cedron must submit he flowery shore nor can he envy it if when apollo sing he swan do silent sit -lrb- 91 -rrb- that heavenly voice i more delight to hear than gentle air to breathe or swell wave against the sound rock they bosom tear -lrb- 92 -rrb- or whistle reed that rutty -lrb- 93 -rrb- jordan lave and with they verdure he white head embrave _ adorn _ to chide the wind or hive bee that fly about the laughing blossom -lrb- 94 -rrb- of sallowy -lrb- 95 -rrb- rock asleep the idle groom -lrb- 96 -rrb- that lazy lie and yet how can i hear thee sing go when man incense with hate thy death foreset or else why do i hear thee sigh so when thou inflamed with love they life dost get -lrb- 97 -rrb- that love and hate and sigh and song be meet but thus and only thus thy love do crave to send thee singing for we to thy grave while we seek thee to kill and thou seek ` st we to save when i remember christ we burden bear i look for glory but find misery i look for joy but find a sea of tear i look that we should live and find he die i look for angel ' song and hear he cry : thus what i look i can not find so well or rather what i find i can not tell these bank so narrow be those stream so highly swell we would gladly eliminate the few common-place allusion but we must take they with the rest of the passage besides far higher merit it be to my ear most melodious one more passage of two stanza from gile fletcher concern the glory of heaven : i quote they for the sake of earth not of heaven gaze but upon the house where man embower : with flower and rush pavéd be he way where all the creature be he servitor : the wind do sweep he chamber every day and cloud do wash he room the ceiling gay starréd aloft the gilded knob embrave : if such a house god to another give how shine those glitter court he for himself will have and if a sullen cloud as sad as night in which the sun may seem embodiéd depured of all he dross we see so white burning in melted gold he watery head or round with ivory edge silver what lustre super-excellent will he lighten on those that shall he sunshine see in that all-glorious court in which all glory be these brother be intense admirer of spenser to be like he phinea must write a allegory and such a allegory of all the strange poem in existence surely this be the strangest the _ purple island _ be man whose body be anatomically describe after the allegory of a city which be then people with all the human faculty personify each set in motion by itself they say the anatomy be correct : the metaphysics be certainly good the action of the poem be just another form of the _ holy war _ of john bunyan -- all the good and bad power fight for the possession of the purple island what render the conception yet more amazing be the fact that the whole ponderous mass of anatomy and metaphysics nearly as long as the _ paradise lose _ be put as a song in a succession of twelve canto in the mouth of a shepherd who begin a canto every morning to the shepherd and shepherdess of the neighborhood and finish it by folding-time in the evening and yet the poem be full of poetry he triumph over he difficulty partly by audacity partly by seriousness partly by the enchantment of song but the poem will never be read through except by student of english literature it be a whole its member be well-fitted it be full of beauty -- in part they swarm like fire-fly and _ yet _ it be not a good poem it be like a well-shaped house build of mud and stick full of precious stone i do not care in my limited space to quote from it never be there a more incongruous dragon of allegory both brother be injure not by they worship of spenser but by the form that worship take -- imitation they seem more pleased to produce a line or stanza that shall recall a line or stanza of spenser than to produce a fine original of they own they even copy line almost word for word from they great master this be pure homage : it be they delight that such adaptation should be recognize -- just as it be spenser 's hope when he insert translate stanza from tasso 's _ jerusalem deliver _ in _ the fairy queen _ to gain the honor of a true reproduction yet strange fate for imitator both but gile especially be imitate by a greater than they worship -- even by milton they make spenser 's worse milton make theirs better they imitate spenser fault and all milton glorify they beauty from the smaller poem of phinea i choose the follow version of psalm cxxx from the deep of grief and fear o lord to thee my soul repair : from thy heaven bow down thine ear let thy mercy meet my prayer oh if thou mark ` st what be do amiss what soul so pure can see thy bliss but with thee sweet mercy stand seal pardon work fear wait my soul wait on he hand wait mine eye oh wait mine ear : if he he eye or tongue afford watch all he look catch all he word as a watchman wait for day and look for light and look again : when the night grow old and gray to be relieve he call amain : so look so wait so long mine eye to see my lord my sun arise wait ye saint wait on we lord for from he tongue sweet mercy flow wait on he cross wait on he word upon that tree redemption grow : he will redeem he israel from sin and wrath from death and hell i shall now give two stanza of he version of the 127th psalm if god build not the house and lay the groundwork sure -- whoever build it can not stand one stormy day if god be not the city 's shield if he be not they bar and wall in vain be watch-tower man and all though then thou wak ` st when other rest though rise thou prevent ` st the sun though with lean care thou daily feast thy labor 's lose and thou undo but god he child will feed and keep and draw the curtain to he sleep compare this with a version of the same portion by dr henry king bishop of chichester who no great poet have write some good verse he be about the same age as phinea fletcher except the lord the house sustain the builder 's labor be in vain except the city he defend and to the dweller safety send in vain be sentinel prepared or arméd watchman for the guard you vainly with the early light arise or sit up late at night to find support and daily eat you bread with sorrow earn and sweat when god who he beloved keep this plenty give with quiet sleep what difference do we find that the former have the more poetic touch the latter the greater truth the former have just lose the one precious thing in the psalm the latter have keep it : that care be as useless as painful for god give we while we sleep and not while we labor chapter xii wither herrick and quarle george wither bear in 1588 therefore about the same age as gile fletcher be a very different sort of writer indeed there could hardly be a greater contrast fancy and all she motley train be scarcely know to wither save by the hearing of the ear he become a eager puritan towards the close of he life but he poetry chiefly belong to the earlier part of it throughout it be distinguish by a certain straightforward simplicity of good english thought and english word he hymn remind I in the form of they speech of gascoigne i shall quote but little for although there be a sweet calm and a great justice of reflection and feeling there be hardly anything of that warm glow that rouse force that impressive weight in he verse which be the chief virtue of the lofty rhyme the best in a volume of ninety _ hymn and song of the church _ be i think _ the author 's hymn _ at the close of which i give three stanza they manifest the simplicity and truth of the man reflect in they very tone he faithful contented trustful nature by thy grace those passion trouble and those want that I opprest have appear as water-bubble or as dream and thing in jest : for thy leisure still attend i with pleasure see they end those affliction and those terror which to other grim appear do but show I where my error and my imperfection be but distrustful could not make I of thy love nor fright nor shake I those base hope that would possess I and those thought of vain repute which do now and then oppress I do not lord to I impute and though part they will not from I let they never overcome I he have write another similar volume but much larger and of a somewhat extraordinary character it consist of no fewer than two hundred and thirty-three hymn mostly long upon a incredible variety of subject comprehend one for every season of nature and of the church and one for every occurrence in life of which the author could think as likely to confront man or woman of these subject i quote a few of the more remarkable but even from they my reader can have little conception of the variety in the book : _ a hymn whilst we be wash _ _ in a clear starry night _ _ a hymn for a house-warming _ _ after a great frost or snow _ _ for one whose beauty be much praise _ _ for one upbraid with deformity _ _ for a widower or a widow deliver from a troublesome yokefellow _ _ for a cripple _ _ for a jailor _ _ for a poet _ here be a portion of one which i hope may be helpful to some of my reader when we can not sleep what ail my heart that in my breast it thus unquiet lie and that it now of needful rest deprive my tiréd eye let not vain hope grief doubt or fear distemper so my mind but cast on god thy thoughtful care and comfort thou shalt find in vain that soul attempteth ought and spend she thought in vain who by or in herself have seek desiréd peace to gain on thee o lord on thee therefore my musing now i place thy free remission i implore and thy refreshing grace forgive thou I that when my mind oppressed begin to be i seek elsewhere my peace to find before i come to thee and gracious god vouchsafe to grant unworthy though i be the needful rest which now i want that i may praise thy name before examine the volume one would say that no man could write so many hymn without frequent and signal failure but the marvel here be that the hymn be all so very far from bad he can never have write in other than a gentle mood there must have be a fine harmony in he nature that _ keep _ he as it be this peacefulness make he interesting in spite of he comparative flatness i must restrain remark however and give five out of twelve stanza of another of he hymn a rock hymn sweet baby sleep what ail my dear what ail my darling thus to cry be still my child and lend thine ear to hear I sing thy lullaby my pretty lamb forbear to weep be still my dear sweet baby sleep whilst thus thy lullaby i sing for thee great blessing ripen be thine eldest brother be a king and have a kingdom buy for thee sweet baby then forbear to weep be still my babe sweet baby sleep a little infant once be he and strength in weakness then be lay upon he virgin mother 's knee that power to thee might be convey sweet baby then forbear to weep be still my babe sweet baby sleep within a manger lodge thy lord where oxen lay and ass feed warm room we do to thee afford a easy cradle or a bed sweet baby then forbear to weep be still my babe sweet baby sleep thou hast yet more to perfect this a promise and a earnest get of gain everlasting bliss though thou my babe perceiv ` st it not sweet baby then forbear to weep be still my babe sweet baby sleep i think george wither 's verse will grow upon the reader of they tame as they be sure to appear at first he _ hallelujah or britain 's second remembrancer _ from which i have be quote be well worth possess and can be procure without difficulty we now come to a new sort both of man and poet -- still a clergyman it be a especial pleasure to write the name of robert herrick amongst the poet of religion for the very act record that the jolly careless anacreon of the church with he head and heart crowd with pleasure throw down at length he wine-cup tear the rose from he head and knelt in the dust nothing bear herrick 's name so unrefined as the thing dr donne write in he youth but the impression make by he earlier poem be of a man of far shallower nature and greatly more absorb in the delight of the pass hour in the year 1648 when he be fifty-seven year of age be prominent as a royalist he be eject from he living by the dominant puritan and in that same year he publish he poem of which the latter part and later write be he _ noble number _ or religious poem we may wonder at he publish the _ hesperide _ along with they but we must not forget that while the manners of a time be never to be take as a justification of what be wrong the judgment of man concern what be wrong will be greatly influence by those manners -- not necessarily on the side of laxity it be but fair to receive he own testimony concern himself offer in these two line print at the close of he _ hesperide _ : to he book 's end this last line he would have place : _ jocund he muse be but he life be chaste _ we find the same artist in the _ noble number _ as in the _ hesperide _ but hardly the same man however far he may have be from the model of a clergyman in the earlier period of he history partly no doubt from the society to which he power of song make he acceptable i can not believe that these later poem be the result of mood still less the result of mere professional bias or even sense of professional duty in a good many of he poem he touch the heart of truth in other even those of epigrammatic form he must be allow to fail in point as well as in meaning as to he art-form he be guilty of great offence the result of the same passion for lawless figure and similitude which dr donne so freely indulge but he verse be brighten by a certain almost childishly quaint and innocent humor while the tenderness of some of they rise on the reader like the aurora of the come sun of george herbert i do not forget that even if some of he poem be print in 1639 year before that george herbert have do he work and go home : my figure stand in relation to the order i have adopt some of he verse be homelier than even george herbert 's homeliest one of its most remarkable trait be a quaint thanksgiving for the commonest thing by name -- not the less real that it be sometimes even queer for instance : god give not only corn for need but likewise superabundant seed bread for we service bread for show meat for we meal and fragment too : he give not poorly take some between the finger and the thumb but for we glut and for we store fine flour press down and run o'er here be another delightful in its oddity we can fancy the merry yet gracious poet chuckle over the vision of the child and the fancy of he word a grace for a child here a little child i stand heave up my either hand cold as paddock though they be _ frog _ here i lift they up to thee for a benison to fall on we meat and on we all _ amen _ i shall now give two or three of he longer poem which be not long and then a few of he short one the best know be the follow but it be not so well know that i must therefore omit it he litany to the holy spirit in the hour of my distress when temptation I oppress and when i my sin confess sweet spirit comfort I when i lie within my bed sick in heart and sick in head and with doubt discomfort sweet spirit comfort I when the house doth sigh and weep and the world be drown in sleep yet mine eye the watch do keep sweet spirit comfort I when the artless doctor see _ without skill _ no one hope but of he fee and he skill run on the lees sweet spirit comfort I when he potion and he pill he or none or little skill meet for nothing but to kill sweet spirit comfort I when the passing-bell doth toll and the fury in a shoal come to fright a parting soul sweet spirit comfort I when the taper now burn blue and the comforter be few and that number more than true sweet spirit comfort I when the priest he last have pray and i nod to what be say 'cause my speech be now decay sweet spirit comfort I when god know i be toss about either with despair or doubt yet before the glass be out sweet spirit comfort I when the tempter I pursu ` th with the sin of all my youth and half damn I with untruth sweet spirit comfort I when the flame and hellish cry fright mine ear and fright mine eye and all terror I surprise sweet spirit comfort I when the judgment be reveal and that open which be seal when to thee i have appeal sweet spirit comfort I the white island or place of the blest in this world the isle of dream while we sit by sorrow 's stream tear and terror be we theme recite but when once from hence we fly more and more approach nigh unto young eternity unite in that whiter island where thing be evermore sincere candor here and lustre there delight : there no monstrous fancy shall out of hell a horror call to create or cause at all affright there in calm and cooling sleep we we eye shall never steep but eternal watch shall keep attend pleasure such as shall pursue I immortalize and you and fresh joy as never too have end to death thou bid ` st I come away and i 'll no longer stay than for to shed some tear for fault of former year and to repent some crime do in the present time and next to take a bit of bread and wine with it to don my robe of love fit for the place above to gird my loin about with charity throughout and so to travel hence with foot of innocence : these do i 'll only cry god mercy and so die eternity o year and age farewell behold i go where i do know infinity to dwell and these mine eye shall see all time how they be lose i ' th ' sea of vast eternity where never moon shall sway the star but she and

not much to say about he popular as he be in he own day for a large portion of he write take the shape of satire which i consider only a active form of negation i doubt much if mere opposition to the false be of any benefit convince a man by argument that the thing he have be teach be false and you leave he house empty sweep and garnish but the expulsion of the falsehood be no protection against its re-entrance in another mask with seven worse than itself in its company the right effort of the teacher be to give the positive -- to present as he may the vision of reality for the perception of which and not for the discovery of falsehood be man create this will not only cast out the demon but so people the house that he will not dare return if a man might disprove all the untruth in creation he would hardly be a hair 's breadth nearer the end of he own make it be better to hold honestly one fragment of truth in the midst of immeasurable error than to sit alone if that be possible in the midst of a absolute vision clear as the hyaline but only repellent of falsehood not receptive of truth it be the positive by which a man shall live truth be he life the refusal of the false be not the reception of the true a man may deny himself into a spiritual lethargy without deny one truth simply by spend he strength for that which be not bread until he have none leave wherewith to search for the truth which alone can feed he only when subject to the positive do the negative find its true vocation i be jealous of the live force cast into the slough of satire no doubt either indignant or loving rebuke have its end and do its work but i fear that wit while rouse the admiration of the spiteful or the like witty come in only to destroy its dignity at the same time i be not sure whether there might not be such a judicious combination of the element as to render my remark inapplicable at all event poetry favor the positive and from the _ emblem _ name of quarle i shall choose one in which it fully predominate there be something in it remarkably fine phosphor bring the day will ' t ne'er be morning will that promise light ne'er break and clear those cloud of night sweet phosphor bring the day whose conquer ray may chase these fog : sweet phosphor bring the day how long how long shall these benighted eye languish in shades like feeble fly expect spring how long shall darkness soil the face of earth and thus beguile we soul of sprightful action when when will day begin to dawn whose new-born ray may gild the weathercock of we devotion and give we unsouled

remain longer : i can part with he without regret worthy man and fair poet as he be chapter xiii george herbert but with my hand on the lock i shrink from open the door here come a poet indeed and how be i to show he due honor with he book humbly doubtfully offer with the ash of the poem of he youth flutter in the wind of he priestly garment he cross the threshold or rather for i have forget the symbol of my book let we all go from we chapel to the choir and humbly ask he to sing that he may make we worthy of he song in george herbert there be poetry enough and to spare : it be the household bread of he be if i begin with that which first in the nature of thing ought to be demand of a poet namely truth revelation -- george herbert offer we measure press down and run over but let I speak first of that which first in time or order of appearance we demand of a poet namely music for inasmuch as verse be for the ear not for the eye we demand a good hearing first let no one undervalue it the heart of poetry be indeed truth but its garment be music and the garment come first in the process of revelation the music of a poem be its meaning in sound as distinguish from word -- its meaning in solution as it be uncrystallize by articulation the music go before the fuller revelation prepare its way the sound of a verse be the harbinger of the truth contain therein if it be a right poem this will be true herein herbert excel it will be find impossible to separate the music of he word from the music of the thought which take shape in they sound i get I flower to strow thy way i get I bough off many a tree but thou wast up by break of day and bring ` st thy sweet along with thee and the gift it enwrap at once and reveal be i have say truth of the deepest hear this song of divine service in every song he sing a spiritual fact will be find its fundamental life although i may quote this or that merely to illustrate some peculiarity of mode _ the elixir _ be a imagine liquid seek by the old physical investigator in order that by its means they might turn every common metal into gold a pursuit not quite so absurd as it have since appear they call this something when regard as a solid _ the philosopher 's stone _ in the poem it be also call a _ tincture _ the elixir teach I my god and king in all thing thee to see and what i do in anything to do it as for thee not rudely as a beast to run into a action but still to make thee prepossest and give it he perfection _ its _ a man that look on glass on it may stay he eye or if he pleaseth through it pass and then the heaven spy all may of thee partake : nothing can be so mean which with he tincture -- _ for thy sake _ -- _ its _ will not grow bright and clean a servant with this clause make drudgery divine : who sweep a room as for thy law make that and the action fine this be the famous stone that turneth all to gold for that which god doth touch and own can not for less be tell with a conscience tender as a child 's almost diseased in its tenderness and a heart loving as a woman 's he intellect be none the less powerful its movement be as the sword-play of a alert poise well-knit strong-wristed fencer with the rapier in which the skill impress one more than the force while without the force the skill would be valueless even hurtful to its possessor there be a graceful humor with it occasionally even in he most serious poem add much to they charm to illustrate all this take the follow the title of which mean _ the retort _ the quip the merry world do on a day with he train-band and mate agree to meet together where i lay and all in sport to jeer at I first beauty creep into a rose which when i pluck not -- sir say she tell I i pray whose hand be those -lrb- 98 -rrb- _ but thou shall answer lord for I _ then money come and chink still -- what tune be this poor man say he : i hear in music you have skill _ but thou shall answer lord for I _ then come brave glory puffing by in silk that whistle -- who but he he scarce allow I half a eye _ but thou shall answer lord for I _ then come quick wit-and-conversation and he would need a comfort be and to be short make a oration : _ but thou shalt answer lord for I _ yet when the hour of thy design to answer these fine thing shall come speak not at large -- say i be thine and then they have they answer home here be another instance of he humor it be the first stanza of a poem to _ death _ he be glory over death as personify in a skeleton death thou wast once a uncouth hideous thing -- nothing but bone the sad effect of sadder groan : thy mouth be open but thou couldst not sing no writer before he have show such a love to god such a childlike confidence in he the love be like the love of those whose verse come first in my volume but the nation have learn to think more and new difficulty have consequently arise these again have to be undermine by deeper thought and the discovery of yet deeper truth have be the reward hence the love itself if it have not strengthen have at least grown deeper and george herbert have have difficulty enough in himself for bear of high family by nature fit to shine in that society where elegance of mind person carriage and utterance be most appreciate and have indeed enjoy something of the life of a courtier he have forsake all in obedience to the voice of he higher nature hence the struggle between he taste and he duty would come and come again augmented probably by such austere notion as every conscientious man must entertain in proportion to he inability to find god in that in which he might find he from this inability inseparable in its vary degree from the very nature of growth spring all the asceticism of good man whose love to god will be the greater as they grow insight reveal he in he world and they grow faith approach to the give of thanks in everything when we have discover the truth that whatsoever be not of faith be sin the way to meet it be not to forsake the human law but so to obey it as to thank god for it to leave the world and go into the desert be not thus to give thanks : it may have be the only way for this or that man in he blameless blindness to take the divine mind of george herbert however be in the main bent upon discover god everywhere the poem i give next powerfully set forth the struggle between liking and duty of which i have speak it be at the same time a instance of wonderful art in construction all the force of the germinal thought keep in reserve to burst forth at the last he call it -- meaning by the word _ god 's restraint _ -- the collar i strike the board and cry no more -- i will abroad what shall i ever sigh and pine my line and life be free -- free as the road loose as the wind as large as store shall i be still in suit have i no harvest but a thorn to let I blood and not restore what i have lose with cordial fruit sure there be wine before my sigh do dry it there be corn before my tear do drown it be the year only lose to I have i no bay to crown it no flower no garland gay all blast all waste not so my heart but there be fruit and thou hast hand recover all thy sigh-blown age on double pleasure leave thy cold dispute of what be fit and not forsake thy cage thy rope of sand which petty thought have make -- and make to thee good cable to enforce and draw and be thy law while thou didst wink and wouldst not see away take heed -- i will abroad call in thy death 's - head there tie up thy fear he that forbear to suit and serve he need deserve he load but as i raved and grow more fierce and wild at every word methought i hear one call _ child _ and i reply _ my lord _ come now to speak of he art let I say something first about he use of homeliest imagery for highest think this i think be in itself enough to class he with the highest _ kind _ of poet if my reader will refer to _ the elixir _ he will see a instance in the third stanza you may look at the glass or at the sky : you may regard you action only or that action as the will of god again let he listen to the pathos and simplicity of this one stanza from a poem he call _ the flower _ he have be in trouble he time have be evil he have feel a spiritual old age creep upon he but he be once more awake and now in age -lrb- 99 -rrb- i bud again after so many death i live and write i once more smell the dew and rain and relish versing o my only light it can not be that i be he on whom thy tempest fall all night again : some may dream merrily but when they wake they dress themselves and come to thee he have a exquisite feeling of lyrical art not only do he keep to one idea in it but he finish the poem like a cameo here be a instance wherein he outdo the elaboration of a norman trouvère for not merely do each line in each stanza end with the same sound as the corresponding line in every other stanza but it end with the very same word i shall hardly care to defend this if my reader choose to call it a whim but i do say that a large degree of the peculiar musical effect of the poem -- subservient to the thought keep it dimly chime in the head until it break out clear and triumphant like a silver bell in the last -- be owe to this use of the same column of word at the line-end of every stanza let he who doubt it read the poem aloud aaron holiness on the head light and perfection on the breast harmonious bell below raise the dead to lead they unto life and rest -- thus be true aaron drest profaneness in my head defect and darkness in my breast a noise of passion ring I for dead unto a place where be no rest -- poor priest thus be i drest only another head i have another heart and breast another music make live not dead without whom i could have no rest -- in he i be well drest christ be my only head my alone only heart and breast my only music striking I even dead that to the old man i may rest and be in he new drest so holy in my head perfect and light in my dear breast my doctrine turn by christ who be not dead but live in I while i do rest -- come people : aaron 's drest note the flow and the ebb of the line of each stanza -- from six to eight to ten syllable and back through eight to six the number of stanza correspond to the number of line in each only the poem itself begin with the ebb and end with a full spring-flow of energy note also the perfect antithesis in they part between the first and second stanza and how the last line of the poem clench the whole in reveal its idea -- that for the sake of which it be write in a word note the _ unity _ bear in 1593 notwithstanding he exquisite art he could not escape be influence by the faulty tendency of he age bear in upon he youth by the example of he mother 's friend dr donne a man must be a giant like shakspere or milton to cast off he age 's fault indeed no man have more of the quip and crank and wanton wiles of the poetic spirit of he time than george herbert but with this difference from the rest of dr donne 's school that such be the indwelling potency that it cause even these to shine with a radiance such that we wish they still to burn and not be consume he muse be seldom other than graceful even when she motion be grotesque and he be always a gentleman which can not be say of he master we could not bear to part with he most fantastic oddity they be so interpenetrate with he genius as well as he art in relation to the use he make of these faulty form and to show that even herein he have exercise a refrain judgment though indeed fancy he have quite discard in only somewhat reform it i recommend the study of two poem each of which he call _ jordan _ though why i have not yet with certainty discover it be possible that not many of he reader have observe the follow instance of the freakish in he rhyming art which however result well when i say so i would not be suppose to approve of the freak but only to acknowledge the success of the poet in he immediate intent they be related to a certain tendency to mechanical contrivance not seldom associate with a love of art : it be art operating in the physical understanding in the poem call _ home _ every stanza be perfectly finish till the last : in it with a access of art or artfulness he destroy the rhyme i shall not quarrel with my reader if he call it the latter and regard it as art run to seed and yet -- and yet -- i confess i have a latent liking for the trick i shall give one or two stanza out of the rather long poem to lead up to the change in the last come lord my head doth burn my heart be sick while thou dost ever ever stay thy long deferring wind I to the quick my spirit gaspeth night and day o show thyself to I or take I up to thee nothing but drought and dearth but bush and brake which way soe'er i look i see : some may dream merrily but when they wake they dress themselves and come to thee o show thyself to I or take I up to thee come dearest lord pass not this holy season my flesh and bone and joint do pray and even my verse when by the rhyme and reason the word be _ stay _ -lrb- 100 -rrb- say ever _ come _ o show thyself to I or take I up to thee balancing this my second instance be of the converse in all the stanza but the last the last line in each hang unrhymed : in the last the rhyming be fulfil the poem be call _ denial _ i give only a part of it when my devotions could not pierce thy silent ear then be my heart break as be my verse my breast be full of fear and disorder o that thou shouldst give dust a tongue to cry to thee and then not hear it cry all day long my heart be in my knee : but no hearing therefore my soul lay out of sight untuned unstrung my feeble spirit unable to look right like a nipt blossom hang discontented o cheer and tune my heartless breast -- defer no time that so thy favor grant my request they and my mind may chime and mend my rhyme it have be hardly worth the space to point out these be not the matter itself precious before make further remark on george herbert let I present one of he poem in which the oddity of the visual fancy be only equal by the beauty of the result the pulley when god at first make man have a glass of blessing standing by let we say he pour on he all we can : let the world 's riches which disperséd lie contract into a span so strength first make a way then beauty flow then wisdom honor pleasure when almost all be out god make a stay perceive that alone of all he treasure _ rest _ in the bottom lay for if i should say he bestow this jewel also on my creature he would adore my gift instead of I and rest in nature not the god of nature : so both should loser be yet let he keep the rest -- but keep they with repine restlessness : let he be rich and weary that at least if goodness lead he not yet weariness may toss he to my breast be it not the story of the world write with the point of a diamond there can hardly be a doubt that he tendency to unnatural form be encourage by the increase of respect to symbol and ceremony show at this period by some of the external power of the church -- bishop laud in particular have all however who delight in symbol a power like george herbert 's of set even within the horn-lantern of the more arbitrary of they such a light of poetry and devotion that they dull side vanish in its pierce shine and we forget the symbol utterly in the truth which it can not obscure then indeed we part would be to take and be thankful but there never have be even a living true symbol which the dulness of those who will see the truth only in the symbol have not degrade into the very cockatrice-egg of sectarianism the symbol be by such always more or less idolize and the light within more or less patronize if the truth for the sake of which all symbol exist be indeed the delight of those who claim it the sectarianism of the church would vanish but man on all side call that _ the truth _ which be but its form or outward sign -- material or verbal true or arbitrary it matter not which -- and hence come strife and division although george herbert however could thus illumine all with he divine inspiration we can not help wonder whether if he have betake himself yet more to vital and less to half artificial symbol the change would not have be a breaking of the pitcher and a outshining of the lamp for a symbol may remind we of the truth and at the same time obscure it -- present it and dull its effect it be the temple of nature and not the temple of the church the thing make by the hand of god and not the thing make by the hand of man that afford the truest symbol of truth i be anxious to be understand the chief symbol of we faith _ the cross _ it may be say be not one of these natural symbol i answer -- no but neither be it a arbitrary symbol it be not a symbol of _ a truth _ at all but of _ a fact _ of the infinitely grandest fact in the universe which be itself the outcome and symbol of the grandest truth _ the cross _ be a historical _ sign _ not properly _ a symbol _ except through the fact it remind we of on the other hand _ baptism _ and the _ eucharist _ be symbol of the loftiest and profoundest kind true to nature and all its meaning as well as to the fact of which they remind we they be in themselves symbol of the truth involve in the fact they commemorate of nature 's symbol george herbert have make large use but he would have be yet a greater poet if he have make a larger use of they still then at least we might have get rid of such oddity as the stanza for step up to the church-door the first at the bottom of the page of the line shape into ugly altar-form and of the absurd easter wing make of ever lengthen line this would not have be much i confess nor the gain by they loss great but not to mention the larger supply of image graceful with the grace of god who when he have make they say they be good it would have lead to the further purification of he taste perhaps even to the cast out of all that could untimely move we mirth until possibly -lrb- for illustration -rrb- instead of this lovely stanza he would have give we even a lovelier : listen sweet dive unto my song and spread thy golden wing on I hatch my tender heart so long till it get wing and fly away with thee the stanza be indeed lovely and true and tender and clever as well yet who can help smile at the notion of the incubation of the heart-egg although what the poet mean be so good that the smile almost vanish in a sigh there be no doubt that the work of man 's hand will also afford many true symbol but i do think that in proportion as a man give himself to those instead of study truth 's wardrobe of form in nature so will he decline from the high calling of the poet george herbert be too great to be himself much injure by the narrowness of the field whence he gather he symbol but he song will be the worse for it in the ear of all but those who have lose sight of or have never behold the oneness of the god whose creation exist in virtue of he redemption feel safer in a low-browed crypt than under the high embowed roof when the desire after system or order degenerate from a need into a passion or ruling idea it close as may be see in many woman who be especial house-keeper like a unyielding skin over the mind to the death of all development from impulse and aspiration the same thing hold in the church : anxiety about order and system will kill the life this do not go near to be the result with george herbert : he life be hide with christ in god but the influence of he _ profession _ as distinguish from he work be hurtful to he call as a poet he of all man would scorn to claim social rank for spiritual service he of all man would not commit the blunder of suppose that prayer and praise be that service of god : they be _ prayer _ and _ praise _ not _ service _ he know that god can be serve only through loving ministration to he son and daughter all needy of commonest human help : but as the most devout of clergyman will be the readiest to confess there be even a danger to they soul in the unvarying recurrence of the outward obligation of they service and in like manner the poet will fare ill if the convention from which the holiest system be not free send he soar with seal eye george herbert 's be but a little blinded thus yet something we must allow he poetry be injure by he profession all that i say on this point however so far from diminish he praise add thereto set forth only that he be such a poet as might have be greater yet have the divine gift have free course but again i rebuke myself and say thank god for george herbert to rid we spiritual palate of the clinging flavor of criticism let I choose another song from he precious legacy -- one less read i presume than many it show he tendency to asceticism -- the fancy of forsake god 's world in order to serve he it have besides many of the fault of the age even to that of punning yet it be a lovely bit of art as well as a rich embodiment of tenderness the thanksgiving oh king of grief a title strange yet true to thee of all king only due oh king of wound how shall i grieve for thee who in all grief preventest I _ goest before I _ shall i weep blood why thou hast weep such store that all thy body be one gore shall i be scourgéd flout boxéd sell ` tis but to tell the tale be tell _ my god my god why dost thou part from I _ be such a grief as can not be shall i then sing skip thy doleful story and side with thy triumphant glory shall thy stroke be my stroke thorn my flower thy rod my posy -lrb- 101 -rrb- cross my bower but how then shall i imitate thee and copy thy fair though bloody hand surely i will revenge I on thy love and try who shall victorious prove if thou dost give I wealth i will restore all back unto thee by the poor if thou dost give I honor man shall see the honor doth belong to thee i will not marry or if she be mine she and she child shall be thine my bosom-friend if he blaspheme thy name i will tear thence he love and fame one half of I be go the rest i give unto some chapel -- die or live as for my passion -lrb- 102 -rrb- -- but of that anon when with the other i have do for thy predestination i 'll contrive that three year hence if i survive -lrb- 103 -rrb- i 'll build a spital or mend common way but mend my own without delay then i will use the work of thy creation as if i use they but for fashion the world and i will quarrel and the year shall not perceive that i be here my music shall find thee and every string shall have he attribute to sing _ its _ that all together may accord in thee and prove one god one harmony if thou shall give I wit it shall appear if thou hast give it I ` tis here nay i will read thy book -lrb- 104 -rrb- and never move till i have find therein thy love -- thy art of love which i 'll turn back on thee : o my dear savior victory then for my passion -- i will do for that -- alas my god i know not what with the precede must be take the follow which come immediately after it the reprisal i have consider it and find there be no deal with thy mighty passion for though i die for thee i be behind : my sin deserve the condemnation o make I innocent that i may give a disentangled state and free and yet thy wound still my attempt defy for by thy death i die for thee ah be it not enough that thou by thy eternal glory didst outgo I couldst thou not grief 's sad conquest I allow but in all victory overthrow I yet by confession will i come into the conquest : though i can do nought against thee in thee i will overcome the man who once against thee fight even embrace the foot of jesus mary magdalene or george herbert must rise and go forth to do he will it will be observe how much george herbert go beyond all that have precede he in the expression of feeling as it flow from individual condition in the analysis of he own mood in the logic of worship if i may say so he utterance be not merely of personal love and grief but of the peculiar love and grief in the heart of george herbert there may be disease in such a mind but if there be it be a disease that will burn itself out such disease be for man constitute like he the only path to health by health i mean that simple regard to the truth to the will of god which will turn away a man 's eye from he own condition and leave god free to work he perfection in he -- free that be of the interference of the man 's self-consciousness and anxiety to this perfection st paul have come when he no longer cry out against the body of he death no more judge he own self but leave all to the father care only to do he will it be enough to he then that god should judge he for he will be the one good thing secure all good thing amongst the keener delight of the life which be at the door i look for the face of george herbert with whom to talk humbly would be in bliss a higher bliss chapter xiv john milton john milton bear in 1608 be twenty-four year of age when george herbert die hardly might two good man present a greater contrast than these in power and size milton greatly excel if george herbert 's utterance be like the sword-play of one skilful with the rapier that of milton be like the sword-play of a old knight flash he huge but keen-cutting blade in lightning about he head compare with herbert milton be a man in health he never _ show _ at least any diseased regard of himself he eye be fix on the truth and he know of no ill-faring while a man look thitherward all the movement of he spirit reveal themselves only in peace everything conspire or should i not rather say everything be freely give to make milton a great poet leave the original seed of melody the primordial song in the soul which all he life be a effort to utter let we regard for a moment the circumstance that favor its development -lrb- illustration : he volant touch fie and pursue transverse the resonant fugue -rrb- from childhood he have listen to the sound of the organ doubtless himself often give breath to the soundboard with he hand on the lever of the bellows while he father 's volant touch instinct through all proportion low and high flee and pursue transverse the resonant fugue and the father 's organ-harmony we yet hear in the son 's verse as in none but he those organ-sound he have take for the very breath of he speech and articulate they he have education and leisure freedom to think to travel to observe : he be more than thirty before he have to earn a mouthful of bread by he own labor rush at length into freedom 's battle he stand in its storm with he hand on the wheel of the nation 's rudder shout many a bold word for god and the truth until fulfil of experience as of knowledge god set up before he a canvas of utter darkness : he have to fill it with creature of radiance god blind he with he hand that like the nightingale he might sing darkle beyond all he life be pure from he childhood without which such poetry as he could never have come to the birth it be the pure in heart who shall see god at length the pure in heart who now hear he harmony more than all yet he devote himself from the first to the will of god and he prayer that he might write a great poem be hear the unity of he be be the strength of milton he be harmony sweet and bold throughout not philip sidney not george herbert loved word and they melody more than he while in they use he be more serious than either and harder to please utter a music they have rarely approach yet even when speak with most miraculous organ with a grandeur never hear till then he overflow in speech more like that of other man than theirs -- he utter himself more simply straightforwardly dignifiedly than they he mode be larger and more human more near to the form of primary thought faithful and obedient to he art he spend he power in no diversion like shakspere he can be silent never hesitate to sweep away the finest line should they mar the intent progress and flow of he poem even while he sing most abandonedly it be ever with a care of he speech it be ever with order word : not one shall dull the clarity of he verse by unlicensed that be needless presence but let not my reader fancy that this imply laborious utterance and strained endeavor it be weakness only which by the agony of visible effort enhance the magnitude of victory the trained athlete will move with the grace of a child for he have not to seek how to effect that which he mean to perform milton have only to take good heed and with no greater effort than it cost the ordinary man to avoid talk like a fool he sing like a archangel but i must not enlarge my remark for of he verse even i can find room for only a few lyric in they however we shall still find the simplest truth the absolute of life the poet 's aim he be ever soar towards the region beyond perturbation the true condition of soul that be wherein a man shall see thing even as god would have he see they he have no time to droop he pinion and sit moody even on the highest pine : the sun be above he he must fly upwards the youth who at three-and-twenty could write the follow sonnet might well at five-and-forty be capable of write the one that follow : how soon have time the subtle thief of youth steal on he wing my three-and-twentieth year my hasting day fly on with full career but my late spring no bud or blossom shew ` th perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth that i to manhood be arrive so near and inward ripeness doth much less appear that some more timely happy spirit endu ` th yet be it less or more or soon or slow it shall be still in strictest measure even to that same lot however mean or high toward which time lead I and the will of heaven : all be -- if

more and more luminous as they be regard the follow i incline to think the finest of he short poem certainly the grandest of they it be a little ode write _ to be set on a clock-case _ on time fly envious time till thou run out thy race call on the lazy leaden-stepping hour whose speed be but the heavy plummet 's pace and glut thyself with what thy womb devour -- which be no more than what be false and vain and merely mortal dross : so little be we loss so little be thy gain for whenas each thing bad thou hast entomb and last of all thy greedy self consume then long eternity shall greet we bliss with a individual kiss _ that can not be divide -- and joy shall overtake we as a flood -lrb- eternal _ when everything that be sincerely good and perfectly divine with truth and peace and love shall ever shine about the supreme throne of he to whose happy-making sight alone when once we heavenly-guided soul shall climb then all this earthy grossness quit attire with star we shall for ever sit triumph over death and chance and thee o time the next i give be likewise a ode -- a more _ beautiful _ one observe in both the fine effect of the short line essential to the nature of the ode be that which give its solemnity the character yet of a song or rather perhaps of a chant in this he call upon voice and verse to rouse and raise we imagination until we hear the choral song of heaven and hearing become able to sing in tuneful response at a solemn music blest pair of siren pledge of heaven 's joy sphere-born harmonious sister voice and verse wed you divine sound and mixed power employ -- dead thing with inbreathed sense able to pierce -- and to we high-raised phantasy present that undisturbed song of pure concent -lrb- 105 -rrb- aye sing before the sapphire-coloured throne to he that sit thereon with saintly shout and solemn jubilee where the bright seraph in burn row they loud uplifted angel trumpet blow and the cherubic host in thousand choir touch they immortal harp of golden wire with those just spirit that wear victorious palm hymn devout and holy psalm singing everlastingly that we on earth with undiscording voice may rightly answer that melodious noise -- as once we do till disproportioned -lrb- 106 -rrb- sin jar against nature 's chime and with harsh din break the fair music that all creature make to they great lord whose love they motion sway in perfect diapason -lrb- 107 -rrb- whilst they stand in first obedience and they state of good o may we soon again renew that song and keep in tune with heaven till god ere long to he celestial consort -lrb- 108 -rrb- we unite to live with he and sing in endless morn of light music be the symbol of all truth to milton he would count it falsehood to write a unmusical verse i allow that some of he blank line may appear unrhythmical but experience especially if she bring with she a knowledge of dante will elucidate all they movement i exhort my younger friend to read milton aloud when they be alone and thus learn the worth of word-sound they will find he even in this a educate force the last ode ought to be thus read for the magnificent dance-march of its motion as well as for its melody show I one who delight in the _ hymn on the nativity _ and i will show you one who may never indeed be a singer in this world but who be already a listener to the best but how different it be from anything of george herbert 's it set forth no feeling peculiar to milton it be a outburst of the gladness of the company of believer every one have at least read the glorious poem but be i to leave it out i should have lose not the sapphire of aspiration not the topaz of praise not the emerald of holiness but the carbuncle of delight from the high priest 's breast-plate and i must give the introduction too : it be the cloudy grove of a overture whence rush the torrent of song on the morning of christ 's nativity this be the month and this the happy morn wherein the son of heaven 's eternal king of wed maid and virgin mother bear we great redemption from above do bring for so the holy sage once do sing that he we deadly forfeit should release and with he father work we a perpetual peace that glorious form that light insufferable and that far-beaming blaze of majesty wherewith he wont -lrb- 109 -rrb- at heaven 's high council-table to sit the midst of trinal unity he lay aside and here with we to be forsake the court of everlasting day and choose with we a darksome house of mortal clay say heavenly muse shall not thy sacred vein afford a present to the infant god hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain to welcome he to this he new abode now while the heaven by the sun 's team untrod have take no print of the approach light and all the spangled host keep watch in squadron bright see how from far upon the eastern road the star-led wizard haste with odour sweet o run prevent they with thy humble ode and lay it lowly at he bless foot have thou the honor first thy lord to greet and join thy voice unto the angel choir from out he secret altar touch with hallowed fire the hymn it be the winter wild while the heaven-born child all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lie nature in awe to he have doff she gaudy trim with she great master so to sympathize : it be no season then for she to wanton with the sun she lusty paramour only with speech fair she woo the gentle air to hide she guilty front with innocent snow and on she naked shame pollute with sinful blame the saintly veil of maiden white to throw confound that she maker 's eye should look so near upon she

the sun himself withhold he wonted speed and hide he head for shame as he inferior flame the new enlighten world no more should need : he see a greater sun appear than he bright throne or burning

that hear such sound beneath the hollow round of cynthium 's seat -lrb- 113 -rrb- the airy region thrilling now be almost win to think she part be do and that she reign have here its last fulfil : she know such harmony alone could hold all heaven and earth in happier union at last surround they sight a globe of circular light that with long beam the shame-faced night array the helméd cherubim and

of heaven 's deep organ blow and with you ninefold harmony make up full consort -lrb- 117 -rrb- to the angelic symphony -lrb- 118 -rrb- for if such holy song enwrap we fancy long time will run back and fetch the age of gold and speckled vanity will sicken soon and die -lrb- 119 -rrb- and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould and hell itself will pass away and leave she dolorous mansion to the peer day yea truth and justice then will down return to man orb in a rainbow and like glory wear mercy will sit between thron in celestial sheen with radiant foot the tissued cloud down steering and heaven as at some festival will open wide the gate of she high palace-hall but wisest fate say no this must not yet be so the babe lie yet in smile infancy that on the bitter cross must redeem we loss so both himself and we to glorify yet first to those y-chained in sleep the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep with such a horrid clang as on mount sinaus ring while the red fire and smoulder cloud outbrake : the agéd earth aghast with terror of that blast shall from the surface to the center shake when at the world 's last sessiön the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread he

bright-harnessed -lrb- 132 -rrb- angel sit in order serviceable -lrb- 133 -rrb- if my reader should think some of the rhyme bad and some of the word oddly use i would remind he that both pronunciation and meaning have alter since : the probability be that the older form in both be the better milton will not use a wrong word or a bad rhyme with regard to the form of the poem let he observe the variety of length of line in the stanza and how skilfully the varied line be associate -- two of six syllable and one of ten then the same repeat then one of eight and one of twelve -- no two except of the shortest come together of the same length its stanza be its own : i do not know another poem write in the same and its music be exquisite the probability be that if the reader note any fact in the poem however trifle it might seem to the careless eye it will repay he by unfold both individual and related beauty then let he ponder the picture give : the sudden arraying of the shame-faced night in long beam the amaze king silent on they throne the bird brood on the sea : he will find many such let he consider the clear-cut epithet so full of mean a true poet may be at once know by the justice and force of the adjective he use especially when he compound they -- that be make one out of two here be some example : _ meek-eyed peace pale-eyed priest speckled vanity smoulder cloud hideous hum dismal dance dusky eyne : _ there be many such each almost a poem in itself the whole be a succession of picture set in the loveliest music for the utterance of grandest thought no doubt there be in the poem instance of such fault in style as be common in the age in which he verse be root : for my own part i never like the first two stanza of the hymn but such instance be few while for a right feeling of the marvel of this poem and of the two precede it we must remember that milton be only twenty-one when he write they apparently to make one of a set with the _ nativity _ he begin to write a ode on the _ passion _ but find the subject above the year he have when he write it and nothing satisfied with what be begin leave it unfinished the fragment be full of unworthy though skilful and for such powerful conceit but be especially interesting as show how even milton try to write about what he feel but without yet have generate thought enow concern the subject itself could only fall back on conventionality happy the young poet the wisdom of whose earliest year be such that he recognize he mistake almost at the outset and drop the attempt amongst the stanza there be however one of exceed loveliness : he sovereign priest stoop he regal head that drop with odorous oil down he fair eye poor fleshly tabernacle enteréd he starry front low-roofed beneath the sky oh what a masque be there what a disguise yet more the stroke of death he must abide then lie he meekly down fast by he brethren 's side in this it will be see that he have leave the jubilant measure of the _ hymn _ and return to the more stately and solemn rhyme-royal of its overture as more suit to he subject milton could not be wrong in he music even when he find the quarry of he thought too hard to work chapter xv edmund waller thoma brown and jeremy taylor edmund waller bear in 1605 be three year older than milton but i have a fancy for not divide herbert and milton as a poet he have a high reputation for many year gain chiefly i think by a regard to literary propriety combine with wit he be graceful sometimes but what in he writings would with many pass for grace be only smoothness and the absence of fault he horse be not difficult to drive he dare little and succeed in proportion -- occasionally however flash out into true song in politics he have no character -- let we hope from weakness rather than from selfishness yet towards the close of he life he write some poem which reveal a man not unaccustomed to ponder sacred thing and able to express he thought concern they with force and justice from a poem call _ of divine love _ i gather the follow very remarkable passage : i wish they have be enforce by greater nobility of character still they be in themselves true even where we have no proof of repentance we may see plentiful sign of a growth towards it we can not tell how long the truth may of necessity require to interpenetrate the ramification of a man 's nature by slow degree he discover that here it be not and there it be not again and again and yet again a man find that he must be bear with a new birth the fear of hell or aim to be bless savor too much of private interest : this move not mose nor the zealous paul who for they friend abandon soul and all a greater yet from heaven to hell descend to save and make he enemy he friend \* \* \* \* \* that early love of creature yet unmade to frame the world the almighty do persuade for love it be that first create light move on the water chase away the night from the rude chaos and bestow new grace on thing dispose of to they proper place -- some to rest here and some to shine above : earth sea and heaven be all the effect of love \* \* \* \* \* not willing terror should he image move he give a pattern of eternal love : he son descend to treat a peace with those which be and must have ever be he foe poor he become and leave he glorious seat to make we humble and to make we great he business here be happiness to give to those whose malice could not let he live \* \* \* \* \* he to proud potentate would not be know : of those that love he he be hide from none till love appear we live in anxious doubt but smoke will vanish when that flame break out : this be the fire that would consume we dross refine and make we richer by the loss \* \* \* \* \* who for himself no miracle would make dispense with -lrb- 134 -rrb- several for the people 's sake he that long-fasting would no wonder show make loaf and fish as they eat they grow of all he power which boundless be above here he use none but to express he love and such a love would make we joy exceed not when we own but other ' mouth we feed \* \* \* \* \* love as he love a love so unconfined with arm extend would embrace mankind self-love would cease or be dilate when we should behold as many self as man all of one family in blood ally he precious blood that for we ransom die \* \* \* \* \* amaze at once and comfort to find a boundless power so infinitely kind the soul contend to that light to fly from she dark cell we practice how to die employ thus the poet 's wingéd art to reach this love and grave it in we heart joy so complete so solid and severe would leave no place for meaner pleasure there : pale they would look as star that must be go when from the east the rise sun come on \* \* \* \* \* to that and some other poem he add the follow -- a kind of epilogue on the foregoing divine poem when we for age could neither read nor write the subject make we able to indite : the soul with nobler resolution deck the body stoop do herself erect : no mortal part be requisite to raise she that unbody can she maker praise the sea be quiet when the wind give o'er : so calm be we when passion be no more for then we know how vain it be to boast of fleeting thing so certain to be lose cloud of affection from we younger eye _ passion _ conceal that emptiness which age descry the soul 's dark cottage batter and decay let in new light through chink that time have make : stronger by weakness wiser man become as they draw near to they eternal home leave the old both world at once they view that stand upon the threshold of the new it would be a poor victory where age be the sole conqueror but i doubt if age ever gain the victory alone let waller however have this praise : he song soar with he subject it be a true praise there be man who write well until they try the noble and then they fare like the fall star which when seek where it fall be accord to a old fancy discover a poor jelly sir thoma brown a physician whose prose writings be as peculiar as they be valuable be of the same age as waller he partake to a considerable degree of the mysticism which be so much follow in he day only in he case it influence he literature most -- he mode of utterance more than he mode of think he _ true christian moral _ be a very valuable book notwithstanding the obscurity that sometimes arise in that as in all he writings from he fondness for latin word the following fine hymn occur in he _ religio medicus _ in which he give a account of he opinion i be not aware of anything else that he have publish in verse though he must probably have write more to be able to write this so well it occur in the midst of prose as the prayer he say every night before he yield to the death of sleep i follow it with the succeed sentence of the prose the night be come like to the day depart not thou great god away let not my sin black as the night eclipse the lustre of thy light keep still in my horizon for to I the sun make not the day but thee thou whose nature can not sleep on my temple sentry keep guard I ` gainst those watchful foe whose eye be open while mine close let no dream my head infest but such as jacob 's temple bless while i do rest my soul advance make my sleep a holy trance that i may my rest be wroughtt awake into some holy thought and with as active vigor run my course as doth the nimble sun sleep be a death : o make I try by sleep what it be to die and as gently lay my head on my grave as now my bed howe'er i rest great god let I awake again at least with thee and thus assure behold i lie securely or to wake or die these be my drowsy day : in vain i do now wake to sleep again : o come that hour when i shall never sleep again but wake for ever this be the dormitive i take to bedward i need no other laudanum than this to make I sleep after which i close mine eye in security content to take my leave of the sun and sleep unto the resurrection jeremy taylor bear in 1613 be the most poetic of english prose-writer : if he have write verse equal to he prose he would have have a lofty place amongst poet as well as amongst preacher take the opposite side from milton than whom he be five year younger he be like he conscientious and consistent suffering while milton 's cause prosper and advance to one of the bishopric hate of milton 's soul when the scale of england 's politics turn in the other direction such man however be divide only by they intellect when man say i must or i must not for it be right or it be not right then be they in reality so bind together even should they not acknowledge it themselves that no oppose opinion no conflicting theory concern what be or be not right can really part they it be not wonderful that a mind like that of jeremy taylor best fit for worship the beauty of holiness should mourn over the disrupt order of he church or that a mind like milton 's best fit for the law of life should demand that every part of that order which have cease to vibrate responsive to every throb of the eternal heart of truth should fall into the ruin which its death have precede the church be hardly deal with but the ruler of the church have to bear the blame here be those i judge the best of the bishop 's _ festival hymn _ print as part of he _ golden grove _ or _ gide to devotion _ in the first there be a little confusion of imagery and in other of they will be find a little obscurity they bear mark of the careless impatience of rhythm and rhyme of one who though ever burst into a natural trill of song sometimes with more rhyme apparently than he intend would yet rather let he thought pour themselves out in that unmeasured chant that poetry in solution which be the natural speech of the prophet-orator he be like a full river that must flow which rejoice in a flood and rebel against the constraint of mole or conduit he exult in utterance itself care little for the mode which however the law of he indwelling melody guide though never compel charmingly diffuse in he prose he verse ever sound as if it would overflow the bank of its self-imposed restraint the second hymn for advent or christ 's come to jerusalem in

they belong at least to the highest order of philosophy and it will be see from the poem i give that they must have bear they part in lift the soul of the man towards a lofty spiritual condition of

would he then by spiritual might have rise indeed above bodily torture it be _ possible _ for a man to arrive at this perfection it be absolutely _ necessary _ that a man should some day or other reach it and i think the wise doctor would have prove the truth of he principle but there be many who would gladly part with they whole body rather than offend and could not yet so rise above the invasion of the sens here as in less important thing we business be not to speculate what we would do in other circumstance but to perform the duty of the moment the one true preparation for the duty to come possibly however the right development of we human relation in the world may be a more difficult and more important task still than this condition of divine alienation to find god in other be better than to grow _ solely _ in the discovery of he in ourselves if indeed the latter be possible devotion good god when they thy inward grace dost shower into my breast how full of light and lively

far have i clamber in my mind but nought so great as love i find : deep-searching wit mount-moving might be nought compare to that good sprite life of delight and soul of bliss sure source of lasting happiness higher than heaven lower than hell what be thy tent where may ` st thou dwell my mansion hight _ humility _ _ be name _ heaven 's vastest capability the further it doth downward tend the

grave but if ` twere lawful up to send my voice to heaven this should it rend : lord thrust I deeper into dust that thou may ` st raise I with the just there be strange thing and worth ponder in all these a occasional classical allusion seem to we quite out of place but such thing we must pass the poem be quite different from any we have have before there have be only a few of such writer in we nation but i suspect those have have a good deal more influence upon the religious life of it than many thinker suppose they be in closest sympathy with the deeper form of truth employ by st paul and st john this last poem concern humility as the house in which charity dwell be very truth a repentant sinner feel that he be make himself little when he pray to be make humble : the christian philosopher see such a glory and spiritual wealth in humility that it appear to he almost too much to pray for the very essence of these mystical writer seem to I to be poetry they use the largest figure for the largest spiritual idea -- _ light _ for _ good darkness _ for _ evil _ such symbol be the true body of the true idea for this service mainly what we term _ nature _ be call into be namely to furnish form for truth for without form truth can not be utter have find they symbol these writer next proceed to use they logically and here begin the peculiar danger when the logic leave the poetry behind it grow first presumptuous then hard then narrow and untrue to the original breadth of the symbol the glory of the symbol vanish and the final result be a worship of the symbol which have wither into a apple of sodom witness some of the writings of the european master of the order -- swedenborg : the highest of they be rich in truth the lowest be poverty-stricken indeed in 1615 be bear richard baxter one of the purest and wisest and devoutest of man -- and no mean poet either if ever a man seek between contend party to do he duty siding with each as each appear right oppose each as each appear wrong surely that man be baxter hence he fare as all man too wise to be partisan must fare -- he please neither royalist nor puritan dull of heart and sadly unlike a mother be the church when by the act of uniformity of charle ii she drive from she bosom such a son with he two thousand brethren of the clergy he have leave we a good deal of verse -- too much perhaps if we consider the length of the poem and the value of condensation there be in many of they a delightful fervor of the simplest love to god utter with a plain half poetic half logical strength from which sometimes the poetry break out clear and fine much that he write be of death from the dread of which he evidently suffer -- a good thing when it drive a man to renew he confidence in he savior 's presence it have with he a very different origin from the vulgar fancy that to talk about death be religious it be refuge from the fear of death he seek and that be the part of every man who would not be a slave the _ door of death _ of which he so often speak be to he a door out of the fear of death the poem from which the follow excerpt be make be evidently write in view of some imminent suffering for conscience-sake probably when the act of uniformity be pass : twenty year after he be imprison at the age of sixty-seven and lay nearly a year and a half -- i omit many verse the resolution it be no great matter what man deem whether they count I good or bad : in they applause and best esteem there be no contentment to be have thy step lord in this dirt i see and lest my soul from god should stray i 'll bear my cross and follow thee : let other choose the fairer way my face be meeter for the spit i be more suitable to shame and to the taunt of scornful wit : it be no great matter for my name my lord have teach I how to want a place wherein to put my head : while he be mine i 'll be content to beg or lack my daily bread must i forsake the soil and air where first i draw my vital breath that way may be as near and fair : thence i may come to thee by death all country be my father 's land thy sun thy love doth shine on all we may in all lift up pure hand and with acceptance on thee call what if in prison i must dwell may i not there converse with thee save I from sin thy wrath and hell call I thy child and i be free no wall or bar can keep thee out none can confine a holy soul the street of heaven it walk about none can its liberty control this flesh have draw my soul to sin : if it must smart thy will be do o fill I with thy joy within and then i 'll let it grieve alone frail sinful flesh be loath to die sense to the unseen world be strange the doubt soul dread the most high and trembleth at so great a change o let I not be strange at home strange to the sun and life of soul choose this low and darkened room familiar with worm and mole be i the first that go this way how many saint be go before how many enter every day into thy kingdom by this door christ be once dead and in a grave yet conquer death and rise again and by this method he will save he servant that with he shall reign the strangeness will be quickly over when once the heaven-born soul be there : one sight of god will it recover from all this backwardness and fear to we christ 's lowest part he foot union and faith must yet suffice to guide and comfort we : it be meet we trust we head who have we eye we see here that faith in the lord lead richard baxter to the same conclusion immediately to which he faithful philosophy lead henry more there be much in baxter 's poem that i would gladly quote but must leave with regret here be a curious skilful and in a homely way poetic ballad embody a good parable i give only a few of the stanza the return who be it that i leave behind when i go last from home that now i all disorder find when to myself i come i leave it light but now all 's dark and i be fain to grope : be it not for one little spark i should be out of hope my gospel-book i open leave where i the promise saw but now i doubt it be lose by theft : i find none but the law the stormy rain a entrance have through the uncovered top : how should i rest when shower of wrath upon my conscience drop i lock my jewel in my chest i 'll search lest that be go : -- if this one guest have quit my breast i have be quite undo my treacherous flesh have play its part and open sin the door and they have spoil and rob my heart and leave it sad and poor yet have i one great trusty friend that will procure my peace and all this loss and ruin mend and purchase my release the bellows i 'll yet take in hand till this small spark shall flame : love shall my heart and tongue command to praise god 's holy name i 'll mend the roof i 'll watch the door and better keep the key i 'll trust my treacherous flesh no more but force it to obey what have i say that i 'll do this that be so false and weak and have so often do amiss and do my covenant break i mean lord -- all this shall be do if thou my heart wilt raise and as the work must be thine own so also shall the praise the allegory be so good that one be absolutely sorry when it break down and the poem say in plain word that which be the subject of the figure bring truth unmask into the midst of the masker who represent truth -- thus interrupt the pleasure of the artistic sense in the transparent illusion the command of metrical form in baxter be somewhat remarkable he have not much melody but he keep good time in a variety of measure chapter xvii crashaw and marvell i come now to one of the loveliest of we angel-birds richard crashaw indeed he be like a bird in more sens than one for he belong to that class of man who seem hardly ever to get foot-hold of this world but be ever float in the upper air of it what i say of a peculiar æolian word-music in william drummond apply with equal truth to crashaw while of we own poet somehow or other he remind I of shelley in the silvery shine and bell-like melody both of he verse and he imagery and in one of he poem _ music 's duel _ the fineness of he phrase remind I of keat but i must not forget that it be only with he sacred he best poem too that i be now concern the date of he birth be not know with certainty but it be judge about 1616 the year of shakspere 's death he be the son of a protestant clergyman zealous even to controversy by a not unnatural reaction crashaw by that time it be say a popular preacher when expel from oxford in 1644 by the puritan parliament because of he refusal to sign they covenant become a roman catholic he die about the age of thirty-four a canon of the church of loretto there be much in he verse of that sentimentalism which i have already say in speaking of southwell be rife in modern catholic poetry i will give from crashaw a specimen of the kind of it avoid a more sacred object one stanza from a poem of thirty-one most musical and full of lovely speech concern the tear of mary magdalen will suit my purpose hail sister spring parent of silver-footed rill ever-bubbling thing thaw crystal snowy hill still spend never spend -- i mean thy fair eye sweet magdalene the poem be call _ the weeper _ and be radiant of delicate fancy but surely such tone be not worthy of flit moth-like about the holy sorrow of a repentant woman fantastically beautiful they but play with she grief sorrow herself would put she shoe off she foot in approach the weep magdalene they make much of she indeed but they show she little reverence there be in they notwithstanding they fervor of amorous word a coldness like that which dwell in the ghostly beauty of icicle shine in the moon but i almost reproach myself for introduce crashaw thus i have to point out the fact and now have do with it i could heartily wish i have room to expatiate on he loveliness even in such poem as _ the weeper _ he _ divine epigram _ be not the most beautiful but they be to I the most valuable of he verse inasmuch as they make we feel afresh the truth which he set forth anew in they some of the fact of we lord 's life and teaching look out upon we as from clear window of the past as epigram too they be excellent -- point as a lance _ upon the sepulchre of we lord _ here where we lord once lay he head now the grave lie buriëd _ the widow 's mite _ two mite two drop yet all she house and land

place be little comfort the church itself with all its memory of the lord the gospel-story and all theory about he be but he tomb until we find himself _ come see the place-where the lord lay _ show I himself himself bright sir oh show which way my poor tear to himself may go be it enough to show the place and say look mary here see where thy lord once lay then could i show these arm of mine and say look mary here see where thy lord once lay from one of eight line on the mother mary look on she child in she lap i take the last two complete in themselves and i think best alone this new guest to she eye new law have give : 'twa once _ look up _ ` tis now _ look down to heaven _ and here be perhaps he best _ two go up into the temple to pray _ two go to pray oh rather say one go to brag the other to pray one stand up close and tread on high where the other dare not lend he eye one nearer to god 's altar tread the other to the altar 's god this appear to I perfect here be the true relation between the form and the end of religion the priesthood the altar and all its ceremony must vanish from between the sinner and he god when the priest forget he mediation of a servant he duty of a door-keeper to the temple of truth and take upon he the office of a intercessor he stand between man and god and be a satan a adversary artistically consider the poem could hardly be improve here be another contain a similar lesson _ i be not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof _ thy god be make haste into thy roof thy humble faith and fear keep he aloof he 'll be thy guest : because he may not be he 'll come -- into thy house no into thee the follow be a world-wide intercession for they that know not what they do of those that reject the truth who can be say ever to have _ truly _ see it a man must be good to see truth it be a thought suggest by we lord 's word not a irreverent opposition to the truth of _ they _ _ but now they have see and hate _ _ see _ and yet _ hate thee

slide gracefully into each other and there be no confusion or incongruity : the result be a inclined plane of development i now come to the most musical and most graceful therefore most lyrical of he

he head chapter xviii a mount of vision -- henry vaughan we have now arrive at the border of a long dreary tract which happily for my reader i can shorten for they in this my retrospect from the height of henry vaughan 's verse i look across a stony region with a few feeble oasis scatter over it and a hazy green in the distance it do not soften the dreariness that its stone be all lay in order that the space which should be meadow be skilfully pave henry vaughan belong to the mystical school but he poetry rule he theory you find no more of the mystic than the poet can easily govern in fact scarcely more than be necessary to the highest poetry he develop he mysticism upward with relation to he higher nature alone : it blossom into poetry he twin-brother thoma develop he mysticism downward in the direction of the material science -- a true effort still but one in which the danger of cease to be true increase with increase ratio the further it be carry they be bear in south wale in the year 1621 thoma be a clergyman henry a doctor of medicine both be royalist and both suffer in the cause -- thoma by expulsion from he live henry by imprisonment thoma die soon after the restoration henry outlive the revolution henry vaughan be then nearly thirty year younger than george herbert whom he consciously and intentionally imitate he art be not comparable to that of herbert : hence herbert remain the master for it be not the thought that make the poet it be the utterance of that think in worthy presence of speech he be careless and somewhat rugged if he can get he thought dress and thus make visible he do not mind the dress fitting awkwardly or even be a little out at elbow and yet he have grander line and phrase than any in herbert he have occasionally a daring success that strike one with astonishment in a word he say more splendid thing than herbert though he write inferior poem he thought be profound and just the harmony in he soul be true its artistic and musical ear be defective he movement be sometimes grand sometimes awkward herbert be always gracious -- i use the word as mean much more than _ graceful _ the follow poem will instance vaughan 's fine mysticism and odd embodiment : cock-crowing father of light what sunny seed what glance of day hast thou confine into this bird to all the breed this busy ray thou hast assign they magnetism work all night and dream of paradise and light they eye watch for the morning hue they little grain -lrb- 143 -rrb- expel night so shine and sing as if it know the path unto the house of light : it seem they candle howe'er do be tine -lrb- 144 -rrb- and light at the sun if such a tincture such a touch so firm a longing can empower shall thy own image think it much to watch for thy appear hour if a mere blast so fill the sail shall not the breath of god prevail o thou immortal light and heat whose hand so shine through all this frame that by the beauty of the seat we plainly see who make the same see thy seed abide in I dwell thou in it and i in thee to sleep without thee be to die yea ` tis a death partake of hell for where thou dost not close the eye it never open i can tell : in such a dark egyptian border the shades of death dwell and disorder its joy and hope and earnest throw and heart whose pulse beat still for light be give to bird who but thee know a love-sick soul 's exalted flight can soul be track by any eye but he who give they wing to fly only this veil which thou hast break and must be break yet in I this veil i say be all the cloak and cloud which shadow I from thee this veil thy full-eyed love deny and only gleam and fraction spy o take it off make no delay but brush I with thy light that i may shine unto a perfect day and warm I at thy glorious eye o take it off or till it flee though with no lily stay with I i have no room for poem often quote therefore not for that lovely one begin they be all go into the world of light but i must not omit _ the retreat _ for besides its worth i have another reason for present it the retreat happy those early day when i shined in my angel-infancy before i understand this place appoint for my second race or teach my soul to fancy ought but a white celestial thought when yet i have not walk above a mile or two from my first love and look back at that short space could see a glimpse of he bright face when on some gilded cloud or flower my gaze soul would dwell a hour and in those weaker glory spy some shadow of eternity before i teach my tongue to wind my conscience with a sinful sound or have the black art to dispense a several sin to every sense but feel through all this fleshly dress bright shoot of everlastingness o how i long to travel back and tread again that ancient track that i might once more reach that plain where first i leave my glorious train from whence the enlighten spirit see that shady city of palm-tree but ah my soul with too much stay be drunk and stagger in the way some man a forward motion love but i by backward step would move and when this dust fall to the urn in that state i come return let any one who be well acquaint with wordsworth 's grand ode -- that on the _ intimation of immortality _ -- turn he mind to a comparison between that and this : he will find the resemblance remarkable whether _ the retreat _ suggest the form of the _ ode _ be not of much consequence for the _ ode _ be the outcome at once and essence of all wordsworth 's theory and whatever he may have draw from _ the retreat _ be glorified in the _ ode _ still it be interesting to compare they vaughan believe with wordsworth and some other great man that this be not we first stage of existence that we be haunt by dim memory of a former state this belief be not necessary however to sympathy with the poem for whether the present be we first life or no we have come from god and bring from he conscience and a thousand godlike gift -- happy those early day vaughan begin : there be a time begin wordsworth when the earth seem apparel in celestial light before i understand this place continue vaughan : blank misgiving of a creature move about in world not realize say wordsworth a white celestial thought say vaughan : heaven lie about we in we infancy say wordsworth a mile or two off i could see he face say vaughan : trail cloud of glory do we come say wordsworth on some gilded cloud or flower my gaze soul would dwell a hour say vaughan : the hour of splendor in the grass of glory in the flower say wordsworth wordsworth 's poem be the profounder in its philosophy as well as far the grander and lovelier in its poetry but in the moral relation vaughan 's poem be the more definite of the two and give we in its close poor as that be compare with the rest of it just what we feel be want in wordsworth 's -- the hope of return to the bliss of childhood we may be comfort for what we lose by what we gain but that be not a recompense large enough to be divine : we want both vaughan will be a child again for the movement of man 's life be in spiral : we go back whence we come ever return on we former trace only upon a higher level on the next upward coil of the spiral so that it be a go back and a go forward ever and both at once life be as it be a constant repentance or thinking of it again : the childhood of the kingdom take the place of the childhood of the brain but comprise all that be lovely in the former delight the heavenly child will subdue kingdom work righteousness wax valiant in fight rout the army of the alien merry of heart as when in the nursery of this world they fight they fancy frigate and defend they toy-battlements here be the beginning and end of another of similar purport : childhood i can not reach it and my strive

study now and scan thee more than e'er i study man and only see through a long night thy edge and thy border light o for thy center and mid-day for sure that be the narrow way many a true thought come out by the help of a fancy or half-playful exercise of the think power there be a good deal of such fancy in the follow poem but in the end it rise to the height of the purest and best mysticism we must not forget that the deepest man can utter will be but the type or symbol of a something deeper yet of which he can perceive only a doubtful glimmer this will serve for general remark upon the mystical mode as well as for comment explanatory of the close of the poem the night john iii 2 through that pure virgin-shrine that sacred veil -lrb- 145 -rrb- draw o'er thy glorious noon that man

_ than any of george herbert 's i use the word with intended precision here be one the end of which be not so good poetically consider as the magnificent beginning but which contain striking line throughout : -- the dawn ah what time wilt thou come when shall that cry _ the bridegroom 's come _ fill the sky shall it in the evening run when we word and work be do or will thy all-surprising light break at midnight when either sleep or some dark pleasure possesseth mad man without measure or shail these early fragrant hour unlock thy bower -lrb- 151 -rrb- and with they blush of light descry thy lock crown with eternity indeed it be the only time that with thy glory doth best chime : all now be stir every field full hymn doth yield the whole creation shake off night and for thy

far that morning-star o at what time soever thou unknown to we the heaven wilt bow and with thy angel in the van descend to judge poor careless man grant i may not like puddle lie in a corrupt security where if a traveller water crave he find it dead and in a grave but as this restless vocal spring all day and night doth run and sing and though here bear yet be acquaint elsewhere and flow keep untainted so let I all my busy age in thy free service engage and though while here of force -lrb- 153 -rrb- i must have commerce sometimes with poor dust -lrb- 154 -rrb- and in my flesh though vile and low as this doth in she channel flow yet let my course my aim my love and chief acquaintance be above so when that day and hour shall come in which thyself will be the sun thou ` lt find I drest and on my way watch the break of thy great day i do not think that description of the dawn have ever be surpass the verse all expect some sudden matter be wondrously fine the water dead and in a grave because stagnant be a true fancy and the acquaint elsewhere of the run stream be a masterly phrase i need not point out the symbolism of the poem i do not know a writer wordsworth not except who reveal more delight in the vision of nature than henry vaughan he be a true forerunner of wordsworth inasmuch as the latter set forth with only greater profundity and more art than he the relation between nature and human nature while on the other hand he be the forerunner as well of some one that must yet do what wordsworth have leave almost unattempted namely -- set forth the sympathy of nature with the aspiration of the spirit that be bear of god bear again i mean in the recognition of the child 's relation to the father both herbert and vaughan have thus read nature the latter turn many leaf which few besides have turn in this he have strike upon a deeper and richer lode than even wordsworth although he have not work it with half he skill in any history of the development of the love of the present age for nature vaughan although i fear he influence would be find to have be small as yet must be represent as the phosphor of come dawn beside he thomson be cold artistic and gray : although larger in scope he be not to be compare with he in sympathetic sight it be this insight that make vaughan a mystic he can see one thing everywhere and all thing the same -- yet each with a thousand side that radiate cross light even as the airy particle around we for he everything be the expression of and point back to some fact in the divine thought along the line of every ray he look towards its radiate center -- the heart of the maker i could give many instance of vaughan 's power in read the heart of nature but i may not dwell upon this phase almost all the poem i give and have give will afford such i walk the other day to spend my hour into a field where i sometimes have see the soil to yield a gallant flower but winter now have ruffle all the bower and curious store i know there heretofore yet i whose search love not to peep and peer i ' th ' face of thing think with myself there might be other spring besides this here which like cold friend see we but once a year and so the flower might have some other bower then take up what i could nearest spy i digged about that place where i have see he to grow out and by and by i see the warm recluse alone to lie where fresh

forth most fair and young this past i throw the clothes quite o'er he head and sting with fear of my own frailty drop down many a tear upon he bed then sigh whisper _ happy be the dead what peace doth now rock he asleep below _ and yet how few believe such doctrine spring from a poor root which all the winter sleep here under foot and have no wing to raise it to the truth and light of thing but be still tread by every wander clod o thou whose spirit do at first inflame and warm the dead and by a sacred incubation feed with life this frame which once have neither be form nor name grant i may so thy step track here below that in these mask and shadow i may see thy sacred way and by those hide ascent climb to that day which break from thee who art in all thing though invisibly : show I thy peace thy mercy love and ease and from this care where dream and sorrow reign lead I above where light joy leisure and true comfort move without all pain : there hide in thee show I he life again at

capable of see in nature he become either a man of appliance a man of science a mystic or a poet i must now give two that be simple in think construction and music the latter ought to be popular from the nature of its rhythmic movement and the holy merriment it carry but in the former note how the major key of gladness change in the third stanza to the minor key of aspiration which have always some sadness in it a sadness which deepen to grief in the next stanza at the consciousness of unfitness for christ 's company but be lift by hope almost again to gladness in the last christ 's nativity awake glad heart get up and sing it be the birthday of thy king awake awake the sun doth shake light from he lock and all the way breathing perfume doth spice the day awake awake hark how the wood ring wind whisper and the busy spring a concert make : awake awake man be they high-priest and should rise to offer up the sacrifice i would i be some bird or star fluttering in wood or lift far above this inn and road of sin then either star or bird should be shine or singing still to thee i would i have in my best part fit room for thee or that my heart be so clean as thy manger be but i be

here be one in which the peculiarity of he theory show themselves very prominently there be a constant tendency in such to wander into the region half-spiritual half-material the aspiration how long

danger of give way to impulse let it be anger or what it may than in the moment when he have just descend from this mount of contemplation we find ourselves now in the zone of _ hymn _ - write from

with especial pleasure that i refer to a little book which be once a household treasure in a multitude of family -lrb- 156 -rrb- the _ spiritual song _ of john mason a clergyman in the county of buckingham the date of he birth do not appear to be know but the first edition of these song -lrb- 157 -rrb- be publish in 1683 dr watt be very fond of they : would that he have write with similar modesty of style a few of they be still popular in congregational singing here be the first in the book : a general song of praise to almighty god how shall i sing that majesty which angel do admire let dust in dust and silence lie sing sing ye heavenly choir thousand of thousand stand around thy throne o god most high ten thousand time ten thousand sound thy praise but who be i thy brightness

another series call _ penitential cry _ by the rev thoma shepherd who for a short time a clergyman in buckinghamshire become the minister of the congregational church at northampton afterwards under the care of doddridge although he be a imitator of mason some of he hymn be admirable the follow i think one of the best : -- for communion with god alas my god that we should be such stranger to each

expression equal to that of wither and a quaint simplicity of thought and form like that of herrick while the very charm of some of the best line be they spontaneity the man have just enough mysticism to afford they homeliest figure for deepest feeling i turn to the accomplished joseph addison he be bear in 1672 he religious poem be so well know and be for the greater part so ordinary in everything but they simplicity of composition that i should hardly have care to choose one have it not be that we owe he much gratitude for what he do in the reign of anne and george i to purify the moral taste of the english people at a time when the influence of the clergy be not for elevation and to teach the love of a higher literature when milton be little known and less esteemed especially be we indebted to he for he modest and admirable criticism of the _ paradise lose _ in the _ spectator _ of those few poem to which i have refer i choose the best know because it be the best it have to I a charm for which i can hardly account yet i imagine i see in it a sign of the poetic time : a flatness of spirit arise from the evanishment of the mystical element begin to result in a worship of power neither power nor wisdom though infinite both could constitute a god worthy of the worship of a human soul and the worship of such a god must sink to the level of that fancy divinity small wonder be it then that the lyric should now droop its wing and moult the feather of its praise i do not say that god 's more glorious attribute be already forget but that the tendency of the christian lyric be now to laudation of power -- and knowledge a form of the same -- as _ the _ essential of godhead this indicate no recall of metaphysical question such as we have meet in foregoing verse but a decline towards system a rise passion -- if anything so cold may be call _ a passion _ -- for the reduction of all thing to the form of the understand a declension which have prepare the way for the present worship of science and its refusal if not denial of all that can not be prove in form of the intellect the hymn which have lead to these remark be still good although like the loveliness of the red and lower west it give sign of a gray and cheerless dawn under whose dreariness the child will first doubt if he father love he and next doubt if he have a father at all and be not a mere foundling that nature have lift from she path the spacious firmament on high with all the blue etherial sky and spangled heaven a shine frame they great original proclaim the unwearied sun from day to day do he creator 's power display and publish to every land the work of a almighty hand soon as the evening shades prevail the moon take up the wondrous tale and nightly to the listen earth repeat the story of she birth whilst all the star that round she burn and all the planet in they turn confirm the tiding as they roll and spread the truth from pole to pole what though in solemn silence all move round the dark terrestrial ball what though no real voice nor sound amidst they radiant orb be find in reason 's ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voice for ever singing as they shine : the hand that make we be divine the very use of the word _ spangled _ and _ frame _ seem -- to my fancy only it may be -- to indicate a tendency towards the unworthy and theatrical yet the second stanza be lovely beyond a doubt and the whole be most artistic although after a tame fashion whether indeed the heavenly body _ teach _ what he say or whether we should read divinity worthy of the name in they at all without the human revelation which heal man i doubt much that divinity be there -- _ yes _ that we could read it there without have see the face of the son of man first i think -- _ no _ i do not therefore dare imagine that no revelation dimly lead towards such result glimmer in the heart of god 's choose amongst jew and gentile before he come what i say be that power and order although of god and prepare the way for he be not he revealer unto man no doubt king david compare the perfection of god 's law to the glory of the heaven but he do not learn that perfection from the heaven

watt bear in 1674 the result must be dreadful where fervor will poetize without the aidful restraint of art and modesty if any man would look upon absurdity in the garb of sobriety let he search dryden 's _ annus mirabili _ : dr watt 's _ lyric _ be as bad they be fantastic to utter folly a admiration of the incomparable mr cowley do the sense of they more injury than the imitation of he rough-cantering ode could do they rhythm the sentimentality of roman catholic writer towards we lord and he mother be not half so offensive as the courtier-like flattery dr watt offer to the most high to say nothing of the irreverence the vulgarity be offensive he afford another instance amongst thousand how little the form in which feeling be express have to do with the feeling itself in he the thought be true the form of its utterance false the feeling lovely the word often to a degree repulsive the ugly web be cross now and then by a fine line and even damask with a occasional good poem : i have find two and only two in the whole of he seventy-five _ lyric sacred to devotion _ he objectivity and boldness of thought and he freedom of utterance cause we ever and anon to lament that he have not the humility and faith of a artist as well as of a christian almost all he symbol indicate a worship of power and of outward show i give the best of the two good poem i have mention and very

devotion break the prison-wall and speed my last remove he psalm and hymn be immeasurably better than he lyric dreadful some of they be and i doubt if there be one from which we would not wish stanza line and word absent but some be very fine the man who could write such verse as these ought not to have write as he have write : -- have i a glance of thee my god kingdom and man would vanish soon vanish as though i see they not as a dim candle die at noon then they might fight and rage and rave : i should perceive the noise no more than we can hear a shake leaf while rattle thunder round we

proportion indeed to the mass of he labor we can not help wish that he have write about the twentieth part we could not have too much of he best such as this : be earth with all she scene withdraw let noise and vanity begone : in secret silence of the mind my heaven and there my god i find but there be no occasion for the best to be so plentiful : a little of it will go a great way and as we best

only make my book heavy and destroy the song-idea i must here pass by one of the best of such poem _ the complaint or night thought _ of dr young nor be there anything else of he i care to quote i must give just one poem of pope bear in 1688 the year of the revolution the flamboyant style of he _ messiah _ be to I detestable : nothing can be more unlike the simplicity of christianity all such equally with those by whatever hand that would be religious by be miserable i reject at once along with all that be merely commonplace religious exercise but this at least be very unlike the rest of

heartily adopt many of he view he have leave we a number of religious poem which be seldom so sweet in music as they be profound in the metaphysics of religion here we have yet again a mystical thread run radiant athwart both warp and woof of we poetic web : the mystical thinker will ever be find the reviver of religious poetry and although some of the seed have come from afar both in time and space byrom 's verse be of indigenous growth much of the thought of the present day will be find in he verse here be a specimen of he metrical argumentation it be take from a series of _ meditation for every day in passion week _ Wednesday _ christ satisfieth the justice of god by fulfil all righteousness _ justice demandeth satisfaction -- yes and ought to have it where injustice be : but there be none in god -- it can not mean demand of justice where it have full reign : to dwell in man it rightfully demand such as he come from he creator 's hand man have depart from a righteous state which he at first must have if god create : ` tis therefore call god 's righteousness and must be satisfy by man 's become just must exercise good vengeance upon man till it regain its rights in they again this be the justice for which christ become a man to satisfy its righteous claim become redeemer of the human race that sin in they to justice might give place : to satisfy a just and righteous will be neither more nor less than to fulfil \* \* \* \* \* here be two stanza of one of more mystical reflection : a penitential soliloquy what though no object strike upon the sight thy sacred presence be a inward light what though no sound shall penetrate the ear to listen think the voice of truth be clear sincere devotion need no outward shrine the center of a humble soul be thine there may i worship and there mayst thou place thy seat of mercy and thy throne of grace yea fix if christ my advocate appear the dread tribunal of thy justice there let each vain thought let each impure desire meet in thy wrath with a consuming fire and here be two of more lyrical favor the soul 's tendency towards its true center stone towards the earth descend river to the ocean roll every motion have some end : what be thine beloved soul mine be where my savior be there with he i hope to dwell : jesu be the central bliss love the force that doth impel truly thou hast answer right : now may heaven 's attractive grace towards the source of thy delight speed along thy quicken pace thank thee for thy generous care : heaven that do the wish inspire through thy instrumental prayer plume the wing of my desire now methink aloft i fly now with angel bear a part : glory be to god on high peace to every christian heart the answer to the desponding soul cheer up desponding soul thy longing pleased i see : ` tis part of that great whole wherewith i long for thee wherewith i long for thee and leave my father 's throne from death to set thee free to claim thee for my own to claim thee for my own i suffer on the cross : o be my love but know no soul could fear its loss no soul could fear its loss but fill with love divine would die on its own cross and rise for ever mine surely there be poetry as well as truth in this but certainly in general he thought be far in excess of he poetry here be a few verse which i shall once more entitle divine epigram with peaceful mind thy race of duty run god nothing do or suffer to be do but what thou wouldst thyself if thou couldst see through all event of thing as well as he \* \* \* \* \* think and be careful what thou art within for there be sin in the desire of sin : think and be thankful in a different case for there be grace in the desire of grace \* \* \* \* \* a heated fancy or imagination may be mistake for a inspiration true but be this conclusion fair to make -- that inspiration must be all mistake a pebble-stone be not a diamond : true but must a diamond be a pebble too to own a god who do not speak to man be first to own and then disown again of all idolatry the total sum be have god that be both deaf and dumb \* \* \* \* \* what be more tender than a mother 's love to the sweet infant fondle in she arm what argument need

love of god to man \* \* \* \* \* faith hope and love be question what they think of future glory which religion teach : now faith believe it firmly to be true and hope expect so to find it too : love answer smile with a conscious glow believe expect i _ know _ it to be so chapter xx the root of the hill in the poem of jame thomson we find two hymn to the god of creation -- one in blank verse the other in stanza they be of the kind which from he we should look for the one in blank verse which be as a epilogue to he great poem _ the season _ i prefer we owe much to thomson bear -lrb- in scotland -rrb- in the year 1700 he be the lead priest in a solemn procession to find god -- not in the law by which he have order he creation but in the beauty which be the outcome of those law i do not say there be much of the relation of man to nature in he write but thitherward it tend he be true about the outside of god and in thomson we begin to feel that the revelation of god as _ meaning _ and therefore _ be _ the loveliness of nature be about to be recognize i do not say -- to change my simile -- that he be the first visible root in we literature whence we can follow the outburst of the flower and foliage of we delight in nature : i could show a hundred fiber lead from the depths of we old literature up to the great root nor be it surprising that with he age about he he too should be find tend to magnify not god 's word but he work above all he name : we have beauty for loveliness beneficence for tenderness i have wonder whether one great part of napoleon 's mission be not to wake people from this idolatry of the power of god to the adoration of he love the _ hymn _ hold a kind of middle place between the _ morning hymn _ in the 5th book of the _ paradise lose _ and the _ hymn in the vale of chamounus _ it would be interesting and instructive to compare the three but we have not time thomson have be influence by milton and coleridge by both we have delight in milton art in thomson heart include both in coleridge hymn these as they change almighty father these be but the varied god the rolling year be full of thee forth in the please spring thy beauty walk thy tenderness and love wide flush the field the softening air be balm echo the mountain round the forest smile and every sense and every heart be joy then come thy glory in the summer month with

the song not the living presence of creative love which never sing its own praise but spend itself in give still although there have pass away a glory from the world of song although the fervor of childlike worship have vanish for a season there be sign in these verse of a new dawn of devotion even the exclusive and therefore blind worship of science will when it have turn the coil of the ascend spiral result in a new song to he that make heaven and earth and the sea and the fountain of water but first for a long time the worship of power will go on there be one sonnet by kirke white eighty-five year younger than thomson which be quite pagan in its mode of glorify the power of the deity but about the same time when thomson 's _ season _ be publish which be in 1730 the third year of george ii that life which have burn on in the hidden corner of the church in spite of the worldliness and sensuality of its ruler begin to show a flame destine to enlarge and spread until it should have light up the mass with a outburst of christian faith and hope i refer to the movement call methodism in the midst of which at a early stage of its history arise the direct energy of john wesley a man send of god to deepen at once and purify its motive influence what he and he friend teach would i presume in its essence amount mainly to this : that acquiescence in the doctrine of the church be no fulfilment of duty -- or anything indeed short of a obedient recognition of personal relation to god who have send every man the message of present salvation in he son a new life begin to bud and blossom from the dry stem of the church the spirit move upon the water of feeling and the new undulation break on the shore of think in a outburst of new song for while john wesley rouse the heart of the people to sing he brother charle put song in they mouth i do not say that many of these song possess much literary merit but many of they be real lyric : they have that essential element song in they the follow however be a very fine poem that certain expression in it may not seem offensive it be necessary to keep the allegory of jacob and the angel in full view -- even better in view perhaps than the writer do himself wrestle jacob come o thou traveller unknown whom still i hold but can not see my company before be go and i be leave alone with thee with thee all night i mean to stay and wrestle till the break of day i need not tell thee who i be my misery or sin declare thyself hast call I by my name : look on my hand and read it there but who i ask thee who art thou tell I thy name and tell I now in vain thou struggle to get free : i never will unloose my hold art thou the man that die for I the secret of thy love unfold wrestle i will not let thee go till i thy name thy nature know \* \* \* \* \* what though my sink flesh complain and murmur to contend so long i rise superior to my pain : when i be weak then i be strong and when my all of strength shall fail i shall with the god-man prevail my strength be go my nature die i sink beneath thy weighty hand : faint to revive and fall to rise i fall and yet by faith i stand -- i stand and will not let thee go till i thy name thy nature know yield to I now for i be weak but confident in self-despair speak to my heart in blessing speak be conquer by my instant -lrb- 161 -rrb- prayer speak or thou never hence shalt move and tell I if thy name be love ` tis love ` tis love thou diedst for I i hear thy whisper in my heart the morning break the shadow flee : pure universal love thou art to I to all thy bowels move : thy nature and thy name be love my prayer have power with god the grace unspeakable i now receive through faith i see thee face to face -- i see thee face to face and live : in vain i have not weep and strive thy nature and thy name be love i know thee savior -- who thou art -- jesus the feeble sinner 's friend nor wilt thou with the night depart but stay and love I to the end thy mercy never shall remove : thy nature and thy name be love \* \* \* \* \* contented now upon my thigh i halt till life 's short journey end all helplessness all weakness i on thee alone for strength depend nor have i power from thee to move : thy nature and thy name be love lame as i be i take the prey hell earth and sin with ease o'ercome i leap for joy pursue my way and as a bound hart fly home through all eternity to prove thy nature and thy name be love it seem to I that the art with which he very difficult end in the management of the allegory be reach be admirable i have omit three stanza i can not give much from william cowper he poem -- graceful always and often devout even when playful -- have few amongst they that be expressly religious while the best of he hymn be know to every reader of such bear in 1731 he be greatly influence by the narrow theology that prevail in he circle and most of he hymn be mar by the exclusiveness which belong to the system and not to the man there be little of it in the following : -- far from the world o lord i flee from strife and tumult far from scene where satan wages still he most successful war the calm retreat the silent shade with prayer and praise agree and seem by thy sweet bounty make for those who follow thee there if thy spirit touch the soul and grace she mean abode oh with what peace and joy and love she commune with she god there like the nightingale she pour she solitary lay nor ask a witness of she song nor thirst for human praise author and guardian of my life sweet source of light divine and -- all harmonious name in one -- my savior thou art mine what thanks i owe thee and what love -- a boundless endless store -- shall echo through the realm above when time shall be no more sad as be cowper 's history with the vapor of a low insanity if not always fill he garden yet ever brood on the hill-top of he horizon he be through he faith in god however darken by the introversion of a neat poverty-stricken theology yet able to lead he life to the end it be delightful to discover that when science which be the anatomy of nature have poison the theology of the country in create a demand for clean-cut theory in infinite affair the loveliness and truth of the countenance of live nature could calm the mind which this theology have irritated to the very border of madness and give a peace and hope which the man be altogether right in attribute to the spirit of god how many have be thus comfort who know not like wordsworth the immediate channel of they comfort or even with cowper recognize its source god give while man sleep chapter xxi the new vision william blake the painter of many strange and fantastic but often powerful -- sometimes very beautiful picture -- write poem of a equally remarkable kind some of they be as lovely as they be careless while many present a curious contrast in the apparent incoherence of the simplest language he be bear in 1757 towards the close of the reign of george ii possibly if he have be send to a age more capable of understand he he genius would not have be tempt to utter itself with such a wildness as appear to indicate hopeless indifference to be understand we can not tell sometimes whether to attribute the bewilderment the poem cause in we to a mysticism run wild or to regard it as the reflex of madness in the writer here be a lyrical gem however although not cut with mathematical precision daybreak to find the western path right through the gate of wrath i urge my way sweet morning lead I on : with soft repentant moan i see the break of day the war of sword and spear melt by dewy tear exhale on high the sun be free from fear and with soft grateful tear ascend the sky the follow be full of truth most quaintly express with a homeliness of phrase quite delicious it be one of the _ song of innocence _ publish as we learn from gilchrist 's life of blake in the year 1789 they be engrave on copper with illustration by blake and print and bind by he wife when we consider they in respect of the time when they be produce we find they marvellous for they originality and simplicity on another 's sorrow can i see another 's woe and not be in sorrow too can i see another 's grief and not seek for kind relief can i see a fall tear and not feel my sorrow 's share can a father see he child weep nor be with sorrow fill can a mother sit and hear a infant groan a infant fear no no never can it be never never can it be and can he who smile on all hear the wren with sorrow small -- hear the small bird 's grief and care hear the woe that infant bear and not sit beside the nest pour pity in they breast and not sit the cradle near weep tear on infant 's tear and not sit both night and day wipe all we tear away oh no never can it be never never can it be he doth give he joy to all he become a infant small he become a man of woe he doth feel the sorrow too think not thou canst sigh a sigh and thy maker be not by think not thou canst weep a tear and thy maker be not near oh he give to we he joy that we grief he may destroy : till we grief be flee and go he doth sit by we and moan there be we mystic yet again lead the way a supreme regard for science and the worship of power go hand in hand : that knowledge be power have be esteem the grandest incitement to study yet the antidote to the disproportionate cultivation of science be simply power in its crude form -- break out that be as brute force when science isolate and glorified have produce a contempt not only for vulgar error but for the truth which be incapable of scientific proof then as we see in the french revolution the wild beast in man break from its den and chaos return but all the noblest mind in europe look for grand thing in the aurora of this uprising of the people to the terrible disappointment that follow we be indebted for the training of wordsworth to the priesthood of nature 's temple so be he possess with the hope of a come deliverance for the nation that he spend many month in france during the revolution at length he be force to seek safety at home deject even to hopelessness for a time he believe in nothing how could there be a god that rule in the earth when such a rise sun of promise be permit to set in such a sea but for man to worship himself be a far more terrible thing than that blood should flow like water : the righteous plague of god allow thing to go as they would for a time but the power of god come upon wordsworth -- i can not say as it have never come before but with a add insight which make he recognize in the fresh gift all that he have know and feel of such in the past to he as to cowper the benignity of nature restore peace and calmness and hope -- sufficient to enable he to look back and gather wisdom he be first troubled then quiet and then teach such presence of the father have be a infinitely more active power in the redemption of man than man have yet become capable of perceive the divine expression of nature that be the face of the father therein visible begin to heal the plague which the worship of knowledge have breed and the power of she teaching grow from comfort to prayer as will be see in the poem i shall give higher than all that nature can do in the way of direct lessoning be the production of such holy mood as result in hope conscience of duty and supplication those who have never feel it have to be tell there be in she such a power -- yield to which the meek inherit the earth ninth evening voluntary _ compose upon a evening of extraordinary

wordsworth before coleridge because he be two year older yet coleridge have much to do with the opening of wordsworth 's eye to such vision as indeed more than any man in we time he have open the eye of the english people to see wonderful thing there be little of a directly religious kind in he poetry yet we find in he what we miss in wordsworth a inclined plane from the revelation in nature to the culminate revelation in the son of man somehow i say perhaps because we find it in he prose we feel more of this in coleridge 's verse coleridge be a sage and wordsworth be a seer yet when the sage see that be when like the son of beor he fall into a trance have he eye open or when feeling and sight be one and philosophy be in abeyance the ecstasy be even loftier in coleridge than in wordsworth in they highest mood they seem almost to change place -- wordsworth to become sage and coleridge seer perhaps the grandest hymn of praise which man the mouth-piece of nature utter for she be the hymn of mont blanc hymn _ before sunrise in the vale of chamounus _ hast thou a charm to stay the morning star in he steep course -- so long he seem to pause on thy bald awful head o sovran

weep beside he foot the weight of sin oppress she heart for all the blame and the poor malice of the worldly shame to she be past extinct and out of date only the _ sin _ remain -- the leprous state she would be melt by the heat of love by fire far fiercer than be blow to prove and purge the silver ore adulterate she sit and weep and with she untressed hair still wipe the foot she be so blest to

implicit insight of the heart the late dean milman bear in 1791 best know by he very valuable labor in history may be take as represent a class of writer in whom the poetic fire be ever on the point and only on the point of break into a flame he composition be admirable -- refined scholarly sometimes rich and even gorgeous in expression -- yet lack that radiance of the unutterable to which the loftiest word owe they grandest power perhaps the best representative of he style be the hymn on the incarnation in he dramatic poem _ the fall of jerusulem _ but as a extract it be tolerably know i prefer give one from he few _ hymn for church service _ eighteenth Sunday after trinity when god come down from heaven -- the living god -- what sign and wonder mark he stately way brake out the wind

enthusiasm of its admirer excellent both in regard of they literary and religious merit true in feeling and thorough in finish the poem always remind I of berlin work in iron -- hard and delicate here be a portion of one of the best of they st matthew ye hermit bless ye holy maid the nearest heaven on earth who talk with god in shadowy glade free from rude care and mirth to whom some viewless teacher bring the secret lore of rural thing the moral of each fleeting cloud and gale the whisper from above that haunt the twilight vale : say when in pity ye have gaze on the wreath would smoke afar that o'er some town like mist upraised hung hiding sun and star then as ye turn you weary eye to the green earth and open sky be ye not fain to doubt how faith could dwell amid that dreary glare in this world 's citadel but love 's a flower that will not die for lack of leafy screen and christian hope can cheer the eye that ne'er saw vernal green : then be ye sure that love can bless even in this crowded loneliness where ever-moving myriad seem to say go -- thou art nought to we nor we to thee -- away there be in this loud stunning tide of human care and crime with whom the melody abide of the everlasting chime who carry music in they heart through dusky lane and wrangle mart ply they daily task with busier foot because they secret soul a holy strain repeat there be here some indication of that strong reaction of the present century towards ancient form of church life this reaction seem to I a further consequence of that admiration of power of which i have speak for find the progress of discovery in the law of nature constantly bring a assurance most satisfactory to the intellect man begin to demand a similar assurance in other matter and whatever department of human thought could not be subject to experiment or do not admit of logical proof begin to be regard with suspicion the highest realm of human thought -- where indeed only grand conviction and that the result not of research but of obedience to the voice within can be have -- come to be by such regard as region where no scientific assurance be procurable it be only to he loss that a man should go wander : the whole affair be unworthy of he and if there be no guide of humanity but the intellect and nothing worthy of its regard but what that intellect can isolate and describe in the form peculiar to its operation -- that be if a man have relation to nothing beyond he definition be not a creature of the immeasurable -- then these man be right but there have appear along with they other thinker who could not thus be satisfy -- man who have in they soul a hunger which the neatest law of nature could not content who could not live on chemistry or mathematics or even on geology without the primal law of _ they _ many dim-dawning wonder -- that be the be if such there might be who think they law first and then embody they in a world of aeonian growth these indeed seek law likewise but a perfect law -- a law they can believe perfect beyond the comprehension of power of whose imperfection they be too painfully conscious they feel in they highest moment a helplessness that drive they to search after some power with a heart deeper than he power who care for the troubled creature he have make but still under the influence of that faithless hunger for intellectual certainty they look about and divide into two party : both would gladly receive the report revelation in jesus the one if they could have evidence enough from without the other if they could only get rid of the difficulty it raise within i be aware that i distinguish in the mass and that both side would be find more or less influence by the same difficulty -- but _ more _ and _ less _ and therefore thus classify by the drive predominance those of the one party then find no proof to be have but that in testimony and anxious to have all they can -- delight too in a certain holy wilfulness of intellectual self-immolation accept the testimony in the mass and become roman catholic nor be it difficult to see how they then find rest it be not the dogma but the contact with christ the truth with christ the man which the dogma in pacify the trouble of the intellect -- if only by a soporific have aid they in reach that give they peace : it be the truth itself that make they free the worshipper of science will themselves allow that when they can not gain observation enough to satisfy they upon any point in which a law of nature be involve they must if possible institute experiment i say therefore to those whose observation have not satisfied they concern the phenomenon christianity -- where be you experiment why do you not thus try the utterance claim to be the law of life call it a hypothesis and experiment upon it carry into practice well justified of you conscience the word which the man speak for therein he say himself lie the possibility of you acceptance of he mission and if after reasonable time thus spend you be not yet convince enough to give testimony -- i will not annoy you by say _ to fact _ but -- to conviction i think neither will you be ready to abandon the continuous experiment these roman catholic have thus meet with jesus come into personal contact with he : by the do of what he tell we and by nothing else be they bless what if they theory show to I like a burning of the temple and a look for the god in the ash they know in whom they have believe and if some of we think we have a more excellent way we shall be bless indeed if the result be no less excellent than in such man as faber newman and aubrey de vere no man need be afraid that to speak the truth concern such will hasten the dominance of alien and oppressive power the truth be free and to be just be to be strong should the time come again when liberty be in danger those who have defend the truth even in she adversary if such there be will be find the readiest to draw the sword for she and hate not yet smite for the liberty to do even they justice to give the justice we claim for ourselves be if there be a christ the law of christ to obey which be eternally better than truest theory i should like to give many of the hymn of dr faber some of they be grand other very lovely and some of course to my mind considerably repulsive he seem to I to go wrong nowhere in originate -- he produce nothing unworthy except when he reproduce what he never could have entertain but for the pressure of acknowledged authority even such thing however he have enclose in pearl as the oyster its incommode sand-grain he hymn on _ the greatness of god _ be profound that on _ the will of god _ be very wise that to _ the god of my childhood _ be full of quite womanly tenderness : all be most simple in speech remind we in this respect of john mason in he no doubt as in all of he class we find trace of that sentimentalism in the use of epithet -- small word as distinguish from homely apply to great thing -- of which i have speak more than once but criticism be not to be indulge in the reception of great gift -- of such a gift as this for instance : -- the eternity of god o lord my heart be sick sick of this everlasting change and life run tediously quick through its unresting race and vary range : change find no likeness to itself in thee and wake no echo in thy mute eternity dear lord my heart be sick of this perpetual lapsing time so slow in grief in joy so quick yet ever cast shadow so sublime : time of all creature be least like to thee and yet it be we share of thine eternity oh change and time be storm for life so thin and frail as ours for change the work of grace deform with love that soil and help that overpower and time be strong and like some chafe sea it seem to fret the shore of thine eternity weak weak for ever weak we can not hold what we possess youth can not find age will not seek -- oh weakness be the heart 's worst weariness : but weakest heart can lift they thought to thee it make we strong to think of thine eternity thou hadst no youth great god a unbeginning end thou art thy glory in itself abode and still abide in its own tranquil heart : no age can heap its outward year on thee : dear god thou art thyself thine own eternity without a end or bind thy life lie all outspread in light we life feel thy life all around make we weakness strong we darkness bright yet be it neither wilderness nor sea but the calm gladness of a full eternity oh thou art very great to set thyself so far above but we partake of thine estate establish in thy strength and in thy love : that love have make eternal room for I in the sweet vastness of its own eternity oh thou art very meek to overshade thy creature thus thy grandeur be the shade we seek to be eternal be thy use to we : ah bless god what joy it be to I to lose all thought of self in thine eternity self-wearied lord i come for i have live my life too fast : now that year bring I nearer home grace must be slowly use to make it last when my heart beat too quick i think of thee and of the leisure of thy long eternity farewell vain joy of earth farewell all love that it not he dear god be thou my only mirth thy majesty my single timid bliss oh in the bosom of eternity thou dost not weary of thyself nor we of thee how easily he word flow even when he be say the deepest thing the poem be full of the element of the finest mystical metaphysics and yet there be no effort in they expression the tendency to find god beyond rather than in we daily human condition be discernible but only as a tendency what a pity that the sect be so slow to become acquaint with the grand best in each other i do not find in dr newman either a depth or a precision equal to that of dr faber he earlier poem indicate a less healthy condition of mind he _ dream of gerontius _ be however a finer as more ambitious poem than any of faber 's in my judgment there be weak passage in it with other of real grandeur but i be perfectly aware of the difficulty almost impossibility of do justice to man from some of whose form of thought i be greatly repel who creep from the sunshine into every ruin archway attract by the brilliance with which the light from its loophole glow in its caverned gloom and the hope of discover within it the first step of a stair wind up into the blue heaven i apologize for the unavoidable rudeness of a critic who would fain be honest if he might and i humbly thank all such as dr newman whose verse reveal they saintship make we long to be holier man of he as of faber 's i have room for no more than one it be write off sardinium desolation o say not thou art left of god because he token in the sky thou canst not read : this earth he tread to teach thee he be ever nigh he see beneath the fig-tree green nathaniel con he sacred lore shouldst thou thy chamber seek unseen he enter through the unopened door and when thou liest by slumber bind outweary in the christian fight in glory girt with saint around he stand above thee through the night when friend to emmaus bend they course he join although he hold they eye : or shouldst thou feel some fever 's force he take thy hand he bid thee rise or on a voyage when calm prevail and prison thee upon the sea he walk the wave he wing the sail the shore be gain and thou art free sir aubrey de vere be a poet profound in feeling and gracefully tender in utterance i give one short poem and one sonnet reality love thy god and love he only : and thy breast will ne'er be lonely in that one great spirit meet all thing mighty grave and sweet vainly strive the soul to mingle with a being of we kind : vainly heart with heart be twine : for the deepest still be single a impalpable resistance hold like nature still at distance mortal love that holy one or dwell for aye alone i respond most heartily to the last two line but i venture to add with regard to the precede six love that holy one and the impalpable resistance will vanish for when thou seest he enter to sup with thy neighbor thou wilt love that neighbor as thyself sonnet ye praise the humble : of the meek ye say happy they live among they lowly bower the mountain and the mountain-storm be ours thus self-deceivers fill with pride alway reluctant homage to the good ye pay mingle with scorn like poison suck from flower -- revere the humble godlike be they power : no mendicant for praise of man be they the child who pray in faith thy will be do be blended with that will supreme which move a wilderness of world by thought untrod he share the starry sceptre and the throne : the man who as himself he neighbor love look down on all thing with the eye of god be it a fancy that in the midst of all this devotion and lovely thought i hear the mingled mournful tone of such as have cut off a right hand and pluck out a right eye which have _ not _ cause they to offend this be tenfold better than to have spare offend member but the true christian ambition be to fill the divine scheme of humanity -- abridge nothing ignore nothing deny nothing call nothing unclean but burn everything a thank-offering in the flame of life upon the altar of absolute devotion to the father and savior of man we must not throw away half he gift that we may carry the other half in both hand to he altar but sacred fervor be confine to no sect here it be of the profoundest and utter with a homely tenderness equal to that of the earliest writer mr brown the princess of poet be no partisan if my work be mainly critical i should feel bind to remark upon she false theory of english rhyme and she use of strange word that she be careless too in she general utterance i can not deny but in idea she be noble and in phrase magnificent some of she sonnet be worthy of be range with the best in we language -- those of milton and wordsworth bereavement when some beloved ` neath whose eyelid lay the sweet light of my childhood one by one do leave I dark before the natural sun and i astonied fall and could not pray a thought within I to myself do say be god less god that _ thou _ art leave undo rise worship bless he in this sackcloth spin as in that purple -- but i answer nay what child he filial heart in word can loose if he behold he tender father raise the hand that chasten sorely can he choose but sob in silence with a upward gaze and _ my _ great father think fit to bruise discern in speechless tear both prayer and praise comfort speak low to I my savior low and sweet from out the hallelujah sweet and low lest i should fear and fall and miss thee so who art not miss by any that entreat speak to I as to mary at thy foot -- and if no precious gum my hand bestow let my tear drop like amber while i go in reach of thy divinest voice complete in humanest affection -- thus in sooth to lose the sense of lose as a child whose song-bird seek the wood for evermore be sing to in its stead by mother 's mouth till sink on she breast love-reconcile he sleep the faster that he weep before gladly would i next give myself to the exposition of several of the poem of she husband robert browning especially the _ christmas eve _ and _ easter day _ in the first of which he set forth in marvellous rhyme the necessity both for widest sympathy with the varied form of christianity and for individual choice in regard to communion in the latter what it be to choose the world and lose the life but this would take many page and would be inconsistent with the plan of my book when i have give two precious stanza most wise as well as most lyrical and lovely from the poem of we honor charle kingsley i shall turn to the other of the class into which the devout thinker of the day have divide a farewell my fairest child i have no song to give you no lark could pipe to sky so dull and gray yet ere we part one lesson i can leave you for every day be good sweet maid and let who will be clever do noble thing not dream they all day long and so make life death and that vast for-ever one grand sweet song surely these last who have not accept tradition in the mass who believe that we must as we lord demand of the jew of we own self judge what be right because therein he spirit work with we spirit -- worship the truth not less devotedly than they who rejoice in holy tyranny over they intellect chapter xxiii the question fervor and now i turn to the other class -- that which while the former have flee to tradition for refuge from doubt set its face towards the spiritual east and in prayer and sorrow and hope look for a dawn -- the noble band of reverent doubter -- as unlike those of the last century who scoff as those of the present who pass on the other side they too would know but they know enough already to know further that it be from the hill and not from the mine they aid must come they know that a perfect intellectual proof would leave they doubt all the same that they high question can not be answer to the intellect alone for they whole nature be the questioner that the answer can only come as questioner and they question grow towards they hence grow hope blossoming ever and anon into the white flower of confidence be they answer as yet they hope -- the beatific vision -- the _ happy-making sight _ as milton render the word of the mystic it be strange how gentle a certain large class of the priesthood will be with those who believe there be a god find it hard to trust he and how fierce with those who unable from the lack of harmony around and in they to say they be sure there be a god would yet could they find he trust he indeed ah but answer such of the clergy and they follower you want a god of you own make certainly the doubter reply we do not want a god of you making : that would be to turn the universe into a hell and you into its torture demon we want a god like that man whose name be so often on you lip but whose spirit you understand so little -- so like he that he shall be the bread of life to _ all _ we hunger -- not that hunger only already satisfy in you who take the limit of you present consciousness for that of the race and say ` this be all the world need : ' we know the bitterness of we own heart and you incapacity for intermeddle with its joy we have another mountain-range from whence bursteth a sun unutterably bright nor for we only but for you also who will not have the truth except it come to you in a system authorize of man i have attribute a general utterance to these man widely different from each other as i know they be here be a voice from one of they arthur hugh clough who die in 1861 well beloved it follow upon two fine poem call _ the question spirit _ and _ bethesda _ in which be represent the condition of many of the finest mind of the present century let we receive it as speak by one in the foremost rank of these doubter man revile by they brethren who dare not doubt for fear of offend the god to whom they attribute they own jealousy but god be assuredly please with those who will neither lie for he quench they dim vision of himself nor count _ that _ he mind which they would despise in a man of he make across the sea along the shore in number more and ever more from lonely hut and busy town the valley through the mountain down what be it ye go out to see ye silly folk of galilee the reed that in the wind doth

arnold only my reader must remember that of none of my poet be i free to choose that which be most characteristic : i have the scope of my volume to restrain I the good shepherd with the kid he save the sheep the goat he doth not save so ring tertullian 's sentence on the side of that unpitying phrygian sect which cry : he can no fount of fresh forgiveness lave who sin once wash by the baptismal

but heart inspire true on those wall subterranean where she hide she head in ignominy death and tomb she she good shepherd 's hasty image draw and on he shoulder not a lamb a kid of these writer tennyson be the foremost : he have write _ the _ poem of the hope doubter _ the _ poem of we age the grand minor organ-fugue of _ in memoriam _ it be the cry of the bereaved psyche into the dark infinite after the vanish love he friend be nowhere in he sight and god be silent death god 's final compulsion to prayer in its dread its gloom its utter stillness its apparent nothingness urge the cry meaning over the dead be mingle with profoundest questioning of philosophy the sign of nature and the story of jesus while now and then the star of the morning bright phosphor flash a few ray through the shift cloudy dark and if the sun have not arise on the close of the book yet the aurora of the come dawn give light enough to make the onward journey possible and hopeful : who dare say that he walk in the full light that the counsel of god be to he not a matter of faith but of vision bewilder in the perplexity of nature 's enigma and drive by a awful pain of need tennyson betake himself to the god of nature thus : liv the wish that of the living whole no life may fail beyond the grave derive it not from what we have the likest god within the soul be god and nature then at strife that nature lend such evil dream so careful of the type she seem so careless of the single life that i consider everywhere she secret meaning in she deed and find that of fifty seed she often bring but one to bear i falter where i firmly tread and fall with my weight of care upon the great world 's altar-stair that slope thro ' darkness up to god i stretch lame hand of faith and grope and gather dust and chaff and call to what i feel be lord of all and faintly trust the larger hope -lrb- illustration : he be dead and there he sit and he that bring he back be there -rrb- once more this be how he use the gospel-tale : mary have return home from the sepulchre with lazarus so late its prey and she sister and jesus : -- xxxii she eye be home of silent prayer nor other think she mind admit but he be dead and there he sit and he that bring he back be there then one deep love doth supersede all other when she ardent gaze rove from the living brother 's face and rest upon the life indeed all subtle thought all curious fear bear down by gladness so complete she bow she bathe the savior 's foot with costly spikenard and with tear thrice bless whose life be faithful prayer whose love in higher love endure what soul possess themselves so pure or be there blessedness like theirs \* \* \* \* \* i have thus trace -- how slightly -- the course of the religious poetry of england from simple song lovingly regardful of sacred story and legend through the chant of philosophy to the full-toned lyric of adoration i have show how the stream sink in the sand of a evil taste generate by the worship of power and knowledge and that a new growth of the love of nature -- beauty counteract not contradict science -- have lead it by a fair channel back to the simplicity of faith in some and to a holy question in other the one class have for its faith the other for its hope that the heart of the father be a heart like ours a heart that will receive into its noon the song that ascend from the twilighted heart of he child gladly would i have pray for the voice of many more of the singer of we country 's psalm especially do i regret the arrival of the hour because of the voice of live man and woman but the time be over and go the twilight have already embrown the gray gloom of the cathedral arch and be drive we forth to part at the door but the singer will yet sing on to he that have ear to hear when he return to seek they the shadowy door will open to he touch the long-drawn aisle recede will guide he eye to the carven choir and there they still stand the sweet singer
