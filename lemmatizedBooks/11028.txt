these story be intend to bring before the american public a few of the tale relate by visayan parent to they child or by the public story-teller in the market as the people gather to buy the material for the evening meal it be only toward the close of a three year ' stay in the island in one province and in neighbor place and after a fair acquaintance with spanish and a little knowledge of the native dialect have enable we to obtain a closer insight into the home life of we pupil than would otherwise have be possible that we venture upon the collection of these tale hope that they might prove of interest to people at home many of the story be write by we boy and girl as part of they work in english composition other be prepare by the native teacher some of whom have be well educate by the spaniard and have already learn to write very fair english indeed a few be able at about the time that these story be write to pass the civil service examination for appointment as insular teacher the article on the superstitious belief of the people be prepare by one of these teacher so that they might be as nearly correct as possible as might be expect the story be often very crude and simple present no difficult situation nor intricate plot sometimes they resemble well-known tale from other land although great care have be take to collect only those from original source the tale here present be collect during the spring of 1904 in the island of panay belong to the visayan group of the philippine island and be obtain in we own class room from native teacher and pupil mr

surprise to discover that they seem to be know wherever we become acquaint with the people and have obtain they confidence sufficiently to induce they to talk freely there be often variation but the framework be always the same if any story be obtain from native teacher who know spanish we have always verify they by get child or native from other place who know no spanish to relate they in order to assure ourselves that the narrative could not be a mere translation of a spanish tale we who have collect these story can claim little credit for any more than the mere arrangement of they as so far as possible even the wording of the original manuscript have be retain doubtless much of the interest we have feel in the work be due to we personal acquaintance with the writer who put on paper for we these simple tale yet we hope that they will not be wholly unattractive to those for whose sake they have be collect February 1906 b l m w h m chapter 1 how jackyo become rich a long time ago

in a bagobo house for the ata live far to the northwest of the bagobo and be extremely timid and wild in the popular sense recent ethnic influence from higher people pre-eminently the moro and the spaniard will have to be reckon with the story of the monkey and the turtle be clearly modify from a spanish source the myth here present include only those of which no text be record a part of the material be give in the vernacular and interpret by a bagobo a part be tell in english or in mixed english and bagobo the story be take down in 1907 on mount merar in the district of talun and at santa cruz on the coast as regard subject-matter the story -lrb- ituran -lrb- 27 -rrb- -rrb- tend to cluster into group fairly distinguishable in type foremost in significance for the cultural tradition of the people be the ulit a long romantic tale relate in highly picturesque language the adventure of the mythical bagobo who live somewhere back in the hazy past before exist condition be establish semi-divine some of they be or man possess magical power the old mona people the malakus who portray the bagobo 's ideal of manhood and the noble lady call bium -- these and other well-marked character figure in the ulit another class of story deal with the demon know as buso who haunt graveyard forest and rock these tale have be build up by numerous accretion from the folk-lore of many generation the fear of buso be a ever-present element in the mental association of the bagobo and a definite factor in shape ritual form and magical usage but the story-teller delight to represent buso as tricked fool bring into embarrassing situation still another type of myth be associate with cosmogony and natural phenomenon it be probable that more extended research would disclose a complete cosmogonic myth to replace the somewhat fragmentary material here offer the number of explanatory animal tale thus far collect be surprisingly small doubtless there be many more to be gather yet in view of the comparatively scanty mammalian fauna of mindanao we might anticipate a somewhat limited range of animal subject it will be observe that these group of story tentatively thus classify for convenience be not separate by sharp line buso figure prominently in the ulit animal play the part of hero in buso tale while in nature myth the traditional mona be more or less closely associate with the shift of sky and sun but this be merely equivalent to say that all the tale hang together a word as to the form of the story and the manner of narration here we find two distinct style dependent on the content of the myth the tale of animal cosmogonic myth and the folk-lore of buso be all tell in prose with many inflection of the voice and often accompany by a animated play of dramatic gesture in marked contrast be the style of the mythical romance or ulit which be recite in a rapid monotone without change of pitch with no gesture and with a regard to accent and quantity that give a rhythmic swing suggestive of a metrical rendering although bagobo song be often designate as man 's song and woman 's song in the case of the story i have find as yet no monopoly by either sex of any special type the ulit however be often tell by a young woman just after she leave the loom when darkness drop she sit on the floor or lie on she back with hand clasp behind she head and pour out she story in a unbroken flow to the eager young man and girl who gather to listen again i have see a girl of thirteen the sole auditor while a boy but little older than she roll off a ulit that seem interminable with never a pause for breath the child do not glance at each other but the face of each be all alight with joy at the tale chapter i myth associate with natural phenomenon cosmogony in the begin diwa -lrb- 28 -rrb- make the sea and the land and plant tree of many kind then he take two lump of earth -lrb- 29 -rrb- and shape they like human figure then he spit on they and they become man and woman the old man be call tuglay and the old woman tuglibung -lrb- 30 -rrb- the two be marry and live together the tuglay make a great house and plant seed of different kind that diwata give he diwata make the sun the moon the star and the river first he make the great eel -lrb- kasilus -rrb- a fish that be like a snake in the river and wound -lrb- 31 -rrb- it all around the world diwa then make the great crab -lrb- kayumang -rrb- and put it near the great eel and let it go wherever it like now when the great crab bite the great eel the eel wriggle and this produce a earthquake when the rain fall it be diwata throw out water from the sky when diwa spit the shower fall the sun make yellow cloud and the yellow cloud make the color of the rainbow but the white cloud be smoke from the fire of the god in the day of the mona long ago the sun hang low over the earth and the old woman call mona say to the sky you go up high because i can not pound my rice when you be in the way then the sky move up higher mona -lrb- 32 -rrb- be the first woman and tuglay -lrb- 33 -rrb- be the first man there be at that time only one man and one woman on the earth they eldest son be name malakus they eldest daughter bium they live at the center of the earth tuglay and mona make all the thing in the world but the god make the woman and the man mona be also call tuglibung tuglay and tuglibung get rich because they could see the god but the snake be there too and he give the fruit to the man and the woman say to they if you eat the fruit it will open you eye then they both eat the fruit this make the god angry after this tuglibung and tuglay could not see the god any more -lrb- 34 -rrb- why the sky go up in the beginning when the world be make the sky lay low down over the earth at this time the poor family call mona be live in the world the sky hang so low that when they want to pound they rice they have to kneel down on the ground to get a play for the arm then the poor woman call tuglibung say to the sky go up higher do not you see that i can not pound my rice well so the sky begin to move upwards when it have go up about five fathom the woman say again go up still more this make the sun angry at the woman and he rush up very high in the old day when the sun as well as the sky be low down the mona have a deep hole in the ground as large as a house into which they would creep to keep themselves from the fierce heat of the sun the mona be all very old but after the sun go up very high they begin to get baby -lrb- 35 -rrb- why the sky go up in the begin the sky hang so low over the earth that the people could not stand upright could not do they work for this reason the man in the sky say to the sky come up then the sky go up to its present place the sun and the moon long ago the sun have to leave the moon to go to another town he know that he wife the moon be expect the birth of a child and before go away he say to she when you baby be bear if it be a boy keep it if a girl kill it a long time pass before the sun could come back to the moon and while he be go the moon give birth to she baby it be a girl a beautiful child it be with curly hair like binubbud -lrb- 36 -rrb- with burnish nail that look like gold and have the white spot call pamotus -lrb- 37 -rrb- on its body the mother feel very sad to think of kill it and so she hide it in the big box -lrb- kaban -lrb- 38 -rrb- -rrb- where they keep they clothes as soon as the sun return he ask the moon how about we baby at once the moon reply it be a girl : i kill it yesterday the sun have only a week to stay at home with the moon one night he dream that a boy with white hair come to he from heaven the boy stand close to he and speak these word : -- you wife get a baby but it be a girl and she hide it away from you in the box when the sun waken from sleep he be very angry at the moon and the two fall to quarrel about the baby the moon want the child save you ought to keep it with you she urge no no protest the sun i can not keep it because my body be so hot it would make you baby sick and i can not keep it complain the moon for my body be very dark and that would surely make the child sick then the sun fall into a passion of rage and he seize he big kampilan -lrb- 39 -rrb- and slew the child he cut its small body into numberless little bit -- as many as the grain of sand that lie along the seashore out of the window he toss the piece of the shine little body and as the gleaming fragment sparkle to they place in the sky the star come to birth origin of the star all the old bagobo man say that the sun and the moon once have a quarrel about the moon 's baby the moon have a baby in she belly and the sun say if we baby be a girl we will kill it because a girl could not be like I then the sun go on a journey to another town and while he be go the baby be bear but it be a girl now the moon feel very sorry to think of she little child be kill and she hide it in a box in a few day the sun come home to rest with he wife then he ask she for the baby the moon answer i kill it yesterday : it be a girl but the sun do not believe what he wife say then he open the box to get he clothes and there he see a baby-girl and the sun be very angry he seize the baby and cut it into many piece and throw the piece out of the window then the piece of the baby 's body become the star before the sun and the moon have they quarrel they journey together through the sky and the sky be not far above the earth as now but it lay low down the fate of the moon 's baby the sun want the moon to have a boy-baby so that it would be like its father the moon too hope to give birth to a boy but when the child be bear it be a girl now at that time the moon be very hungry and want to eat she own baby then the sun kill the girl-child and eat it up himself the black man at the door of the sun the man who live in that part of the world near to where the sun rise be very black they be call manobo tagsela k ` alo -lrb- 40 -rrb- from sunrise until noon they stay in a hole in the ground to escape the fierce heat of the sun just before sunrise they put they

they meal be all ready for they from noon until sunset and then all night the black man play and work but before the sun rise they fix they rice in the pot leave it for the sun to cook and go down again into the big hole story of the eclipse before time begin very long ago a great bird call minokawa -lrb- 41 -rrb- swallow the moon seize with fear all the people begin to scream and make a great noise then the bird peep down to see what be the matter and he open he mouth but as soon as he open he mouth the moon spring out and run away the minokawa-bird be as large as the island of negro or bohol he have a beak of steel and he claw too be of steel he eye be mirror and each single feather be a sharp sword he live outside the sky at the eastern horizon ready to seize the moon when she reach there from she journey under the earth the moon make eight hole in the eastern horizon to come out of and eight hole in the western horizon to go into because every day the big bird try to catch she and she be afraid the exact moment he try to swallow she be just when she be about to come in through one of the hole in the east to shine on we again if the minokawa should swallow the moon and swallow the sun too he would then come down to earth and gulp down man also but when the moon be in the belly of the big bird and the sky be dark then all the bagobo scream and cry and beat agong -lrb- 42 -rrb- because they fear they will all get dead soon this racket make the minokawa-bird look down and open he mouth to hear the sound then the moon jump out of the bird 's mouth and run away all the old man know about the minokawa-bird in the ulit story chapter ii the ulit : adventure of mythical bagobo at the dawn of tradition lumabat and mebu ` yan long ago lumabat -lrb- 43 -rrb- and he

all the way along the journey if any one answer he become a tree or stone or rock accord to the nature of the object that put the question by and by the remainder of the party reach the border of the sky they have go to the very end of the earth as far as the horizon but here they have to stop because the horizon keep move up and down -lrb- supa-supa -rrb- the sky and the earth would part and then close together again just like the jaw of a animal in eat this movement of the horizon begin as soon as the people reach there there be many young man and woman and they all try to jump through the place where the sky and the earth part but the edge of the horizon be very sharp like a kampilan -lrb- 50 -rrb- and they come together with a snap whenever anybody try to jump through and they cut he into two piece then the part of he body become stone or grain of sand one after another of the party try to jump through for nobody know the fate of the one who go before he last of all lumabat jump -- quick quicker than the rest and before the sharp edge snap shut he be safe in heaven as he walk along he see many wonderful thing he see many kampilan stand alone and fight and that without any man

diwa rub the isse on lumabat 's belly and with one downward stroke he open the belly and take out lumabat 's intestine -lrb- betuka -rrb- then lumabat himself become a god he be not hungry any more for now he intestine be go yet if he want to eat he have only to say food come now and at once all the fish be there ready to be catch in the sky-country fish do not have to be catch and lumabat become the greatest of all the diwa now when lumabat leave home with he brother and sister one sister and three brother remain behind the brother name warus feel sad because lumabat have go away at last he decide to follow he he cross the sea and reach the border of the sky which immediately begin to make the opening and shut motion but warus be agile like he brother lumabat and he jump quick just like lumabat and get safe into heaven follow the same path that he brother have take he reach the same house and again diwata take the isse and attempt to open warus 's belly but warus protest for he do not like to have he intestine pull out therefore the god be angry at warus yet wari staid on in the house for three day then he go out on the atad -lrb- 55 -rrb- that join the front and back

on he journey then he take meadow-grass -lrb- karan -rrb- and tie the long blade together make a line long enough to reach down to earth he tie warus and the dog to one end of the line but before he lower the rope he say to warus do not eat while you be up in the air for if you eat it will set you dog to quarrel if i hear the sound of dog fight i shall let go the rope but while warus hang in the air he get very hungry and although he have be let down only about a third of the distance from heaven to earth he take some of he food and eat it immediately the dog begin to fight then diwata in the sky hear the noise and he drop the rope of meadow-grass then warus fall down down but he do not strike the ground for he be catch in the branch of the tree call lanipo it be a tall tree and warus could not get down he begin to utter cry and all night he keep cry aro-o-o-o-i then he turn into a kulago-bird -lrb- 56 -rrb- at night when you hear the call of the kulago-bird you know that it be the

do not know that no knife could wind the neck of tuglay unless fire be lay upon he throat at the same time this be eight million year ago that the buso try to cut off the head of tuglay then another day the tuglay speak to all the buso it be now my turn : let I try whether i can cut you neck after this speech tuglay stand up and take from he mouth the chew betel-nut that be call isse and make a motion as if he would rub the isse on the great buso 's throat when the buso see the isse he think it be a sharp knife and he be frighten all the lesser buso begin to weep fear that they chief would be kill for the isse appear to all of they as a keen-bladed knife the tear of all the buso run down like blood they weep stream and stream of tear that all flow together form a deep lake red in color then tuglay rub the chew betel on the great buso 's throat one pass only he make with the isse and the buso 's head be sever from he body both head and body of the mighty buso roll down into the great lake of tear and be devour by the crocodile now the tuglay be dress like a poor man -- in bark -lrb- bunut -lrb- 70 -rrb- -rrb- garment but as soon as he have slay the buso he strike a blow at he own
