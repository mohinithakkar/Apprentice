that he training be incomplete the rifle you be arm with be the most accurate in the world if it get dirty or rusty it will deteriorate in its accuracy and work efficiency and no subsequent care will restore it to its original condition the most important part of the rifle to keep clean be the bear if after firing the bear be leave dirty over night it will be badly rust in the morning therefore you rifle must be clean not later than the evening of the day on which it be fire the fouling of the blank cartridge be as dangerous to the bear as the fouling of the ball cartridge never attempt to polish any part that be blue if rust appear remove by rub with oil never use emery paper pomade or any preparation that cut or scratch to clean any part of the rifle to beautify and preserve the stock rub with raw linseed oil the use of any other preparation on the stock be strictly forbid always handle you rifle with care do not throw it around as though it be a club do not stand it up against anything so that it rest against the front sight do not leave a stopper or a rag in the bear : it will cause rust to form at that point it may also cause the gun barrel to burst if a shot be fire before remove it guard the sight and muzzle carefully from any blow that might injure they the front sight cover should always be on the rifle except when rifle be be fire this be especially necessary to protect the front sight while rifle be be carry in scabbard by a mount man in come to the order arm lower the piece gently to the ground when there be a cartridge in the chamber the piece be always carry lock in this position the safety lock should be keep turn fully to the right since if it be turn to the left nearly to the ready position and the trigger be pull the rifle will be discharge when the safety lock be turn to the ready position at any time later on cartridge can not be load from the magazine unless the bolt be draw fully to the rear when the bolt be close or only partly open the cut-off may be turn up or down as desire but if the bolt be draw fully to the rear the magazine can not be cut off unless the top cartridge or the follower be press down slightly and the bolt be push forward so that the cut-off may be turn off in the case of a misfire do not open the bolt immediately as it may be a hangfire misfire be often due to the fact that the bolt handle be not fully press down sometimes in pull the trigger the soldier raise the bolt handle without know it unless otherwise order arm will be unloaded before be take to quarter or tent or as soon as the man use they be relieve from duty keep the work part oil in every company there should be at least one copy of the manual of the ordnance department entitle description and rule for the management of the u s magazine rifle this manual give the name and a cut of every part of the rifle explain its use show how to take the rifle apart and care for the same and also give much other valuable and interesting information section 3 cleaning the rifle clean the rifle -- -lrb- a -rrb- the proper care of the bear require conscientious careful work but it pay well in the attainment of reduce labor of clean prolonged accuracy life of the barrel and better result in target practice briefly state the care of the bear consist in remove the foul result from firing to obtain a chemically clean surface and in coating this surface with a film of oil to prevent rusting the fouling which result from firing be of two kind -- one the product of combustion of the powder the other cupro-nickel scrape off -lrb- under the abrade action of irregularity or grit in the bear -rrb- powder fouling because of its acid reaction be highly corrosive that be it will induce rust and must be remove metal fouling of itself be inactive but may cover powder fouling and prevent the action of clean agent until remove and when accumulate in noticeable quantity it reduce the accuracy of the rifle -lrb- b -rrb- powder fouling may be readily remove by scrub with hot soda solution but this solution have no effect on the metal fouling of cupro-nickel it be necessary therefore to remove all metal fouling before assurance can be have that all powder fouling have be remove and that the bear may be safely oil normally after firing a barrel in good condition the metal fouling be so slight as to be hardly perceptible it be merely a smear of infinitesimal thickness easily remove by solvent of cupro-nickel however due to pit the presence of dust other abrasive or to accumulation metal fouling may occur in clearly visible flake or patch of much greater thickness much more difficult to remove -lrb- c -rrb- in clean the bear after firing it be well to proceed as follow : swab out the bear with soda solution -lrb- subparagraph j -rrb- to remove powder foul a convenient method be to insert the muzzle of the rifle into the can contain the soda solution and with the cleaning rod insert from the breech pump the barrel full a few time remove and dry with a couple of patch examine the bear to see that there be in evidence no patch of metal fouling which if present can be readily detect by the naked eye then swab out with the swab solution -- a dilute metal-fouling solution -lrb- subparagraph j -rrb- the amount of swab require with the swab solution can be determine only by experience assist by the color of the patch swab should be continue however as long as the wipe patch be discolor by a bluish-green stain normally a couple of minute ' work be sufficient dry thoroughly and oil -lrb- d -rrb- the proper method of oil a barrel be as follow : wipe the cleaning roll dry select a clean patch and thoroughly saturate it with sperm oil or warm cosmic be sure that the cosmic have penetrate the patch scrub the bear with the patch finally draw the patch smoothly from the muzzle to the breech allow the cleaning rod to turn with the rifle the bear will be find now to be smooth and bright so that any subsequent rust and sweating can be easily detect by inspection -lrb- e -rrb- if patch of metal fouling be see upon visual inspection of the bear the standard metal foul solution prepare as hereinafter prescribe must be use after scrub out with the soda solution plug the bear from the breech with a cork at the front end of the chamber or where the rifle begin slip a 2-inch section of rubber hose over the muzzle down to the sight and fill with the standard solution to at least one-half inch above the muzzle of the barrel let it stand for 30 minute pour out the standard solution remove hose and breech plug and swab out thoroughly with soda solution to neutralize and remove all trace of ammonia and powder fouling wipe the barrel clean dry and oil with few exception one application be sufficient but if all fouling be not remove as determine by careful visual inspection of the bear and of the wipe patch repeat as describe above -lrb- f -rrb- after properly clean with either the swab solution or the standard solution as have just be describe the bear should be clean and safe to oil and put away but as a measure of safety a patch should always be run through the bear on the next day and the bear and wipe patch examine to insure that cleaning have be properly accomplish the bear should then be oil as describe above -lrb- g -rrb- if the swab solution or the standard metal-fouling solution be not available the barrel should be scrub as already describe with the soda solution dry and oil with a light oil at the end of 24 hour it should again be clean when it will usually be find to have sweat that be rust have form under the smear of metal foul where powder fouling be present the surface be puff up usually a second cleaning be sufficient but to insure safety it should be again examine at the end of a few day before final oil the swab solution should always be use if available for it must be remember that each puff when the bear sweat be a incipient rust pit -lrb- h -rrb- a clean dry surface have be obtain to prevent rust it be necessary to coat every portion of this surface with a film of neutral oil if the protection require be but temporary and the arm be to be clean or fire in a few day sperm oil may be use this be easily apply and easily remove but have not sufficient body to hold its surface for more than a few day if rifle be to be prepare for storage or shipment a heavier oil such as cosmic must be use -lrb- i -rrb- in prepare arm for storage or shipment they should be clean with particular care use the metal-fouling solution as describe above care should be take insure by careful inspection on succeed day or day that the cleaning be properly do and all trace of ammonia solution remove the bear be then ready to be coat with cosmic at ordinary temperature cosmic be not fluid in order therefore to insure that every part of the surface be coat with a film of oil the cosmic should be warm apply the cosmic first with a brush then with the breech plug fill the barrel to the muzzle pour out the surplus remove the breechblock and allow to drain it be believe that more rifle be ruin by improper preparation for storage than from any other cause if the bear be not clean when oil -- that be if powder fouling be present or rust have start -- a half inch of cosmic on the outside will not stop its action and the barrel will be ruin remember that the surface must be perfectly clean before the heavy oil be apply if the instruction as give above be carefully follow arm may be store for year without harm -lrb- j -rrb- preparation of solution : _ soda_solution _ -- this should be a saturated solution or sal soda -lrb- bicarbonate of soda -rrb- a strength of at least 20 per cent be necessary the spoon refer to in the follow direction be the model 1910 spoon issue in the mess outfit sal soda one-fourth pound or four -lrb- 4 -rrb- heap spoonful water 1 pint or cup model of 1910 to upper rivet the sal soda will

hour before use it should be keep in a strong bottle tightly cork the solution should not be use more than twice and use solution should not be mix with unused solution but should be bottled separately the solution when mix should be use within 30 day care should be exercise in mix and use this solution to prevent injury to the rifle a experienced noncommissioned officer should mix the solution and superintend its use neither of these ammonia solution have any appreciable action on steel when not expose to the air but if allow to evaporate on steel they attack it rapidly care should therefore be take that none spill on the mechanism and that the barrel be wash out promptly with soda solution the first application of soda solution remove the greater portion of the powder fouling and permit a more effective and economical use of the ammonia solution these ammonia solution be expensive and should be use economically -lrb- k -rrb- it be a fact recognize by all that a highly polish steel surface rust much less easily than one which be roughen : also that a barrel which be pit foul much more rapidly than one which be smooth every effort therefore should be make to prevent the formation of pit which be merely enlarged rust spot and which not only affect the accuracy of the arm but increase the labor of cleaning -lrb- l -rrb- the chamber of rifle be frequently neglect because they be not readily inspect care should be take to see that they be clean as thoroughly as the bear a roughened chamber delay greatly the rapidity of fire and not infrequently cause shell to stick -lrb- m -rrb- a cleaning rack should be provide for every barrack rifle should always be clean from the breach thus avoid possible injury to the rifle at the muzzle which would affect the shooting adversely if the bear for a length of 6 inch at the muzzle be perfect a minor injury near the chamber will have little effect on the accuracy of the rifle the rifle should be clean as soon as the firing for the day be complete the fouling be easier to remove then and if left longer it will corrode the barrel -lrb- n -rrb- the principle as outline above apply equally well for the care of the barrel of the automatic pistol special attention should be pay to clean the chamber of the pistol use the soda solution it have be find that the chamber pit readily if it be not carefully clean with the result that the operation of the pistol be make less certain -lrb- _ par_134_small_arms _ _ firing_manual_1913 _ -rrb- section 4 uniform uniform and clothing issue to enlist man must not be

service it consist of -- ounce bacon 12 hard bread 16 coffee roasted and ground 112 sugar 24 salt 16 ----- approximate net weight pound 2 the _ field_ration _ be the ration prescribe in order by the commander of the field force it consist of the reserve ration in whole or in part supplement by article requisition or purchase locally or ship from the rear in campaign a command carry as a part of its normal equipment the follow ration : -lrb- a -rrb- on each man : at least two day ' reserve ration -lrb- b -rrb- in the ration section of the field train for each man : two day ' field and one day 's reserve ration -lrb- c -rrb- in the supply train : two day ' field ration in addition to the foregoing commander will require each man on the march to carry the unconsumed portion of the day 's ration issue the night before for the noonday meal reserve ration be consume only in case of extreme necessity when other supplies be not available they be not to be consume or renew without a express order from the officer in command of the troops who be responsible for the provision of supplies namely the division commander or other independent-detachment commander every officer within the limit of he command be hold responsible for the enforcement of this regulation reserve ration consume must he replace at the first opportunity section 2 individual cooking sometimes ration for several day be issue to the soldier at one time and in such case you should be very careful to so use the ration that they will last you the entire period if you stuff yourself one day or waste you ration you will have to starve later on generally the cooking for the company will be do by the company cook but sometimes every soldier will have to prepare he own meal use only he field mess kit for the purpose the best fire for individual cooking be a small clear one or better yet a few brisk coal to make such a fire first gather a number of stick about 1 inch in diameter these should be dry dead limb adhering to a tree be dryer than those pick up from the ground split some of these and shave they up into kindle dig a trench in the ground lay with the wind about a foot long 4 inch wide and 6 inch deep start the fire in this trench gradually pile on the heavier wood as the fire grow when the trench be full of burn wood allow it a few minute to burn down to the coal and stop blaze high then rest the meat can and cup over the trench and start cooking either may be support if necessary with green stick if you can not scrape a trench in the soil build one up out of rock or with two parallel log the following recipe have be furnish from the office of the quartermaster general united state army : _ coffee _ -- fill the cup two-third full of water and bring to a boil add one heap spoonful of coffee and stir well add one spoonful of sugar if desire boil five minute and then set it to the side of the fire to simmer for about 10 minute then to clear the coffee throw in a spoonful or two

from two to four foot long -- and weave the point of the stick through the steak several time so that it may be readily turn over a few brisk coal or on the windward side of a small fire allow to brown nicely turn frequently salt and pepper to taste meat with considerable fat be prefer though any meat may be broil in this manner _ fresh_meat _ -lrb- to stew -rrb- -- cut into chunk from one-half inch to one inch cube fill cup about one-third full of meat and cover with about one inch of water let boil or simmer about one hour or until tender add such fibrous vegetable as carrot turnip or cabbage cut into small chunk soon after the meat be put on to boil and potato onion or other tender vegetable when the meat be about half do amount of vegetable to be add about the same as meat depend upon supply and taste salt and pepper to taste apply to ail fresh meat and fowl the proportion of meat and vegetable use vary with they abundance and fix quantity can not be adhere to fresh fish can be handle as above except that it be cook much quicker and potato and onion and can corn be the only vegetable generally use with it thus make a chowder a slice of bacon would greatly improve the flavor may be conveniently cook in meat can or cup vegetable _ potato _ -lrb- fry -rrb- -- take two medium-sized potato or one large one -lrb- about one-half pound -rrb- peel and cut into slice about one-fourth inch thick and scatter well in the meat can in which the grease remain after try the bacon add sufficient water to half cover the potato cover with the lid to keep the moisture in and let come to a boil for about 15 to 20 minute remove the cover and dry as desire salt and pepper to taste during the cooking the bacon already prepare may be keep on the cover which be most conveniently place bottom side up over the cooking vegetable _ onion _ -lrb- fry -rrb- -- same as potato _ potato _ -lrb- boil -rrb- -- peel two medium-sized potato -lrb- about one-half pound -rrb- or

boil add salt and pepper to taste or add a pinch of salt and one-fourth spoonful of sugar _ or _ have try the bacon pour the tomato into the meat can the grease remain and add if desire two broken hardtack set over a brisk fire and let come to a boil _ or _ heat the tomato just as they come from the can add two pinch of salt and one-half spoonful of sugar if desire _ or _ especially in hot weather eat cold with hard bread they be very palatable _ rice _ -- take about two-third of a cupful of water bring to a boll add four heap spoonful of rice and boil until the grain be soft enough to be easily mash between the finger -lrb- about 20 minute -rrb- add two pinch of salt and after stir pour off the water and empty rice out on meat can bacon grease or sugar may be add _

meat can which should contain the grease from fried bacon or a spoonful of butter or fat and place over medium hot coal sufficient to bake so that in from 5 to 7 minute the flapjack may be turn by a quick toss of the pan fry from 5 to 7 minute longer or until by examination it be find to be do _ hoecake _ -- hoecake be make exactly the same as flapjack by substitute _ corn_meal _ for _ flour _ _ emergency_rations _ -- detailed instruction as to the manner of prepare the emergency ration be find on the label of each can remember that even a very limited amount of bacon or hard bread or both consume with the emergency ration make it far more palatable and generally extend the period during which it can be consume with relish for this reason it would be better to husband the supply of hard bread and bacon for use with the emergency ration when it become evident that the latter must be consume rather than to retain the emergency ration to the last extremity and force its exclusive use for a longer period than two or three day section 3 the forage ration _ 1077_army_regulations _ -- the forage ration for a horse be 14 pound of hay and 12 pound of oats corn or barley and 3-1\/3 pound of straw -lrb- or hay -rrb- for bedding for a field artillery horse of the heavy-draft type weigh 1300 pound or over 17 pound of hay and 14 pound of oats corn or barley and 3-1\/3 pound of straw -lrb- or hay -rrb- for bedding for a mule 14 pound of hay and 9 pound of oats corn or barley and 3-1\/3 pound of straw -lrb- or hay -rrb- for bedding to each animal 3 pound of bran may be issue in lieu of that quantity of grain the commanding officer may in he discretion vary the proportion of the component of the ration -lrb- 1 pound of grain 1-1\/2 pound of hay and 2 pound of straw be take as equivalent -rrb- and in the field may substitute other recognize article of forage obtain locally the variation or the substitution not to exceed the money value of the component of the ration at the contract rate in effect at the time of change _ 1078_army_regulations _ -- where grazing be practicable or when little work be require of the animal command officer will reduce the forage ration when on the other hand condition demand it they be authorize to increase the ration not in excess however of savings make in the field the authorize allowance must often be reduce and supplement by grazing and other kind of food such as green forage bean pea rice palay wheat and rye wheat and rye should be crush and feed sparingly -lrb- about one-fourth of the allowance -rrb- for unshelled corn add about one-quarter weight on the march the grain ration be the only forage carry it consist of 12 pound of grain for each horse and 9 pound of grain for each mule recourse must be have to grazing if it be not possible to procure long forage in the country traverse in campaign a command carry as a part of its normal equipment the follow forage : -lrb- a -rrb- for each draft animal : on each vehicle a _ reserve _ of one day 's grain ration for its draft animal -lrb- b -rrb- on animal and vehicle : a portion of they grain ration issue the night before for a noonday feed -lrb- c -rrb- in the ration section of the field train for each animal two day 's grain ration -lrb- d -rrb- in supply train of a infantry division two day ' grain ration and of a cavalry division one day ' grain ration chapter iv personal hygiene and care of the foot personal hygiene history show that in almost every war many more man die of disease than from wound receive in battle much of this disease be preventable and be due either to the ignorance or carelessness of the person who have the disease or of other person about he it be a terrible truth that one man who violate any of the great rule of health may be the means of kill many more of he comrade than be kill by the bullet of the enemy it be therefore most important that every soldier should learn how to take care of he health when in the field and that he should also insist that he comrade do not violate any of the rule prescribe for this purpose a great many disease be due to germ which be either little animal or little plant so very small that they can only be see by aid of the microscope all disease cause by germ be catch all other disease be not catch there be only five way of catch disease : -lrb- a -rrb- get certain germ on the body by touch some one or something which have they on it thus one may catch venereal disease smallpox measles scarlet fever chicken pox mumps boll body louse ringworm barber 's itch dhopie itch and some other disease wound be infect in this manner -lrb- b -rrb- breathing in certain germ which float in the air in this way one may catch pneumonia consumption influenza diphtheria whooping cough tonsilitis spinal meningitis measles and certain other disease -lrb- c -rrb- take certain germ in through the mouth in eating or drinking dysentery cholera typhoid fever diarrhea and intestinal worm may be catch in this manner -lrb- d -rrb- have certain germ inject into the body by the bite of insect such as mosquito flea and bedbug malaria yellow fever dengue fever and bubonic plague may be catch in this way -lrb- e -rrb- inherit the germ from one 's parent person may have these germ sometimes without apparently be sick with any disease such person and person who be sick with the disease be a great source of danger to other about they germ which multiply in such person be find in they urine and excretion from the bowels in discharge from ulcer and abscess in the spit or particle cough or sneeze into the air in the perspiration or scale from the skin and in the blood suck up by bite insect those who have take care of they health and who have not become weaken by bad habit exposure and fatigue be not only less liable to catch disease but be more apt to recover when take sick know all these thing the soldier can understand the reason for the follow rule and how important it be that they should be carry out by each and every person : stay away from person have catch disease it you have any disease do not try to cure it yourself but go to the surgeon insist that other soldier do likewise typhoid fever be one of the most dangerous and common camp disease modern medicine have however discover a effective preventative for this disease in the typhoid prophylactic which render the person immune from typhoid fever the treatment consist in inject into the arm a preventative serum the injection be give three time at 10-day interval association with lewd woman be dangerous it may result in disable you for life it be the cause of a disease -lrb- syphilis -rrb- which may be transmit by a parent to he child soldier with venereal disease should not use basin or toilet article use by other as the germ of these disease if get into the eye very often cause blindness likewise if they use the same drinking cup use by other they may give other the disease they should promptly report they trouble to the surgeon that they may receive the best medical advice and attention should a soldier expose himself to infection by have intercourse with a unknown woman he should report as soon as possible afterwards to the regimental infirmary for prophylactic treatment which if take within a few hour after intercourse will prevent to a large degree the liability of contract any disease cook germ be dead and therefore harmless water even when clear may be alive with deadly germ therefore when the condition be such that the commanding officer order all drinking water to be boil be careful to live up to this order use the latrine and do not go elsewhere to relieve yourself in open latrine cover you deposit with dirt as it breed file and may also be full of germ fly carry germ from one place to another therefore see that you food and mess kit be protect from they all slop find scrap of food scatter about camp soon produce bad odor and draw fly therefore do you part toward keep the camp free from disease by carefully deposit such refuse in the pit or can use for this purpose urinate only in the latrine or in the can set out for this purpose never on the ground around camp because it not only cause bad smell but urine sometimes contain the germ of catch disease soapy water throw on the ground soon produce bad odor therefore in camp of several day ' duration this water should be throw in covered pit or in can use for this purpose as certain mosquito can transmit malaria and yellow fever use you mosquito bar for this reason as well as for personal comfort keep you mouth clean by brushing you tooth once or twice a day it help to prevent the tooth from decay decayed tooth cause toothache they also lead one to swallow food without properly chew it and this lead to stomach trouble of various kind food leave around and between the tooth be bad for the tooth and form good breed place for germ keep the skin clean through the pore of the skin the body get rid of much waste and poisonous matter therefore remove this and keep the pore open by bathing once every day if possible if water be scarce rub the body over with a wet towel if no water be at hand take a dry rub wash carefully the armpit between the leg and under the foreskin as this will prevent chafe the skin protect the sensitive part underneath from injury and help to keep out germ therefore when blister be form do not tear off the skin insert a needle under the skin a little distance back from the blister and push it through to the opposite side press out the liquid through the hole thus form heat the needle red hot first with a match or candle to kill the germ when the skin be break -lrb- in cut and wound -rrb- keep the opening cover with a bandage to keep out germ and dirt otherwise the sore may fester pus be always cause by germ keep you hair short long hair and a long beard in the field generally mean a dirty head and a dirty face and favor skin disease louse and dandruff do not let any part of the body become chill as this very often be the direct cause of diarrhea dysentery pneumonia rheumatism and other disease wet clothes may be worn while march or exercise without bad result but there be great danger if one rest in wet clothing as the body may become chill do not sit or lie or sleep directly on damp ground as this be sure to chill the body when hot or perspiring or when wear damp clothes do not remain where a breeze can strike you you be sure to become chill every day if possible hang you blanket and clothing out to air in the sun shake or beat they with a small stick germ and vermin do not like this treatment but damp musty clothing suit they very well wash you shirt underwear and sock frequently the danger of blood poisoning from a wound be greatly increase if the bullet pass through dirty clothes ditch you tent as soon as you can particularly a shelter tent even if you camp for one night only otherwise a little rain may ruin a whole night 's rest always prepare you bed before dark level off the ground and scrape out a little hollow for you hip get some straw or dry grass if possible green grass or branch from tree be better than nothing sleep on you poncho this keep the dampness from come up from the ground and chill the body every minute spend in make a good bed mean about a hour 's good rest later on avoid the food and drink find for sale in the cheap stand about camp the quality be generally bad and it be often prepare in filthy place by very dirty person the use of intoxicating liquor be particularly dangerous in the field its excessive use even at long interval break down one 's system drinking man be more apt to get sick and less liable to get well than be they more sober comrade if alcohol be take at all it be best after the work of the day be over it should never be take when the body be expose to severe cold as it diminish the resistance of the body hot tea or coffee be much preferable under these circumstance care of the foot a soldier can not march with sore foot and march be the main part of a infantryman 's daily duty in the field all soldier should be familiar with the proper method of care for the foot sore foot be generally due to carelessness neglect or ignorance on the part of the soldier the most important factor in the care of the foot and the march ability of the soldier be the shoe civilian shoe particularly light patent leather or low shoe be sure to cause injury and in time will ruin a man 's foot only the march shoe issue by the quartermaster corps should be worn and they must be properly fit to the individual it will not suffice to order a march shoe of the same size as one 's ordinary civilian shoe for it must be remember that a soldier may have to march many mile daily over rough road and carry a heavy pack the pack itself cause the foot to spread out to a larger size and the rough road give so much exercise to the muscle of the foot that they swell greatly through the increase blood supply -lrb- for direction as to measure the foot for the march shoe see general order no 26 war department 1912 a copy of which should be on hand in each company -rrb- do not start out on a march wear new shoe this be a frequent cause of sore foot new shoe should be properly break in before begin a march by wear they for several hour daily for a week before the march and they should be adapt to the contour of the foot by stretch they with shoe stretcher with adjustable knob to take the pressure off painful corn and bunion such stretcher be issue by the quartermaster corps and there should be one or more pair in every company of infantry should this be impracticable then the follow be suggest : the soldier stand in he new shoe in about 2-1\/2 inch of water for about five minute until the leather be thoroughly pliable and moist he should then walk for about a hour on a level surface let the shoe dry on he foot to the irregularity of which the leather be thus mold in the same way as it be previously mold over the shoe last on take the shoe off a very little neat 's - foot oil should be rub into the leather to prevent its hardening and crack if it be desire to waterproof shoe at any time a considerable amount of neat 's - foot oil should be rub into the leather waterproof leather cause the foot of some man to perspire unduly and keep they constantly soft light woolen or heavy woolen sock will habitually be wear for march cotton sock will not be worn unless specifically order by the surgeon the sock will be large enough to permit free movement of the toe but not so loose as to permit of wrinkle darned sock or sock with hole in they will not be worn in march until the foot have harden they should be dust with foot powder which can be obtain at the regimental infirmary before each day 's march clean sock should be worn daily as soon as possible after reach camp after a day of march the foot should be wash with soap and water and the soldier should put on a dry pair of sock and he extra pair of shoe from he surplus kit if the skin be tender or the foot perspire wash with warm salt water or alum water but do not soak the foot a long time as this although very comforting at the time tend to keep they soft should blister 's appear on the foot prick and evacuate they by prick at the lower edge with a pin which have be pass through the flame of a match and cover they with zinc oxide plaster apply hot this plaster can be obtain on request at the regimental infirmary if serious abrasion appear on the foot or corn bunion and ingrow nail cause trouble have you name place on sick report and apply to the surgeon for treatment cut the toe nail square -lrb- fairly close in the middle but leave the side somewhat longer

execution officer battalion noncommissioned staff officer platoon leader guide and musician be equip with whistle the major and he staff will use a whistle of distinctive tone the captain and company musician a second and distinctive whistle the platoon leader and guide a third distinctive whistle 35 prescribed signal be limit to such as be essential as a substitute for the voice under condition which render the voice inadequate before or during a engagement special signal may be agree upon to facilitate the solution of such special difficulty as the particular situation be likely to develop but it must be remember that simplicity and certainty be indispensable quality of a signal order 36 in these regulation a order embrace instruction or direction give orally or in write in term suit to the particular occasion and not prescribe herein order be employ only when the command prescribe herein do not sufficiently indicate the will of the commander order be more fully describe in paragraph 378 to 383 inclusive command 37 in these regulation a command be the will of the commander express in the phraseology prescribe herein 38 there be two kind of command : the preparatory command such as _ forward _ indicate the movement that be to be execute the command of execution such as march halt or arm cause the execution preparatory command be distinguish by _ italics _ those of execution by capital where it be not mention in the text who give the command prescribe they be to be give by the commander of the unit concern the preparatory command should be give at such a interval of time before the command of execution as to admit of be properly understand the command of execution should be give at the instant the movement be to commence the tone of command be animated distinct and of a loudness proportion to the number of man for whom it be intend each preparatory command be enunciate distinctly with a rise inflection at the end and in such manner that the command of execution may he more energetic the command of execution be firm in tone and brief 39 major and commander of unit larger than a battalion repeat such command of they superior as be to be execute by they unit face they unit for that purpose the battalion be the largest unit that execute a movement at the command of execution of its commander 40 when give command to troops it be usually best to face toward they indifference in give command must be avoid as it lead to laxity in execution command should be give with spirit at all time bugle signal 41 the authorize bugle signal be publish in part v of these regulation the following bugle signal may be use off the battle field when not likely to convey information to the enemy : attention : troops be bring to attention attention to order : troops fix they attention forward march : use also to execute quick time from double time double time march to the rear march : in close order execute squad right about halt assemble march the follow bugle signal may be use on the battlefield : fix bayonet charge assemble march these signal be use only when intend for the entire firing line hence they can be authorize only by the commander of a unit -lrb- for example a regiment or brigade -rrb- which occupy a distinct section of the battle field exception : fix bayonet -lrb- see par 318 -rrb- the follow bugle signal be use in exceptional case on the battle field they principal use be in field exercise and practice firing commence firing : officer charge with fire direction and control open fire as soon as practicable when give to a firing line the signal be equivalent to fire at will cease firing : all part of the line execute cease firing at once these signal be not use by unit smaller than a regiment except when such unit be independent or detach from its regiment whistle signal 42 attention to order a short blast of the whistle this signal be use on the march or in combat when necessary to fix the attention of troops or of they commander or leader preparatory to give command order or signal when the firing line be firing each squad leader suspend firing and fix he attention at a short blast of he platoon leader 's whistle the platoon leader 's subsequent command or signal be repeat and enforce by the squad leader if a squad leader 's attention be attract by a whistle other than that of he platoon leader or if there be no order or command to convey to he squad he resume firing at once suspend firing a long blast of the whistle all other whistle signal be prohibit arm signal 43 the follow arm signal be prescribe in make signal either arm may be use officer who receive signal on the firing line repeat back at once to prevent misunderstanding forward march carry the hand to the shoulder straighten and hold the arm

fire may be give at any time after the preparatory command for firing whether the firing have actually commence or not the use of cover 152 the recruit should be give careful instruction in the individual use of cover it should be impress upon he that in take advantage of natural cover he must be able to fire easily and effectively upon the enemy if advance on a enemy he must do so steadily and as rapidly as possible he must conceal himself as much as possible while firing and while advance while set he sight he should be under cover or lie prone 153 to teach he to fire easily and effectively at the same time conceal himself from the view of the enemy he be practice in simulated firing in the prone sit kneel and crouch position from behind hillock tree heap of earth or rock from depression gully ditch doorway or window he be teach to fire around the right side of he concealment whenever possible or when this be not possible to rise enough to fire over the top of he concealment when these detail be understand he be require to select cover with reference to a assume enemy and to place himself behind it in proper position for firing 154 the evil of remain too long in one place however good the concealment should be explain he should be teach to advance from cover to cover select cover in advance before leave he concealment it should be impress upon he that a man run rapidly toward all enemy furnish a poor target he should be train in spring from a prone position behind concealment run at top speed to cover and throw himself behind it he should also be practice in advance from cover to cover by crawl or by lie on the left side rifle grasp in the right hand and push himself forward with the right leg 155 he should be teach that when fire on while act independently he should drop to the ground seek cover and then endeavor to locate he enemy 156 the instruction of the recruit in the use of cover be continue in the combat exercise of the company but he must then be teach that the proper advance of the platoon or company and the effectiveness of its fire be of greater importance than the question of cover for individual he should also be teach that he may not move about or shift he position in the firing line except the better to see the target observation 157 the ability to use he eye accurately be of great importance to the soldier the recruit should be train in observe he surround from position and when on the march he should be practice in point out and name military feature of the ground in distinguish between live being in count distant group of object or being in recognize color and form 158 in the training of man in the mechanism of the firing line they should be practice in repeat to one another target and aim point designation and in quickly locate and point out a designate target they should be teach to distinguish from a prone position distant object particularly troops both with the naked eye and with field glass similarly they should be train in estimate distance section 6 school of the company 159 the captain be responsible for the theoretical and practical instruction of he officer and noncommissioned

man take they proper place in the skirmish line ordinarily each line be make up of one man per squad and the man of a squad be send forward in order from right to leave as deploy the first line be lead by the platoon leader of the right platoon the second by the guide of the right platoon and so on in order from right to leave the advance be conduct in quick time unless condition demand a faster gait the company have arrive at the indicated position a further advance by the same means may be advisable 219 the advance in a succession of thin line be use to cross a wide stretch sweep or likely to be sweep by artillery fire or heavy long-range rifle fire which can not profitably be return its purpose be the building up of a strong skirmish line preparatory to engage in a fire tight this method of advance result in serious -lrb- though temporary -rrb- loss of control over the company its advantage lie in the fact that it offer less definite target hence be less likely to draw fire 220 the above be suggestion other and better formation may be devise to fit particular case the best formation be the one which advance the line farthest with the least loss of man time and control the fire attack 221 the principle govern the advance of the firing line in attack be consider in the school of the battalion when it become impracticable for the company to advance as a whole by ordinary means it advance by rush 222 be in skirmish line : 1 _ by_platoon _ -lrb- two_platoons_squad _ _ four_men_etc -rrb- _ from_the_right _ -lrb- left -rrb- _ 2 rush the platoon leader on the indicate flank carefully arrange the detail for a prompt and vigorous execution of the rush and put it into effect as soon as practicable if necessary he designate the leader for the indicate fraction when about to rush he cause the man of the fraction to cease firing and to hold themselves flat but in readiness to spring forward instantly the leader of the rush -lrb- at the signal of the platoon leader if the latter be not the leader of the rush -rrb- command : follow I and run at top speed lead the fraction to the new line where be halt it and cause it to open fire the leader of the rush select the new line if it have not be previously designate the first fraction have establish itself on the new line the next like fraction be send forward by its platoon leader without further command of the captain and so on successively until the entire company be on the line establish by the first rush if more than one platoon be to join in one rush the junior platoon leader conform to the action of the senior a part of the line have advance the captain may increase or decrease the size of the fraction to complete the movement 223 when the company form a part of the firing line the rush of the company as a whole be conduct by the captain as describe for a platoon in the precede paragraph the captain lead the rush platoon leader lead they respective platoon platoon guide follow the line to insure prompt and orderly execution of the advance 224 when the foregoing method of rush by run become impracticable any method of advance that bring the attack closer to the enemy such as crawl should be employ for regulation govern the charge see paragraph 318 and 319 the company in support 225 to enable it to follow or reach the firing line the support adopt suitable formation follow the principle explain in paragraph 212-218 the support should be keep assemble as long as practicable if after deploy a favorable opportunity arise to hold it for some time in close formation it should be reassemble it be redeploy when necessary 226 the movement of the support as a whole and the dispatch of reenforcement from it to the firing line be control by the major a reenforcement of less than one platoon have little influence and will be avoid whenever practicable the captain of a company in support be constantly on the alert for the major 's signal or command 227 a reenforcement send to the firing line join it deploy as skirmisher the leader of the reenforcement place it in a interval in the line if one exist : and command it thereafter as a unit if no such suitable interval exist the reenforcement be advance with increase interval between skirmisher each man occupy the nearest interval in the firing line and each then obey the order of the nearest squad lender and platoon leader 228 a reenforcement join the firing line as quickly as possible without exhaust the man 229 the original platoon division of the company in the firing line should be maintain and should not be break up by the mingling of reenforcement upon join the firing line officer and sergeant accompany a reenforcement take over the duty of other of like grade who have be disabled or distribute themselves so as best to exercise they normal function condition with vary and no rule can be prescribe it be essential that all assist in master the increase difficulty of control the company act alone 230 in general the company when act alone be employ accord to the principle applicable to the battalion act alone the captain employ platoon as the major employ company make due allowance for the difference in strength the support may be smaller in proportion or may be dispense with 231 the company must be well protect against surprise combat patrol on the flank be specially important each leader of a flank platoon detail a man to watch for the signal of the patrol or patrol on he flank fire 232 ordinarily piece be load and extra ammunition be issue before the company deploy for combat in close order the company execute the firing at the command of the captain who post himself in rear of the center of the company usually the firing in close order consist of salute volley only 233 when the company be deploy the man execute the firing at the command of they platoon leader the latter give such command as be necessary to carry out the captain 's direction and from time to time add such further command as be necessary to continue correct and control the fire order 234 the voice be generally inadequate for give command during fire and must be replace by signal of such character that proper fire direction and control be assure to attract attention signal must usually be precede by the whistle signal -lrb- short blast -rrb- a friction of the firing line about to rush should it practicable avoid use the long blast signal as a aid to cease firing officer and man behind the firing line can not ordinarily move freely along the line but must depend on mutual watchfulness and the proper use of the prescribe signal all should post themselves so as to see they immediate superior and subordinate 235 the musician assist the captain by observe the enemy the target and the fire effect by transmit command or signal and by watch for signal 236 firing with blank cartridge at a outline or represent enemy at distance less than 100 yard be prohibit 237 the effect of fire and the influence of the ground in relation thereto and the individual and collective instruction in marksmanship be treat in the small-arm firing manual range 238 for convenience of reference range be classify as follow : 0 to 600 yard close range 600 to 1200 yard effective range 1200 to 2000 yard long range 2000 yard and over distant range 239 the distance to the target must be determine as accurately as possible and the sight set accordingly aside from training and morale this be the most important single factor in secure effective fire at the longer range 240 except in a deliberately prepared defensive position the most accurate and only practicable method of determine the range will generally be to take the mean of several estimate five or six officer or man select from the most accurate estimator in the company be designate as range estimator and be specially train in estimate distance whenever necessary and practicable the captain assemble the range estimator point out the target to they and adopt the mean of they estimate the range estimator then take they customary post class of firing 241 volley firing have limit application in defense it may be use in the early stage of the action if the enemy present a large compact target it may be use by troops execute fire of position when the ground near the target be such that the strike of bullet can be see from the firing line range volley may be use to correct the sight setting in combat volley firing be execute habitually by platoon 242 fire at will be the class of fire normally employ in attack or defense 243 clip fire have limit application it be principally use : 1 in the early stage of combat to steady the man by habituate they to brief pause in firing 2 to produce a short burst of fire the target 244 ordinarily the major will assign to the company a objective in attack or sector in defense the company 's target will lie within the limit so assign in the choice of target tactical consideration be paramount the nearest hostile troops within the objective or sector will thus be the usual target this will ordinarily be the hostile firing line troops in rear be ordinarily proper target for artillery machine gun or at time infantry employ fire of position change of target should not be make without excellent reason therefor such as the sudden appearance of hostile troops under condition which make they more to be fear than the troops comprise the former target 245 the distribution of fire over the entire target be of special importance the captain allot a part of the target to each platoon or each platoon leader take as he target that part which correspond to he position in the company man be so instruct that each fire on that part of the target which be directly opposite he 246 all part of the target be equally important care must be exercise that the man do not slight its less visible part a section of the target not cover by fire represent a number of the enemy permit to fire cooly and effectively 247 if the target can not be see with the naked eye platoon leader select a object in front of or behind it designate this as the aim target and direct a sight setting which will carry the cone of fire into the target fire direction 248 when the company be large enough to be divide into platoon it be impracticable for the captain to command it directly in combat he efficiency in manage the firing line be measure by he ability to enforce he will through the platoon leader have indicate clearly what he desire they to do he avoid interfere except to correct serious error or omission 249 the captain direct the fire of the company or of designate platoon he designate the target and when practicable allot a part of the target to each platoon before begin the fire action he determine the range announce the sight setting and indicate the class of fire to be employ and the time to open fire thereafter he observe the fire effect correct material error in sight setting prevent exhaustion of the ammunition supply and cause the distribution of such extra ammunition as may be receive from the rear fire control 250 in combat the platoon be the fire unit from 20 to 35 rifle be as many as one leader can control effectively 251 each platoon leader put into execution the command or direction of the captain have first take such precaution to insure correct sight setting and clear description of the target or aim target as the situation permit or require thereafter he give such additional command or direction as be necessary to exact compliance with the captain 's will he correct the sight setting when necessary he designate a aim target when the target can not be see with the naked eye 252 in general platoon leader observe the target and the effect of they fire and be on the alert for the captain 's command or signal they observe and regulate the rate of fire the platoon guide watch the firing line and check every breach of fire discipline squad leader transmit command and signal when necessary observe the conduct of they squad and abate excitement assist in enforce fire discipline and participate in the firing 253 the best troops be those that submit longest to fire control loss of control be a evil which rob success of its greatest result to avoid or delay such loss should be the constant aim of all fire control imply the ability to stop firing change the sight setting and target and resume a well direct fire fire discipline 254 fire discipline imply besides a habit of obedience a control of the rifle by the soldier the result of training which will enable he in action to make hit instead of miss it embrace take advantage of the ground care in set the sight and delivery of fire constant attention to the order of the leader and careful observation of the enemy a increase of fire when the target be favorable and a cessation of fire when the enemy disappear economy of ammunition -lrb- small-arms firing manual -rrb- in combat shot which graze the enemy 's trench or position and thus reduce the effectiveness of he fire have the approximate value of hit such shot only or actual hit contribute toward fire superiority fire discipline imply that in a firing line without leader each man retain he presence of mind and direct effective fire upon the proper target 255 to create a correct appreciation of the requirement of fire discipline man be teach that the rate of fire should be as rapid as be consistent with accurate aim that the rate will depend upon the visibility proximity and size or the target and that the proper rate will ordinarily suggest itself to each trained man usually render caution or command unnecessary in attack the highest rate of fire be employ at the halt precede the assault and in pursue fire 256 in a advance by rush leader of troops in firing position be responsible for the delivery of heavy fire to cover the advance of each rush fraction troops be train to change slightly the direction of fire so as not to endanger the flank of advanced portion of the firing line 257 in defense when the target disappear behind cover platoon leader suspend fire prepare they platoon to fire

tent except one pole be use two guy rope be use at each end the guy pin be place in front of the corner pin the tent be pitch by number 1 and 2 front and rear rank and by number 3 and 4 front and rear rank the man fall in on the left be number count off if necessary all the man spread they shelter half on the ground the tent be to occupy those of the front rank be place with the triangular end to the front all four half be then button together first the ridge and then the square end the front corner of the tent be pin by the front rank man the odd number hold the pole the even number drive the pin the rear rank man similarly pin the rear corner while the odd number steady the pole each even number of the front rank take he pole and enter the tent where assist by the even number of the rear rank he adjust the pole to the center eye of the shelter half in the follow order : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the lower half of the front tent -lrb- 2 -rrb- the lower half of the rear tent -lrb- 3 -rrb- the upper half of the front tent -lrb- 4 -rrb- the upper half of the rear tent the guy rope be then adjust the tent have be pitch the triangular end be turn back contents of the roll arrange and the man stand at attention each opposite he own shelter half and face out from the tent 796 omit 797 omit 798 omit section 9 manual of the bayonet 1 the infantry soldier rely mainly on fire action to disable the enemy but he should know that personal combat be often necessary to obtain success therefore he must be instruct in the use of the rifle and bayonet in hand-to-hand encounter 2 the object of this instruction be to teach the soldier how to make effect use of the rifle and bayonet in personal combat : to make he quick and proficient in handle he rifle to give he a accurate eye and a steady hand and to give he confidence in the bayonet in offense and defense when skill in these exercise have be acquire the rifle will still remain a most formidable weapon at close quarter should the bayonet be lose or disabled 3 efficiency of organization in bayonet fighting will be judge by the skill show by individual in personal combat for this purpose pair or group of opponent select at random from among recruit and trained soldier should engage in assault use the fencing equipment provide for the purpose 4 officer and specially select and thoroughly instruct noncommissioned officer will act we instructor 5 instruction in bayonet combat should begin as soon as the soldier be familiar with the handling of he rifle and will progress as far as practicable in the order follow in the text 6 instruction be ordinarily give on even ground but practice should also be have on uneven ground especially in the attack and defense of intrenchment 7 these exercise will not be use as a calisthenic drill 8 the principle of the command be the same as those give in paragraph 9 15 and 38 infantry drill regulation interval and distance will be take as in paragraph 109 and 111 infantry drill regulation except that in formation for bayonet exercise the man should be at least four pace apart in every direction 9 before require soldier to take a position or execute a movement for the first time the instructor execute the same for the purpose of illustration after which he require the soldier to execute the movement individually movement prescribe in this manual will not be execute in cadence as the attempt to do so result in incomplete execution and lack of vigor each movement will be execute correctly as quickly as possible by every man as soon as the movement be execute accurately the command be give rapidly as expertness with the bayonet depend chiefly upon quickness of motion 10 the exercise will he interrupt at first by short and frequent rest the rest will be less frequent as proficiency be attain fatigue and exhaustion will be specially guard against as they prevent proper interest be take in the exercise and delay the progress of the instruction rest will be give from the position of order arm in the manner prescribe in infantry drill regulation the bayonet nomenclature and description 11 the bayonet be a cutting and thrust weapon consist of three principal part viz the _ blade_guard _ and _ grip _ 12 the blade have the follow part : edge false edge back groove point and tang the length of the blade from guard to point be 16 inch the edge 145 inch and the false edge 56 inch length of the rifle bayonet fix be 594 inch the weight of the bayonet be 1 pound weight of rifle without bayonet be 869 pound the center of gravity of the rifle with bayonet fix be just in front of the rear sight note -- the use of the hand ax and the pick mattock in organization equip with the intrenching tool be authorize for the purpose of drive shelter-tent pin the use of the bayonet for that purpose be prohibit i instrution without the rifle 13 the instructor explain the importance of good footwork and impress on the man the fact that quickness of foot and suppleness of body be as important for attack and defense as be the ability to parry and deliver a strong point or cut 14 all foot movement should be make from the position of guard as far as practicable they will be make on the ball of the foot to insure quickness and agility no hard and fast rule can be lay down as to the length of the various foot movement this depend entirely on the situation occur in combat 15 the man have take interval or distance the instructor command : 1 _ bayonet_exercise _ 2 guard at the command guard half face to the right carry back and place the right foot about once and a half its length to the rear and about 3 inch to the right the foot form with each other a angle of about 60 ° weight of the body balanced equally on the ball of the foot knee slightly bent palm of hand on hip finger to the front thumb to the rear head erect head and eye straight to the front 16 to resume the attention 1 _ squad _ 2 attention the man take the position of the soldier and fix they attention 17 advance advance the left foot quickly about once its length follow immediately with the right foot the same distance 18 retire move the right foot quickly to the rear about once its length follow immediately with the left foot the same distance 19 1 _ front _ 2 pass place the right foot quickly about once its length in front of the left advance the left foot to its proper position in front of the right 20 1 _ rear _ 2 pass place the left foot quickly about once its length in rear of the right retire the right foot to its proper position in rear of the leave the pass be use to get quickly within striking distance or to withdraw quickly therefrom 21 1 _ right _ 2 step step to the right with the right foot about once its length and place the left foot in its proper relative position 22 1 _ leave _ 2 step step to the leave with the left foot about once its length and place the right foot in its proper relative position these step be use to circle around a enemy to secure a more favorable line of attack or to avoid the opponent 's attack better ground or more favorable light may be gain in this way in bayonet fencing and in actual combat the foot first move in step to the right or left be the one which at the moment bear the least weight ii instruction with the rifle 23 the command for and the execution of the foot movement be the same as already give for movement without the rifle 24 the man have take interval or distance the instructor command : 1 _ bayonet_exercise _ 2 guard at the second command take the position of guard -lrb- see par 15 -rrb- at the same time throw the rifle smartly to the front grasp the rifle with the left hand just below the lower band finger between the stock and gun sling barrel turn slightly to the leave the right hand grasp the small of the stock about 6 inch in front of the right hip elbow free from the body bayonet point at the height of the chin 25 1 _ order _ 2 arm bring the right foot up to the left and the rifle to the position of order arm at the same time resume the position of attention 26 during the preliminary instruction attack and defens will he execute from guard until proficiency be attain after which they may be execute from any position in which the rifle be hold attack 27 1 thrust thrust the rifle quickly forward to the full length of the left arm turn the barrel to the left and direct the point of the bayonet at the point to be attack butt cover the right fore-arm at the same time straighten the right leg vigorously and throw the weight of the body forward and on the left leg the ball of the right foot always on the ground guard be resume immediately without command the force of the thrust be deliver principally with the right arm the left be use to direct the bayonet the point at which the attack should be direct be in order of they importance stomach chest head neck and limb 28 1 lunge execute in the same manner as the thrust except that the left foot be carry forward about twice its length the left heel must always be in rear of the left knee guard be resume immediately without command guard may also be resume by advance the right foot if for any reason it be desire to hold the ground gain in lunge in the latter case the preparatory command forward will be give each method should be practice 29 1 _ butt _ 2 strike straighten right arm and right leg vigorously and swing butt of rifle against point of attack pivot the rifle in the left hand at about the height of the left shoulder allow the bayonet to pass to the rear on the left side of the head guard be resume without command -lrb- illustration : par 27 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : par 24 -rrb- the point of attack in they order of importance be head neck stomach and crotch 30 1 _ cut _ 2 down execute a quick downward stroke edge of bayonet direct at point of attack guard be resume without command 31 1 _ cut _ 2 right -lrb- left -rrb- with a quick extension of the arm execute a cut to the right -lrb- left -rrb- direct the edge toward the point attack guard be resume without command the cut be especially useful against the head neck and hand of a enemy in execute left cut it should be remember that the false or back edge be only 56 inch long the cut can be execute continuation of stroke thrust lunge and parry -lrb- illustration : par 28 -rrb- 32 to direct a attack to the right left or rear the soldier will change front as quickly as possible in the most convenient manner for example : 1 _ to_the_right_rear _ 2 _ cut _ 3 down 1 _ to_the_right _ 2 lunge 1 _ to_the_left _ 2 thrust etc whenever possible the impetus gain by the turn movement of the body should be throw into the attack in general this will be best accomplish by turn on the ball of the right foot these movement constitute a change of front in which the position of guard be resume at the completion of the movement -lrb- illustration : par 29 -rrb- 33 good judgment of distance be essential accuracy in thrust and lunge be best attain by practice these attack against ring or other convenient opening about 3 inch in diameter suitably suspend at desire height 34 the thrust and lunge at ring should first be practice by endeavor to hit the opening look at this should be follow by direct the attack against one opening while look at another 35 the soldier should also experience the effect of actual resistance offer to the bayonet and the butt of the rifle in attack this will be teach by practice attack against a dummy 36 dummy should be construct in such a manner as to permit the execution of attack without injury to the point or edge of the bayonet or to the barrel or stock of the rifle a suitable dummy can be make from piece of rope about 5 foot in length plait closely together into a cable between 6 and 12 in diameter old rope be preferable bag weighted and stuff with hay straw shaving etc be also suitable -lrb- illustration : par 36 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : par 33 -rrb- defens 37 in the preliminary drill in the defens the position of guard be resume by command after each parry when the man have become proficient the instructor will cause they to resume the position of guard instantly without command after the execution of each parry 38 1 _ parry _ 2 right keep the right hand in the guard position move the rifle sharply to the right with the left arm so that the bayonet point be about 6 inch to the right 39 1 _ parry _ 2 leave move the rifle sharply to the left front with both hand so as to cover the point attack 40 1 _ parry _ 2 high raise the rifle with both hand high enough to clear the line of vision barrel downward point of the bayonet to the left front -lrb- illustration : par 40 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : par 41 -rrb- when necessary to raise the rifle well above the head it may be support between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand this position will be necessary against attack from higher elevation such as man mount or on top of parapet 41 1 _ low_parry _ 2 right -lrb- left -rrb- carry the point of the bayonet down until it be at the height of the knee move the point of the bayonet sufficiently to the right -lrb- left -rrb- to keep the opponent 's attack clear of the point threaten these parry and rarely use as a attack below the waist leave the head and body expose -lrb- illustration : par 41 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : par 44 -rrb- 42 parry must not be too wide or sweeping but sharp short motion finish with a jerk or quick catch the hand should as far as possible be keep in the line of attack parry against butt strike be make by quickly move the guard so as to cover the point attack 43 to provide against attack from the right left or rear the soldier will change front as quickly as possible in the most convenient maimer : for example : 1 to the left rear 2 _ parry _ 3 high 1 to the right 2 _ parry _ 3 right etc these movement constitute a change of front in which the position of guard be resume at the completion of the movement in change front for the purpose of attack or defense if there be danger of wound a comrade the rifle should first be bring to a vertical position iii instruction without the bayonet 44 1 _ club_rifle _ 2 swing -lrb- illustration : par 44 -rrb- be at order arm at the preparatory command quickly raise and turn the rifle regrasp it with both hand between the rear sight and muzzle barrel down thumb around the stock and toward the butt at the same time raise the rifle above the shoulder farthest from the opponent butt elevated and to the rear elbow slightly bent and knee straight each individual take such position of the foot shoulder and hand as best accord with he natural dexterity swing tighten the grasp of the hand and swing the rifle to the front and downward direct it at the head of the opponent and immediately return to the position of club rifle by complete the swing of the rifle downward and to the rear repeat by the command swing the rifle should be swing with sufficient force to break through any guard or parry that may be interpose be at club rifle order arm be resume by command the use of this attack against dummy or in fencing be prohibit 45 the position of club rifle may be take from any position of the rifle prescribe in the manual of arm it will not be take in personal combat unless the emergency be such as to preclude the use of the bayonet iv combine movement 46 the purpose of combined movement be to develop more vigorous attack and more effective defens than be obtain by the single movement to develop skill in pass from attack to defense and the reverse every movement to the front should be accompany by a attack which be increase in effectiveness by the forward movement of the body every movement to the rear should ordinarily be accompany by a parry and should always be follow by a attack movement to the right or left may be accompany by attack or defense 47 not more than three movement will be use in any combination the instructor should first indicate the number of movement that be to be combine as two movement or three movement the execution be determine by one command of execution and the position of guard be take upon the completion of the last movement only example front pass and lunge right step and thrust leave step and low parry right rear pass parry left and lunge lunge and cut right parry right and parry high butt strike and cut down thrust and parry high parry high and lunge advance thrust and cut right right step parry left and cut down to the left butt strike and cut down to the right rear cut down and butt strike 48 attack against dummy will be practice the approach will be make against the dummy both in quick time and double time v practical bayonet combat 49 the principle of practical bayonet combat should be teach as far as possible during the progress of instruction in bayonet exercise 50 the soldier must be continually impress with the extreme importance of the offensive due to its moral effect should a attack fail it should be follow immediately by another attack before the opponent have a opportunity to assume the offensive keep the opponent on the defensive if due to circumstance it be necessary to take the defensive constantly watch for a opportunity to assume the offensive and take immediate advantage of it 51 observe the ground with a view to obtain the best footing time for this will generally be too limited to permit more than a single hasty glance 52 in personal combat watch the opponent 's eye if they can be plainly see and do not fix the eye on he weapon nor upon the point of you attack if he eye can not be plainly see as in night attack watch the movement of he weapon and of he body 53 keep the body well cover and deliver attack vigorously the point of the bayonet should always be keep as nearly as possible in the line of attack the less the rifle be move upward downward to the right or to the leave the better prepare the soldier be for attack or defense 54 constantly watch for a chance to attack the opponent 's left hand he position of guard will not differ materially from that describe in paragraph 24 if he bayonet be without a cut edge he will be at a great disadvantage 55 the butt be use for close and sudden attack it be particularly useful in riot duty from the position of port arm a sentry can strike a severe blow with the butt of the rifle 56 against a man on foot arm with a sword be careful that the muzzle of the rifle be not grasp all the swordsman 's energy will be direct toward get past the bayonet attack he with short stab thrust and keep he beyond striking distance of he weapon 57 the adversary may attempt a greater extension in the thrust and lunge by quit the grasp of he piece with the left hand and advance the right as far as possible when this be do a sharp parry may cause he to lose control of he rifle leave he expose to a counter attack which should follow promptly 58 against odds a small number of man can fight to best advantage by group themselves so as to prevent they be attack from behind 59 in fight a mount man arm with a saber every effort must be make to get on he near or left side because here he reach be much shorter and he parry much weaker if not possible to disable such a enemy attack he horse and then renew the attack on the horseman 60 in receive night attack the assailant 's movement can be best observe from the kneel or prone position as he approach generally bring he against the sky line when he arrive within attack distance rise quickly and lunge well forward at the middle of he body vi fencing exercise 61 fencing exercise in two line consist of combination of thrust parry and foot movement execute at command or at will the opponent reply with suitable parry and return 62 the instructor will inspect the entire fencing equipment before the exercise begin and fissure himself that everything be in such condition as will prevent accident 63 the man equip themselves and form in two line at the order face each other with interval of about 4 pace between file and a distance of about 2 pace between line one line be designate as number 1 the other number 2 also as attack and defense 64 the opponent be at the order face each other the instructor command : salute each man with eye on he opponent carry the left hand smartly to the right side palm of the hand down thumb and finger extend and join forearm horizontal forefinger touch the bayonet -lrb- two -rrb- drop the arm smartly by the side this salute be the fencing salute all fencing exercise and all fencing at will between individual will begin and terminate with the formal courtesy of the fencing salute 65 after the fencing salute have be render the instructor command : 1 _ fencing_exercise _ 2 guard at the command guard each man come to the position of guard heretofore define bayonet cross each man 's bayonet bearing lightly to the right against the corresponding portion of the opponent 's bayonet this position be know as the engage or engage right 66 be at the engage right : engage leave the attack drop the point of he bayonet quickly until clear of he opponent 's rifle and describe a semicircle with it upward and to the right bayonet be cross similarly as in the engage position each man 's bayonet bearing lightly to the leave against the corresponding portion of the opponent 's bayonet 67 be at engage left : engage right the attack quickly drop the point of he bayonet until clear of he opponent 's rifle and describe a semicircle with it upward and to the left and engage 68 be engage : engage left and right the attack engage left and then immediately engage right 69 be engage left : engage right and leave the attack engage right and then immediately engage left 70 1 number one engage right -lrb- left -rrb- 2 number two counter number one execute the movement order as above number two quickly drop the point of he bayonet and circle it upward to the original position 71 in all fencing while maintain the pressure in the engage a certain freedom of motion of the rifle be allowable consist of the play or up-and-down motion of one bayonet against the other this be necessary to prevent the opponent from divine the intended attack it also prevent he use the point of contact as a pivot for he assault in charge from one engage to the other the movement be control by the left hand the right remain stationary 72 after some exercise in engage engage left and counter exercise will be give in the assault assault 73 the part of the body to be attack will be designate by name as head neck chest stomach leg no attack will be make below the knee the command be give and the movement for each line be first explain thoroughly by the instructor the execution begin at the command assault number one execute the attack and number two parry conversely at command number two attack and number one parry 74 for convenience in instruction assault be divide into simple attack counter attack attack on the rifle and feint simple attack 75 success in these attack depend on quickness of movement there be three simple attack -- the straight the disengagement and the counter disengagement they be not precede by a feint 76 in the straight the bayonet be direct straight at a opening from the engage position contact with the opponent 's rifle may or may not be abandon while make it if the opening be high or low contact with the rifle will usually be abandon on commence the attack if the opening be near he guard the light pressure use in the engage may be continue in the attack example : be at the engage right 1 number one at neck -lrb- head chest right leg etc -rrb- thrust 2 number two parry right 3 assault 77 in the disengagement contact with the opponent 's rifle be abandon and the point of the bayonet be circle under or over he bayonet or rifle and direct into the opening attack this attack be deliver by one continuous spiral movement of the bayonet from the moment contact be abandon example : be at the engage right 1 number one at stomach -lrb- left chest leave leg etc -rrb- thrust 2 number two parry left -lrb- etc -rrb- 3 assault 78 in the counter disengagement a swift attack be make into the opening disclose while the opponent be attempt to change the engagement of he rifle it be deliver by one continuous spiral movement of the bayonet into the opening example : be at the engage right 1 number two engage leave 2 number one at chest thrust 3 number two parry left 4 assault number two initiate the movement number one thrust as soon as the opening be make and number two then attempt to parry 79 a counter attack or return be one make instantly after or in continuation of a parry the parry should be as narrow as possible this make it more difficult for the opponent to recover and counter parry the counter attack should also be make at or just before the full extension of the opponent 's attack as when it be so make a simple extension of the arm will generally be sufficient to reach the opponent 's body example : be at engage 1 number two at chest lunge 2 number one parry right and at stomach -lrb- chest head etc -rrb- thrust 3 assault attack on the rifle 80 these movement be make for the purpose of force or disclose a opening into which a attack can be make they be the press the beat and the twist 81 in the press the attack quickly press against the opponent 's bayonet or rifle with he own and continue the pressure as the attack be deliver example : be at the engage 1 number one press and at chest thrust 2 number two parry right 3 assault 82 the attack by disengagement be particularly effective follow the press example : be at the engage 1 number one press and at stomach thrust 2 number two low parry left 3 assault 83 the beat be a attack in which a sharp blow be strike against the opponent 's rifle for the purpose of force he to expose a opening into which a attack immediately follow it be use when there be but slight opposition or no contact of rifle example : be at the engage 1 number one beat and at stomach -lrb- chest etc -rrb- thrust 2 number two parry left 3 assault 84 in the twist the rifle be cross over the opponent 's rifle or bayonet and he bayonet force downward with a circular motion and a straight attack make into the open it require superior strength on the part of the attack example : be at the engage 1 number one twist and at stomach thrust 2 number two low parry left 3 assault feint 85 feint be movement which threaten or simulate attack and be make with a view to induce a opening or parry that expose the desire point of attack they be either single or double accord to the number of such movement make by the attack 86 in order that the attack may be change quickly as little force as possible be put into a feint example : be at the engage 1 number one feint head thrust at stomach lunge 2 number two parry right and low parry right 3 assault number one execute the feint and then the attack number two execute both parry 87 in double feint first one part of the body and then another be threaten and a third attack example : be at the engage 1 number one feint straight thrust at chest disengagement at chest at stomach lunge 2 number two parry right parry left and low parry left 3 assault 88 a opening may be offer or procure by opposition as in the press or beat 89 in fencing exercise every feint should at first be parry when the defense be able to judge or divine the character of the attack the feint be not necessarily parry but may be nullify by a counter feint 90 a counter feint be a feint follow the opponent 's feint or follow a parry of he attack and generally occur in combined movement combine movement 91 when the man have become thoroughly familiar with the various foot movement parry guard attack feint etc the instructor combine several of they and give the command in quick succession increase the rapidity and number of movement as the man become more skillful opponent will be change frequently 1 example : be at the engage 1 number one by disengagement at chest thrust 2 number two parry left right step -lrb- left foot first -rrb- and lunge 3 assault 2 example : be at engage left 1 number one press and lunge 2 number two parry right left step and thrust 3 assault 3 example : be at the engage 1 number one by disengagement at chest thrust 2 number two parry left front pass and at head butt strike 3 number one right step 4 assault 92 example 1 and 2 be typical of movement know as cross counter and example no 3 of movement know as close counter 93 a chancery be a attack by means of which the opponent be disarm which cause he to lose control of he rifle or which disable he weapon 94 when the different combination be execute with sufficient skill the instructor will devise series of movement to be memorize and execute at the command assault the accuracy and celerity of the movement will be carefully watch by the instructor with a view to the correction of faulty execution 95 it be not intend to restrict the number of movement but to leave to the discretion of company commander and the ingenuity of instructor the selection of such other exercise as accord with the object of the drill vii fencing at will 96 as satisfactory progress be make the instructor will proceed to the exercise at will by which be mean assault between two man each endeavor to hit the other and to avoid be hit himself fencing at will should not be allow to degenerate into random attack and defens 97 the instructor can supervise but one pair of combatant at a time frequent change should be make so that the man may earn different method of attack and defense from each other 98 the contest should begin with simple careful movement with a view to form a correct opinion of the adversary afterwards everything will depend on coolness rapid and correct execution of the movement and quick perception of the adversary 's intention 99 continual retreat from the adversary 's attack and frequent dodge to escape attack should be avoid the offensive should he continually encourage 100 in fencing at will when no command be give opponent face each other at the position of order arm salute they then immediately and simultaneously assume the position of guard rifle engage neither man may take the position of guard before he opponent have complete he salute the choice of position be decide before the salute 101 the opponent be about two pace apart and the fencing salute have be render the instructor command 1 _ at _ _ will _ 2 assault after which either party have the right to attack to interrupt the contest the instructor will command halt at which the combatant will immediately come to the order to terminate the contest the instructor will command 1 _ halt _ 2 salute at which the combatant will immediately come to the order salute and remove they mask 102 when man have acquire confidence in fencing at will one opponent should be require to advance upon the other in quick time at charge bayonet from a distance not to exceed 10 yard and deliver a attack as soon as a hit be make by either opponent the instructor command halt and the assault terminate opponent alternate in assault the assailant be likewise require to advance at double time from a distance not exceed 20 yard and at a run from a distance not exceed 30 yard 103 the instructor will closely observe the contest and decide doubtful point he will at once stop the contest upon the slightest indication of temper after conclusion of the combat he will comment on the action of both party point out error and deficiency and explain how they may be avoid in the future 104 as additional instruction the man may be permit to wield the rifle leave hand that be on the left side of the body leave hand at the small of the stock many man will be able to use this method to advantage it be also of value in case the left band be wound -lrb- illustration : par 104 -rrb- 105 after man have fence in pair practice should be give in fencing between group equally and unequally divide when practicable intrenchment will be use in fencing of this character in group fencing it will be necessary to have a sufficient number of umpire to decide hit a individual receive a hit be withdraw at once from the bout which be decide in favor of the group have the numerical superiority at the end the fencing salute be not require in group fencing rule for fencing at will 106 1 hit on the leg below the knee will not be count no hit count unless in the opinion of the instructor it have sufficient force to disable 2 upon receive a hit call out hit 3 after receive a fair hit a counter attack be not permit a position of engage be take 4 a second or third hit in a combined attack will be count only when the first hit be not call 5 when it be necessary to stop the contest -- for example because of breaking of weapon or displacement of means of protection -- take the position of the order 6 when it be necessary to suspend the assault for any cause it will not be resume until the adversary be ready and in condition to defend himself 7 attack direct at the crotch be prohibit in fencing 8 step out of bound when establish count as a hit suggestion for fencing at will 107 when engage in a assault first study the adversary 's position and proceed by false attack execute with speed to discover if possible he instinctive parry in order to draw the adversary out and induce he to expose that part of the body at which the attack be to be make it be advisable to simulate a attack by a feint and then make the real attack 108 return attack should be frequently practice as they be difficult to parry and the opponent be within easier reach and more expose the return can be make a continuation of the parry as there be no previous warning of its delivery although it should always be expect return be make without lunge if the adversary can be reach by thrust or cut 109 endeavor to overcome the tendency to make a return without know where it will hit make return blindly be a bad habit and lead to instinctive return -- that be habitual return with certain attack from certain parry -- a fault which the skilled opponent will soon discover 110 do not draw the rifle back preparatory to thrust and lunge 111 the purpose of fencing at will be to teach the soldier as many form of simple effective attack and defens as possible complicated and intricate movement should not be attempt hint for instructor 112 the influence of the instructor be great he must be master of he weapon not only to show the various movement but also to lead in the exercise at will he should stimulate the zeal of the man and arouse pleasure in the work officer should qualify themselves as instructor by fence with each other 113 the character of each man he bodily conformation and he degree of skill must always be take into account when the instructor be demonstrate the combination feint return and parry the rapidity of he attack should be regulate by the skill of the pupil and no more force than be necessary should be use if the pupil expose himself too much in the feint and parry the instructor will by a attack convince he of he error but if these return be too swiftly or too strongly make the pupil will become overcautious and the precision of he attack will be impaired the object be to teach the pupil not to give exhibition of superior skill 114 occasionally the instructor should leave himself uncovered and fail to parry in order to teach the pupil to take quick advantage of such opportunity suggestion instruction in bayonet exercise and bayonet fencing should be conduct with a view to teach the aggressive use of the bayonet unless troops be so thoroughly train with the bayonet that they believe that with it they be superior to they opponent it will be difficult or impossible to develop that morale which be necessary for a successful assault man should be impress with the importance of act always on the offensive in bayonet combat of push they attack with all they might troops which be successful in they first few bayonet encounter will seldom thereafter be call upon to use the bayonet -- they opponent will not await the assault chapter vi field service section 1 principle of infantry training inaction give every advantage to the enemy the offensive alone give decisive result a quick and energetic offensive minimize loss a advance against the enemy 's position once enter upon must be continue to go back under fire be to die the best way to hold down the fire of the enemy and to diminish he power to inflict loss be to bring the position he occupy under well conduct and continue fire present as small a target as possible to the enemy by utilize every bit of cover the ground afford individual skill in marksmanship be a advantage in battle only when unite with fire discipline and control constant movement to the front lessen the effect of the enemy 's fire modern battle fight in the open show that the heaviest loss be in the mid and long range when close range be reach the loss diminish rapidly the best protection against artillery fire be a constant but irregular movement to the front when close to the enemy 's position he fire be least effective a knowledge of how to use the bayonet and the will to use it must often be the decide factor in battle finally : in infantry training we can not go far wrong or fail to accomplish the best result if we keep before we mind the spirit as well as the wording of paragraph 352 of the infantry drill regulation : the duty of infantry be many and difficult all infantry must be fit to cope with all condition that may arise modern war require but one kind of infantry -- good infantry section 2 combat the field of battle be the final test of the instruction discipline and efficiency of the fight force of any army the battalion be the attack unit or the defense unit whether operating alone or as part of a regiment the company constitute the firing line and the support a individual soldier be concern only with the enemy in he immediate front in obey order and instinctively do what he have be train to do the one requisite necessary to win the battle be intelligent team work the army be handle just like a football team a part be on the first line face the enemy another part like the half back be hold back as support another part like the full back be hold as a reserve each unit like each player have a certain duty to perform when the signal be give all work together -- all play the game -- team work the player consist of all branch of the service the same rule hold true down to the smallest unit and even to the individual enlist man each regiment be a team compose of three player -- each a battalion each battalion be a team of four player -- each a company in the same manner each company be a team of two or more platoon each platoon a team of two or more squad and last but not least each squad be a team of eight player the one question that always present itself on the battlefield every minute of the time to every person whether he be a general or a private be what play have my team captain order and how best may i act so as to work in conjunction with the other player to bring about the desire result -- team play to the infantry private this mean -- first prompt and loyal obedience to the squad leader every squad always have a team captain if the squad leader be kill or disabled another player previously designate take he place if no one be designate then the private with the longest service take command when the squad leader give the command for a certain play do not stop to think if the play be a good one but do you very best to carry ont the play as order a poor play in which every player enter with he whole heart -lrb- team work -rrb- will often win while on the other hand the best play in which some of the player be skulker and shirker will probably fail second never lose touch with you squad every individual as well as every unit should always be act under the control of some higher commander this be necessary if there be to be any unity of action therefore if you lose you squad or it become break up join the first squad you can find and obey you new squad leader as loyally and as cheerfully as you do you own infantry approach the battle field in column of squad while yet several mile from the enemy 's position the troops may come under artillery fire on green man enter upon they fight the sound of the projectile whistle through the air the noise flash and smoke on the burst of the shrapnel and the hum of the various piece thereafter all produce a very terrifying effect but old soldier soon learn to pay little attention to this as the danger be not great as the troops advance the column break up into smaller column which form on a irregular line with more or less interval between as the advance continue each column break up into smaller column until finally a line of skirmisher be form firing be delay as long as possible for three reason viz : -lrb- a -rrb- at the extreme range little damage can be do on the enemy and ineffective firing always encourage he -lrb- b -rrb- halt to fire delay the advance and the great object to be accomplish be to close in on the enemy where you can meet he on better term -lrb- c -rrb- plenty of ammunition will be require at the decisive stage of the fight and it be very difficult to send extra ammunition up to the firing line therefore never fire until order to do so and then never fire more than the number of round designate never fire after the command cease firing be give ammunition in the bandoleer will ordinarily be expend first thirty round in the right pocket section of the belt will be hold as a reserve to be expend only when order by a officer soon however it will be necessary to halt and open fire on the enemy in order to cause he some loss to make he rifleman keep down in they trench and to make they fire wildly it be probable that at this time and until you arrive much closer you will not see any of the enemy to fire at you may not even see any trench nor know just where the enemy be you higher officer however with they field glass and the message they receive will know each company will be assign a certain front to cover with its fire therefore be careful to fix you sight at the designate range and fire only at the designate target this mean team work in firing which be one of the most important element of success the firing line advance from position to position by means of rush at long range the entire line may rush forward at the same time but as the range decrease one part of the line rush forward while the remainder keep up a hot fire on the enemy the number take part in each rush decrease as the fire of the enemy become warmer until perhaps only one squad or even less rush or crawl forward at a time protect by the fire of the rest of the company the distance cover by each rush also become less and less after any rush no part of the line again advance until the rest of the line be up in make a rush the leader of the unit give the signal and lead the way the rest follow no attempt be make to keep a line but each man rush forward at a run seek only to reach the new halting position as quickly and with as little exposure as possible when halt the skirmisher need not be in a perfect line but every advantage should be take of the ground for concealment and protection it be necessary only that no man or group of man should interfere with the fire of other part of the firing line the noise on the firing line will be great leader will be disabled and new man will take they place reinforcement come up will cause unit to become mixed to the green man everything may appear to be in confusion but this be not so this be war as it really be if you have lose you squad or you squad leader join the leader nearest to you this be the way the game be play as long as the fight last every available rifleman must be keep in the firing line the first and last consideration be to win the battle therefore under no circumstance will any soldier be permit to go to the rear either for ammunition or to assist the wound if the attack force can no longer advance it be much safer to throw up hasty intrenchment and await the arrival of reinforcement or darkness than it be to retreat retreat troops be the one that suffer the greatest this lesson be teach by every great war therefore always remember that the safest thing to do be to stick to firing line troops on the firing line when not actually engage in firing at the enemy busy themselves throw up shelter trench it only require a few minute to construct a trench that give great protection therefore never get separate from you intrenching tool concealment be no less important than protection therefore when condition permit as be generally the case when on the defensive every effort should be make to hide intrenchment by the use of sod grass weed bush etc in make a attack the infantry be always support when possible by its own artillery which continue to fire over its head until the infantry arrive very close to the enemy 's trench this fire be help you a great deal by keep down the fire of the enemy infantry and artillery therefore do not think you be be fire into by you own artillery because you hear they shell and shrapnel singing through the air or burst a short distance in you front but rather be thankful you be receive they help up to the very last minute in the last rush which carry the enemy 's position there be always much mix of unit the firing line do not continue rush madly as individual after the enemy but halt and fire on he until he get out of good range the pursuit be take up by form troops hold in reserve or by the firing line only after its unit be again get together as the fighting often last all day and great suffering be cause from thirst do not throwaway you canteen when the fight commence it may also be impossible to get ration up to the line during the night therefore it be advisable to hold onto at least one ration as the recent war have show the possibility of hand-to-hand fighting especially at night each soldier should be school in the use of the bayonet the following have particular reference to the duty of platoon and squad leader and to the team work of the platoon in combat : attack troops must first gain fire superiority in order to reach the hostile position by gain fire superiority be mean make one 's fire superior to that of the enemy in volume and accuracy and it depend upon the number of rifle employ the rate of fire the character of the target training and discipline and fire direction and control when the fire of the attacker become effective and superior to that of the defender the latter be no longer able to effectively and coolly aim and fire at the former and as a consequence the attacker be able to inaugurate a successful rush or advance which carry they nearer to the enemy 's position when a trained organization have be commit to the attack the gain of fire superiority depend upon the way in which fire direction and fire control be exercise the captain direct the fire of the company he indicate to the platoon commander the target -lrb- enemy -rrb- which the company be to fire and advance upon and tell each upon which part of this target he be to direct the fire of he platoon when he desire the fire to be open he give the necessary command or signal include the range at which the sight lira to be set when the fire fight have once start it become to a great extent a fight of a number of platoon the platoon be the largest organization which can be control by a single leader in action the platoon commander -lrb- lieutenant or sergeant -rrb- control its fire in order to gain the maximum fire effect and to avoid waste ammunition he must try he best to make the fire of he platoon effective to get it forward and to support neighbor platoon in they effort to advance at the same time he must hold himself subject to he captain 's direction he should take advantage of every chance to carry he platoon forward unless otherwise order in all this he be assist by he platoon guide -lrb- sergeant -rrb- and by he corporal at the commencement of a engagement the platoon commander will give the objective -lrb- part of the enemy 's line or aim target -rrb- at which he platoon be to direct its fire noncommissioned officer must be sure that they see and understand the objective and that all the man in they squad do likewise fire be then direct at this objective without further command until the platoon commander give a new objective man should be instruct to aim at that part of the target assign to they platoon which correspond with they own position in they own platoon so that there will be no portion of the target which be not cover by fire a portion of the enemy 's line not cover by fire mean that that portion be able to coolly aim and fire at they opponent in a engagement the voice can seldom be hear over a few foot and the platoon commander will generally have to convey he order by signal a corporal may be able to shout order to he squad and order may be repeat along a skirmish line by shout care should be take that order intend for one platoon only be not thus convey to another platoon a short blast on the whistle give by the platoon commander mean attention to order all noncommissioned officer at once suspend firing and glance toward the platoon commander to see if the latter have any signal or order for they if not they resume firing a long blast on the whistle means suspend firing when a noncommissioned officer hear this signal from he platoon commander he should at once shout suspend firing upon receive a signal the noncommissioned officer for whom it be intend should at once repeat it back to be sure that it be correctly understand when a leader in command of a platoon or squad receive a order or signal to rush he should cause he man to suspend firing and to hold themselves flat but ready for a sprinter 's start he select the point as far as possible with reference to cover to which he intend to carry he unit forward he then give the command rush spring forward and run at full speed about three pace ahead of he man lead they in the rush arrive at the position he have select he throw himself prone and the man drop on either side of he all crawl forward to good firing position consider the cover also and the leader give the necessary order for resume the fire the latter will include give the range again the length of the rush be subtract from the sight set order at the last position as a rule rush should be start by a unit on one flank and should be follow in succession by the other unit to the opposite flank each succeed unit should halt on the line establish by the unit which first rush when a unit be about to rush leader in charge of adjacent unit should caution they man to be careful not to fire into the rush unit as it bound forward when one unit suspend fire for the purpose of rush adjacent leader should arrange to have a portion of they man turn they fire on the target of the rush unit to the end that there may be no portion of the enemy 's line not under fire and able to fire coolly on the rush unit rush should be make for as long a distance as possible due regard be have for the wind of the man and not to get beyond support distance of the other unit long rush facilitate a advance and quickly place a skirmish line close to the enemy 's position where its fire will have more effect a attack line suffer less from casualty at short range than it do at mid range every advantage should be take to utilize the cover available the best kind of cover be that which while it mask the skirmisher from the sight and fire of the enemy afford favorable condition for firing and for readily advance in order to allow man to regain they wind or should the fire of the enemy be so effective as to prevent a further advance without reinforcement advantage may be take to lie close in cover or hasty fire trench may be throw up in order to allow the line to maintain its position to go back under fire be to die when a platoon be firing all noncommissioned officer watch every opportunity to make the fire more effective the platoon guide should constantly watch the man to see that they do not become excited fire too hastily or without aim that they sight be set at the correct range that they be obviously firing at the designate target and that they assume steady firing position and take advantage of cover in perform these duty it may be necessary for the guide to be constantly crawl along the line a corporal in like manner supervise he squad firing with it when he be not actively engage in control it bayonet be fix preparatory to a charge this command be usually give by the bugle only one or two man in each squad should fix they bayonet at the same time in order that there may be no marked pause or diminution in the fire at this critical stage of the engagement in order to be effective in combat the platoon must be thoroughly train to work as a team each noncommissioned officer must be conversant with the signal and command and the proper method for instantly put into effect the order of he platoon commander each private must be train until he instinctively do the right thing in each phase of the action section 3 patrolling the designation of a patrol indicate the nature of the duty for which it be detail as for example visit reconnoiter explore flanking combat harass pursue etc a infantry patrol consist as a rule of from 3 to 16 man reconnoiter patrol be habitually small and seek safety in concealment or flight fight only when they mission demand it the most skillful reconnaissance be where patrol accomplish they mission and return without be discover by the enemy when resistance be expect stronger detachment be require these cover themselves with small patrol of two to four man the remainder act as support the commander determine the number and strength of patrol and when they be to be send out it be a cardinal principle to send out patrol of such strength only as will accomplish the object the officer send out the patrol verify the detail designate a second in command and give the necessary instruction the order or instruction for a patrol or for any detachment go on reconnoissance must state clearly where the enemy be or be suppose to be what information be desire what feature be of special importance the general direction to be follow whether friendly patrol be liable to be encounter and where message be to be send or the patrol be to report important and comprehensive instruction should be in write but precaution against capture of papers must be take a officer send out a patrol must be certain that he order be understand detailed instruction be as a rule avoid when necessary the time of return be state the patrol leader should be select with care he should have good judgment courage be able to read map make sketch and send clear and concise message in addition to he ordinary equipment he should have a map of the country a watch field glass compass whistle message blank and pencil the leader of a patrol should carefully inspect it before start out and see that each member be in good physical condition have serviceable shoe a full canteen one ration a first-aid packet and that he rifle and ammunition be in good condition he will see that the equipment be arrange so as not to rattle that nothing bright be expose so as to glitter in the sunlight that nothing be take along that will give information to the enemy should any member fall into he hand as for example copy of order map with position of troops marked thereon letter newspaper or collar ornament blanket roll should generally be leave behind in order that the patrol may travel as light as possible the leader then give he patrol information and instruction these embrace instruction from higher authority he detailed plan information of the country and enemy the countersign if any the point where the patrol will assemble if scatter he will see that the man understand the prescribed signal it must always be remember that it make no difference how valuable may be the information that the patrol get it be worthless if not send back in time to be of service herein be where most patrol full this apply particularly to the information obtain by patrol act as a point or flanker of advance rear and flank guard whenever the patrol get any information the leader must think whether the commanding officer would change he plan or issue new order if he have the information if he would the information should be send back at once if the distance be great or the inhabitant be hostile it be well to send two man with the message these man should not travel side by side but as a patrol of two man if the information be very important and the danger of capture be considerable the message should be send by two party each travel by a different route a message from a patrol should always show -lrb- a -rrb- the place from which it be send -lrb- b -rrb- the time it be send -lrb- date hour and minute -rrb- -lrb- c -rrb- to whom it be send -lrb- d -rrb- the message itself -lrb- e -rrb- what the patrol intend do after send the message -lrb- f -rrb- the name of the sender under -lrb- d -rrb- care must be take to separate what have actually be see by the patrol from information receive from other source care must also be take not to exaggerate what be see but to report only the exact fact in they conduct patrol exercise the greatest vigilance to prevent discovery no formal formation be or should be prescribe under the leader 's guidance it move so as to guard against surprise usually with point and flanker to extend the sphere of its observation still smaller patrol -lrb- one or two man -rrb- may be send out for short distance communication with the leader be maintain by signal whatever the formation adopt it should favor the escape of at least one man in case of surprise in patrol of two to five man the commander generally lead in this formation few signal be necessary the man simply regulate they movement by he in question civilian caution be observe not to disclose information that may be of value to the enemy stranger be not allow to precede the patrol patrol lender be authorize to seize telegram and mail matter and to arrest individual report the fact as soon as possible patrol should observe everything for sign of the enemy even apparent trifle may be of great value the finding of a collar ornament show a man 's regiment may enable the chief of staff to determine that the enemy have be reenforce patrol should not travel on the main road if they can observe they and at the same time make the necessary progress by move some distance to the side of the road unless in case of attack or of great personal danger no member of the patrol should fire on hostile troops without order from the patrol leader when send out to gain information patrol should avoid fight unless it be absolutely necessary in order to carry out they order village and inclosure involve danger of surprise be enter with precaution and for brief period only halt be make at point afford good view and the country be study in all direction landmark to the rear be impress on the mind of the man so that the way back can be readily find the leader consult he map and locate himself thereon when a patrol be scatter it reassemble at some place previously select if check in one direction it take another if cut off it return by a detour or force its way through as a last resort it scatter so that at least one man may return with information patrol near they own line should march at a walk unless press by the enemy occasionally it be advisable fur the leader to conceal he patrol and continue the reconnoissance with one or two companion patrol far from they command or in contact with the enemy often remain out overnight in such case they seek a place of concealment proceeding thereto after nightfall or under cover when the enemy be encounter it be very necessary to locate he main force information be particularly desire of he strength whether he have infantry cavalry and artillery the route and direction of he march or the location of he camp and line of outpost dust cloud indicate move body infantry raise a low thick cloud cavalry a high thin cloud artillery and wagon a broken cloud the kind of troops direction of march and approximate strength may thus sometimes be roughly estimate if from some position a body of troops can be see march along in column the exact time in minute and seconds it require for they to pa a certain point should be note together with the formation they be in thus : infantry column of squad three minute and twelve seconds cavalry column of two at a trot one minute and twenty seconds wagon four-mule five minute from this information the strength can be determine by the follow rule : assume that infantry in column of squad occupy half a yard per man cavalry in column of fours 1 yard per man and artillery and wagon in single column 20 yard per gun caisson or wagon a give point would be pass in one minute by about -- 175 infantry 110 cavalry at a walk 200 cavalry at a trot 5 gun caisson or wagon for troops in column of two take one-half of the above estimate patrol should always observe the country march over with a view to make a report on the same the follow information be always of value : road -- direction kind whether dirt gravel macadam etc width whether suitable for column of squad etc border whether fence with stone barb wire rail etc steepness in cross hill and valley where they pass through defile and along command height etc crossroads surround country -- whether generally open and passable for infantry cavalry and artillery or whether broken and impassable due to fence wood crop ravine etc railroad -- single or double track narrow or broad gauge tunnel bridge cut direction station etc bridge -- material wood stone steel etc : length and breadth number and kind of pier or support river -- direction width depth kind of bottom such as mud sand rocky etc : bank steep or gentle open or wooded rapidity of current variation in depth at different time as indicate by driftwood and high-water mark island height in vicinity commanding stream wood -- extent and shape kind of tree free from underbrush or not clearing road swamp ravine etc telegraph line -- number of wire along rond or railroad station etc village -- size kind of house nature of street mean of defense etc hill and ridge -- whether slope be gentle or steep whether top be narrow or wide whether ground be break or smooth wooded or clear whether difficult or easy to cross etc whether command by other hill defile -- they direction length and width whether surround height be passable for infantry and artillery kind of country at each opening of the defile etc ravine ditch etc -- width and depth bank whether passable for infantry cavalry and wagon whether suitable for trench or for movement of troops therein etc in general every soldier should be constantly on the lookout to obtain information that might be of some military value remember that information of the enemy and of the country be worthless unless make know to the proper official in time to be of use every soldier should be able to find he way in a strange country should know how to use a compass should know how to locate the north star should be able to travel across country keep a give direction both by day and by night and by observe landmark he should be able to return to the start point either over the same route or by a more circuitous one this can easily be learn by a little practice it add a great deal to the value of a soldier if he know how to use a map to find he way if he know how to make a rough sketch of the country show the position of road stream wood railroad bridge house village field fence hill etc he have add to he value as a soldier very much indeed because a rough sketch of a country will give more and better information at a glance than can be obtain by read many page of write description patrolling be one of the most important duty a soldier can learn any enlist man who understand thoroughly he duty as a member of a patrol will understand also most of he duty when with advance or rear guard or when on outpost duty patrolling can not be learn merely by read book nor by work indoors thoroughness come only by actually go out in the country and act as a patrol in carry out this idea the follow scheme be recommend : let four or more man and a noncommissioned officer act as a patrol they assemble at a certain time at a convenient point on some country road a officer whom we will call captain a act as the director the noncommissioned officer whom we will call sergeant b act as patrol leader and the other -lrb- private c d e etc -rrb- act as member of sergeant b 's patrol assume that the company -lrb- battalion etc -rrb- have just make camp in this vicinity find that the inhabitant be friendly -lrb- or hostile -rrb- captain a indicate to the rest of the man where the camp be situate and point out where the various sentinel be post -lrb- this in itself afford a opportunity for much discussion and for teach many valuable lesson -rrb- captain a then call up sergeant b and tell he -- -lrb- a -rrb- just what information captain a have of the enemy and also any information of the country or of friendly troops in the vicinity that might be of service to sergeant b -lrb- b -rrb- how many man he shall take for the patrol -lrb- this be another problem for captain a to solve -rrb- any man present not use as part of the patrol go along with captain a as observer -lrb- c -rrb- how far he shall go and what country he shall cover with the patrol -lrb- d -rrb- just what information it be particularly desire he shall obtain -lrb- e -rrb- where he shall send he message and when he shall return example 1 : sergeant b it have just be report to I that a company of hostile infantry be in camp last night at x about 5 mile from here on this road take 5 man and proceed toward x and find out whether the enemy be still there and if not when he leave and where he go send message to I here and return by 8 o'clock this evening example 2 : sergeant b i think i hear the firing of field gun over in that direction a short while ago take 6 man and proceed to that high hill you see over there about 4 mile away send a message to I here when you reach there you may go farther if you then think it advisable but return before daylight i desire particularly to know if there be any hostile troops in this vicinity especially artillery i shall send sergeant x with 3 man to observe the country from that hill you see over there farther to the south he will remain there till dark send message to I here if the company be not here on you return you will find a note for you underneath this rail example 3 : sergeant b this friendly country boy have just report that four hostile cavalryman stop about half a hour ago at he father 's house which he say be about 2 mile up this road one of the man seem to be very sick you will select eight man from you section and endeavor to capture these man if they have disappear you will reconnoiter in that vicinity until dark this boy will accompany you as a guide i desire particularly to learn the position strength and composition of any hostile troops in this vicinity send report to I here return before daylight example 4 : sergeant b here be a map of the country in this vicinity on a scale of 1 inch to the mile here be where we be camp -lrb- indicate position on map -rrb- i have just learn that forage party of the enemy be collect supplies over here at x -lrb- indicate point on map -rrb- which be 10 mile off in that direction -lrb- point across country toward x -rrb- it be report that this bridge over this stream -lrb- indicate same on the map -rrb- which be about 3 mile down this road -lrb- indicate road and direction on the ground -rrb- have be destroy you will take three man from you platoon and verify this report you will also reconnoiter the stream for a distance of 1 mile both above and below the bridge for ford suitable for infantry message will reach I here return by 8 o'clock to-night sergeant b then inspect he man and give they they instruction the patrol be then form and move out exactly as it would under actual war condition captain a may halt -lrb- and assemble if desirable -rrb- the patrol at interval in order to discuss the formation use and the movement of any member of the patrol they route use of cover etc with the reason therefor and compare the same with suggest modification of the formation etc after the discussion the patrol be again set in motion captain a may accompany any part of the patrol from time to time he present certain situation to some member of the patrol be very careful to assume only such situation as might naturally occur thus take example 1 : captain a be with sergeant b who with private c be march along the road as the point of the patrol the other member of the patrol be distribute to suit the nature of the country over which the patrol be march the point have just reach a ridge beyond which the country be open and cultivate for about half a mile beyond this the road enter a wood captain a now say : sergeant b from this point you see two soldier in khaki on the road there at the beginning of that cornfield about 200 yard from the wood -lrb- point out same -rrb- they be move in this direction about 200 yard to the right of these find somewhat farther to they rear you see two more man move along that rail fence sergeant b now do exactly as he would do in actual war how do he signal to he patrol do he assemble he man if so how and where do he send a message back to camp and if so by whom and be it write or verbal -lrb- if write sergeant b actually write it and deliver it to private -- with the necessary instruction if verbal it be actually give to private -- with instruction -rrb- captain a must in this case make note of what the message be in either case private -- cease to be a member of the patrol and join captain a as a observer he should however at some later time be require to repeat he message to captain a on the assumption that he have reach camp with the same the message whether oral or write should be thoroughly analyze and discuss be it proper to send a message at this time do sergeant b intend to remain in observation if so how long -lrb- captain a can give such information from time to time concern the hostile patrol as sergeant b might reasonably be suppose to learn in view of he disposition in order that captain a may present natural assumption it be very essential that in he own mind he should at the outset assume a situation for the hostile force and that he should consider himself as in command of all hostile troops in this particular case he should assume himself to be in command of the hostile patrol act under certain specify order similar to example give and he should conduct this patrol in he own mind in accordance with these order give sergeant b only such information as he might reasonably be expect to obtain in view of whatever action sergeant b take -rrb- will sergeant b attempt to capture this patrol if so how will he avoid fighting and attempt to pass it unobserved and if so how and why in this manner the exercise be continue care must be take not to have the patrol leader or member state what they would do but they must actually do it explanation and discussion may take place later in a similar manner the director may inform sergeant b -lrb- or any member of the patrol -rrb- that this hostile patrol be follow by a squad -lrb- on the assumption that it be the lead unit of a advance guard -rrb- and the exercise be then continue along these line the following be example of assumption that might be make and carry out : -lrb- a -rrb- that the patrol be unexpectedly fire upon -lrb- b -rrb- that one or more of the patrol be wound -lrb- c -rrb- that a prisoner be capture -lrb- let a observer act as prisoner -rrb- -lrb- d -rrb- that a friendly inhabitant give certain information -lrb- e -rrb- that a dust cloud be see in the distance over the tree -lrb- f -rrb- that a column of troops can be see march along a distant road -lrb- g -rrb- that a abandon camp be discover and certain sign note -lrb- h -rrb- that the patrol be attack by a superior force and compel to scatter there be practically no end to the number of reasonable assumption that may be make company officer may use this method of instruct non-commissioned officer in patrolling advance and rear guard duty outpost and in squad lead in write message in select position for trench and in construct and conceal same this form of instruction be call a tactical walk it be very greatly use by all foreign army exercise along the same general line be conduct for field and staff officer and even general officer and be call tactical ride and strategical ride depend upon they object after some proficiency have be attain as a result of these tactical walk the greatest interest and enthusiasm can be awaken in this work by send out two patrol the same day one to operate against the other each should wear a distinctive uniform the strength of each patrol its start point route to be follow and its order should all be unknown to the other patrol if blank ammunition be use a officer should supervise its issue and carefully inspect to see that no man carry any ball cartridge one umpire should accompany the commander of each party each umpire should be fully inform of the strength order and route of both patrol he must however carefully avoid give suggestion or offer any information to the commander observer in these small maneuver problem be generally in the way and none should be permit to be along these small maneuver may be gradually develop by have one side establish al outpost or fight a delaying action etc it should always be remember that there be no hard and fast rule prescribe how a patrol of three five or any number of man should march the same be equally true of advance guard and apply also to the establishment of outpost it be simply a question of common sense base on military knowledge do not try to remember any diagram in a book think only of what you have be order to do and how best you can handle you man to accomplish you mission and at the same time save the man from any unnecessary hardship never use two or more man to do what one can do just as well and do not let you man get beyond you control in addition to the signal prescribe in the infantry drill regulation the following should be clearly understand by the member of a patrol enemy in sight in small number hold rifle above the head horizontally enemy in force same proceeding raise and lower the rifle several time take cover a downward motion of the hand other signal may be agree upon but they must be familiar to the man complicate signal be avoid signal must be use cautiously so as not to convey information to the enemy section 4 advance guard the advance guard be a detachment of the main body which precede and cover it on the march the primary duty of a advance guard be to insure the safe and uninterrupted march of the main body specifically its duty be : 1 to guard against surprise and furnish information by reconnoiter 2 to push back small party of the enemy and prevent they observe firing upon or delay the main body 3 to check the enemy 's advance in force long enough to permit the main body to prepare for action 4 when the enemy be encounter on the defensive to seize a good position and locate he line care be take not to bring on a general engagement unless the advance guard commander be empower to do so 5 to remove obstacle repair the road and favor in every way the steady march of the column the strength of the advance guard will vary with the proximity of the enemy and character of the country for a regiment it will generally consist of from two company to a battalion for a battalion of one company for a company of from a squad to a platoon the advance guard commander be responsible for the proper performance of the duty with which it be charge and for its conduct and formation the advance guard provide for its security and gain information by throw out to the front and flank smaller body each part must keep in touch with the unit from which it be send out a advance guard be generally divide into a reserve and a support where it consist of less than a battalion the reserve be generally omit the support send forward a advance party which in turn send forward a point in small advance guard the point precede the advance party about 150 yard the advance party the support about 300 yard and the support the main body about 400 yard where advance guard be large enough to require a reserve these distance be increase about one-fourth the reserve follow the support the main body follow the reserve at a distance vary from 500 to 800 yard unless the country to the flank be distinctly visible from the road for a distance of what may be say to be effective rifle fire approximately 1000 yard flanking patrol of two or three man each should be send out from the advance party and when in proximity of the enemy in addition from the support when the nature of the country be such that patrol may move across country without undue effort and fatigue these patrol should march at a distance of from 200 to 300 yard from the flank of the body from which detach for the examination of any object such as a wood building etc examine patrol should be send out from the main body the usual method of protect the flank particularly when the country be at all cut up or difficult be to send out patrol from time to time to some point from which a good outlook can be obtain or which will afford protection to the enemy these patrol remain in observation until the advance guard have pass when they rejoin the nearest subdivision as quickly as possible work they way to that to which they belong during the halt by send out a succession of small patrol in this manner the flank be protect should the advance party become deplete it must be reenforce from the support a battalion act as advance guard would have two company in reserve and two in support the support would send forward as advance party two platoon the advance party in turn send forward as point one squad a company act as advance guard would have no reserve and would send forward as advance party one platoon case may arise when the best means of cover the head and flank of the column will be by a line of skirmisher extend at interval of from 5 to 50 yard as for instance when pass through high corn underbrush etc it must always be remember that the principal duty of the advance guard be to secure the uninterrupted march of the main body if the point be fire upon it should at once deploy and endeavor to advance fight the flanker should assist in this and endeavor to locate the enemy 's flank should there be such resistance that advance be impossible each succeed body should march promptly forward and in turn be place in action with the idea of clear the way for the advance of the main body should this be impossible the commander of the entire body must determine what measure he will take section 5 rear guard a rear guard be a detachment detail to protect the main body from attack in rear in a retreat it check pursuit and enable the main body to increase the distance between it and the enemy and to re-form if disorganize the general formation be that of a advance guard reverse its commander should take advantage of every favorable opportunity to delay the pursuer by obstruct the road or by take up specially favorable position from which to force the enemy to deploy in this latter case care must be take not to become so closely engage as to render withdrawal unnecessarily difficult the position take should be select with reference to ease of withdrawal and ability to bring the enemy under fire at long range section 6 flank guard a flank guard be a detachment detail to cover the flank of a column march past or across the front of a enemy it may be place in position to protect the passage or it may be so march as to cover the passage the object of the flank guard be to hold the enemy in check long enough to enable the main body to pass or like the advance guard to enable the main body to deploy like all other detachment it should be no larger than be necessary and should not be detail except when its protection be require when a flank guard consist of a regiment or less its distance from the main body should not exceed a mile and a half practicable communication must exist between it and the main body the flank guard be march as a separate command that be with advance or rear guard or both as circumstance demand and with patrolling on the expose flank section 7 outpost troops not on the march provide for they security by outpost the general duty of a outpost be reconnoissance observation and resistance the specific duty be : 1 to protect the main body so that the troops may rest undisturbed 2 in case of attack to check the enemy long enough to enable the main body to make the necessary disposition during a advance the outpost be usually detail from the advance guard during the retreat the outpost for the night usually form the rear guard the next day if the command remain in bivouac the new outpost generally go on duty at daybreak the vigilance of outpost troops must be unceasing but they should avoid bring on combat or unnecessarily alarming the command firing disturb the rest of troops and if frequently indulge in cease to be a warning no trumpet signal except to arm or to horse be sound and all unnecessary noise must be avoid as a rule a outpost will not exceed one-sixth the strength of a command for a single company a few sentinel and patrol will suffice for a larger command a more elaborate system must be devise the troops compose the outpost be generally divide into a reserve and several support at a proper distance in front of the camp of the main body a line which offer a good defensive position be select this be call the line of resistance and should he so located that a advance enemy will be hold in check beyond effective rifle range in case of a small force artillery range in case of a large force of the main body until the latter can deploy the reserve be station at some point in rear of this line where it can be move quickly to reinforce any point as need the line of resistance be divide into section the limit of each of which be clearly define a support be assign to each section which be number from right to leave and occupy a position on or near the line have special regard to cover avenue of approach the position occupy should always be intrench the reserve and support proceed to they respective position by the shortest route provide for they own protection by send out cover detachment generally speak about one-half the infantry of the advance guard should be in the support as each support arrive at its position it send out observation group vary in size from four man to a platoon to watch the country in the direction of the enemy these group be call outguard for convenience they be classify as picket sentry squad and cossack post and should be sufficient in number to cover the front of the section occupy by the support and connect with the neighbor support a picket be a group consist of two or more squad ordinarily not exceed half a company post in the line of outpost to cover a give sector it furnish patrol and one or more sentinel sentry squad or cossack post for observation picket be place at the more important point in the line of outguard such as road fork the strength of each depend upon the number of small group require to observe properly its sector a sentry squad be a squad -lrb- eight man -rrb- post in observation at a indicated point it post a double sentinel in observation the remain man rest near by and furnish the relief of sentinel in some case it may be require to furnish a patrol a cossack post consist of four man it be a observation group similar to a sentry squad but employ a single sentinel as a rule not more than one-third of the support should be on outguard duty as soon as they be send out to they postion the support commander select a defensive position on the line of resistance give instruction for intrench same establish a sentinel to watch for and transmit signal from outguard send out patrol to reconnoiter the country to the front of he section and if on the flank of the line the flank and then proceed to make a careful reconnoissance of the section assign he rectify the position of outguard if necessary see that they understand they instruction in case of attack or when stranger approach they post and point out they line of retreat in case they be compel to fall back on the support when the outguard be establish the member of the support may stack arm and remove equipment except cartridge belt no fire will be build or smoking permit unless specially authorize or no loud talking or other noise all patrolling to the front will be do as a rule from the support the support commander should locate the position of the adjacent support und make arrangement with the commander for the joint defense of the line of resistance at night all road and trail should be carefully cover and the country to the front and between adjacent outguard well patrol the line occupy by the outguard be call the line of observation outguard move to they position provide for they own protection and so we to conceal the movement from the enemy these position be intrench and be number from right to leave in each support the duty of the outguard be to observe the enemy to guard the outpost from surprise and to make a preliminary resistance to the enemy 's advance the strength of the outguard will vary accord to its object when a important road which at night will afford a line of advance or a bridge be to be cover or when several post be establish from a outguard it should be of considerable strength two squad or a platoon when mere observation and alarm be all that be require four man will suffice a squall be a good unit to use as a outguard this will allow one double sentry post of three relief and one man in addition to the commander who may be use for messenger service the outguard should be carefully conceal the utmost quiet should be observe and there should be no cooking or smoking the interval between outguard will depend upon the situation and the terrain the line of observation be not necessarily continuous but all avenue of approach must be carefully guard the distance of the outguard from the support likewise be govern by the terrain but in general may be say to be from 300 to 400 yard in thick country or at night outguard patrol along the line of observation between post communication between outguard and the support be by signal and messenger in special case by wire member of the outguard retain possession of they weapon and do not remove they equipment sentinel from the outguard be post so as to avoid observation but so that they may have a clear lookout and be able to see if possible by day the sentinel of the adjacent outguard double sentinel be always post near enough to each other to communicate easily in ordinary voice sentinel be generally on post two hour out of six for every sentinel and every patrol there should be three relief and outguard should be of a strength sufficient to allow this the position of a sentinel should be select with reference to observation it may be advantageous to place a sentinel in a tree sentinel furnish by cossack post or sentry squad be keep near they group those furnish by they picket may be keep as far sa 100 yard away relief visit patrol and inspect officer approach sentinel from the rear a sentinel on the line of observation should always have the follow instruction : the name of village stream and prominent feature in sight and where the road lead the number -lrb- if any -rrb- of he post and the number of he and of the adjoining outguard the position of the support the line of retreat to be follow if the outguard be compel to fall back the position of advance detachment and whether friendly patrol be operate in front to watch to the front and flank without intermission and devote special attention to unusual or suspicious occurrence if he see indication of the enemy to at once notify he immediate superior in case of imminent danger or when a attack be make to give the alarm by firing rapidly by day to pass in or out officer noncommissioned officer and detachment recognize as part of the outpost and officer know to have authority to do so to detain all other and notify the outguard commander at night when person approach he post to come to a ready halt they and notify the outguard commander the latter challenge ascertain they identity and act accordingly when individual fail to halt or otherwise disobey to fire upon they after a second warning or sooner if they attempt to attack or escape to require deserter to lay down they arm and remain until a patrol be send out to bring they in to order deserter pursue by the enemy to drop they arm and to give a alarm if they fail to obey they be fire upon to require bearer of flag of truce and they escort to halt and to face outward to permit they to hold no conversation and to see that they be then blindfold and dispose of in accordance with instruction from the support commander if they fall to obey to fire upon they at night to remain practically stationary move about for purpose of observation only not to sit or lie down unless authorize to do so in the daytime to make use of natural or artificial cover and assume such position as to give he the best field of view to inform pass patrol of what he have see to carry he weapon habitually load and lock and at will outpost patrol be divide into those which operate beyond the line and those whose duty lie principally within the line the former call reconnoitering patrol scout in the direction of the enemy the latter call visit patrol maintain communication between the part of the outpost and supervise the performance of duty on the line of observation reconnoissance should be continuous though scout and detachment of cavalry remain in contact with the enemy or at least push forward to a considerable distance more detailed reconnoissance by infantry patrol in the foreground must not be neglect reconnoitering patrol be compose of at least two man and a skillful leader who in important case would be a officer they obtain information ascertain the presence of the enemy or discover he approach all patrol when they cross the line of observation inform the nearest sentinel of the direction in which they be to advance on they return they similarly report what they have see of the enemy signal be agree upon so that they can be recognize when return any ground near the line of observation which might afford cover for troops or for scout or spy and the approach to which can not be observe by sentinel be search frequently by patrol definite information concern the enemy be report at once patrol fire only in self-defense or to give the alarm support on the flank of a outpost position patrol the country on the expose flank visit patrol and relief should not march in the open and thereby expose the position of sentinel during a march in the vicinity of the enemy when halt be make special measure for protection be take when the halt be for a short period less than half a hour the advance party and support remain at ease the point and flanker move to position from which they can obtain a good lookout and additional patrol may be send out from advance party and support where the halt be for a period exceed half a hour a march outpost should be form with a advance guard consist of a battalion 2 company in the reserve 2 in the support the latter have as advance party one-half a company a typical march outpost would be form as follow : the advance party would send one platoon four or five hundred yard to the right as outguard no 1 the remain platoon constitute outguard no 2 a platoon from the head of the support would be send a similar distance to the leave as outguard no 3 the balance of the support would constitute the support of the march outpost the reserve of the advance guard act as reserve on signal be give to resume the march the various unit would close in and as soon as the advance party have assemble the march would be take up section 8 rifle trench soldier should remember that only by act vigorously on the offensive can a army hope to gain the victory the defensive may delay or stop the enemy but it can never destroy he troops dig because they be force to halt they do not halt to dig trench will frequently be construct without be use and soldier must expect this as a feature of campaigning and accept cheerfully what at time may appear as unnecessary labor when intrench under fire cover be first secure in the lie position each man scoop out a depression for he body and throw the earth to the front in this position no excavation can be conveniently make for the leg but if time permit the original excavation be enlarged and deepen until it be possible to assume a sit position with the leg cross and the shoulder to the parapet in such a position a man present a smaller target to shrapnel bullet than in the lie trench and can fire more comfortably and with less exposure than in the kneel trench from the sit position the excavation may be continue until a standing trench be secure the accompany plate show some of the more common form of trench in profile figure 1 be the simplest form of stand trench figure 2 show the same trench deepen in rear so as to allow man to walk along in the rear -lrb- deeper -rrb- portion of the trench without expose they head above the parapet figure 3 show a cover and firing trench with a chamber in which man can find shelter when under heavy artillery fire when the excavate earth be easily remove figure 4 show a good profile the enemy 's infantry as well as he artillery will generally have great difficulty in see this type of trench the mound or bank of earth throw up for shelter in front of a trench be call the parapet it should be at least 30 inch thick on top and the front should slope gradually as show in the plate so that shell will tend to glance from it rather than penetrate and explode the top should be cover with sod grass or leave so as to hide the newly turn earth which could be easily see and aim at by the enemy there should be no rock loose stone or pebble on top which might be strike by the bullet splinter and fly thus add greatly to the number of dangerous projectile and often deflect bullet downward into the trench a stone wall be a very dangerous thing to be behind in a fight the portion of the ground in rear of the parapet and between the parapet and the trench not cover by the parapet be to rest the elbow on when firing the rifle be rest on top of the parapet to obtain head cover in a trench fill a gunny sack or other bag with sand or soil and place it on top of the parapet aim around the right-hand side of it or dig a small lateral trench in the parapet large enough to hold the rifle roof it over with board small log or brush and heap dirt on top aim through the small trench or result loophole figure 5 show the plan of a section of a rifle trench -lrb- 7 -rrb- between the portion occupy by each squad there be often place a mound of earth as high as the top of the parapet and project back into the trench this be call a traverse and protect the occupant of the trench from fire from a flank bullet from this direction hit a traverse instead of fly down into the trench and wound several man -lrb- footnote 7 : the traverse should be at least 6 foot wide instead of 3 foot as show in figure 5 -rrb- trench be seldom continuous but be make in section place at the most advantageous point as show in figure 6 a company or battalion may occupy a single section the firing trench have cover trench in rear of they where the support can rest undisturbed by the hostile fire until they be need in the firing trench to repel a serious assault or to take part in a counter attack passage consist of deep communicate trench facilitate passage from the cover trench to the firing trench when under fire these communicate trench be usually zigzag or traverse to prevent they be sweep by hostile fire when troops be likely to remain in trench for a considerable time drainage should be arrange for and latrine and dress station should be construct in trench water should be bring into the trench and hole excavate in the front wall of the trench for extra ammunition in digging trench man usually work in relief one relief digging while the other rest the proportion of shoveler to pick man be about 3 to 1 if a plow can be obtain to turn the sod it will greatly facilitate the initial work of digging -lrb- illustration : plate v -rrb- chapter vii march and camp section 1 breaking camp and preparation for a march the evening before the march when a command learn that it be to make a march on the follow day presumably start early in the morning certain detail should be attend to the evening before all man should fill they canteen as there will probably be no time for this in the morning the mess sergeant should find out whether lunch or the reserve ration will be carry on the march and should attend to these detail in the evening in order that the issue can be make promptly in the morning the commander of the guard should be give a memorandum as to what time to awaken the cook and where they tent be the member of the guard who do this should awaken they without noise so as not to disturb the rest of the remainder of the command the cook should be instruct as to what time breakfast be to be serve and what time to awaken the first sergeant the cook or cook 's police must cut and split all firewood for the morning before 9 p m there must be no chop talking or rattle of pan before reveille which will disturb the rest of the command this apply to every morning in camp the morning of the march cook arise when call by the guard and start the preparation of breakfast without noise the first sergeant be usually awaken by one of the cook about half a hour before reveille in order that he may complete he toilet and breakfast early and be able to devote all he time to supervise the detail of the morning 's work if the officer desire to be awaken before reveille they will notify the first sergeant accordingly at first call the man turn out perform they toilet strike they shelter tent -lrb- unless it have be direct to await the sound of the general for this -rrb- and make up they pack at the sound of assembly immediately after reveille each man must be in he proper place in rank this assembly be under arm the first sergeant start to call the roll or command report at the last note of assembly arm be stack before the company be dismiss breakfast be serve to the company immediately after roll call immediately after breakfast each man will wash he mess kit in the hot water provide for that purpose at the kitchen and will at once pack the mess kit in he haversack the cook will provide hot water for wash mess kit at the same time that breakfast be serve immediately after breakfast the company proceed to the work of break camp and packing in accordance with a prearranged system similar to the following : one squad assist the cook in pack the kitchen one squad strike and fold the officer ' tent and bring they to the kitchen one squad fill in the sink the sink should not be fill in earlier than be absolutely necessary one squad police the camp within the company police limit one squad be available for possible detail from regimental headquarters officer and first sergeant supervise the work a permanent assignment of squad to these duty lighten the labor and decrease the time necessary for break camp after the breaking of camp the entire company be use to police camp man should not start from camp thirsty but should drink all the water they want immediately after breakfast all canteen should be fill before march one man in each squad be detail to fill the canteen for he squad at assembly for the march the man fall in in rear or the stack fully equip for march section 2 march the principal work of troops in the field consist of march battle take place only at indefinite interval but march be of daily occurrence it be only by good march that troops can arrive at a give point at a give time and in good condition for battle the rate of march depend greatly upon the condition of the road and the weather but the average rate for infantry be about 2-1\/2 mile per hour this allow for a rest of 10 minute each hour the total distance march in a day depend not only on the rate of march but upon the size of the command large command often cover only about 10 mile a day while small command easily cover double that distance in order to make the march with the greatest comfort and the least danger it be necessary that each unit be keep well in hand each man be permit and encourage to make himself as comfortable as possible at all time except only that he must not interfere with the comfort of other or with the march of the column infantry generally march in column of squad but on narrow road or trail column of two or file be use the route step be habitually use when silence be not require in large command in order that the column be keep in hand it be very necessary that each man keep he place in rank and follow he file leader at the prescribe distance this be one of the best test for determine the discipline and efficiency of troops the equipment should be carefully adjust before start out and any part that be not comfortable should be rearrange at the first opportunity the rifle be carry at will except that the muzzle must be point up so as not to interfere with the other man under no circumstance will any man leave the rank without permission from he company or higher commander if the absence be to be for more than a short while he must be give a pass show he name rank and organization and the reason he be permit to be absent if sick it be better to wait by the roadside at some comfortable place for the arrival of the surgeon or the ambulance in any case the soldier keep he rifle and equipment with he if possible soldier absent from they organization without a pass will be arrest and return to they command for punishment march in hot weather be particularly try green leaf or a damp cloth carry in the hat lessen the chance of sunstroke the hat should have ventilator and when not expose to the direct ray of the sun it should be remove from the head it be well to keep the clothing about the neck and throat open and sometimes to turn up the shirt sleeve so as to leave the wrist free the canteen should always be fill before start out use the water very sparingly none at all should be drunk during the first three or four hour of the march after that take only a few mouthful at a time and wash out the mouth and throat except possibly in very hot weather one canteen of water should last for the entire day 's march excessive water drinking on the march will play a man out very quickly old soldier never drink when march a small pebble carry in the mouth keep it moist and therefore reduce thirst or a small piece of chocolate may occasionally be eat smoking be very depressing during a march canteen will not be refill on the march without authority from a officer as the clearest water whether from a well spring or run stream may be very impure and the source of many camp disease if canteen be to be refill it should be do by order and a detail be generally make for this purpose enter upon private property without permission or steal fruit etc from garden and orchard be a serious military offense as well as a violation of the civil law when a cook meal be carry it should not be eat until the proper time a command ordinarily march for 50 minute and halt for 10 minute the first halt in a day 's march be for about 15 minute be make after about 30 minute ' march and be for the express purpose of allow the man to relieve themselves man who wish to do this should attend to it at once and not wait until the command be almost ready to march again at every halt get all the rest possible and do not spend the time wander around or stand about only green recruit do this if the ground be dry stretch out at full length remove the pack or blanket roll and belt and get in as comfortable position as possible the next best way be to sit down with a good back rest against a tree or a fence or some other object never sit down or lie down however on wet or damp ground sit on you pack or blanket roll or on anything else that be dry at a halt it be very refreshing to adjust the underclothing section 3 make camp on reach the camp site the man should be allow to fall out and rest as soon as the arm have be stack and the shelter tent pitch if the blanket roll have be carry on the wagon then the location of the front pole of the shelter tent should be mark before they be allow to fall out the man will not be allow to relieve themselves until sink be dig temporary sink may be dig with intrenching tool if carry a guard should be place over the water supply at once as soon as the shelter tent be pitch the company proceed to the remainder of the camp work in accordance with a permanent assignment similar to the following : one squad help arrange the kitchen one squad pitch the officer ' tent one squad dig the sink one squad procure wood and water one squad be hold available for detail from regimental headquarters the officer and first sergeant supervise the work the sink be locate by the commanding officer the detail to dig they should wait until inform of the location a officer should inspect the sink as soon as the detail report it as complete after the camp have be put in order the first sergeant make the detail from roster for kitchen police and noncommissioned officer in charge of quarter for the next day and for such guard as may be order for that day the detail call for by regimental headquarters for pitch the headquarters camp for the quartermaster etc should be report to the adjutant without delay the cook pitch they tent at that end of the company street nearest the kitchen space must be leave for this tent if the cook be not in rank when the company pitch tent unless lunch have be carry or cook during the march the cook should get to work on a hot meal as soon as possible the kitchen police report at the kitchen as soon as they tent be pitch wood and water will be require at once officer should avoid keep the man unnecessarily under arm or on they foot after a hard day 's march when the detail of make camp have be complete all man should at once care for they rifle and foot -lrb- for detail as to the care of the rifle see chapter ii section 1 for the care of the foot see chapter iv -rrb- section 4 camp service and duty in camp reveille be precede by first call and a march play by the band or field music and be follow immediately by assembly if there be a reveille gun it be fire at the first note of the march and be the signal for all to arise the roll be call at the last note of assembly after reveille at this formation man should fall in in the proper uniform -- rifle and belt service hat olive-drab flannel shirt service breeches leggings and shoe the regimental commander may prescribe that coat be to be worn and will prescribe the exact uniform for all drill parade and other formation as well as for man go on pass immediately after reveille roll call the sergeant next in rank to the first sergeant take command of the company and deploy it for a general police of the camp within the limit assign to the company man pick up all scrap of paper and rubbish of all kind deposit it in the company incinerator or place designate for the purpose the police limit of each company be usually designate as extend from head to rear of camp within the space occupy by the company street include the ground occupy by the tent of the company no unassigned space be leave between company immediately after breakfast man police they tent and raise wall of same if the day be fair all bedding should be spread on the tent for several hour ' airing at sick call all man who be sick fall in and be march to the regimental infirmary under charge of the noncommissioned officer in charge of quarter the noncommissioned officer take with he the company sick report previously fill in and sign by the company commander the surgeon examine all those report and indicate they status on the sick report this status may be duty -lrb- available for all duty -rrb- quarter -lrb- patient to remain in tent or company street -rrb- and hospital -lrb- patient to be send to the hospital -rrb- the noncommissioned officer then return to the company with all the man not marked hospital and hand the sick report to the first sergeant at drill call the company prepare for drill and fall in so that it will be completely form at assembly which be usually sound 10 minute after drill call all man be require to attend drill except those excuse by sick report and those specially excuse from headquarters the excuse list should include in each company only the mess sergeant the two cook one kitchen police and man on regimental guard during drill hour the guard to be excuse should be limit to a small patrol to guard against fire and thief in camp if the bedding have be air it should be take in immediately after drill and place in the tent neatly fold some time during the morning at a time designate by he the company commander inspect the entire company camp at this inspection the entire street should be police kitchen in order and tent police as follow : in permanent camp when pyramidal conical or wall tent be use : bedding fold neatly and place on the head of the cot -lrb- if bed sack be use they will be fold in three fold and the bedding place on top -rrb- hat on top of the bedding shoe under foot of cot surplus kit bag at side of squad leader 's cot equipment suspend neatly from a frame arrange around the tent pole rifle in rack construct around the tent pole in shelter-tent camp : bedding neatly fold and place at rear of tent poncho underneath equipment arrange on the bedding rifle lay on bedding except when use as tent pole the regimental commander prescribe the exact scheme to be follow in the police of tent should there be no parade retreat roll call be hold at the same hour this roll call be under arm and be supervise by a officer of the company after the roll call and at the sound of retreat the officer bring the company to parade rest and keep it in this position during the sound of this call at the first note of the national anthem -lrb- the star-spangled banner -rrb- or to the color the company be bring to attention and so stand until the end of the play the officer then report the result of the roll call to the adjutant or officer of the day return to the company inspect the arm and dismiss it at the sound of call to quarter all man

at reveille it be they duty to assist the cook in the kitchen they assist in the preparation of meal wait on the table wash dish procure water and wood chop firewood and keep the kitchen mess tent and surround ground police they be under the order of the mess sergeant and the cook rifle need careful attention in camp they should be clean and oil daily preferably just before retreat or parade it be advisable for each man to have a canvas cover to keep off the dust and dampness in a shelter-tent camp tie the rifle muzzle up to the pole of the tent place a chip of wood under the butt plate and a oily rag over -lrb- never inside -rrb- the muzzle wet shoe should be fill with oats or dry sand and set in a cool place to dry never dry they by a fire uniform need special care as camp service be very hard on they in a permanent camp every man should have two pair of breeches the coat will seldom be worn except at parade or retreat one pair of breeches and the coat should be keep neat clean and press for use on ceremony inspection and when go on pass woolen uniform may be clean and free from spot by rub with a flannel rag saturate with gasoline cotton uniform may be wash with water soap and a scrub brush wring out and stretch properly crease on a flat wood surface in the sun to dry leggings can be similarly wash hat should be clean with gasoline and dampen and iron to restore they shape enlist man should be very careful to observe all the sanitary regulation of the camp fly be the greatest spreader of camp disease all fecal matter and food should be carefully guard from they in camp extreme precaution be take to screen the sink and kitchen from fly and all enlist man should cooperate in the effort to make these precaution successful one fly carry germ on he foot from the sink to the food can start a serious and fatal epidemic in a camp defecate on the ground in the vicinity of camp or urinating in camp be extremely dangerous to the health of the command and be serious military offens at night a urinal can be provide in each company street in a permanent camp cot or bed sack be usually provide for the man to sleep on in a shelter tent camp bed should be make of hay grass leave pine or spruce bough or pine needle on top of which the poncho and blanket be spread thus soften the ground and keep the sleeper away from the cold and dampness neglect to prepare the bed when sleep without cot or bed sack mean a loss of sleep and may lead to cold bowel disorder and rheumatism in wet weather tent should be ditch and in windy or cold weather dirt may be bank around they a place for wash the person and clothes should be arrange for in each company street and the waste water disposed of by means of drainage or rock-filled pit in dry weather the street in camp should frequently be sprinkle with water to keep down the dust this be specially necessary around the kitchen chapter viii target practice section 1 preliminary training in marksmanship effective rifle fire be generally what count most in battle to have effective rifle fire the man on the firing line must be able to hit what they be order to shoot at there be no man who can not be teach how to shoot it be not necessary or even desirable to begin instruction by firing on a rifle range a perfectly green recruit who have never fire a rifle may be make into a good shot by a little instruction and some preliminary drill and exercise before a man go on the range to fire it be absolutely necessary that he should know -- 1 how to set the rear sight 2 how to sight or aim 3 how to squeeze the trigger 4 how to hold the rifle in all position if he do not know these thing it be worse than useless for he to fire he will not improve the more he shoot the worse he will shoot and it will become more difficult to teach he section 2 sight adjustment man must be able to adjust they sight correctly and quickly a error in adjustment so small that one can scarcely see it on the sight leaf be sufficient to cause a miss at a enemy at 500 yard and over notice you rear sight when the leaf be lay down the battle sight appear on top this sight be set for 547 yard and be not adjustable when the leaf be raise four sight come into view the extreme range sight for 2850 yard at the top of the leaf be seldom use the open sight at the upper edge of the drift slide be adjustable from 1400 to 2750 yard to set it the upper edge of the slide be make to correspond with the range reading on the leaf and the slide be then clamp with the slide screw this sight also be seldom use the open sight at the bottom of the triangular opening in the drift slide be adjustable from 100 to 2450 yard to set it the index line at the lower corner of the triangle be set opposite the range graduation on the leaf and the slide clamp this and the peep sight just below it be the sight most commonly use to set the peep sight the index line on either side of the peephole be set opposite the range desire and the slide clamp notice the scale for the various range on either side of the face of the leaf the odd-numbered hundred of yard be on the right and the even on the leave the line below the number be the index line for that range thus to set the sight for 500 yard the index line of the slide be bring in exact line with the line on the leaf below the figure 5 and the slide clamp to set for 550 yard the index line of the slide be set half way between the index line on the leaf below the figure 5 on the right side and the figure 6 on the left side look at you sight carefully when set it and take great pain to get it exact a error in set the width of one of the line on the leaf will cause a error of about 8 inch in where you bullet will strike at 500 yard the wind gauge be adjust by means of the windage screw at the right front end of the base of the sight each graduation on the wind-gauge scale be call a point for convenience in adjust the line of each third point on the scale be longer than the other if you turn the windage screw so that the movable base move to the right you be take right windage which will cause you rifle to shoot more to the right it be seldom that a rifle will shoot correctly to the point aim at at a give range with the sight adjust exactly to the scale graduation for that range if you sight be not correctly adjust for you shooting and you wish to move it slightly to make it correct remember to move it in the direction you wish you shot to hit if you wish to shoot higher raise you sight if to the right move the wind gauge to the right always move you sight the correct amount in accordance with the follow table : section 3 table of sight correction _ showing_to_what_extent_the_point_of_impact_is_moved_by_a_change _ _ of_25_yards_in_elevation_or_1_point_in_windage _ correction correction by a change by a change range in elevation in windage of 25 yard of 1 point -------- -------------- ------------- _ yard _ _ inch _ _ inch _ 100 072 4 200 162 8 300 279 12 400 429 16 500 622 20 600 859 24 800 1543 32 1000 2508 40 a easy rule to remember the windage correction by be : a change of 1 point of wind change the point of impact 4 inch for every 100 yard of range copy this table and take it to the range with you example of sight adjustment : suppose you be firing at 500 yard the first two or three shot show you that you shot be hit about a foot below and a foot to the right of the center of the bull 's - eye from the above table you will see that if you will raise you sight 50 yard and move the wind gauge half a point to the leave the rifle will be sight so that if you aim correctly the bullet will hit well inside the bull 's eye section 4 aim open sight : always align you sight with the front sight squarely in the middle of the u or notch of the rear sight and the top of the front sight even with the upper corner of the u -lrb- see fig 1 -rrb- all the sight on the rifle except the peep sight be open sight peep sight : always center the tip of the front sight in the center of the peephole when aim with this sight -lrb- see fig 2 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : figure 1 -rrb- always aim below the bull 's - eye never let you front sight appear to touch the bull 's - eye in aim try to see the same amount of white target between the top of the front sight and the bottom of the bull 's - eye each time the eye must be focus on the bull 's - eye or mark and not on the front or rear sight look at figure 1 and 2 until you eye retain the memory of they then try to duplicate the picture every time you aim aim consistently always the same never change you aim change you sight adjustment if you shot be not hit in the right place section 5 battle sight the battle sight be the open sight see when the leaf be lay flat it be adjust for a range of 547 yard it be intend to be use in battle when you get nearer to the enemy than 600 yard always aim at the belt of a standing enemy or just below he if he be kneel sit or lie on the target range this sight be use for rapid fire with it the rifle shoot about 2 foot high at range between 200 and 400 yard so you must aim below the figure on the target d find out in four instruction practice just how much you must aim below to hit the figure section 6 trigger squeeze use the first joint of the fore finger to squeeze the trigger it be the most sensitive and best control portion of the body as you place the rifle to you shoulder squeeze the trigger so as to pull it back about one-eighth of a inch thus take up the safety portion or slack of the pull then contract the trigger finger gradually slowly and steadily increase the pressure on the trigger while the aim be be perfect continue the gradual increase of pressure so that when the aim have become exact the additional pressure require to release the point of the sear can be give almost insensibly and without cause any deflection of the rifle put absolutely all you mind and will power into hold the rifle steady and squeeze the trigger off without disturb the aim practice squeeze the trigger in this way every time you have you rifle in you hand until you can surely and quickly do it without a suspicion of a jerk -lrb- illustration : figure 2 -rrb- by practice the soldier become familiar with the trigger squeeze of he rifle and know this he be able to judge at any time within limit what additional pressure be require for its discharge by constant repetition of this exercise he should be able finally to squeeze the trigger to a certain point beyond which the slightest movement will release the sear have squeeze the trigger to this point the aim be correct and when true the additional pressure be apply and the discharge follow and the bullet fly true to the mark section 7 firing position when in rank at close order the position be those describe in the infantry drill regulation when in extend order or when firing alone these position may be modify somewhat to better suit the individual the follow remark on the various position be offer as suggestion whereby steady position may be learn by the soldier standing position : face the target then execute right half face plant the foot about 12 inch apart as you raise the ride to the shoulder lean very slightly backward just enough to preserve the perfect balance on both foot which the raising of the rifle have somewhat disturb do not lean far back and do not lean forward at all if you body be out of balance it will be under strain and you will tremble the right elbow should be at about the height of the shoulder the left hand should grasp well around the stock and handguard in front of the rear sight and the left elbow should be almost directly under the rifle the right hand should do more than half the work of hold the rifle up and against the shoulder the left hand only steadying and guide the piece do not try to meet the recoil let the whole body move back with it do not be afraid to press the jaw hard against the stock this steady the position and the head go back with the recoil and insure that you face be not hurt kneel position : assume the position very much as describe in the infantry drill regulation sit on the right heel the right knee should point directly to the right that be along the firing line the point of the left elbow should rest over the left knee there be a flat place under the elbow which fit a flat place on the knee and make a solid rest lean the body well forward this position be uncomfortable until practice when it quickly cease to be uncomfortable sit position : sit down half face to the right foot from 6 to 8 inch apart knee bent right knee slightly higher than the left left leg point toward the target rest both elbow on the knee hand grasp the piece the same as in the prone position this be a very steady position particularly if hole can be find or make in the ground for the heel prone position and use of the gun sling : to adjust the sling for firing unhook the straight strap of the sling and let it out as far as it will go adjust the loop so that when stretch along the bottom of the stock its rear end -lrb- bight -rrb- come about opposite the comb of the stock a small man need a longer loop than a tall man lie down face at a angle of about 60 ° to the right of the direction of the target spread the leg as wide apart as they will go with comfort thrust the left arm through between the rifle and the sling and then back through the loop of the sling secure the loop by means of the keeper around the upper left arm as high up as it will go pass the hand under and then over the sling from the left side and grasp the stock and handguard just in rear of the lower band raise the right elbow off the ground roll slightly over on the left side place the butt to the shoulder and roll back into position clamp the rifle hard and steady in the firing position the rifle should rest deep down in the palm of the left hand with finger almost around the handguard shift the left palm a little to the right or leave until the rifle stand perfectly upright -lrb- no cant -rrb- without effort the left elbow should rest on the ground directly under the rifle and right elbow on the ground about 5 inch to the right of a point directly under the stock in this position the loop of the sling start at the lower band pass to the right of the left wrist and thence around the left upper arm the loop should be so tight that about 50 pound tension be place on it when the position be assume this position be uncomfortable until practice when it quickly cease to be uncomfortable it will be steadier if small hole can be find or dig in the ground for the elbow in this position the sling bind the left forearm to the rifle and to the ground so that it form a dead rest for the rifle with a universal joint the wrist at its upper end also the rifle be so bind to the shoulder that the recoil be not feel at all this be the steadiest of all firing position the gun sling can also be use in this manner with advantage in the other position section 8 call the shot it be evident that the sight should be so adjust at each range that the rifle will hit where you aim in order to determine that the sight be so adjust it be necessary that you shall know each time just where you be aim on the target at the instant you rifle be discharge if you know this and you rifle hit this point you rifle be correctly sight if you shot do not hit near this point you should change you sight adjustment in accordance with the table of sight correction in section 3 no man can hold absolutely steady the rifle tremble slightly and the sight seem to wobble and move over the target you try to squeeze off the last ounce of the trigger squeeze just as the sight move to the desire alignment under the bull 's - eye at this instant just before the recoil blot out a view of the sight and target you should catch with you eye a picture as it be of just where on the target you sight be align and call to yourself or to the coach this point this point be where you shot should strike if you sight be correctly adjust and if you have squeeze the trigger without disturbing you aim until a man can call he shot he be not a good shot for he can never tell if he rifle be sight right or not or if a certain shot be a good one or only the result of luck section 9 coordination good marksmanship consist in learn thoroughly the detail of -- hold the rifle in the various position aim squeeze the trigger call the shot adjust the sight and when these have be master in detail then the coordination of they in the act of firing this coordination consist in put absolutely all of one 's will power into a effort to hold the rifle steadily especially in get it to steady down when the aim be perfect in get the trigger squeeze off easily at the instant the rifle be steadiest and the aim perfect in call the shot at this instant and if the shot do not hit near the point call then in adjust the sight the correct amount so that the rifle will be sight to hit where you aim section 10 advice to rifleman before go to the range clean the rifle carefully remove every trace of oil from the bear this can best be do with a rag saturate with gasoline put a light coat of oil on the bolt and cam blacken the front and rear sight with smoke from a burning candle or camphor or with liquid sight black look through the bear and see that there be no obstruction in it keep the rifle off the ground the stock may absorb dampness the sight may be injure or the muzzle fill with dirt watch you hold carefully and be sure to know where the line of sight be at discharge it be only in this way that the habit of call shot which be essential to good shooting can be acquire study the condition adjust the sling and set the sight before go to the firing point look at the sight adjustment before each shot and see that it have not change if sure of you hold and if the hit be not as call determine and make full correction in elevation and windage to put the next shot in the bull 's - eye keep a write record of the weather condition and the corresponding elevation and windage for each day 's firing less elevation will generally be require on hot day on wet day in a bright sunlight with a 6 o'clock wind or with a cold barrel more elevation will generally be require on cold day on very dry day with a 12 o'clock wind with a hot barrel in a dull or cloudy light the upper band should not be tight enough to bind the barrel do not put a cartridge into the chamber until ready to fire do not place cartridge in the sun they will get hot and shoot high do not rub the eye -- especially the sighting eye in cold weather warm the trigger hand before shooting after shoot clean the rifle carefully and then oil it to prevent rust have a strong clean cloth that will not tear and jam properly cut to size for use in cleaning always clean the rifle from the breech use a brass cleaning rod when available a injury to the rifle at the muzzle cause the piece to shoot very irregularly regular physical exercise take systematically will cause a marked improvement in shooting frequent practice of the position and aim drill be of the greatest help in prepare for shooting on the range rapid firing : success be rapid firing depend upon catch a quick and accurate aim hold the piece firmly and evenly and in squeeze the trigger without a jerk in order to give as much time as possible for aim accurately the soldier must practice take position load with the clip and work the bolt so that no time will be lose in these operation with constant practice all these movement may be make quickly and without false motion when the bolt handle be raise it must be do with enough force to start the shell from the chamber and when the bolt be pull back it must be with sufficient force to throw the empty shell well away from the chamber and far enough to engage the next cartridge in load use force enough to load each cartridge with one motion the aim must be catch quickly and once catch must be hold and the trigger squeeze steadily rapid firing as far as hold aim and squeeze the trigger be concern should be do with all the precision of slow fire the gain in time should be in get ready to fire loading and work the bolt firing with rest : in order that the shooting may be uniform the piece should always be rest at the same point section 11 the course in small-arm firing the course in small-arm firing consist of -- -lrb- a

remark -- the right arm may be slightly bent although the difficulty of hold the pistol uniformly and of keep it as well as the forearm in the same vertical plane make this objectionable 137 the grip -- grasp the stock as high as possible with the thumb and last three finger the forefinger alongside the trigger guard the thumb extend along the stock the barrel hand and forearm should be as nearly in one line as possible when the weapon be pointed toward the target the grasp should not be so tight as to cause tremor of the hand or arm to be communicate to the weapon but should be firm enough to avoid lose the grip when the recoil take place remark -- the force of recoil of the pistol or revolver be exert in a line above the hand which grasp the stock the lower the stock be grasp the greater will be the movement or jump of the muzzle cause by the recoil this not only result in a severe strain upon the wrist but in loss of accuracy if the hand be place so that the grasp be on one side of the stock the recoil will cause a rotary movement of the weapon toward the opposite side the release of the sear cause a slight movement of the muzzle generally to the leave the position of the thumb along the stock overcome much of this movement the soldier should be encourage to practice this method of hold until it become natural to do uniform shoot the weapon must be hold with exactly the same grip for each shot not only must the hand grasp the stock at the same point for each shot but the tension of the grip must be uniform 138 -lrb- a -rrb- the trigger squeeze -- the trigger must be squeeze in the same manner as in rifle dring -lrb- see chapter viii section 6 -rrb- the pressure of the forefinger on the trigger should be steadily increase and should be straight back not sideways the pressure should continue to that point beyond which the slightest movement will release the sear then when the aim be true the additional pressure be apply and the pistol fire only by much practice can the soldier become familiar with the trigger squeeze this be essential to accurate shooting it be the most important detail to master in pistol or revolver shooting -lrb- b -rrb- self-cocking action -- the force require to squeeze the trigger of the revolver when the self-cocking device be use be considerably greater than with the single action to accustom a soldier to the use of the self-cocking mechanism and also to strengthen and develop the muscle of the hand a few minute practice daily in hold the unloaded revolver on a mark and snap it use the self-cocking mechanism be recommend the use of the self-cocking device in firing be not recommend except in emergency by practice in cock the revolver the soldier can become sufficiently expert to fire very rapidly use single action while he accuracy will be greater than when use double action 139 aim -- except when deliver rapid or quick fire the rear and front sight of the pistol be use in the same manner as the rifle sight the normal sight be habitually use -lrb- see pl vi -rrb- and the line of sight be direct upon a point just under the bull 's - eye at 6 o'clock the front sight must be see through the middle of the rear-sight notch the top be on a line with the top of the notch care must be take not to cant the pistol to either side -lrb- 12 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : the instructor should take cognizance of the fact that the proper aim point be often affect by the personal and fixed peculiarity of the firer and if unable to correct such abnormality permit firer to direct sight at such point as promise effective result -rrb- if the principle of aim have not be teach the soldier 's instruction will begin with sighting drill as prescribe for the rifle so far as they may be applicable the sighting bar with open sight will be use to teach the normal sight and to demonstrate error likely to be commit to construct a sighting rest for the pistol -lrb- see pl vi -rrb- take a piece of wood about 10 inch long 1-1\/4 inch wide and 9\/16 inch thick shape one end so that it will fit snugly in the handle of the pistol when the magazine have be remove screw or nail this stick to the top of a post or other object at such a angle that the pistol when place on the stick will be approximately horizontal a suitable sighting rest for the revolver may be easily improvise -lrb- illustration : plate vi -rrb- 140 -lrb- a -rrb- how to cock the pistol -- the pistol should be cock by the thumb of the right hand and with the least possible derangement of the grip the forefinger should be clear of the trigger when cock the pistol some man have difficulty at first in cock the pistol with the right thumb this can be overcome by a little practice jerk the pistol forward while hold the thumb on the hammer will not be permit -lrb- b -rrb- how to cock the revolver -- the revolver should be cock by put the thumb on the hammer at as nearly a right angle to the hammer as possible and by the action of the thumb muscle alone bring the hammer back to the position of full cock some man with large hand be able to cock the revolver with the thumb while hold it in the position of aim or raise pistol where the soldier 's hand be small this can not be do and in this case it assist the operation to give the revolver a slight tilt to the right and upward -lrb- to the right -rrb- particular care should be take that the forefinger be clear of the trigger or the cylinder will not revolve jerk the revolver forward while hold the thumb on the hammer will not be permit 141 position and aim drill dismount -- for this instruction the squad will be form with a interval of 1 pace between file black paster to simulate bull 's - eye will be paste opposite each man on the barrack or other wall from which the squad be 10 pace distant the squad be form as describe above the instructor give the command : 1 _ raise _ 2 _ pistol _ -lrb- par 156 cavalry drill regulation -rrb- and caution position and aim drill dismount the man take the position describe in paragraph 136 except that the pistol be hold at raise pistol the instructor caution trigger squeeze exercise at the command ready cock the weapon as describe in paragraph 140 at the command 1 _ squad _ 2 fire slowly extend the arm till it be nearly horizontal the pistol direct at a point about 6 inch below the bull 's - eye at the same time put the forefinger inside the trigger guard and gradually feel the trigger inhale enough air to comfortably fill the lung and gradually raise the piece until the line of sight be direct at the point of aim i e just below the bull 's - eye at 6 o'clock while the sight be direct upon the mark gradually increase the pressure on the trigger until it reach that point where the slightest additional pressure will release the sear then when the aim be true the additional pressure necessary to fire the piece be give so smoothly as not to derange the alignment of the sight the weapon will be hold on the mark for a instant after the hammer fall and the soldier will observe what effect if any the squeeze of the trigger have have on he aim it be impossible to hold the arm perfectly still but each time the line of sight be direct on the point of aim a slight additional pressure be apply to the trigger until the piece be finally discharge at one of the moment when the sight be correctly align upon the mark when the soldier have become proficient in take the proper position the trigger squeeze should be execute at will the instructor preface the preparatory command by at will and give the command halt at the conclusion of the exercise when the soldier will return to the position of raise pistol at first this exercise should be execute with deliberation but gradually the soldier will be teach to catch the aim quickly and to lose no time in begin the trigger squeeze and bring it to the point where the slightest additional pressure will release the sear remark -- in service few opportunity will be offer for slow aim fire with the pistol or revolver although use will be make of the weapon under circumstance when accurate point and rapid manipulation be of vital importance in deliver a rapid fire the soldier must keep he eye fix upon the mark and after each shot begin a steadily increase pressure on the trigger try at the same time to get the sight as nearly on the mark as possible before the hammer again fall the great difficulty in quick firing with the pistol lie in the fact that when the front sight be bring upon the mark the rear sight be often find to be outside the line join the eye with the mark this tendency to hold the pistol obliquely can be overcome only by a uniform manner of hold and point this uniformity be to be attain only by acquire a grip which can be take with certainty each time the weapon be fire it be this circumstance which make the position and aim drill so important the soldier should constantly practice point the pistol until he acquire the ability to direct it on the mark in the briefest interval of time and practically without the aid of sight the soldier then repeat the exercise with the pistol in the left hand the left side be turn toward the target 142 to draw and fire quickly -- snap shooting -- with the squad form as describe in paragraph 141 except that the pistol be in the holster and the flap if any button the instructor caution quick-fire exercise and give the command 1 squad 2 fire at this command each soldier keep he eye on the target quickly draw he pistol cock it as in paragraph 140 thrust it toward the target squeeze the trigger and at the instant the weapon be bring in line with the eye and the objective increase the pressure release the sear to enable the soldier to note error in point the weapon will be momentarily hold in position after the fall of the hammer effort at deliberate aim in this exercise must be discourage remark under paragraph 141 be specially applicable also to this type of fire when the soldier have become proficient in the detail of this exercise it should be repeat at will the instructor caution at will quick fire exercise the exercise should be practice until the mind the eye and trigger finger act in unison to simulate this type of fire mount the instructor place the squad so that the simulated bull 's - eye be in turn to the right to the leave to the right front to the left front to the right rear with the squad in one of these position the instructor caution position and aim drill mount at this caution the right foot be carry 20 inch to the right and the left hand to the position of the bridle hand -lrb- par 246 cavalry drill regulation -rrb- the exercise be carry out as describe for the exercise dismount use the command and mean lay down in paragraph 161 to 168 inclusive cavalry drill regulation for firing in the several direction the exercise be to be execute at will when the squad have be sufficiently well instruct in detail when firing to the leave the pistol hand will be about opposite the left shoulder and the shoulder turn about 45 ° to the leave when firing to the right rear the shoulder be turn about 45 ° to the right when the soldier be proficient in these exercise with the pistol in the right hand they be repeat with the pistol in the left hand revolver or pistol range practice -- the course in range practice be give in paragraph 147 to 199 small arm firing manual 1913 chapter ix extract from manual of interior guard duty unite state army 1914 -lrb- the number refer to paragraph in the manual -rrb- section 1 introduction 1 guard may be divide into four class : exterior guard interior guard military police and provost guard 2 exterior guard be use only in time of war they belong to the domain of tactic and be treat of in the field service regulation and in the drill regulation of the different arm of the service the purpose of exterior guard be to prevent surprise to delay attack and otherwise to

bring to a order by its commander the commander of the new guard then direct the orderly or orderly to fall out and report and cause bayonet to be fix if so order by the commanding officer bayonet will not then be unfixed during the tour except in route march while the guard be actually march or when specially direct by the commanding officer the commander of the new guard then fall out member of the guard for detach post place they under charge of the proper noncommissioned officer divide the guard into three relief first second and third from right to left and direct a list of the guard to be make by relief when the guard consist of troops of different arm combine the man be assign to relief so as to insure a fair division of duty under rule prescribe by the commanding officer 365 the sentinel and detachment of the old guard be at once relieve by member of the new guard the two guard stand at ease or at rest while these change be be make the commander of the old transmit to the commander of the new guard all he order instruction and information concern the guard and its duty the commander of the new guard then take possession of the guardhouse and verify the article in charge of the guard 366 if considerable time be require to bring in that portion of the old guard still on post the commanding officer may direct that as soon as the order and property be turn over to the new guard the portion of the old guard at the guardhouse may be march off and dismiss in such a case the remain detachment or detachment of the old guard will be inspect by the commander of the new guard when they reach the guardhouse he will direct the senior noncommissioned officer present to march these detachment off and dismiss they in the prescribed manner 367 in bad weather at night after long march or when the guard be very small the field music may be dispense with chapter x map reading and sketch section 1 military map reading when you pick up a map the first question be where be the north this can usually be tell by a arrow -lrb- see fig 1 section 1 -rrb- which will be find in one of the corner of the map and which point to the true north -- the north of the north star on some map no arrow be to be find the chance be a hundred to one that the north be at the top of the map as it be on almost all print map but you can only assure yourself of that fact by check the map with the ground it represent for instance if you ascertain that the city of philadelphium be due east of the city of columbus then the philadelphia-columbus line on the map be a due east-and-west line and establish at once all the other map direction now the map represent the ground as nearly as it can be represent on a flat piece of paper if you be stand up face the north you right hand will be in the east you leave in the west and you back to the south it be the same with a map if you look across it in the direction of the arrow -- that be toward its north -- you right hand will be toward what be east on the map you left hand to the west the south will be at the bottom of the map there be another kind of a arrow that sometimes appear on a map it be like the one in figure 2 section 1 and point not to the true north but to the magnetic north which be the north of the compass though the compass needle and therefore the arrow that represent it on the map do not point exactly north the deviation be from a military point of view slight and appreciable error will rarely result through the use of the magnetic instead of the true north in the solution of any military problem -lrb- illustration : fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 -rrb- should you be curious to know the exact deviation consult you local surveyor or any civil engineer both arrow may appear on you map in that case disregard the magnetic arrow unless you be use the map in connection with a compass if a map be be use on the ground the first thing to be do be to put the line of the map parallel to the real outline of the ground form and road fence railroad etc that the map show for the making of a map be no more than the drawing on paper of line parallel to and proportional in length to real direction and distance on the ground for instance the road between two place run due north and south then on the map a line represent the road will be parallel to the arrow show the north and will be proportional in length to the real road in this way a map be a picture or better a bare outline sketch and as we can make out a picture though it be upside down or crooked on the wall so we call use a map that be upside down or not parallel to the real ground form but it be easier to make out both the picture and the map if they line be parallel to what they represent so in use a map on the ground we always put the line parallel to the actual feature they show this be easy if the map have a arrow if the map have no arrow you must locate object or feature on the ground and on the map they representation draw on the map a line connect any two of the feature place this line parallel to all imaginary line through the two actual feature located and you map will be correctly place look to it that you do not reverse on the map the position of the two object or feature or you map will be exactly upside down when the map have be turn into the proper position -- that be to say orient -- the next thing be to locate on the map you position if you be in the village of easton and there be a place on the map label easton the answer be apparent but if you be out in the country at a unlabeled point that look like any one of a dozen other similar point the task be more complicate in this latter case you must locate and identify both on the map and on the ground other point -- hill village peculiar bend in river forest -- any ground feature that have some easily recognizable peculiarity and that you can see from you position suppose for instance you be near leavenworth and want to locate you exact position of which you be uncertain you have the map show in this manual and look about you see southwest from where you stand the united state penitentiary also halfway between the south and the southeast -- south-southeast a sailor would say -- the reservoir -lrb- rectangle west of o in missourus -rrb- have orient you map draw on it a line from the map position of the reservoir toward its actual position on the ground similarly draw a line from the map position of penitentiary toward its actual position prolong the two line until they intersect the intersection of the line will mark the place where you stand -- south merritt hill this method consist merely in draw on the map line that represent the line of sight to know and visible place the line pass through the map position of the place you see and be parallel to the actual line of sight therefore they be the map representation of the line of sight and they intersection be the map position of the eye of the observer after this orientation and location of position one can deduce from the map everything there be to know in regard to direction in this respect study of the ground itself will show no more than will study of the map after what direction come how far to answer this one must understand that the map distance between any two point show bear a fixed and definite relation or proportion to the real distance between the two point for instance : we measure on a map and find the distance between two point to be 1 inch then we measure the real distance on the ground and find it to be 10000 inch hence the relation between the map distance and the real distance be 1 to 10000 or 1\/10000 now if the map be properly draw the same relation will hold good for all distance and we can obtain any ground distance by multiply by 10000 the corresponding map distance this relation need not be 1\/10000 but may be anything from 1\/100 that a architect might use in make a map or plan of a house up to one over a billion and a half which be about the proportion between map and real distance in a pocket-atlas representation of the whole world on a 6-inch page map maker call this relation the scale of the map and put it down in a corner in one of three way first 1 inch equal 100 second 1\/100 third as show in figure 3 -lrb- section 1 -rrb- these expression mean one and the same thing a variation of the first method on a map of different scale might be : 1 inch equal 1 mile since a mile contain 63360 inch then the real distance between any two point show on the map be 63360 time the map distance to find the ground distance by the third kind of scale copy it on the edge of a slip of paper apply the slip directly to the map and read off the distance and so we answer the question how far after direction and distance come the interpretation of the sign symbol and abbreviation on the map those authorize be give in section 2 -lrb- a reprint of appendix 4 field service regulation 1914 -rrb- but there be a good many other conventional sign in common use a key to they be publish by the war department and be call conventional sign unite state army from these you read at once the natural and artificial feature of the country show on you map it should be bear in mind that these conventional sign be not necessarily draw to scale as be the distance they show the position and outline of the feature rather than the size this for the reason that many of the feature show if draw to scale would be so small that one could not make they out except with a magnifying glass if the exact dimension be of any importance they will be write in figure on the map for instance bridge in addition to te above conventional sign we have contour to show the elevation depression slope and shape of the ground abroad hachure be much use but they serve only to indicate elevation and as compare to contour be of little value contour resemble the line show in figure 4 -lrb- section 1 -rrb- hachure be show in figure 5 -lrb- section 1 -rrb- and may be find on any european map they simply show slope and when carefully draw show steeper slope by heavier shading and gentler slope by the fainter hachure the crest of the mountain be within the hachure -lrb- see fig 5 section 1 -rrb- _ contour _ -- a certain student when ask by he instructor to define space say : i have it sir in my head but can not put it into word the instructor reply : i suppose that under those circumstance mr -- the definition really would not help much and so it be with contour -- the definition do not help much if you know a contour when you meet it on a map for example of contour turn to the map in section 2 and start at the united state penitentiary note the smooth flow irregular curved line marked 880 860 840 840 860 etc the only other line on the map that at all resemble contour be stream line like corral creek but the stream line be readily distinguish from contour by the fact that they cross the contour squarely while the contour run approximately parallel to each other note the stream line just to the west of south merritt hill the contour represent line on the ground that be horizontal and whose meanderings follow the surface just as the edge of a flood would follow the irregularity of the hill about it those line that contour stand for be just as level as the water 's edge of a lake but horizontally they wander back and forth to just as great a degree the line marked 880 at the penitentiary pass through on that particular piece of ground every point that be 880 foot above sea level should the missourus river rise in flood to 880 foot the penitentiary would be on a island the edge of which be mark by the 880 contour contour show several thing among they the height of the ground they cross usually the contour have label on it in figure the height above some start point call the datum plane -- generally sea level if with a survey instrument you put in on a piece of ground a lot of stake each one of which be exactly the same height above sea level -- that be run a line of level -- then make a map show the locution of the stake a line draw on the map through all the stake position be a contour and show the position of all point of that particular height on any give map all contour be equally space in a vertical direction and the map show the location of a great number of point at certain fixed level if you know the vertical interval between any two adjacent contour you know the vertical interval for all the contour on that map for these interval on a give map be all the same with reference to a point through which no contour pass we can only say that the point in question be not higher than the next contour up the hill nor lower than the next one down the hill for the purpose of any problem it be usual to assume that the ground slope evenly between the two adjacent contour and that the vertical height of the point above the lower contour be proportional to its horizontal distance from the contour as compare to the whole distance between the two contour for instance on the map find the height of point a the horizontal measurement be as show on the map the vertical distance between the contour be 20 foot a be about one-quarter of the distance between the 800 and the 820 contour and we assume its height to be one-quarter of 20 foot -lrb- 5 foot -rrb- higher than 800 foot so the height of a be 805 foot the vertical interval be usually indicate in the corner of the map by the letter v i for instance : v i = 20 foot on map of very small piece of ground the v i be usually small -- perhaps as small as 1 foot on map of large area on a small scale it may be very great -- even 1000 foot contour also show slope it have already be explain that from any contour to the next one above it the ground rise a fixed number of foot accord to the vertical interval of that map from the scale of distance on the map the horizontal distance between any two contour can be find for example : on the map the horizontal distance between d and e be 90 yard or 270 foot the vertical distance be 20 foot the v i of the map the slope then be 20\/270 = 1\/135 = 7-1\/2 % = 4-1\/2 ° in all of which different way the slope can be express -lrb- illustration -rrb- on a good many contoured map a figure like this will be find in one of the corner : -lrb- illustration -rrb- on that particular map contour separate by the distance -lrb- illustration -rrb- on the vertical scale show a slope of 1 ° : if separate by the distance -lrb- illustration -rrb- they show a 2 ° slope etc a slope of 1 ° be a rise of 1 foot in 57 to use this scale of slope copy it on the edge of a piece of paper just as you do the scale of distance and apply it directly to the map you will notice that where the contour lie closest the slope be steepest where they be farthest apart the ground be most nearly flat it have already be set forth how contours show height and slope in addition to this they show the shape of the ground or ground form each single contour show the shape at its particular level of the hill or valley it outline for instance the 880 contour about the penitentiary show that the hill at that level have a shape somewhat like a horse 's head similarly every contour on the map give we the form of the ground at its particular level and know these ground form for many level we can form a fair conception of what the whole surface be like a round contour like the letter o outline a round ground feature a long narrow one indicate a long narrow ground feature different hill and depression have different shape a good many of they have one shape at one level and another shape at another level all of which information will be give you by the contour on the map one of the way to see how contours show the shape of the ground be to pour half a bucket of water into a small depression in the ground the water 's edge will be exactly level and if the depression be approximately round the water 's edge will also be approximately round the outline will look something like figure 6 draw roughly on a piece of paper a figure of the same shape and you will have a contour show the shape of the bit of ground where you pour you water next with you heel gouge out on one edge of you little pond a small round bay the water will rush in and the water-mark on the soil will now be shape something like figure 7 alter you drawing accordingly and the new contour will show the new ground shape again do violence to the face of nature by digging with a stick a narrow inlet open out of you miniature ocean and the watermark will now look something like figure 8 alter you drawing once more and you contour show again the new ground form drop into you main pond a round clod and you will have a new watermark like figure 9 to add to you draw this new contour of the same level with the one show the limit of the depression show on the draw the round island drop in a second clod this time long and narrow the watermark will be like figure 10 and the drawing of it properly place will show another island of another shape you drawing now will look like figure 11 it show a depression approximately round off which open a round bay and a long narrow bay there be also a round elevation and a long narrow one a long narrow ridge jut out between the two bay and a short broad one across the neck of the round bay -lrb- illustration : fig 6 fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 fig 10 fig 11 -rrb- now flood you lake deeply enough to cover up the feature you have introduce the new water line about as show by the dot line in figure 11 show the oblong shape of the depression at a higher level the solid line show the shape farther down the horizontal distance between the two contour at different point show where the bank be steep and where the slope be gentler put together the information that each of these contour give you and you will see how contours show the shape of the ground on the little map you have draw you have introduce all the variety of ground form there be therefore all the contour form the contour on a ordinary map seem much more complicated but this be due only to the number of they they length and many turn before they finally close on themselves or they may close off the paper but trace each one out and it will resolve itself into one of the form show in figure 11 just as the high-tide line round the continent of north and south america run a long and tortuous course but finally close back on itself so will every contour do likewise and just as truly as every bend in that high-tide mark turn out around a promontory or in around a bay so will every bend in a contour stand for a hill or a valley point to the lowland if it be a hill and to the height if it mark a valley if the map embrace a whole continent or a island all the contour will be of closed form as in figure 11 but if it embrace only it part of the continent or island some of the contour will be chop off at the edge of the map and we have the open form of contour as we would have if figure 11 be cut into two part the closed form may indicate a hill or a basin the open form a ridge or a valley sometimes a casual glance do not indicate which take up first the contour of the open type if the map show a stream run down the inside of the contour there be no difficulty in say at once that the ground feature be a valley for instance v v v and the valley of corral creek on the map but if there be no stream line do the contour bend show a valley or a ridge first of all there be a radical difference between the bend of a contour round the head of a valley and its bend round the nose of a ridge compare on the map the valley v and the ridge r the bend of the contour round the head of the valley be much sharper than the bend of the contour round the nose of the ridge this be a general truth not only in regard to map but also in regard to ground form study any piece of open ground and note how much wider be the ridge than the valley where you find a hog back or devil 's backbone you have a exception to the rule but the exception be not frequent enough to worry over to tell whether a give point be on a ridge or in a valley start from the nearest stream show on the map and work across the map to the undetermined point keep in mind that in a real trip across the country you start from the stream go up the hill to the top of a ridge down the other side of the hill to a water-course then up a hill to the top of a ridge down again up again etc that be all travel be -- valley hill valley hill valley etc though you wander till the crack o ' doom and so you map travels must go -- valley hill valley hill -- till you run off the map or come back to the start point on the map follow the r-v line v indicate valley and r ridge or hill note first the difference in sharpness in the contour bend also how the valley contour point to the highland and the ridge contour to the lowland the contour go thus : -lrb- illustration -rrb- the stream flow down the valley and the sharp angle of the contour point always _ up _ stream note also how the junction of a stream and its tributary usually make a angle that point _ down _ stream which way do this stream run water flow down hill if you be in the bed of a stream contour represent higher ground must be to you right and to you left get the elevation of these contour generally the nearest contour to the bank of the stream will cross the stream and there will be a angle or sharp turn in the contour at this cross if the point of the angle or sharp turn be toward you you be go downstream if away from you you be go upstream if the contour be number you have only to look at the number to say where the low and where the high place be but to read a map with any speed one must be quite independent of these number in ordinary map reading look first of all for the stream line the stream be the skeleton upon which the whole map be hung then pick out the hilltop and ridge and you have a body to clothe with ail the detail that will be reveal by a close and careful study of what the map maker have record as to closed contour they may outline a depression or a hill on the map 881 or 885 might be hill or pond as far as they shape be concerned but clearly they be hill for on either side be small stream run _ away _ from they if they be pond the stream line would run _ toward _ the closed contour the rest of hill valley hill will always solve the problem when there be not enough stream line show to make evident at once whether a closed contour mark a pond or a hill look in the beginning for the stream line and valley and by contrast if for no other reason the hill and ridge at once loom up to illustrate the subject of contour to aid those who have difficulty in read contoured map the following be suggest : 1 secure modeling clay and build a mound 2 use wire and slice this mound horizontally at equal vertical interval into zone then insert vertical dowel through the mound of clay 3 remove the top zone place on paper and draw outline of the bottom edge trim you paper roughly to the outline draw indicate where the hole make by the dowel pierce the paper 4 do the above with each zone of you mound 5 place these papers in proper order on dowel similarly place to one in original mound at say 1 inch vertical interval apart a skeleton mound result 6 replace the zone of the clay mound and form the original clay mound along the side of skeleton mound 7 new force all the paper sheet down the dowel onto the bottom sheet and we have a map of clay mound with contour note -- one-inch or 2-inch plank can be make into any desire form by the use of dowel and similar procedure follow people frequently ask what should i see when i read a map and the answer be give the ground as it be this be not true any more than it be true that the word the valley of the meuse bring to you mind vine-clad hill a noble river and green field where cattle graze nor can any picture ever put into you thought what the grand canyon really be what print word or paint picture can not do a map will not a map say to you here stand a hill here be a valley this stream run so and give you a good many fact in regard to they but you do not have to see anything any

front be use to indicate a interval 24 the beam of the searchlight though ordinarily use with the shutter like the heliograph may be use for long-distance signaling when no shutter be suitable or available in a similar manner to the flag or torch the first position be a vertical one a movement of the beam 90 ° to the right of the sender indicate a dot a similar movement to the left indicate a dash the beam be lower vertically for front 25 to use the torch or hand lantern a foot light must be employ as a point of reference to the motion the lantern be most conveniently swing out upward to the right of the footlight for a dot to the leave for a dash and raise vertically for front note -- to call a station make the call letter until acknowledge at interval give the call or signal of the call station if the call letter of a station be unknown wave flag until acknowledge in use the searchlight without shutter throw the beam in a vertical position and move it through a arc of 180 ° in a

flash lantern and searchlight -lrb- with shutter -rrb- general service code 26 the first position be to turn a steady flash on the receive station the signal be make by short and long flash use a short flash for dot and a long steady flash for dash the element of a letter should be slightly longer than in sound signal 27 to call a station make its call letter until acknowledge 28 if the call letter of a station be unknown signal a until acknowledged each station will then turn on a steady flash and adjust when adjustment be satisfactory to the call station it will cut off its flash and the call station will proceed with its message 29 if the receiver see that the sender 's mirror or light need adjustment he will turn on a steady flash until answer by a steady flash when the adjustment be satisfactory the receiver will cut off he flash and the sender will resume he message -lrb- illustration : the two-arm semaphore code -rrb- -lrb- illustration : the two-arm semaphore

or at night they may be use with the dot and dash code in apply the general service code to whistle foghorn bugle or trumpet one short blast indicate a dot and one long blast a dash with the drum one tap indicate a dot and two tap in rapid succession a dash although these signal can be use with a dot and dash code they should be so use in connection with a preconcerted or conventional code signaling by two-arm semaphore hand flag 43 signaling by the two-arm semaphore be the most rapid method of send spelled-out message it be however very liable to error if the motion be slur over or run together in a attempt to make speed both arm should move rapidly and simultaneously but there should be a perceptible pause at the end of each letter before make the movement for the next letter rapidity be secondary to accuracy for alphabet see page follow note -- in make the interval the flag be cross downward in front of the body -lrb- just above the knee -rrb- the double interval be the chop-chop signal make twice the triple interval be chop-chop signal make three time in call a station face it squarely and make its call if there be no immediate reply wave the flag over the head to attract attention make the call at frequent interval when the sender make end of message the receiver if message be understand extend the flag horizontally and wave they until the sender do the same

dressing contain in the first-aid packet have be so treat as to destroy any germ thereon therefore when dress a wound be careful not to touch or handle that part of the dress which be to be apply to the wound a sick or injured person should always be make to lie down on he back if practicable as this be the most comfortable position and all muscle may be relax all tight article of clothing and equipment should be loosen so as not to interfere with breathing or the circulation of the blood belt collar and the trousers at the waist should be open -lrb- illustration : fig 1 -rrb- do not let mere onlooker crowd about the patient they prevent he from get fresh air and also make he nervous and excite in case of injury the heart action be generally weak from shock and the body therefore grow somewhat cold so do not remove any more clothing than be necessary to expose the injury cut or rip the clothing but do not pull it try to disturb the patient as little as possible do not touch a wound with you finger or a handkerchief or with anything else but the first-aid dress do not wash the wound with water as you may infect it do not administer stimulant -lrb- whisky brandy wine etc -rrb- unless order to do so by a doctor while in a few case stimulant be of benefit in a great many case they do positive harm especially where there have be any bleed the heart may be consider as a pump and the artery as a rubber hose which carry the blood from the heart to every part of the body the vein be the hose which carry the blood back to the heart every wound bleed some but unless a large artery or a large vein be cut the bleeding will stop after a short while if the patient be keep quiet and the first-aid dress be bind over the wound so as to make pressure on it -lrb- illustration : fig 2 -rrb- when a large artery be cut the blood gush out in spurt every time the heart beat in this case it be necessary to stop the flow of blood by press upon the hose somewhere between the heart and the leak if the leak be in the arm or hand apply pressure as in figure 1 if the leak be in the leg apply pressure as in figure 2 if the leak be in the shoulder or armpit apply pressure as in figure 3 the reason for this be that at the place indicate the artery may be press against a bone more easily than at any other place another way of apply pressure -lrb- by means of a tourniquet -rrb- be show in figure 4 place a pad of tightly roll cloth or paper or any suitable object over the artery tie a bandage loosely about the limb and then insert you bayonet or a stick and twist up the bandage until the pressure of the pad on the artery stop the leak twist the bandage slowly and stop as soon as the blood cease to flow in order not to bruise the flesh or muscle unnecessarily -lrb- illustration : fig 3 -rrb- a tourniquet may cause pain and swell of the limb and it leave on too long may cause the limb to die therefore about every half hour or so loosen the bandage very carefully but if the bleeding continue pressure must be apply again in this case apply the pressure with the thumb for five or ten minute as this cut off only the main artery and leave some of the smaller artery and the vein free to restore some of the circulation when a tourniquet be painful it be too tight and should be carefully loosen a little it the leg or arm be hold upright this also help to reduce the bleeding in these part because the heart then have to pump the blood uphill a broken bone be call a fracture the great danger in the case of a fracture be that the sharp jagged edge of the bone may stick through the flesh and skin or tear and bruise the artery vein and muscle if the skin be not break a fracture be not so serious as no germ can get in therefore never move a person with a broken bone until the fracture have be so fix that the broken end of the bone can not move -lrb- illustration : fig 4 -- improvise tourniquet -rrb- if the leg or arm be break straighten the limb gently and if necessary pull upon the end firmly to get the bone in place then bind the limb firmly to a splint to hold it in place a splint may be make of any straight stiff material -- a shingle or piece of board a bayonet a rifle a straight branch of a tree etc whatever material you use must be well pad on the side next to the limb be careful never to place the bandage over the fracture but always above and below -lrb- fig 5 6 7 8 -rrb- many surgeon think that the method of bind a broken leg to the well one and of bind the arm to the body be the best plan in the field as be the quickest and one that serve the immediate purpose -lrb- illustration : fig 5 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 6 -rrb- with wound about the body the chest and abdomen you must not meddle except to protect they when possible without much handling with the material of the packet fainting shock heat exhaustion the symptom of faint shock and heat exhaustion be very similar the face be pale the skin cool and moist the pulse be weak and generally the patient be unconscious keep the patient quiet rest on he back with he head low loosen the clothing but keep the patient warm and give stimulant -lrb- whisky hot coffee tea etc -rrb- sunstroke in the case of sunstroke the face be flush the skin be dry and very hot and the pulse be full and strong in this case place the patient in a cool spot remove the clothing and make every effort to lessen the heat in the body by cold application to the head and surface generally do not under any circumstance give any stimulant or hot drink -lrb- illustration :

in a cool place and never near a fire stimulant be to be give cautiously when the patient can swallow and follow by small amount of warm liquid nourishment the object be to restore the circulation of the blood and the natural warmth gradually and not violently care and patience be necessary to do this resusitation of the apparently drown in the instruction of the army in first aid the method of resuscitation of the apparently drown as describe by schaefer will be teach instead of the sylvester method heretofore use the schaefer method of artificial respiration be also applicable in case of electric shock asphyxiation by gas and of the failure of respiration follow concussion of the brain be under water for four of five minute be generally fatal but a effort to revive the apparently drown should always be make unless it be know that the body have be under water for a very long time the attempt to revive the patient should not be delay for the purpose of remove he clothes or place he in the ambulance begin the procedure as soon as he be out of the water on the shore or in the boat the first and most important thing be to start artificial respiration without delay the schaefer method be prefer because it can be carry out by one person without assistance and because its procedure be not exhaust to the operator thus permit he if require to continue it for one or two hour when it be know that a person have be under water for but a few minute continue the artificial respiration for at least one and a half to two hour before consider the case hopeless once the patient have begin to breathe watch carefully to see that he do not stop again should the breathing be very faint or should he stop breathe assist he again with artificial respiration after he start breathing do not lift he nor permit he to stand until the breathing have become full and regular as soon as the patient be remove from the water turn he face to the ground clasp you hand under he waist and raise the body so any water may drain out of the air passage while the head remain low -lrb- figure 9 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 9 -- schaefer method of artificial respiration inspiration -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 10 -- schaefer method of artificial respiration expiration -rrb- the patient be lay on he stomach arm extend from he body beyond he head face turn to one side so that the mouth and nose do not touch the ground this position cause the tongue to fall forward of its own weight and so prevent its fall back into the air passage turn the head to one side prevent the face come into contact with mud or water during the operation this position also facilitate the removal from the mouth of foreign body such as tobacco chew gum false tooth etc and favor the expulsion of mucus blood vomitus serum or any liquid that may be in the air passage the operator kneel straddle one or both of the patient 's thigh and face he head locate the lowest rib the operator with he thumb nearly parallel to he finger place he hand so that the little finger curl over the twelfth rib if the hand be on the pelvic bone the object of the work be defeat hence the bone of the pelvis be first located in order to avoid they the hand must be free from the pelvis and rest on the lowest rib by operate on the bare back it be easier to locate the lower rib and avoid the pelvis the nearer the end of the rib the hand be place without slide off the better the hand be thus remove from the spine the finger be nearly out of sight the finger help some but the chief pressure be exert by the heel -lrb- thenar and hypothenar eminence -rrb- of the hand with the weight come straight from the shoulder it be a waste of energy to bend the arm at the elbow and shove in from the side because the muscle of the back be stronger than the muscle of the arm the operator 's arm be hold straight and he weight be bring from he shoulder by bring he body and shoulder forward this weight be gradually increase until at the end of the three seconds of vertical pressure upon the lower rib of the patient the force be feel to be heavy enough to compress the part then the weight be suddenly remove if there be danger of not return the hand to the right position again they can remain lightly in place but it be usually better to remove the hand entirely if the operator be light and the patient a overweight adult he can utilize over 80 per cent of he weight by raise he knee from the ground and support himself entirely on he toe and the heel of he hand the latter properly place on the end of the float rib of the patient in this manner he can work as effectively as a heavy man a light feather or a piece of absorbent cotton draw out thin and hold near the nose by some one will indicate by its movement whether or not there be a current of air go and come with each force expiration and spontaneous inspiration the natural rate of breathing be 12 to 15 time per minute the rate of operation should not exceed this the lung must be thoroughly empty by three seconds of pressure then refill take care of itself pressure and release of pressure -- one complete respiration -- occupy about five seconds if the operator be alone he can be guide in each act by he own deep regular respiration or by count or by he watch lie by he side if comrade be present he can be advise by they the duration of the effort as artificial respiration should ordinarily exceed a hour indefinitely longer if there be any evidence of return animation by way of breathing speaking or movement there be liable to be evidence of life within 25 minute in patient who will recover from electric shock but where there be doubt the patient should be give the benefit of the doubt in drown especially recovery be on record after two hour or more of unconsciousness hence the schaefer method be easy of operation be more likely to be persist in aromatic spirit of ammonia may be pour on a handkerchief and hold continuously within 3 inch of the face and nose if other ammonia preparation be use they should be dilute or hold farther away try it on you own nose first when the operator be a heavy man it be necessary to caution he not to bring force too violently upon the rib as one of they might be break do not attempt to give liquid of any kind to the patient while unconscious apply warm blanket and hot-water bottle as soon as they can be obtain chapter xiv law and regulation section 1 general provision the army of the united state be govern by certain law call the article of war and certain regulation call army regulation
