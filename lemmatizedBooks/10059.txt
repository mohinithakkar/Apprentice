it delightful arthur weldon do you ever breathe such ozony delicious mountain air and do you get the fragrance of the pine forest and the -- the -- the bump ask arthur as the wagon give a jolt a bit more emphatic than usual yes patsy dear i get they all but i will not pass judgment on millville and uncle john 's farm just yet be we ` most there we be to have four whole month of it sigh beth that ought to enable we to renew we youth after the strenuous winter rubbish say uncle john you have not know a strenuous moment my dear and you be all too young to need renewal anyhow but if you can find happiness here my girl we old farm will become a paradise these three niece of mr merrick be well worth look at louise the eldest be now twenty -- entirely too young to be a bride but have decide to marry arthur weldon the girl would brook no interference and have a will of she own overcome all opposition she tall slender form be exceedingly graceful and willowy she personality dainty and refined she temperament under ordinary condition essentially sweet and agreeable in crisis louise develop considerable character in strong contrast with she usual assumption of well-bred composure that the girl be insincere in little thing and cultivate a polished manner to conceal she real feeling be undeniable but in spite of this she might be rely upon to prove loyal and true in emergency patricium doyle be more than two year the junior of she cousin louise and very unlike she patsy 's old father major gregory doyle say she wear she heart on she sleeve and the girl be frank and outspoken to a fault patsy have no figure to speak of be somewhat dumpy in build nor be she piquant feature at all beautiful she nose tip at the end she mouth be broad and full-lipped and she complexion badly freckled but patsy 's hair be of that indescribable shade that hover between burnish gold and sunset carmine fiery red she be wont to describe it and most people consider it very justly one of she two claim to distinction she other admirable feature be a pair of magnificent deep blue eye -- merry mischievous and scintillating as diamond few could resist those eye and certain it be that patsy doyle be a universal favorite and win friend without a particle of effort the younger of the three niece elizabeth de graf be as beautiful a girl as you will often discover one of those rarely perfect creation that excite we wonder and compel admiration -- as a beautiful picture or a bit of statuary will dreamy and reserve in disposition she lack the graciousness of louise and patsy 's compelling good humor yet you must not think she stupid or disagreeable she reserve be really diffidence she dreamy expressionless gaze the result of a serious nature and a thoughtful temperament beth be quite practical and matter-of-fact the reverse of patsy 's imaginative instinct or louise 's affect indifference those who know beth de graf best love she dearly but stranger find she hard to approach and be often repulse by she unresponsive manner underneath all the girl be a real girl with many splendid quality and uncle john rely upon beth 's stability more than on that of he other two niece she early life have be a stormy and unhappy one so she be but now develop she real nature beneath the warmth of she uncle 's protect love top the brow of a little hill the wagon come to a smooth downward grade where the road meet the quaint old bridge that span little bill creek beside which stand the antiquated flour and feed mill that have give millville its name the horse be able to maintain they brisk trot across the bridge and through the main street of the town which be merely a cluster of unimposing frame building that line either side of the highway for the space of a ordinary city block then they be in the wild again and rattle over another cobblestone trail this ` ere country 's nuth 'n' but pine wood 'n' cobblestone sigh old huck as the horse subside to a walk lor ' know what would ` a ' happen to we without the tree they save we grace so be to speak i think the scenery be beautiful observe patsy it be so different from other country place not much farming around here i imagine say arthur weldon more than you would think sir reply thomas there be certain crop as thrive in stony land a ' a few mile north o ' here towards huntingdon the soil 's mighty rich 'n' productive thing be not never as bad as they seem in this world sir he add turn he persistently smile face toward the young man mr merrick sit beside the driver on the front seat the middle seat be occupy by patsy and beth between whom squeeze little mary the maid louise and arthur have the back seat a quarter of a mile beyond the town they come to a sort of lane run at right angle with the turnpike and down this lane old huck turn he team it seem like a forbid prospect for ahead of they loom only a group of tall pine mark the edge of the forest yet as they come nearer and make a little bend in the road the wegg farm suddenly appear in view the house seem so cozy and homelike set upon its green lawn with the tall pine for a background that the girl who know the place well exclaim with delight and arthur who now see it for the first time nod he head approvingly uncle john be all excitement over the arrival at he country home a old fashion stile be set in a rail fence which separate the grounds from the lane and huck draw up the wagon so he passenger could all alight upon the step of the stile patsy be out at a bind louise follow more deliberately assist by she boy husband and beth come more sedately yet but uncle john ride around to the barn with thoma be eager to see the cow and pig and poultry with which the establishment be liberally stock the house be of two story the lower be build of cobblestone and the upper of pine slab but it have be artistically do and the effect be delightful it be a big rambling dwelling and mr merrick have furnish the old place in a lavish manner so that he niece would lack no modern comfort when they come there to spend a summer on the porch stand a old woman clothe in a neat gingham dress and wear a white apron and cap she pleasant face be wreathe in smile as she turn it toward the laughing chatter group that come up the path patsy spy she and rush up to give old nora a hug and kiss and the other two girl salute the blind woman with equal cordiality for long ago she have win the love and devotion of all three arthur who have hear of nora press she hand and tell she she must accept he as another of she child and then she ask for mr merrick and run in to get the breakfast serve for although blind old nora be far from be helpless and the breakfast she have prepare in anticipation of they arrival be as deliciously cook as if she have be able to use she eye as other do chapter iii the dawn of a great enterprise the great enterprise be spring on mr merrick the very morning follow he arrival at the farm breakfast be over and a group have form upon the shady front lawn where chair bench and hammock be scatter in profusion well uncle how do you like it ask louise be you perfectly comfortable and happy now we have escape so far from the city that its humming life be a mere memory happy as a clam respond uncle john lean back in he chair with he foot on a foot rest if i only have the morning paper there would be nothing else to wish for the paper that be what that queer tramp at the junction house ask for remark beth the first thought of even a hobo be for a morning paper i wonder why man be such slave to those gossipy thing phoo cry patsy we be all slave to they show I a person who do not read the daily journal and keep abreast of the time and i 'll show you a dummy patsy 's right remark arthur weldon the general intelligence and cosmopolitan knowledge of the people be best cultivate by the newspaper the superiority of we newspaper have be a factor in make we the greatest nation on earth for we be the best inform my what big word exclaim louise it be quite true say uncle john soberly that i shall miss we daily paper during we four month ' retirement in these fascinating wild it be the one luxury we can not enjoy in we country retreat why not ask patsy with startling abruptness while a queer expression -- as of a inspiration -- steal over she bright face chump say beth drily you know very well why not patsy doyle mooley cow and the fourth estate do not intermingle so to speak they can be make to though declare patsy why have not some one thought of it before uncle john -- girl -- i propose we start a daily paper louise laugh softly beth 's lip curl and arthur weldon cast a amuse glance at the girl but uncle john stare seriously into patsy 's question blue eye how he ask in a puzzle tone if anything could interest this eccentric little millionaire more than the usual trend of event it be a original proposition of this sort he love to do thing that other people have not attempt nor even think of he hate conversational platitude and establish convention and he niece have endear themselves to he more by they native originality and frank disregard of ordinary feminine limitation than in any other way it be generally concede that patsy be he favorite because she could advance more odd suggestion than the other girl and this niece have a practical aptitude for carry out she whimsical idea that have long since win she uncle 's respect not that she could outdo mr merrick in eccentricity : that be admit to be he special province in which he have no rival but the girl be so clever a confederate that she give she erratic uncle much happiness of the sort he most appreciate therefore this seemingly preposterous proposition to establish a daily paper on a retired country farm do not strike the old gentleman as utterly impossible and anything within the bound of possibility be sure to meet he earnest consideration especially when it be propose by one of he favorite niece how respond patsy why it be easy enough uncle we 'll buy a press hire a printer and beth and louise will help I edit the paper i be sure i can exhibit literary talent of a high order once they be encourage to sprout louise write lovely poetry and ` story of human interest ' and beth -- i can not write even a good letter assert that young lady but i would dearly love to edit a newspaper of course agree louise we all would and i think we could turn out a very creditable paper -- for millville but would not it cost a lot of money that be not the present question reply uncle john the main thing be do you girl want to be tie down to such a task every day in the week all during we summer holiday -- why you have make we whole life a holiday uncle john interrupted patsy and we have be so coddle and swamp with luxury that we be just now in serious danger of be spoil you do not want three spoil niece on you hand do you and please make allowance for we natural impetuosity and eagerness to be up and do we love the farm but we happiness here would be double if we have some occupation to keep we busy and this philanthropic undertaking would furnish we with no end of fun even while we be benefit we fellow man all jabber dear exclaim beth i admit the fun but where do the philanthropy come in do not you see asked patsy both uncle john and that tramp we encounter have meet on common ground to bewail the lack of a daily newspaper ` in we midst ' -- to speak in journalistic parlance at the paper mill at royal be over two hundred workman moan in despair while they lose all track of the world 's progress at huntingdon not five mile distant be four or five hundred people lack all the educational advantage of a up-to-date -- or be ` down-to-date ' proper -- press and millville -- good gracious what would sleepy millville folk think of have a bright newsy metropolitan newspaper leave on they doorstep every morning or evening as the case may be h-m say uncle john i scent a social revolution in the wild of chazy county let 's start it right away cry patsy the ` millville tribune ' what do you say girl why ` tribune ' ask louise because we three will run it and we be a triumvirate -- the future tribunal of the people in this district very good say uncle john nodding approval a clever idea patsy but it be all nonsense sir observe arthur weldon in astonishment have you any idea of the detail of this thing you be propose none whatever say the little millionaire that be the beauty of the scheme arthur it may lead we into a reg ` lar complicated mix-up and the joy of get untangled ought to repay we for all we bother perhaps so -- if you ever untangle say the young man smile at the whimsical speech then he turn to he young bride do you want to go into this thing louise he ask of course i do she promptly reply it be the biggest thing in the way of a sensation that patsy 's crazy brain have ever evolve and i 'll stand by the _ millville tribune _ to the last you must not forget arthur that i shall be able to publish all my verse and story which the century and harper ' so heartlessly turn down and beth oh i be in it too declare beth there be something so delightfully mysterious and bewildering in the idea of we editing and print a daily paper here in millville that i can hardly wait to begin the experiment it be no experiment whatever assert patsy boldly the daily newspaper be a established factor in civilization and ` whatever man have do man can do ' -- a adage that apply equally to girl have you any notion of the cost of a outfit such as be require to print a modern daily ask arthur oh two or three hundred perhaps but -- you be crazy child that would not buy the type nevertheless begin patsy argumentatively but she uncle stop she you need not figure on that he say hastily the outfit shall be my contribution to the enterprise if you girl say you be anxious and willing to run a newspaper i 'll agree to give you a proper start oh thank you uncle of course we be willing it be all absolutely settle so far as we be concern say patsy firmly how long will it take to get the thing here uncle mr merrick consider a moment there be a long-distance telephone over at cotting 's general store in town he say i 'll drive over and get major doyle on the wire and have he order the stuff send out at once oh no protest patsy do not tell daddy of this plan please he would think we be all fit subject for the lunatic asylum major doyle would not be far wrong in that conclusion suggest arthur i would like to surprise he by send he the first copy of the _ millville tribune _ add the major 's daughter then say mr merrick i 'll call up marvin my banker he 'll perhaps attend to the matter more understandingly and more promptly than the major would tell huck to harness joe to the buggy patsy and i 'll go at once we 'll all go exclaimed beth of course add louise we be all equally interested in this venture so patsy have old huck hitch joe to the surrey and the three girl accompany they uncle in he drive to town leave arthur weldon shake he head in a deprecating way but fully realize that no protest of he would avail to prevent this amazing undertaking that old man be as much a child as beth or patsy he reflect it puzzle I to explain how he make all those million with so little worldly wisdom chapter iv the way into print sam cotting 's general store at millville divide importance with bob west 's hardware store but be a more popular loaf place for the sparse population of the tiny town the post office be located in one corner and the telephone booth in another and this latter institution be regard with much awe by the simple native once in awhile some one would telephone over to the junction on some trivial business but the long-distance call be never employ except by the nabob -- the local name for john merrick and he niece -- or by the manager of the new mill at royal who have extend the line to he own office in the heart of the pine forest so when uncle john and the girl enter cotting 's store and the little gentleman shut himself up in the telephone booth a ripple of excitement spread throughout the neighborhood skim clark the youthful hope of the widow clark who run the emporium happen to be in the store and he rush out to spread the news that the nabob 's talkin ' to new yoruk this information demand immediate attention marshall mcmahon mcnutt familiarly know as peggy mcnutt -- because he have once lose a foot in a mow machine -- and who be allege to be a real estate agent horse doctor fancy poultry breeder and palmist and who also dabble in the sale of subscription book life insurance liniment and watermelon quickly slide off he front porch across the way and saunter into cotting 's to participate in the excitement seth davi the blacksmith drop he tool and hurry to the store and the druggist three door away -- a dapper gentleman know as nib corkin -- hurriedly lock he door and attend the meeting presently the curious group be enlarged by the addition of nick thome the liveryman lon taft a carpenter and general man-of-all-work and sila caldwell the miller the latter a serious individual who have jest happen to come acrost from the mill in the nick o ' time sam cotting be himself of great local importance have never regard with favor the rivalry of the nabob but he place stool near the telephone booth for the three girl who accept the courtesy with a graciousness that ought to have disarm the surly storekeeper they could not fail to be amuse at the interest they excite and as they personally know every one of the town people they pleasantly nod to each arrival and inquire after they health and the welfare of they family the reply be monosyllable millville folk be diffident in the presence of these city visitor and while they favor the girl with rather embarrassing stare they chief interest be center on the little man in the telephone booth who could plainly be see through the glass door but might not be hear however loudly he shout talkin ' to new yoruk be yet a marvelous thing to they and much speculation be exchange in low tone as to the probable cost of such a conversation as mr merrick be now indulge in cost a dollar to connect ye know remark peggy mcnutt to ned long bet a cookie he be runnin ' the blame bill up to two dollar with all this chinnin ' why can not th ' ol' nabob write a letter like common folk a ' give he extry cash to the poor meanin ' you peggy ask nib corkin with a chuckle he might do wuss ner that retort peggy lor ' know i be poor enough you do not ketch _ I _ a-talkin ' to new york at a dollar a throw nib do ye meantime mr merrick have succeed in get mr marvin of the banking house of isham marvin & co on the wire do I a favor marvin he say hunt up the best supply house and have they send I a complete outfit to print a daily newspaper everything must be modern you know and do not let they leave out anything that might come handy then go to corrigan the superintendent of the railroad and have he send the freight up here to chazy junction by a special engine for i do not want a moment 's delay and the regular freight take a week or so charge everything to my account and impress upon the dealer the need of haste understand all that marvin i think i do sir be the reply but that be a pretty big order mr merrick the outfit for a modern daily will cost a small fortune never mind send it along very well but you would better give I some detail how big a newspaper do you want to print hold the wire and i 'll find out say uncle john then he open the door of the booth and say : patsy how big a thing do you want to print how big oh let I see four page will do will not it louise plenty i should say for this place answer louise and how many column to a page ask uncle john oh six or seven that be regular i guess make it six propose beth that will keep we busy enough all right say uncle john and close the door again this conversation be of the most startling nature to the assemble villager who be all try to look unconcerned and as if they would jest drop in but be unable to dissemble they curiosity successfully of course much of this interchange of word between the man in the booth and the girl outside be greek to they all but to print and column and page could apply only to one idea which while not fully grasp be tremendously startling in its suggestion the merrick party be note for do astonishing thing in the past and evidently in the word of peggy mcnutt they be up to some

corkin these merrick do everything on a big scale four page a ' six column to a page ask cott scornfully sound to I more like a newspaper folk there be a moment 's silence during which they all stare at the speaker fearfully then say skim clark in he drawling halt way : ef thet 's the case a ' there be goin ' ter be a newspaper here in millville we may as well give up the struggle fer the town 'll be ruin chapter v divide the responsibility the rest of that day and a good share of the night be devote to a earnest consultation concern the proper method of launch the _ millville daily tribune _ we must divide the work say patsy so that all will have a equal share of responsibility louise be to be the literary editor and the society editor that sound like a good combination there be no society here object louise not as we understand the term perhaps reply miss doyle but every community however small believe it be a social center and so it be -- to itself if there be a dance or a prayer meeting or a christening or illness it must be record in we local column if bob west sell a plow we have get to mention the name of the farmer who buy it if there be a wedding we 'll make a double-header of it if a baby be bear we will -- will -- print its picture in the paper eh uncle john this from beth of course say mr merrick you must print all the home news as well as the news of the world how be you go to get the news of the world ask arthur how how that be my question private wire from new york say mr merrick as the girl hesitate how to meet this problem i 'll arrange with the telegraph company to-morrow to have a extension of the wire run over from chazy junction then we 'll hire a operator -- a girl of course -- to receive the news in the office of the paper but who will send we the news ask beth the associated press i suppose or some news agency in new york i 'll telegraph to-morrow to marvin to arrange it arthur whistle softly this newspaper be go to cost something he murmur uncle john look at he with a half quizzical half amuse expression that be what marvin warn I yesterday when i order the equipment say he he tell I that before i get through with this deal it would run up into the thousand and he add that millville be not worth it and what do you say to that uncle john ask beth in that case i say i would be sure to get some pleasure and satisfaction out of you journalistic enterprise my last financial statement show a frightful condition of affair in spite of major doyle 's reckless investment of my money and -- and the little we manage to give to deserving charity i be get richer every day when a small leak like this newspaper project occur it seem that fortune be pat I on the back i have no idea what a respectable newspaper will cost but i hope it will cost a lot for every dollar it devour make my mind just that much easier arthur weldon laugh in that case sir say he i can make no further protest but i predict you will find the bill -- eh -- eh -- entirely satisfactory you mention a office just now uncle observe louise must we have a business office to be sure mr merrick reply we must find a proper location where we can install the press and all the type and machinery that go to make up a newspaper i have not think of this before but it be a serious matter my dear we may have to build a place oh that would take too long entirely say patsy can not we put it in the barn uncle what would happen to the horse and cow no we 'll take a look over millville and see what we can find there you will not find much predict beth i can not think of a single unoccupied building in the town then we 'll put it in a tent declare patsy do not borrow trouble advise uncle john wait till we have go over the ground together we truck will require a pretty big place for marvin say one freight car would not hold all the outfit he be go to send two car anyhow have he fill up the second with print paper propose arthur ah that be another thing i have not think of say mr merrick how big a daily edition will you print patsy let 's see ponder the girl there be about two hundred at royal say four hundred at huntingdon at millville about -- about -- say fifteen say uncle john that be six hundred and fifteen and -- and the farmer of course there must be at least a hundred and fifty of 'em in the county so that make seven hundred and seventy-five copy a day wait a moment cry arthur somewhat bewildered by this figure do you suppose every inhabitant -- man woman and child -- will subscribe for you paper patsy blush why no of course not she acknowledge frankly how many do you think _ will _ subscribe arthur remember it be to be a great newspaper four page of six column each plenty big enough for millville he say thoughtfully my advice girl be to print a first edition of about four hundred copy and distribute the papers free in every house within a radius of five or six mile from millville these will be sample and after the people have have a chance to read they you can ask they to subscribe by the way what will you charge for subscription how much uncle ask patsy appealingly a penny paper be the most popular he say regard she with merry twinkling eye say thirty cent a month or three-fifty a year that be as much as these poor people can stand i think so too reply the girl seriously but it seem to I a penny paper be not dignified pout louise i have intend to print all my poem in it and i be sure that ought to make it worth at least five cent a copy that will make it worth more my dear comment uncle john but frequently one must sell property for less than it be actually worth you must remember these people have not be use to spend much money on literature and i imagine you 'll have to coax they to spend thirty cent a month many of the big new york papers be sell for a penny and without any loss of dignity either do you think we can make it pay on that basis uncle ask beth uncle john cough to gain time while he think of a suitable reply that my dear he inform he niece will depend upon how many subscriber you can get subscriber and advertiser be necessary to make any paper pay advertiser of course say practical beth every merchant in millville and huntingdon will naturally advertise in we paper and we 'll make the major get we a lot from new york oh say patsy i see so _ that _ difficulty be settle arthur smile but hold he peace uncle john 's round face be grow merrier every minute patsy do you think we shall make any money from this venture ask louise we ought to if we put we heart and soul into the thing be the reply but before we divide any profit we must pay back to uncle john the original investment we do not especially care to make any profit do we inquire beth it be fun for we you know and a -- a -- great educational experience and -- and -- a fine philanthropy -- and all that we do not need the money so if the paper pay a profit at a cent a copy we would better cut down the price do not do that yet advise uncle john soberly there will be expense that as yet you do not suspect and a penny for a paper be about as low as you can go what be to be my position on the staff patsy ask beth turn to she cousin you be a good mathematician beth so i propose you act as secretary and treasurer and keep the book no that be too mechanical no bookkeeping for I i want something literary then you can be sport editor goodness patsy there will be no sport news in millville there will be a ball game occasionally and i see some of the man pitch quoit yesterday but this be to be a newspaper reflect the excitement of the entire world beth and all the telegraphic news of a sport character you must edit and arrange for we reading column oh yes and you 'll take care of the religious item too we must have a Sunday sermon by some famous preacher uncle we 'll print that every Saturday so those who can not go to church may get as good a talk as if they do -- and perhaps a better one that will be fine he agree how about murder crime and divorce all bar nothing that send a cold chill down you back will be allow in we paper these people be delightfully simple we do not want to spoil they cut out the cold chill and you 'll spoil you newspaper suggest arthur people like to read of other folk ' horror for it make they more contented with they own lot in life false philosophy sir cry fatsy firmly you can not educate people by retail crime and scandal and the _ millville tribune _ be go to be as clean as a prayer book if i be to be manage editor be that to be you office dear ask louise i think so i have a heap of executive ability and i be run over with literary -- eh -- eh -- literary discrimination in addition to run the thing i 'll be the general news editor because i be better post on newspaper business than the other girl how do that happen inquire louise wonderingly why i -- i _ read _ the papers more than you or beth and i have set myself to master every detail of the business no more crochet or fancy work -- no novel reading -- no gossipy letter write from this day on we must attend strictly to business if we be to become journalist girl we must be good one -- better than the ordinary -- so that uncle john may point to we with pride and the column of the _ millville daily tribune _ will be quote by the new york and chicago press only in that way can we become famous throughout the world pass I the bonbon dear sigh louise it be a high ambition be not it a very laudable ambition add uncle john approvingly i hope my clever niece will be able to accomplish it how about picture ask beth modern newspaper be illustrated and have cartoon of the lead event of the day can not we buy those thing somewhere ask patsy appeal to uncle john again there be not a artist among we of any account and we shall be too busy to draw picture we must hire a artist say mr merrick add the item to he memorandum i 'll speak to marvin about it all these detail be begin to bewilder the embryo journalist it be quite possible that have not uncle john place he order for press and type so promptly the girl might have withdraw from the proposition but the die be now cast and they be too brave -- perhaps too stubborn -- to back down at this juncture i realize say patsy slowly and with a shake of she flaming head that we have undertake a important venture we new enterprise be a most serious one girl for there be nothing greater or grander in we advanced age than the daily newspaper no power so tremendous as the power of the press yes the press must be powerful or it would not print clearly remark beth we be to become public mentor to the simple native of chazy county continue patsy warm up to she subject and speak oratorically we shall be the guide star of the -- er -- er -- the benighted citizen of millville and huntingdon we must lead they in politics counsel they in the management of they farm and educate they to the great world movement that be constantly occur let 's put all that rot in we prospectus say louise look at she cousin admiringly can you remember it patsy or have i better write it down now i like that about teach the farmer how to run they farm it be so practical you wait say patsy unflinchingly i 'll write 'em a editorial that will make they eye roll but it will not do a bit of harm for you and beth to jot down all the brilliant thought you run across for the benefit of we subscriber we have not any subscriber yet remark beth placidly i 'll overcome that defect say uncle john i want to subscribe right now for ten copy to be mail to friend of mine in the city who -- who need educate i 'll pay in advance and collect of my friend when i see 'em this be certainly encouraging and patsy smile benignantly i 'll take five more yearly subscription say arthur oh but you be go to be on the staff cry patsy be i certainly i have be think over we organization and while it be quite proper for three girl to run paper there ought to be a man to pose as the editor in chief that 'll be you arthur but you will not print my name oh yes we shall do not groan sir it be no disgrace wait till you see the _ millville tribune _ also we shall print we own name in that case give credit to whom credit be due the announcement will run something like this : ` arthur weldon general manager and editor in chief p doyle general news editor l merrick weldon society and literary editor e degraf sport editor secretary and treasurer ' you see by use we initial only no one will ever suspect we be girl the millville people may say arthur slyly and perhaps the disguise will be penetrate by outsider that will depend on the paper i do not like that combination of sport editor and secretary and treasurer object beth it be not the usual thing in journalism i be sure suppose you call I editor of special feature and let it go at that have we any special feature ask louise oh yes say arthur there be beth 's eyebrow patsy 's nose and -- do be sensible cry patsy this be not a joking matter sir we newspaper will have plenty of special feature and beth 's suggestion be a good one it sound impressive you see arthur we have get to use you as a figurehead but so you will not loaf on you job i have decide to appoint you solicitor of advertising and subscription thank you my dear he say grin in a amuse way you and louise who still like to be together can drive all over the county get subscription and you can write letter on we new stationery to all the big manufacturer of soap and breakfast food and beauty powder and to all the correspondence school and get they advertisement for the _ tribune _ if you get a good many we may have to enlarge the paper do not worry miss doyle i 'll try to keep within bound and so they go on lay plan and discuss detail in such a earnest way that uncle john become as enthusiastic as any of they and declare in no uncertain tone that the _ millville daily tribune _ be bind to be a howling success after the girl have retire for the night and the man sit smoking together in uncle john 's own room arthur say : tell I sir why you have encourage this mad project the little millionaire puff he pipe in silence a moment then he reply : i be educate my girl to be energetic and self-reliant i want to bring out and develop every spark of latent ability there be in they whether the _ millville tribune _ succeed or fail be not important it will at least keep they busy for a time along new line and tax they best resource of intellect and business ability in other word this experience be bind to do 'em good and in that way i figure it will be worth all it cost -- and more i like the originality of the idea i be pleased with the difficulty i see loom ahead i be quite sure my girl will rise to every occasion and prove they grit he pause to knock the ash from he pipe i be worth a lot of money arthur he continue meekly and some day these three girl will inherit immense fortune it be my duty to train they in all practical business way to take care of they property i follow you line of reasoning sir observe arthur weldon but this absurd journalistic venture be bind to result in heavy financial loss i know it my boy i be sure of it but can not you see that the lesson they will learn will render they more cautious in make future investment i be go to supply a complete newspaper outfit -- to the last detail -- and give 'em a good run start then i shall sit back and watch result if they lose money on run expense as they surely will they 'll first take it out of they allowance then sell they jewelry and finally come to I for help see the lesson will be worth while arthur and aside from that -- think of the fun they 'll have chapter vi mr skeelty of the mill the next morning they drive to town again pass slowly up the street of the little village to examine each building that might be a possible location for a newspaper office here be a map that patsy draw of millville which give a fair idea of its arrangement : -lrb- illustration : village street -rrb- count the dwelling there be exactly twelve building and they all seem occupy when they reach the hardware store opposite cotting 's mr west the proprietor be stand on the broad platform in front of it in many respects bob west be the most important citizen of millville tall and gaunt with great horn spectacles cover a pair of cold gray eye he be usually as reserve and silent as he neighbor be confide and talkative a widower of long standing without child or near relative he occupy a suite of well-appointed room over the hardware store and take he meal at the hotel before mr merrick appear on the scene west have be consider a very wealthy man as it be know he have many interest outside of he store but compare with the multi-millionaire old bob have come to be regard more modestly although still admit to be the village 's warmest citizen he be a authority in the town too and a man of real importance mr merrick stop he horse to speak with the hardware man a old acquaintance west say he my girl be go to start a newspaper in millville the merchant bow gravely perhaps to cover the trace of a smile he be unable to repress it be to be a daily paper you know continued mr merrick and it seem there be a lot of machinery in the outfit it 'll need quite a bit of room in other word and we be look for a place to install it west glance along the street -- up one side and down the other -- and then shake he head negatively plenty of land but no building say he you might buy the old mill and turn it into a newspaper office caldwell be not make much of a living and would be glad to sell out it be too dusty and floury say patsy we have never get it clean i be sure what be in that shed of yours ask uncle john point to a long low building ' that adjoin the hardware store west turn and look at the shed reflectively that be where i store my stock of farm machinery he say there be very little in there now for it be a poor season and i do not lay in much of a supply in fact i be pretty well clean out of all surplus stock but next spring i shall need the place again good cry mr merrick that solve we problem have it a floor yes a excellent one but only one small window we can remedy that declare uncle john here be the proposition west : let we have the shed for six month at the end of which time we will know whether the _ millville tribune _ be a success or not if it be we 'll build a fine new building for it if it do not seem to prosper we 'll give you back the shed what do you say west think it over there be room on the rear platform for all the farm machinery i now have on hand all right mr merrick i 'll move the truck out and give you possession it will not make a bad newspaper office but of course you be to fit up the place at you own expense thank you very much sir exclaim uncle john i 'll set lon taft at work at once where can he be find play billiards at the hotel usually i suppose he be there now very good i 'll hunt he up what do you think of we newspaper scheme west the old merchant hesitate then he say slowly : whatever you charming and energetic niece undertake sir will doubtless be well accomplish the typical country newspaper groan under a load of debt and seldom get a fair show to succeed but in this case there will be no lack of money and -- why that settle the question i think money be the keystone to success mr west say louise with dignity we be depend chiefly on the literary merit of we newspaper to win recognition of course of course say he hastily put I down as a subscriber please and rely upon my support at all time it be possible young lady -- nay quite probable i should say -- that you originality and genius will yet make millville famous that speech pleased uncle john and as the hardware merchant bow and turn away mr merrick say in he cheeriest tone : he be quite right my dear and we be lucky to have find such a fine roomy place for we establishment before we go after the carpenter to fix it up i must telephone to marvin about the thing we still need over the long-distance telephone mr marvin report that he have buy the require outfit and it be even then be load on the freight car i have arrange for a special engine he add and if all go well the freight will be on the sidetrack at chazy junction on Monday morning the dealer will send down three man to set up the press and get everything in run order but he ask if you have arrange for you workman how about it mr merrick have you plenty of competent printer and pressman at millville there be none at all be the reply better inquire how many we will need marvin and send they down here and by the way hire woman or girl for every position they be competent to fill this be go to be a girl ' newspaper so we 'll have as few man around as possible i understand sir uncle john order everything he could think of and tell he agent to add whatever the supply man think might be need this business be accomplish he find lon taft at the hotel and instruct the carpenter to put row of window on both side of the shed and to build partition for a editorial office and a business office at the front this be the beginning of a busy period especially for poor uncle john who have many detail to attend to personally the next morning the electrician arrive and begin string the power cable from the paper mill to the newspaper office this render it necessary for mr merrick to make a trip to royal to complete he arrangement with mr skeelty the manager he drive over with arthur weldon in the buggy -- four mile of hill climb over rough cobble-stone into the pine forest arrive there the visitor be astonish at the extent of the plant so recently establish in this practically unknown district the great mill where the wood pulp be make be a building construct from pine slab and cobblestone material gather from the clearing in which it stand but it be quite substantial and roomy adjoining the mill be the factory building where the pulp be roll into print paper surround these huge building be some sixty small dwelling of the bungalow type for the use of the workman build of rough board but neat and uniform in appearance almost in the center of this group stand the extensive storehouse from which all necessary supplies be furnish the mill hand the cost be deduct from they wages the electric power plant be a building at the edge of royal waterfall the low and persistent roar of which be scarcely drown by the rumble of machinery finally at the edge of the clearing nearest the mill stand the business office and to this place mr merrick and arthur at once proceed they find the office a busy place three or four typewriter be click away operate by sallow-faced girl and behind a tall desk be two bookkeeper in one of whom uncle john recognize -- with mild surprise -- the tramp he have encounter at chazy junction on the morning of he arrival the young fellow have improve in appearance have discard he fray gray suit for one of plain brown khaki such as many of the workman wear a supply be carry by the company 's store he be clean-shaven and trim and a gentlemanly bearing have replace the careless half defiant attitude of the former hobo it be evident he remember meeting mr merrick for he smile and return the nabob 's nod mr skeelty have a private enclosed office in a corner of the room be admit to this sanctum the visitor find the manager to be a small puffy individual about forty-five year of age with shrewd beadlike black eye and a insolent assumption of super-importance skeelty interrupt he task of run up column of impressive figure to ask he caller to be seat and open the interview with characteristic abruptness you be merrick eh i remember you want to buy power and we have it to sell how much will you contract to take i do not know just how much we need answer uncle john we want enough to run a newspaper plant at millville and will pay for whatever we use i have order a meter as you ask I to do and my man be now string the cable to make the connection pah a newspaper how absurd say mr skeelty with scornful emphasis you name merrick be not unknown to I it stand for financial success i understand but i 'll bet you never make you money do such fool thing as establish newspaper in graveyard uncle john look at the man attentively i shall refrain from criticise you conduct of this mill mr skeelty he quietly observe nor shall i dictate what you may do with you money -- provide you succeed in make any the manager smile broadly as if the retort please he give a ' take sir that be my motto he say but you prefer to take i do be the cheerful reply i 'll take you paper for instance -- if it be not too high price in case it be we will present you with a subscription say uncle john but that remind I : as a part of we bargain i want you to allow my niece or any representative of the _ millville tribune _ to take subscription among you workman mr skeelty stare at he a moment then he laugh they be mostly foreigner mr merrick who have not yet fully master the english language but he add thoughtfully a few among they might subscribe if you country sheet contain any news of interest at all this be rather a lonely place for my man and they get dissatisfy at time all workman seem chronically dissatisfied and they woman constantly urge they to rebellion already there be grumbling and they claim they be bury alive in this forlorn forest do not appreciate the advantage of country life you see and i have a idea they 'll begin to desert pretty soon really a live newspaper might do they good -- especially if you print a little socialistic drivel now and then again he devote a moment to thought and then continue : tell you what i 'll do sir i 'll solicit the subscription myself and deduct the price from the man 's wages as i do the cost of they other supplies but the company get a commission for that of course it be a penny paper say uncle john the subscription be only thirty cent a month deliver i suppose so well i 'll pay you twenty cent and keep the balance for commission that be fair enough very well mr skeelty we be after subscription more than money just now get all you can at that rate after sign a contract for the supply of electrical power whereby he be outrageously rob but the supply be guarantee mr merrick and arthur return to the farm that man say louise 's young husband refer to the manager of the paper mill be a unmitigated scoundrel sir i will not deny it reply mr merrick it occur to I he be hire those poor workman at low wages and make a profit on all they living necessity which he reserve the right of supply from he own store no wonder the poor fellow get dissatisfied chapter vii the sketch artist during the next three day so many thing happen at millville that the native be in a panic of excitement not only be electricity bring from the paper mill but a telegraph wire be run from chazy junction to bob west 's former storage shed and a telephone gang come along and place a private wire with long-distance connection in the new newspaper office the office itself become transform -- as full o ' winder as a hothouse exclaim peggy mcnutt with bulge eye

the community some be glad and some rebel but all be excite a perpetual meeting be hold at cotting 's store to discuss development for something startling occur every few minute it be a outrage this thing comment young skim clark despondently they be tryin ' to run mother out o ' business -- a ' she a widder with I to look after most o ' the business at the emporium be do in newspaper a ' magazine a ' sich so these gal think they would cut under a ' take the business away from she can not the widder clark sell the new paper then ask the blacksmith i dunno have not think o ' that say skim but the price be to be jus ' one cent a ' we have ben gittin ' five cent fer all the outside papers where 's the profit comin ' from on one cent i would like to know why we make two or three cent on all the five cent papers as fer that remark the druggist we 'll get a cheap paper -- if it be any good -- a ' that be somethin' to be thankful for ` two not be any good assert skim ma say so but no one except mcnutt be prepare to agree with this prediction the extensive plan in preparation seem to indicate that the new paper would be fully equal to the requirement of the populace on Monday when the news spread that two big freight car have arrive at the junction and nick thorne begin work three team to haul the outfit to millville the rest of the town abandon all business other than watch

mignonette anyhow suspect or unsuspected she mean ` fragrance ' suggest beth change it to : ` the fragrance there be lie under the rust ' that 'll fix it all right louise it do not seem right even then remark uncle john if the fragrance lie under the rust it can not be smell can it i do not anticipate all this criticism say louise with a air of injured dignity none of the big publishing house

keep sober in that case you have acquire the best sketch artist in america oh be you the artist then ask patsy with doubtful intonation i do not like the word i be not a real artist -- just a cartoonist and newspaper hack say it be funny to see I in this jungle be not it what joy i 'll have in astonishing the native i s ` pose a picture 's a picture to they and art a impenetrable mystery

apology for intrude i have a letter from tommy and one from a big banker -- marvin i guess he name be she draw two letter from she satchel and toss they on the desk before patsy they be no good to I

i be go to stab it with my pencil where it bump the rock it be obstinate and pig-headed where it leap the little shelf of slate it be merry and playful where it sweep silently between the curving bank it be sulky and resentful the little bill have mood bless its heart mood betoken character patsy secure for hetty a pleasant room face the creek where will you work at the office or here she ask in the open i guess i 'll run over the telegraph news to get a subject for the day 's cartoon and then take to the wood let I know what other picture you want and i 'll do 'em on the run i be a beast to work arthur weldon in he capacity as advertising manager write to all the national advertiser ask they patronage for the _ millville daily tribune _ the letter be typewrite by the office stenographer on newly print letterhead that fitzgerald the job printer have prepare some of the advertiser be interested enough in arthur 's novel proposition to reply with question as to the circulation of the new paper where it be distribute and the advertising rate the voting man answer frankly that they have 27 subscriber already and be go to distribute 400 free copy every day for a time as sample with the hope of increase the subscription list i be not sure you will derive any benefit at all from advertising in we paper he add but we would like to have you try it and you can pay we whatever you

venture along we square statement of fact have give we a good start he tell the girl i be really amaze at we success and it be up to you to make a paper that will circulate and make trade for these trustful advertiser with the local merchant the result be less satisfying bob west put in a card advertising he hardware business and nib corkin cautiously invest a half dollar to promote he drug

with a new coat of paint and elaborately strip sometimes it would be blue with yellow stripe then green with red stripe and anon a lovely pink decorate with purple one drawback to peggy 's delight in these transformation be the fact that it take the paint a night and a day to dry thoroughly and during this period of wait he would sit upon he porch with the wooden foot tenderly rest upon the rail -- a helpless prisoner some folk he would say likes pretty necktie a ' some wear fancy sock but fer my part i would ruther show a han ` some foot ner anything it do not cost as much as wearin ' sock a ' necktie a ' it be more artistic like hetty have catch the village character in the act of strip the wooden foot and he expression of intense interest in the operation be so original and the likeness so perfect from the string suspenders and flannel shirt to the antiquated straw hat and fade and patch overalls that no one would be likely to mistake the subject the sketch be entitle the village artist and patsy declare they would run it on a inside page just to make the millville people aware of the power of the press larry make a etching of it and mount the plate for a double column picture the original sketch patsy decide to have frame and to hang it in she office chapter viii the millville daily tribune the first edition of the _ millville daily tribune _ certainly prove it to be a wonderful newspaper the telegraphic news of the world 's doings receive and edit by the skillful miss brigg be equal to that of any metropolitan journal the first page cartoon refer to the outbreak of a rebellion in china be clever and humorous enough to delight anyone but the local news and literary page be woefully amateurish and smack of the schoolgirl editor who have prepare they perhaps the chazy county people do not recognize these deficiency for the new paper certainly create a vast amount of excitement and win the praise of nearly all who read it on the eventful night of the _ tribune 's _ first run we girl be too eager to go home and await its appearance so they remain at the office to see the birth of they enterprise and as it be the night precede the fourth of July uncle john give a exhibition of firework in front of the newspaper office to the delight of the entire population the girl journalist however be not so greatly interested in firework as in the birth of they fascinating enterprise wear long gingham apron they hover over the big table where the form be be lock up and watch anxiously every movement of the workman it be exceedingly interesting to note how a column of the first page be leave open until the last so that copy hot from the wire of the very latest news might be add before go to press finally at exactly two o'clock the form be lock place upon the bed of the press and mcgaffey a sour-faced individual whose chief recommendation be he ability as a pressman begin to make ready for the run outside the brilliantly light window which be leave open for air congregate a wonder group of the millville people many of whom have never be up so late before in all they life but the event be too important to miss the huge complicated press have already inspire they awe and they be eager to see it work as it print the new paper the girl tolerate this native curiosity with indulgent good humor and at midnight even pass out sandwich to the crowd a supply have be secure for the workman these be accept silently and as they munch the food all keep they eye fix upon the magician within there be a hitch somewhere mcgaffey muttered naughty word under he breath and ply wrench and screwdriver in a way that bring a thrill of anxiety approach fear to every heart the press start half a dozen time only to be shut down abruptly before it have print a single impression mcgaffey counsel with larry who shake he head fitzgerald the job printer examine the machinery carefully and again mcgaffey screw nut and regulate the press then he turn on the power the big cylinder revolve the white paper reel out like a long ribbon and with a rattle and thump the first copy of the _ millville daily tribune _ be deposit cut and fold upon the table place to receive it patsy make a rush for it but before she could reach the table half a dozen more papers have be pile above it and gather speed the great press hum busily and the pile of _ tribune _ grow as if by magic patsy grab the first dozen and hand they to beth for they be to be reserve as souvenir then run back to the table she seize a bunch and begin distribute they to the watcher outside the window the native accept they eagerly enough but could not withdraw they eye from the marvelous press which seem to possess intelligence almost human each of the three girl journalist now have a copy in hand scanning it with boundless pride and satisfaction it realize completely they fondest hope and they have good cause to rejoice then uncle john who ought to have be in bed and sound asleep at this uncanny hour of night come bounce in accompany by arthur weldon each make a dive for a paper and each face wear a expression of genuine delight the roar of the press make conversation difficult but mr merrick catch he niece in he arm by turn and give each one a ecstatic hug and kiss suddenly the press stop what be wrong mcgaffey demand patsy anxiously nothing miss edition off that be all what the entire four hundred be print four twenty-five i run a few extry and now a shriek of laughter come from the window as the villager slowly open the papers they hold come upon the caricature of peggy mcnutt the subject of the cartoon have with he usual aggressiveness secure the best standing room available and he contemplative protrude eye be yet fix upon the interior of the workroom but now he curiosity arouse he look at the paper to see what he neighbor be laugh at and he expression of wonder slowly change to a broad grin he straighten up look triumphantly around the circle and exclaim : by gum folk this ` ere paper 's go to be a go i do not take no stock in it till now but they fool gal seem to know they business a ' i 'll back 'em to the last ditch chapter ix trouble of course the girl exhaust they store of effusion on the first two or three papers a daily eat up copy very fast and the need to supply so much material begin to bewilder the bud journalist there be not sufficient local news to keep they go but fortunately the new york news service supply more general news than they could possibly use and besides mr marvin foresee this dilemma have send on several long stout box fill with plate matter which mean that a variety of story poem special article and paragraph of every sort have be make into stereotyped plate of column width which could be place anywhere in the paper where a space need to be fill this material have be prepare by skilled writer be of excellent character so that the paper gain in its class of contents as the girlish contribution begin to be replace by plate the niece do not abandon write however and all three work sedulously to prepare copy so that at least one column of the tribune each day be fill with note from they pen subscription come in freely during those first day for farmer and villager alike be proud of they local daily and the price be so low that no one begrudge the investment but uncle john well know that if every individual in the county subscribe and the advertising patronage double the income would fall far short of run expense Saturday night when the pay roll have to be meet the girl consult together seriously in spite of the new subscription receive a deficiency must be supply and they quietly advance the money from they private purse this be no great hardship for each have a ample allowance from uncle john as well as a income from property own in she own name it be only about thirty dollar apiece say patsy i guess we can stand that until -- until more money begin come in on Saturday evening there be a invasion of workman from royal many of whom we be rough foreigner who come to millville in search of excitement as a relief from they week 's confinement at the pine wood settlement at the mill skeelty who think he know how to manage these people allow every man at the close of work on Saturday to purchase a pint of whiskey from the company store charge a exorbitant price that net a huge profit there be no strong drink to be have at millville so the workman bring they bottle to town carousing on the way and think it amusing to frighten the simple inhabitant of the village by they rude shout and ribald song this annoyance have occur several time since the establishment of the mill and bob west have protest vigorously to mr skeelty for give he man whiskey and turn they loose in a respectable community but the manager merely grin and say he must keep the boy satisfy at all hazard and it be the business of the millville people to protect themselves if the workman become too boisterous on this Saturday evening the girl be stand on the sidewalk outside the printing office await the arrival of arthur with the surrey when a group of the royal workman appear in the dim light swaggering three abreast and indulge in offensive language uncle john 's niece withdraw to the protection of the doorway but a big bearded fellow in a red shirt discover they and lurch forward push he evil countenance in patsy 's face call to he fellow in harsh tone that he have find a partner for a dance a instant later he receive a swing blow above the ear that send he sprawl at full length upon the sidewalk and a quiet voice say : pardon I lady it seem necessary all three at once recognize the suppose tramp whom they have see the morning of they arrival but whom uncle john have report to be one of the bookkeeper at the paper mill the young fellow have no time to say more for the downfall of they comrade bring a shout of rage from the group of workman numbering nearly a dozen and with one accord they rush upon the man who have dare champion the defenseless girl beth manage to open the door of the office through which patsy and louise slip instantly but the younger girl always cool in emergency hold the door ajar while she cry to the young man : quick sir -- come inside really he have no time to obey just then with he back to the door he drive he fist at he assailant in a dogged persistent way that fell three more of they before the other draw away from he stalwart bow by that time larry and fitzgerald who have be summon by louise rush from the office arm with iron bar catch up at random both eager for a fight the workman see the reinforcement beat a retreat carry they sadly pommeled comrade with they but they insulting language be not restricted until they have pass out of hearing then the young man turn bow gravely to the girl who have now venture forth again and without wait to receive they thanks march calmly down the street when arthur reach home with the girl mr merrick be very indignant at he report of the adventure he denounce skeelty in unmeasured term and declare he would find a way to protect millville from further invasion by these rough and drunken workman there be no Sunday paper so the girlish editor find the morrow a veritable day of rest they all drive to hooker 's fall to church and return to find that old nora have prepare a fine chicken dinner for they patsy have invite hetty hewitt in whom she be now greatly interested to dine with they and to the astonishment of all the artist walk over to the farm array in a new gown have discard the disreputable costume in which she have formerly appear the new dress be not in the best of taste and its loud check make dainty louise shudder but somehow hetty seem far more feminine than before and she have moreover wash herself carefully and try to arrange she rebellious hair this place be do I good she confide to she girl employer after dinner when they be seat in a group upon the lawn i be get over my nervousness and although i have not drink a drop stronger than water since i arrive i feel a new sort of energy course through my vein also i eat like a trooper -- not at night as i use to but at regular mealtime and i be behave quite like a lady do you know i would not be surprise to find it just as amusing to be respectable as to -- to be -- the other thing you will find it far more satisfactory i be sure reply patsy encouragingly what most surprise I be that with you talent and education you ever get into such bad way environment say hetty that be what do it when i first go to new york i be very young a newspaper man take I out to dinner and ask I to have a cocktail i look around the table and see other girl drink cocktail so i take one that be where i turn into the rocky road people get careless around the newspaper office they work under a constant nervous strain and find that drink steady

year at one time she get the cocktail habit and a week or so ago i pay she fine for get pinch while intoxicated she be in rag and have not a red cent that set I think and when tommy fire I from he paper and say the best he could do be to get I a job in the country it seem as if my chance to turn over a new leaf have arrive i have turn it she add with a pathetic sigh but whether it 'll stay turn or not be a question for the puzzle page have not you a family to look after you -- or for you to look after ask beth no brother and i be leave orphan in a connecticut town and he go out west to chicago and promise to send for I must have forget that promise i guess for i have never hear of dan since i could draw picture so i go to new york and find a job guess that be my biography and it be not as interesting as one of hearst 's editorial either hetty seem pleased and grateful to note the frank friendliness of she girlish employer in whom she recognize the admirable quality she have personally sacrifice for a life of dissipation in the privacy of she room at the hotel she have read the first copy of the millville tribune and shriek with laughter at the ingenuous editorial and schoolgirl essay then she grow sober and thoughtful envy in she heart the sweetness and simplicity so apparent in every line here be girl who possess something infinitely higher than journalistic acumen they be true woman with genuine womanly quality and nature that betray they worth at a glance as do ingot of refined gold what would not this waif from the grim underworld of new york have give for such clear eye pure mind and unsullied heart i do not know as i can ever swim in they pond hetty reflect with honest regret but there be a chance i can look folk square in the eye again -- and that would not be so bad Monday morning when patsy louise and beth drive to they office miss brigg say nonchalantly : mcgaffey 's go go go where ask patsy back to new york catch a freight from the junction Saturday night be not he come back inquire beth here be a letter he leave say miss brigg they read it together it be very brief climate do not suit I no excitement i have quit mcgaffey i

the press i 'll find out say patsy march into the workroom neither fitz nor larry would undertake to run the press they say the machine be so complicated it require a expert and unless a experienced pressman could be secure the paper must suspend publication here be a unexpected dilemma one that for a time daze they these thing always happen in the newspaper business remark miss brigg when appeal to can not you telegraph to new york for another pressman yes but he can not get here in time say patsy there be no Monday train to chazy junction at all and it would be Wednesday morning before a man

paper never stop somehow or other it always keep go -- even if the world turn somersault and stand on its head you 'll find a way i be sure but the bewildered girl have no such confidence they drive

turn from the window to examine the young man with new interest be you injure he ask my right ankle be sprain and i have a cut under my left eye -- you can see the scar still you have no idea how you come there not the slightest i do not recognize the surrounding country i have no clear impression as to who i be there be a farmhouse a quarter of a mile away i limp to it and they give I some breakfast i find i be fifty-six mile from new york the farmer have hear of no accident there be no railway nearer than six mile the highway be little used i tell the good people my story and they suspect I of be drunk or crazy but do not credit a single word i say that be but natural say uncle john after breakfast i take stock of myself in my pocket i find a twenty-dollar bill and some silver i wear a watch and chain and a ring set with a good-sized diamond my clothing seem good but the ditch have soil it i have no hat nor could the farmer find one when i send he back to look for it my mind be not wholly a blank i seem to have a fair knowledge of life and when the farmer mention new york the city seem familiar to I but in regard to myself my past history -- even my name -- i be totally ignorant all personal consciousness date from the moment i wake up in the ditch how wonderful exclaimed louise and you have not solve the mystery yet after two year ask patsy no miss doyle i

to read all the newspaper seek to discover if anyone be report miss the sight of automobile lead I to conceive the theory that i have be ride in one of those machine along a country road when something throw I out my head might have strike a stump or stone and the blow render I insensible something in the nature of the thing or in my physical condition deprive I of all knowledge of the past since then i have read of several similar case the curious thing about my own experience be that i could find no reference to my disappearance in any way nor could i learn of any automobile accident that might account for it i walk the street day after day hope some acquaintance would accost I i wait patiently for some impulse to direct I to my former haunt i search the newspaper persistently for a clue but nothing reward I after spend all my money and the proceeds of my watch and diamond i begin to seek employment but no one would employ a man without recommendation or antecedent i do not know what work i be capable of do so finally i leave the city and for more than two year i have be wander from one part of the country to another hope that some day i would recognize a familiar spot i have do odd job at time but my fortune go from bad to worse until of late i have become no better than the typical tramp how do you secure employment as a book-keeper for skeelty ask uncle john i hear a new mill have start at royal and walk up there to inquire for work the manager ask if i could keep book and i say yes have you ever keep book before not that i know of but i do it very well i seem to comprehend the work at once and need no instruction often during these two year i have encounter similar curious condition i sell goods in a store and seem to know the stock i work two week in a telegraph office and discover i know the code perfectly i have shod horse for a country blacksmith wire a house for electric light and compound prescription in a drug store whatever i have undertake to do i seem able to accomplish and so it be hard for I to guess what profession i follow before my memory desert I you do not retain any position for long it seem remark uncle john no i be always impatient to move on always hope to arrive at some place so familiar that my lose memory would return to I the work i have mention be nearly all secure during the first year after i become seedy and disreputable in appearance people be more apt to suspect I and work be harder to obtain why do you come to millville ask louise you bring I here he answer with a smile i catch a ride on you private car when it leave new york not care much where it might take I when i wake up the next morning the car be sidetrack at chazy junction and as this be a section i have never before explore i decide to stay here for a time that be all of my story i believe quite remarkable declare mr merrick emphatically the girl too have be intensely interested in the strange recital you seem educate say patsy thoughtfully therefore you must have come from a good family that do not seem conclusive reply Thursday smith deprecatingly although i naturally hope my family be respectable i have be incline to resent the fact that none of my friend or relative have ever inquire what become of I be you sure they have not i have watch the papers carefully in two year i have follow several clue a bricklayer disappear but he drowned body be finally find a college professor be miss but he be sixty year of age a young man in new york embezzle a large sum and hide himself i follow that trail although regretfully but the real embezzler be catch the day i present myself in he place perhaps the most curious experience be in the case of a young husband who desert he wife and infant child she advertise for he he have disappear about the time i have find myself so i go to see she what be the result ask beth she say i be not she husband but if he fail to come back i might take he place provide i would guarantee to support she during the laugh that follow Thursday smith go back to he work and a animated discussion concern he strange story follow he seem honest say louise but i blame a man of he ability for become a mere tramp he ought to have assert himself and maintain the position in which he first find himself how inquire patsy at that time he be well dress and have a watch and diamond ring if he have go to some one and frankly tell he story he could surely have obtain a position to correspond with he personality but instead of this he waste he time and the little capital he possess in do nothing that be sensible it be easy for we to criticise the man remark beth and he may be sorry now that he do not act differently but i think in he place i should have make the same attempt he do to unravel the mystery of he lose identity so much depend upon that it be all very odd and incomprehensible say uncle john i wonder who he can be i suppose he call himself Thursday because that be the day he first find himself observe patsy yes and smith be the commonest name he could think of to go with it the most surprising thing add they uncle be the fact that a man of he standing be not miss or seek for perhaps suggest louise he have be insane and escape from some asylum then how do he come to be lie in a ditch question patsy and would not a escape maniac be promptly hunt down and capture i think so agreed mr merrick for my part i be inclined to accept the man 's theory that it be a automobile accident then what become of the car or of the other in it it be no use say beth shake she head gravely if Thursday smith who be a intelligent young man could not solve the mystery himself it be not likely we can do so we know as much as he do as far as that be concern say patsy and we combined intelligence ought at least to equal he i be sorry for the poor man and wish we might help he to come to he own again they all agree to this sentiment and while the girl attend to they editorial duty they have the amazing story of Thursday smith uppermost in they mind when the last copy have be place in the hand of miss brigg and they be drive to the farm -- at a little after six o'clock -- they renew the interesting discussion just before reach the farm hetty hewitt come out of the wood just in front of they she be clothe in she short skirt and leggings and bear a fishing rod and a creel what luck ask patsy stop the horse seven trout answer the artist i might have catch more but the poor little creature squirm and struggle so desperately that i have not the heart to destroy any more of they will not you take they home for mr merrick 's breakfast patsy look at the girl musingly jump in hetty she say i be go to take you with we for the night the day 's fishing have tire you there be deep circle under you eye and that stuffy old hotel be not home-like jump in hetty flush with pleasure but hesitate to accept the invitation i -- i be not dress for -- you be all right say beth support she cousin 's proposition we 'll lend you anything you need do come miss hewitt add louise hetty sigh then smile and finally climb into the surrey in new york she say as they start on i have sometimes hobnob with editor but this be somewhat different in what way ask patsy casually you be not real journalist you know and -- why be not we journalist ask louise for a moment hetty be puzzle how to reply you be do very good editorial work she say mendaciously but after all you be only play at journalism the real journalist -- as i know he -- be a bohemian a font of cleverness run to waste a reckless tender-hearted jolly careless ne'er - do-well who work like a trojan and play like a child he be very sophisticated at he desk and very artless when he dive into the underworld for rest and recreation he live at high tension scintillate burn he red fire without discrimination and be shortly extinguish you be not like that you can not even sympathize with that sort of person but i can for i be cut from a remnant of the same cloth scintillate all you want to hetty cry patsy with a laugh but you be not go to be extinguish for we the imitation journalist have take you under we wing there be no underworld at millville and the only excitement we can furnish just now be a night with we at the old farm that reply hetty be indeed a real excitement you can not quite understand it perhaps but it be so -- so very different from what i be accustomed to uncle john welcome the girl artist cordially and under he hospitable roof the waif soon feel at ease at dinner the conversation turn upon Thursday smith and he peculiar experience beth ask hetty if she know the man yes reply the girl i have see he at the office and we have exchange a word or two but he board with thorne the liveryman and not at the hotel you have never see he before you meet he here never i wonder say louise musingly if he be quite right in he mind all this story may be a hallucination you know he be a very clever fellow assert hetty and such a loss of memory be by no means so uncommon as you think we brain be queer thing -- mine be i know -- and it do not take much to throw they machinery out of gear once i know a reporter who be worried and over-worked he come to the office one morning and say he be george washington the commander of the continental army in all other way he be sane enough and we humor he and call he ` general ' at the end of three month the idea quit he as suddenly as it have come on and he be not only normal but greatly restore in strength of intellect through the experience perhaps some of the overworked brain cell have take a rest and renew they energy it would not surprise I if some day Thursday smith suddenly remember who he be -lrb- footnote : this anecdote be true -- _ author _ -rrb- in the meantime say uncle john i be go to make a effort to discover he identity in what way uncle ask patsy i 'll set fogerty who be a clever detective at work no man can disappear from he customary haunt without leave some sort of a record behind he and fogerty may be able to uncover the mystery in a short time then we 'll lose we pressman declare beth for i be positive that Thursday smith be a person of some importance in he past life chapter xi the honer ` ble ojoy boglin one morning while patsy be alone in she office busy over she work the door softly open and a curious look individual stand before she he be thin in form leathery skin and somewhat past the middle age of life he clothing consist of a rusty black prince albert coat rusty

diamond attach to a chain he have chin whisker of a sandy gray color and small gray eye that be both shrewd and suspicious in expression he stand in the doorway a moment attentively eye the girl while she in turn examine he with a amusement she could not quite suppress then he say speaking in a low diffident voice : i be lookin ' for the editor i be the editor assert patsy really it be quite true he seem disconcert a moment strive to regain he assurance then he take out a well-worn pocketbook and from its depths abstract a soil card which lean forward he place carefully upon the table before

be the same as a election so what i want be the nomination what do you say patsy glare at he and decide that as far as appearance go he be not a fit candidate for any office however humble but she answer diplomatically : i will inquire into the condition of politics in this district mr boglin and try to determine which candidate be the most deserving have reach a decision the _ millville tribune _ will espouse the cause of the best man -- if it mention local politics at all the hon ojoy give a dissatisfied grunt that mean in plain word he suggest that you 'll give kleppish a chance to

patsy quietly we be quite independent mr boglin and intend to remain so -- even if we can not make the paper pay in other word the _ millville daily tribune _ can not be buy he stare in amazement then scratch he ear with a puzzle air such talk as that mean somethin' he assert gropingly but what it mean blame if i know newspaper never turn money down unless they be a ` ready buy or have get a grouch of they own say he suddenly cry as a inspiration strike he you be not get anything agin the mill at royal or agin skeelty have you i have sir declare patsy raise she head to frown discouragingly upon

i will with this he nod cheerfully and go away chapter xii molly sizer 's party the people of chazy county be very proud of the _ millville tribune _ the only daily paper in that section of the state it be really a very good newspaper if small in size and related the news of the day as promptly as the great new york journal do arthur weldon have not be very enthusiastic about the paper at any time although he humor the girl by attend in a good-natured way to the advertising hire some of the country folk to get subscription and keep the book he be a young man of considerable education who have inherit a large fortune safely invest and therefore have no need through financial necessity to interest himself in business of any sort he allow the girl to print he name as editor in chief but he do no editorial work at all amusing himself these delightful summer day by wander in the wood where he collect botanical specimen or sit with uncle john on the lawn where they read together or play chess both the man be glad the girl be happy in they work and enthusiastic over the success of they audacious venture beth be develop decide talent as a writer of editorial and she article be even more thoughtful and dignified than be those of patsy the two girl find plenty to occupy they at the office while louise do the reportorial work and flit through millville and down to huntingdon each day in search of small item of local interest she grow fond of this work for it bring she close to the people and enable she to study they character and peculiarity she manner of approach the simple country folk be so gracious and win that they freely give she any information they possess and chat with she unreservedly sometimes louise would make she round alone but often arthur would join she for a afternoon drive to huntingdon and it greatly amuse he to listen to he girl-wife 's adroit manner of pump the native about halfway to huntingdon be the sizer farm the largest and most important in that vicinity old zeke sizer have a large family -- five boy and three girl -- and they be note as quite the most aggressive and disturbing element in the neighborhood old zeke be rude and coarse and swear like a trooper so he son could not be expect to excel he in refinement bill sizer the eldest be a hard drinker and people who know he assert that he never draw a sober breath the other son be all quarrelsome in disposition and many a free fight be indulge in among they whenever dispute arise they be industrious farmer though and the three girl and they mother work from morning till night so the farm prosper and the sizer be repute to be well-off molly the eldest girl have attract louise who declare she be pretty enough to arrest attention in any place indeed this girl be a rave beauty in she buxom countrify way and she good look be the pride of the sizer family and the admiration of the neighbor the other two be bounce merry girl rather coarse in manner as might be expect from they environment but molly perhaps fully conscious of she prettiness assume certain air and grace and a regal deportment that bring even she big brutal brother to she foot in adoration the sizer be among the first subscriber to the _ millville tribune _ and whenever louise stop at the farmhouse for news the family would crowd around she ignore all duty and volunteer whatever information they possess for when they read they own gossip in the local column it give they a sort of proprietary interest in the paper and bill have once thrash a young clerk at huntingdon for question the truth of a item the sizer have contribute one day when louise and arthur stop at the farm mollie run out with a eager face to say that Friday be she birthday and the sizer be to give a grand party to celebrate it we want you to come over a ' write it up mr weldon say the girl they be comin ' from twenty mile around fer the dance a ' we have get the orchestry from malvern to play for we pop 's goin ' to spend a lot of money on refreshment a ' it 'll be the biggest blow-out chazy county ever see i think i can write up the party without be present mollie suggest louise no you come over i read once in a novel how a editor come to a swell party a ' writ about all the dress a ' thing -- say what everybody wear you know i be goin ' to have a new dress a ' if ever ` thing 's describe right well we 'll buy a lot of papers to send to folk we know in connecticut well say louise with a sigh i 'll try to drive over for a little while it be to be Saturday you say yes the birthday 's Friday and the dance Saturday night rain or shine a ' you might bring the chief editor you husband a ' try a dance with we it would not hurt we reputation any to have you folk mingle with we on this festive occasion she add airily they have a good laugh over this invitation when it be report at mr merrick 's dinner table and patsy insist that louise must write up the party it will be fun to give it a ` double head ' and a big send-off she say write it up as if it be a real society event dear and exhaust you vocabulary on the gown you 'll have to invent some frenchy name to describe those i guess for they 'll be wonder and we 'll wind up with a list of ` those present ' so on Saturday evening arthur drive he wife over to the sizer farm and long before they reach there they hear the scrape of fiddle mingle with shout and boisterous laughter it be a prohibition district to be sure but old sizer have import from somewhere outside the dry zone a quantity of liquor more remarkable for strength than quality and with these the guest have be ply from the moment of they arrival most of they be wholly unused to such libation so by the time arthur and louise arrive the big living room of the farmhouse present a appearance of wild revelry that be quite deplorable molly welcome they with wild enthusiasm and big bill she adoring brother demand in a loud voice if arthur do not consider she the belle of chazy county they be not a stunner in the state as kin hold a candle to we molly he add and then with uncertain gait he leave the reporter with the promise to bring 'em a drink come louise say arthur quietly let 's get out of here he draw she to the door and as a dance be just start they manage to escape without notice what a disgraceful scene cry louise when they be on they way home and to think of such a shocking carousal be hold in good old chazy county where moral be usually irreproachable i shall not mention the affair in the _ tribune _ at all but patsy who have a managing editor 's respect for news of any sort combat this determination and beg louise to write up molly sizer 's party without refer to its deplorable feature it be not policy to offend the sizer she say for although they be coarse and common they have show a friendly spirit toward the paper moreover the enmity of such people -- which would surely result from we ignore the birthday party -- would keep we in hot water so louise though reluctantly write up the party and the manuscript be send over to miss brigg Sunday afternoon so it would get a place in Monday morning 's _ tribune _ uncle john have the paper at breakfast on Monday and he give a amuse laugh as he eye catch the report of the sizer party this be a good one on you louise he exclaim you say that miss molly ` look more lovely than ever in she handsome new gown greet she guest with a roughish smile ' a what demand louise horrify a ` roughish ' smile oh that be a mistake she say glancing at the item what i say be a ` roguish ' smile but there be be a typographical error which miss brigg must have overlook in read the proof nevertheless remark arthur the statement be not far wrong everything be rough include the smile as far as i note that remarkable gathering but -- see here cry patsy that be a dreadful mistake that spoil all the nice thing you say about the girl louise i hope the sizer will not notice it but the sizer do and be frantic with rage over what they deem be a deliberate insult to molly several young man who have come from distance to attend the birthday party have stay over Sunday at the farmhouse where the revelry still continue in a fitful way due to vain attempt to relieve rack headache by further libation Monday morning find the dissipate crew still the guest of the sizer and when big bill slowly spell out the assertion make by the _ tribune _ that he sister have a roughish smile loud cry of indignation arise molly first cry and then have hysteric and scream vigorously bill swear vengeance on the _ millville tribune _ and all connect with it while the guest gravely assert it be a low-down measly trick which the sizer ought to resent they all begin drink again to calm they feeling and after the midday dinner bill sizer grab a huge cowhide whip and start to millville to lick the editor to a standstill a wagonload of he guest accompany he and molly plead with she brother not to hurt mr weldon i will not but i 'll cowhide that fresh husband of hers declare bill he be the editor -- the paper say so -- and he be the one i be after chapter xiii bob west interfere it be unfortunate that at that time Thursday smith have go up the electric line toward royal to inspect it in the office be patsy hetty hewitt -- who be make a drawing -- arthur weldon engage upon he book and finally seat in a easy-chair from which he silently watch they work old bob west the hardware man louise and beth have drive over to the junction to write up a accident one of the trainman have catch he hand in a coupling between two freight car bob west often drop into the office which be next door to he own place of business but he be a silent man and have little to say on these visit in he early day he have wander pretty much over the whole world and he could relate some interesting personal adventure if he choose in this retired village west be the one inhabitant distinguish above he fellow for he knowledge of the world in he room over the store where few be ever invite he have a fine library of unusual book and a rare collection of curio gather from foreign land it be natural that such a man would be interested in so unique a experiment as the _ millville tribune _ and he watch its conduct with curiosity but a constantly grow respect for the three girl journalist no one ever mind when he come into the office nod and sit down sometimes he would converse with much freedom at other time the old gentleman remain a hour without offer a remark and go away with a brief parting nod it be west who first see through the window the wagonload of man from the sizer farm come dash up the street at a gallop instinctively perhaps he know trouble be brewing but he never alter he expression or he attitude even when the wagon stop at the printing office and the passenger leap out in march bill sizer at the head of he follow cowhide in hand patsy she face flush scarlet stand up and face the intruder stand back girl cry sizer in a fierce tone it be that coward editor i be after point he whip with tremble hand at arthur my sister molly may be rough a ' hev a rough smile but i 'll be ding ef i do not skin the man thet print it in a paper good fer you bill murmur he friend approvingly arthur lean back and regard he accuser in wonder the big table litter with papers be between they come out o ' there ye measly city chap a ' take yer medicine roar bill swing he whip i 'll larn ye to come inter a decent neighborhood a ' slander its woman come outer there west have sit quietly observe the scene now he inquire in compose tone : what be the trouble bill trouble trouble west why this lyin ' scroundrel say in he paper thet we molly have a rough smile that be the trouble do he really say that ask west ` course he do print it in the paper for all to read that be why i have come to cowhide the critter within a inch o ' he life good fer you bill cry he friend encouragingly but -- wait a moment command west as the maddened half drunken young farmer be about to leap over the table to grasp he victim you be not go at this thing right bill sizer why be not i bob west because answer west in calm even tone this insult be too great to be avenge by a mere cowhiding nothing but blood will wipe away the dreadful stain on you sister 's character oh mr west cry patsy horrify by such a statement eh blood say bill stupefy by the suggestion of course return west you must not thrash mr weldon you must kill he a delighted chorus of approval come from sizer 's supporter all right then say the bully glare around i -- i 'll kill the scandler hold on counsel west seize he arm this affair must be conduct properly -- otherwise the law might cause we trouble no murder mind you you must kill weldon in a duel a -- a what a duel gasp sizer to be sure that be the way to be revenge hetty he add turn to the artist who alone of the observer have smile instead of groan at the old gentleman 's startling suggestion will you kindly run up to my room and get a red leather case that lie under the shell cabinet thank you my dear hetty be off like a flash during she absence a intense silence pervade the office break only by a occasional hiccough from one of mr sizer 's guest patsy be paralyze with horror and have fall back into she chair to glare alternately at bob west and the big bully who threaten she cousin 's husband arthur be pale and stern as he fix a reproachful gaze on the hardware merchant from miss brigg ' little room could be hear the steady click-click of the telegraph instrument but the furious arrival of the sizer party have arouse every inhabitant of millville and with one accord they drop work and rush to the printing office by this time the window be dark with group of eager face that peer wonderingly through the screen -- the sash be up -- and listen to the conversation within while hetty be go not a word be speak but the artist be absent only a brief time presently she reenter and lay the red leather case on the table before bob west the hardware man at once open it display a pair of old-fashioned dueling pistol with long barrel and pearl handle there be a small can of powder some bullet and wad in the case and as west take up one of the pistol and proceed to load it he say in a unconcerned voice : i once get these from a officer in vienna and they have be use in more than a score of duel i be tell one of the pistol -- i can not tell which it be -- have kill a dozen man so you be go to fight with famous weapon both arthur and bill sizer as well as the group at the window watch the loading of the pistol with fascinate gaze bob 's a queer ol' feller whisper peggy mcnutt to the blacksmith who stand beside he this dool be just one o ' he odd fancy much he keer ef they kill each other er not mr west cry patsy suddenly rouse from she apathy i 'll not allow this shameful thing a duel be no better than murder and i be sure there be a law against it true return west ram the bullet into the second pistol it be quite irregular and -- er -- illegal i believe perhaps i shall go to jail with whichever of the duelist survive but you see it be a point of honor with we all molly sizer have seemingly be grossly malign in you paper and the editor be responsible be you a good shot bill i -- i guess so stammer sizer that be good weldon i hear be a expert with the pistol arthur do not contradict this statement although he be positive he could not hit a barn at twenty yard now then be we ready staid west rise come with I gentleman what ye goin ' to do bob ask sizer anxiously i 'll explain reply the hardware man lead the way to the street everyone follow he and the crowd at the window join the group outside of course you must not shoot in the main street for you might hit some one or break window but back of this row of building be a lane that be perfectly clear you will stand back to back in the center of the block and then at my word you will each march to the end of the block and pass around the building to the lane as soon as you come in sight of one another you be privileged to fire and i suppose bill sizer will try to kill you mr weldon on the spot and therefore you will try to kill he first but -- look a-here bob cry sizer it be not right fer he to take a shot at I you say fer I to kill he but ye do not say nuth 'n about _ he _ shootin ' at _ I _ that be all right bill return west you be in the right and the right ought to win but you must give the man a chance for he life you know that be not in the bargain it be now by the law of duel he -- he might shoot I urge bill it be not likely although he be a dead shot you have right on you side and you must be sure to fire as soon as you get within good range it will not be consider murder it will only be a duel and the law will deal lightly with you that be right bill assert one of sizer 's friend bob west 's a justice o ' the peace himself a ' he orter know i do know declare west gravely he place arthur weldon and bill sizer back to back in the middle of the street and hand each a pistol now then say he you both understand the rule which i have explain and the spectator will bear witness that whatever happen this affair have be conduct in a regular manner with no favor show to either you be both brave man and this duel will vindicate you honor if you be fortunate enough to survive you will be hero and all you difference will be wipe off the slate but as one or both may fall we the citizen of millville hereby bid you a solemn and sad farewell impress by this speech sizer 's friend begin to shake hand with he all ready call west one -- two -- three -- go at the word the two back to back start for the opposite end of the little street and at once the crowd make a rush between the building to gain the rear where they might witness the shooting in the lane when the duelist meet arthur have be think seriously during these proceedings and have make up he mind it be in no degree he duty to be bore full of hole by a drunken countryman like bill sizer just because there have be a typographical error in the _ millville tribune _ so when he get to the end of the street instead of turn into the lane he make for the farm hold the long dueling pistol gingerly in he hand and trot at a good pace for home footstep follow he in sudden panic he increase he run but the other be faster a heavy hand grasp he shoulder and swing he around while old bob west panting for breath exclaim : stop you fool -- stop the other one be run the other one echo arthur wonderingly of course bill sizer be sure to run he be a coward as all bully be quick weldon save the day and you reputation or i 'll never stand you friend again arthur understand now he turn and run back faster than he have come swing into the lane where the crowd be cautiously peer from the shelter of the building and wave he pistol in a reckless way that make bob west shudder he cry out : where be he where 's sizer why do not he show up and be shoot like a man no sizer appear he be even then head cross-lot for home leave he friend to bemoan he cowardice as for arthur the crowd give he a cheer and condemn he opponent 's conduct in no measure term they be terribly disappoint by big bill 's defection for while not especially bloodthirsty they hate to see the impending tragedy turn out a farce in the printing office patsy be laugh hysterically as she horror dissolve and allow she to discover the comic phase of the duel she literally fall on arthur 's neck as he enter but the next moment push he away to face the hardware merchant i beg you pardon mr west say she with twinkle eye i suspect you of be a cold-blooded ruffian when you propose this duel but i now see that you understand human nature better than the whole caboodle of we put together arthur thank mr west for save you from a flogging i do indeed say arthur fervently chapter xiv the danger signal by this time the _ tribune _ have become the pride of all millville yet the villager could not quite overcome they awe and wonder at it also the newspaper be the pride of the three girl journalist who under the tutelage of miss brigg be learn to understand the complicated system of a daily journal they amateurish effort be gradually give way to more dignified and readable article beth could write a editorial that interested even uncle john she severest critic louise show exceptional talent for pick up local happening and make news note of they while patsy grab everything that come to she net -- local editorial telegraphic and telephone report from all part of the world -- and skillfully sort edit and arrange they for the various department of the paper it be mighty interesting to they all and they be so eager each morning to get to work that they could scarcely devote the proper time to old nora 's famous breakfast we make a mistake uncle say patsy to mr merrick in start the _ tribune _ in the wrong place in a few week we must leave it and go back to the city whereas have we establish we paper in new york -- then it never would have be hear of interrupted practical beth in new york patsy dear we would become the laugh stock of the town i shudder when i think what a countrified paper we turn out that first issue but we be fast become educate declare patsy i be not ashamed of the _ tribune _ now even in comparison with the best new york daily beth laugh but uncle john say judicially : for millville it be certainly a marvel i get the world news more concisely and more pleasantly from its four page than when i wade through twenty or thirty of the big page of a metropolitan newspaper you be do famously my dear i congratulate you but we be run behind dreadfully suggest arthur the bookkeeper even since Thursday smith enable we to cut down expense so greatly the money that come in never equal what we pay out how long can you keep this up girl they make no reply nor do uncle john discuss the financial condition of the newspaper he be himself pay some heavy expense that do not appear on the book such as the associated press franchise the telegraph bill and the electric power but he be quite delighted to take care of these item and regret he have not assume more of the paper 's obligation he know the expense be eat big hole in the income of he three niece yet they never complain nor allow they enthusiasm to flag mr merrick who have test these girl in more way than one be watch they carefully and fully approve they spirit and courage under such try condition major doyle patsy 's father when the first copy of the _ millville tribune _ be lay on he desk in the city be astounded at the audacity of this rash venture when he could command he temper to write calmly he send a letter to mr merrick which read : take altogether john you be the craziest bunch of irresponsible outside a asylum no wonder you keep this folly a secret from I until you have accomplish you nefarious design the _ millville daily tribune _ be a corker and no mistake for we patsy 's at the head of you lunatic gang i 'll go farther and say the paper 's a wonder i believe it be the first daily newspaper publish in a town of six inhabitant that have ever carry the associated press dispatch but allow I to ask why the lonely inhabitant of the desert of chazy county do not need a daily -- or a weekly -- or a monthly a semi-annual would about hit they gait and be more than they deserve so i have decide it be merely a silly way to spend money -- and a easy way too i 'll be bind oblige I by explain this incomprehensible eccentricity to this a mild protest for the major uncle john reply : dear major doyle : yours receive have you no business of you own to attend to affectionately yours john merrick the major take the hint he make no further complaint but read the paper religiously every day gloat over patsy 's name as manage editor and preserve the file with great care he really enjoy the _ millville tribune _ and as he summer vacation be shortly due he anticipate with pleasure a visit to the farm and a peep at the workings of we patsy 's famous newspaper the other girl he ignore if patsy be connect with the thing she adoring parent be quite sure she be responsible for all the good there be in it the paper print no mention of the famous duel but hetty make a cartoon of it show the lane with its fringe of spectator arthur weldon standing manfully to await he antagonist and big bill sizer in the distance sprint across the field in the direction of home this cartoon be highly prize by those who have witness the adventure and peggy mcnutt pin it on the wall of he real estate office beside the one hetty have make of himself bill sizer promptly stop the paper that be the only vengeance at hand and when bob west send a boy to he demand the return of the pistol bill dispatch with the weapon the follow characteristic note which he have pen with much labor : bob west sir you beet I out uv my reeveng and make I look like a bag uv been but i will skware this thing sum da and yu and that edyter hed better watch out i do not stand fer no throwdown like that wm sizer however the bully receive scant sympathy even from he most intimate friend and he prestige in the community be henceforth destroy arthur do not crow for he part he tell the girl frankly of he attempt to run away and evade the meeting which sensible intention be only frustrate by bob west 's interference and they all agree he be thoroughly justified the young man have prove to they he courage year before and none of the girl be dispose to accuse he of cowardice for not wish to shoot or be shoot by such a person as bill sizer a few day follow the duel another incident occur which be of a nature so startling that it drive the sizer comedy from all mind this time Thursday smith be the hero hetty hewitt it seem be have a desperate struggle to quell the longing of she heart for the allurement of the great city she have be for year a thorough bohemienne frequent cafe theater and dance hall smoking and drinking with man and woman of she class and by degree lose every womanly quality with which nature have generously endowed she but the girl be not really bad she be essentially nervous and crave excitement so she have drift into this sort of life because no counteract influence of good have be inject into she pliable disposition none that be until the friendly editor for whom she work anticipate she final downfall have seek to save she by send she to a country newspaper he talk to the girl artist very frankly before she leave for millville and hetty know he be right and be truly grateful for the opportunity to redeem herself the sweet girl journalist with whom she be throw in contact be so different from any young woman she have heretofore know and prove so kindly sympathetic that hetty speedily become ashamed of she waste life and form a brave resolution to merit the friendship so generously extend she but it be hard work at first she could get through the day easily enough by wander in the wood and take long walk along the rugged country road but in the evening come the insistent call of the cafe the cheap orchestra vaudeville midnight supper and the like she strenuously fight this yearning and find it be grow less and less powerful to influence she but she night be yet restless and she nerve throb from the effect of past dissipation often she would find herself unable to sleep and would go out into the moonlight when all other be in bed and prowl around with the cat as she express it until the wee hour of morning often she tell patsy she wish there be more work she could do the drawing require by the paper never occupy she more than a couple of hour each day sometimes she make one of she cleverest cartoon in fifteen or twenty minute can not i do something else she beg let I set type or run the ticker -- i can receive telegram fairly well -- or even write a column of local comment i be no journalist so you 'll not be envious but patsy shake she head really hetty there be nothing else you can do and you picture be very important to we rest and enjoy yourself and get strong and well you be improve wonderfully in health since you come here often at midnight hetty would wander into the pressroom and watch Thursday smith run off the edition on the wonderful press which seem to possess a intelligence of its own so perfectly do it perform its function at such time she sit listlessly by and say little for Thursday be no voluble talker especially when busy over he press but a certain spirit of comradeship grow up between these two and it be not unusual for the pressman after he work be finish and the papers be neatly pile for distribution to the carrier at daybreak to walk with hetty to the hotel before proceed to he own lodgings in the little wing of nick thorne 's house which stand quite at the end of the street to be sure the hotel adjoin the printing office with only a vacant lot between but hetty seem to appreciate this courtesy and would exchange a brief good night with smith before go to she own room afterward she not infrequently steal out again because sleep would not come to she and then the moon watch she wanderings until it dip behind the hill on the night we speak of hetty have part from Thursday smith at one o'clock and creep into the hallway of the silent barnlike hotel but as soon as the man turn away she issue forth again and walk up the empty street like a shadow almost to thompson 's cross she stroll deep in thought and then turn and retrace she step but when she again reach the hotel she be wide-eyed as ever so she pass the building think she would go on to little bill creek and sit by the old mill for a time the girl be just opposite the printing office when she attention be attract by a queer grate noise as if one of the window be be pry up she stop short a moment and then creep closer to the building two man be at a side window of the pressroom which they have just succeed in open as hetty gain she point of observation one of the man slip inside but a moment later hastily reappear and join he fellow at once both turn and steal along the side of the shed directly toward the place where the girl stand she first impulse be to run but recollect that she wear a dark gown and stand in deep shadow she merely flatten herself against the building and remain motionless the man be chuckle as they pass she and she recognize they as mill hand from royal guess that 'll do the job say one in a low tone if it do not nothin ' will be the reply they be go then steal across the road and beat a hasty retreat under the shadow of the house hetty stand motionless a moment wonder what to do then with sudden resolve she run to thorne 's house and rap sharply at the window of the wing where she know Thursday smith sleep she hear he leap from bed and open the blind what be it he ask it be I Thursday -- hetty she say two man have just break into the pressroom through a window they be man from royal and they do not steal anything but run away in great haste i -- i be afraid something be wrong Thursday even while she speak he be rapidly dress wait he call to she in a few moment he open the door and join she without hesitation he begin walk rapidly toward the office and the girl keep step with he he ask no question whatever but we soon as she have lead he to the open window he leap through it and switch on a electric light a instant later he cry aloud in a voice of fear : get out hetty run -- for you life run yourself Thursday if there be danger she coolly return but he shout run -- run -- run in such thrilling compelling tone that the girl shrink away and dash across the vacant lot to the hotel before she turn again in time to see smith leap from the window and make a dash toward the rear he be carry something -- something extend at arm ' length before he -- and he cross the lane and run far into the field before stoop to set down he burden now he be race back again run as madly as if a troop of demon be after he a flash cleft the darkness a deep detonation thunder and echo against the hill the building against which hetty lean shake as if a earthquake have seize it and Thursday smith be throw flat on he face and roll almost to the terrify girl 's foot where he lay motionless only the building save she from pitch headlong too but as the reverberation die away to be follow by frantic scream from the rudely waken population of millville hetty sink upon she knee and turn the man over so that he lay face up he open he eye and put up one hand then he struggle to he foot tremble weakly and he white face smile into the girl 's anxious one that be a close call dear he whisper but you timely discovery save we from a terrible calamity i -- i do not believe there be much harm do as it be hetty make no reply she be think of the moment he have hold that deadly thing in he hand while he strive to save life and property from destruction the inevitable crowd be gather now demand in terrify tone what have happen man woman and child pour from the house in scant attire all unnerved and fearful cry for a explanation of the explosion keep mum hetty say smith warningly it will do no good to tell they the truth she nod realize it be best the villager do not suspect that a enemy of the newspaper have place they all in dire peril dynamite she ask in a whisper yes a bomb but for heaven 's sake do not mention it suddenly a man with a lantern discover a great pit in the field behind the lane and the crowd quickly surround it from they limited knowledge of the fact the explosion seem unaccountable but there be sufficient intelligence among they to determine that dynamite have cause it and dig this gaping hole in the stony soil bob west glance at the printing office which be directly in line with the explosion then he cast a shrewd look into the white face of Thursday smith but the old hardware merchant merely mutter under he breath something about ojoy boglin and shake he head determinedly when question by he fellow villager interest presently center in the damage that have be do many window pane be shatter and the kitchen chimney of the hotel have topple over but no person have be injure and the damage could easily be repair while the excitement be at its height Thursday smith return to he room and go to bed but long after the villager have calm down sufficiently to seek they home hetty hewitt sit alone by the great pit stare reflectively into its ragged depths quaint and curious be the thought that puzzle the solitary girl 's weary brain but prominent and ever-recurring be the sentence that have tremble upon Thursday smith 's lip : it be a close call _ dear _ the close call do not worry hetty a particle it be the last word of the sentence that amaze she that and a new and wonderful respect for the manliness of Thursday smith fill she heart to overflow chapter xv a clever idea neither Thursday nor hetty allow a word to escape concern the placing of the bomb in the _ tribune _ office but the explosion be public knowledge and many be bother they head to explain its meaning john merrick when he hear the news look very grave and glance uneasily into the unconscious face of he three beloved niece a man of much worldly experience in spite of he simple ingenuous nature the little man begin carefully piece together part of the puzzle Thursday smith 's defense of the girl journalist whereby he have severely pound some of the workman who have insult they have cause the man to be denounce by the colony at royal mr skeelty the manager have demand that smith be discharge by mr mirrick and be refuse have threaten to shut off the power from the newspaper plant skeelty dare not carry out this threat for fear of a lawsuit but he man who have urge the matter of smith 's discharge upon they manager be of the class that seek revenge at any cost at this juncture ojoy boglin skeelty 's partner and the owner of all the pine forest around royal have become the enemy of the newspaper and be aware of the feeling among the workman a word from boglin back by skeelty 's tacit consent would induce the man to go to any length in injure the _ millville tribune _ and all concern in its welfare consider these fact mr merrick shrewdly suspect that the dynamite explosion have be the work of the mill hand yet why it be harmlessly explode in a field be a factor that puzzle he exceedingly he conclude from what information he possess that they have merely intend this as a warning which if disregard might be follow by a more serious catastrophe the idea that such a danger threaten he niece make the old gentleman distinctly nervous there be way to evade further molestation from the lawless element at the mill the hon ojoy could be conciliate Thursday smith discharge or the girl could abandon they journalistic enterprise altogether such alternative be mortify to consider but he girl must be protect from harm at any cost while he be still consider the problem the girl and arthur have drive to the office as usual joe wegg ride over from thompson 's cross on he sorrel mare for a chat with he old friend and benefactor it be this same young man -- still a boy in year -- who have once own the wegg farm and disposed of it to mr merrick joe be something of a mechanical genius and when he father die long to make he way in the great world but after many vicissitude and failure he return to chazy county to marry ethel thompson he boyhood sweetheart and to find that one of he father 's apparently foolish investment have make he rich ethel be the great-granddaughter of the pioneer settler of chazy county -- little bill thompson -- from whom the little bill creek and little bill mountain have be name it be he who first establish the mill at millville so in marry a descendant of little bill thompson joe wegg have become quite the most important resident of chazy county and the young man be popular and well like by all who know he after the first interchange of greeting joe question mr merrick about the explosion of the night before and uncle john frankly state he suspicion i be sorry say joe they ever start that mill at royal fall most of the workman be foreigner and all of they rude and reckless they have cause we quiet law-abiding people no end of trouble and anxiety already it be become a habit with they to haunt millville on Saturday night when they be partly intoxicate and they have even invade some of the farmhouse and frighten the woman and child i have talk to bob west about it and he have promise to swear in lon taft and seth davi as special constable to preserve order but he admit we be quite helpless to oppose such a gang of rowdy i have also be to see mr skeelty to ask he to keep he man at home but he answer gruffly that he have no authority over he employee except during work hour and not much authority even then skeelty do not seem the right man to handle those fellow observe mr merrick thoughtfully but as he own the control interest in he company and boglin be fully as unreasonable we can not possibly oust he from control if the man determine to blow up all millville with dynamite i be sure skeelty would not lift a finger to prevent it no he be deathly afraid of they and that be a fact say joe they sit in silence a while you report of skeelty 's threat to cut off you electric power say young wegg remind I of a plan i have have in mind for some time i find i have too much time on my hand mr merrick and i can not be thoroughly happy unless i be occupied ethel 's farm be let on share and i be a drone in the world 's busy hive but we be anchor here at millville so i have be wonder what i could do to improve the place and keep myself busy it have seem to I that the same rush of water in little bill creek that run the dynamo at royal be in evidence -- to a lesser extent -- at the old milldam what would you think of my put in a electric plant at the mill and lighting both millville and huntingdon as well as all the farmhouse not a bad idea joe say uncle john approvingly electric light have a civilizing influence continue the young man i be quite sure all the farmer between here and huntingdon would use they at a reasonable price i can also run a line to hooker 's fall and one to chazy junction plenty of pole can be cut from we pine forest and the wire will be the chief expense i may not make money at first but i 'll play pretty nearly even and have something to do do you think you could furnish enough power for we printing office ask mr merrick yes and a dozen factory besides i have a idea the thing may bring factory to millville then get at it joe and build it quick i have a notion we shall have a open rupture with skeelty before long joe wegg smile you be go to accuse I sir of ask advice after i have make up my mind say he but the fact be i have buy the mill of sila caldwell already he be be want to dispose of the property for some time good exclaimed uncle john also i -- i have order a dynamo and machinery it all ought to be here in a few day better yet cry mr merrick you have relieve my mind of a great weight joe now about Thursday smith say the young man do not you think it would be policy for you to let he go mr merrick no he be a clever fellow i can use he at my lighting plant thank you joe but that would not help any as long as he be in millville he will be a object of vengeance to those anarchistic mill hand the only way to satisfy they in to drive smith out of town and -- i 'll be hang if i 'll do it he have not do anything wrong and i be interested in the fellow 's curious history i have put he case in the hand of a famous new york detective -- fogerty -- with instruction to discover who he be and i can not let a lot of rowdy force I to abandon the man for no reasonable cause do not blame you sir say joe if it be not this Thursday smith some other would incur the hatred of the royal workman and as they be dispose to terrorize we we may as well fight it out on this line as any other the whole county will stand by you sir the only thing i dread be possible danger to my girl keep 'em away from the office evening advise joe during the day they be perfectly safe if anything happen it will be at night and while the newspaper office may some time go fly skyward the girl will run no personal danger whatever maybe so joe how queer it be that such a condition should exist in millville -- a little forget spot in the very heart of civilization and the last place where one might expect excitement of this sort but i will not be cow i will not be drive or bully by a pack of foreign hound i assure you if skeelty can not discipline he man i will in furtherance of which assertion mr merrick go to town and wire a message to the great fogerty chapter xvi local contribution we hear considerable of the conventional people of this world but seldom meet with they for as soon as we begin to know a person we discover peculiarity that quite remove he from the rank of the conventional -- if such rank exist at all the remark of the old scotch divine to he good wife : everybody 's queer but thee and I nancy and sometimes i think _ thee _ a little queer sum up human nature admirably we seldom recognize we own queerness but be prone to mark the erratic temperament of other and this be rather more comfortable than to be annoy by a consciousness of we personal deficit the inhabitant of a country town be so limited in they experience that we generally find they personal characteristic very amusing no amount of scholastic learning could have render the millville people sophisticated for contact with the world and humanity be the only true educator but as a matter of fact there be little scholastic learning among they with one or two exception and the villager as a rule be of limited intelligence every one be really a character and uncle john 's niece who all possess a keen sense of humor enjoy the oddity of the millvillite immensely a humorous situation occur through a seemingly innocent editorial of beth on authorship in the course of she remark she say : a prominent author be state to have accumulate a large fortune by write short story for the newspaper and magazine he be say to receive ten cent a word and this unusual price be warrant by the eager demand for he story of which the read public be very fond however the unknown author do not fare so badly the sum of from thirty to fifty dollar

while in silence mr merrick must have send for they he suggest yes i think he suspect about the bomb he ought to discharge I say Thursday no he be man enough to stand by he gun i like mr merrick he do not become a millionaire without have cleverness to back he and i imagine he be clever enough to thwart skeelty and all he gang perhaps i ought to go of my own accord say Thursday do not do that when you have find a friend like mr merrick stick to he i imagine those detective be here to protect you as well as the printing plant it will not be so easy to set a bomb the next time smith look at she with a smile there be a glint of admiration in he eye you be not a bad sleuth yourself hetty he remark no detective could have act more wisely and promptly than you do that night it be a accidental discovery Thursday sometimes i sleep that be a good deal of conversation for these two to indulge in hetty be talkative enough at time and so be Thursday smith when the humor seize he but when they be together they say very little the artist would stroll into the pressroom after the compositor have finish they task and watch the man make up the form lock they place they on the press and run off the edition then he would glance over the paper while Thursday wash up and put on he coat after which he accompany she to the door of she hotel and with a simple good night proceed up the street to he own lodging there be surprise in the newspaper business as we girl journalist be fast discover it be a real calamity when miss brigg who have be primarily responsible for get the _ millville daily tribune _ into proper work order suddenly resign she position they have depend a great deal on miss brigg so when the telegraph editor inform they she be go back to new york they be positively bewilder by she loss question elicit the fact that the woman be nervous over the recent explosion and look for further trouble from the mill hand she also suspect the two recent arrival to be detective and the town be so small and so absolutely without police protection that she would not risk she personal safety by remain longer in it perhaps i be homesick she add it be dreadfully lonely here when i be not at work and for that reason i have try to keep busy most of the time really i be astonished to think i have stand this isolation so long but now that my mind be make up i be go and it be useless to ask I to remain they offer she higher wages and mr merrick himself have a long talk with she but all argument be unavail what shall we do Thursday ask patsy in despair none of we understand telegraphy hetty hewitt do he suggest hetty i be afraid if i ask she to assume this work she also would leave we no she 'll stay he say positively but she can not edit the telegraph news suppose she take the message who would get the night news in shape for the compositor my uncle would not like to have I remain here until midnight but even if he would permit it i have not yet master the art of condense the dispatch and select just such item as be suitable for the _ tribune _ i 'll do that miss doyle promise smith i have be pay especial attention to the work of miss brigg for i have a idea she be get uneasy and i can take all the day message too if hetty will look after the wire evening i can do the rest of the telegraph editor 's work and my own too good gracious Thursday exclaim patsy you 'll be run the whole paper presently no i can not do the typesetting but if the dwyer girl stick to they job -- and they seem quite contented here -- i 'll answer for the rest of the outfit i be glad the

he versatile daughter be the most unreliable of any class in the world so i have often be tell and i believe it they come and go by fit and start and it be a wonder the erratic rascal never put a paper out of business but they do not you never hear of a newspaper that fail to appear just because the mechanical force desert and leave it in the lurch by hook or crook the paper must be print -- and it always be so do not worry mavourneen when you sallow-faced artist and you hobo jack-of-all-trade desert you there 'll still be a way to keep the _ millville tribune _ go and therefore the world

minute those fellow will cut it again the town 's full of the rascal and they be not exactly sober either watch the wire that be the idea say uncle john it be only a short distance to the mill and i be sure the villager will volunteer for this duty of course say joe major doyle will you mount guard over my man at the dynamo to see they be not interfere with while i look after the wire sure enough

pocket and lay it on the table i be afraid there may be a attack on this office in a few minute for i understand the language of those striker and have be listen to they if any of the mill hand attempt to break into this room do not be afraid to shoot why should the man wish to attack we sir ask patsy wonderingly there be several reason they be after smith for one thing they have a old grudge against he to settle aside from the mere matter of revenge i overheard one of they tell he friend to smash the press and keep the paper from come out and mr boglin would pay they well for the job smith carelessly thrust the revolver into he hip pocket the paper will come out if mr wegg give we the power he say can you let I have a revolver mr west ask hetty could you use it i think so he look at she a moment and then take a second revolver from he pocket i have rob my hardware stock he say with a smile but i advise you girl to keep you hand off the thing unless a crisis arise i do not imagine the gang will get past I and booth at the entrance but if any straggler come you way smith have authority to drive they back i be justice of the peace and i hereby appoint you all special officer of the law he say this lightly fear to alarm the girl unnecessarily and then pass through the doorway and join booth at the front the telephone ring and patsy answer it how soon will the form be ready ask arthur 's voice in ten minute -- perhaps five she answer we 'll have the power on in ten minute more tell smith not to lose a instant 's time in run off the edition for we do not know how

the heavy iron frame fill with type and slide they onto the bed of the press they give he all the light the flicker candle afford as he adjust the machinery and all be bend over the press when a low distant growl be hear rise slowly to a frenzied shout a revolver pop -- another -- follow by wild cry from the street the girl grow a little pale but Thursday smith put he hand on the lever of the press and say : all right the moment they give we the current we be ready to run patsy straighten up with a sigh of relief then give a low cry as the screen of the two window of the pressroom be smash in and through the opening man begin to tumble into the room at once hetty confront they with level revolver and the sight cause they to hesitate out o ' the way you woman call a burly fellow who wear a green sweater and a oilskin hat we do not want to hurt you if we can help there be the one we be after he point a finger at Thursday smith you can not have he retort beth half shield behind the militant hetty this be private property and you be trespassing unless you go away at once you will suffer the consequence this defense seem to surprise they for they fall back a little toward the window at that moment with a low rumble the press start move slowly at first but gradually acquire speed the sight arouse the resentment of the invader stop that press yell they spokesman excitedly stop it smith or we 'll put both you and the machine out of business Thursday pay no attention to anything but he press the huge cylinder of white paper be unroll pass under the platen and emerge at the other end as neatly fold copy of the millville daily tribune with a roar of rage the big fellow leap forward but at the action a shot ring out and he fall headlong almost at the foot of the press beth and patsy turn they head a instant to glance at hetty the artist 's face be white and set she eye sparkle brilliantly she hold the still smoking weapon in readiness for another shot but the man be awed by the fall of they leader they watch beth leap to the platform beside Thursday smith and draw he revolver from he pocket where he have place it hetty 's courage have inspire she and beth have handle pistol before the man read the determine eye fix upon they they note smith 's indifference to they threat the defender of the press and pressman be only girl but they be girl evidently not afraid to shoot no advance be make and the tableau be dramatic smith watch he press with undivided attention and it clatter away at full speed until the frail building shake with its powerful steady motion then suddenly it begin to slow down the power be off and the machine come to a abrupt stop Thursday step from the platform and look at the index of the counter four hundred and sixty-three twenty-two short miss doyle he announce that 'll do Thursday he come to she side then face the sullen glowering group of mill hand boy say he it will not do you any good to interfere with we to-night the paper for to-morrow morning be already print and ojoy boglin be not a big enough man to stop it now or ever better go back to royal and settle you trouble with skeelty for if you stay here the citizen of millville be in the mood to shoot you down like dog they stand undecided a moment but the argument have evidently strike home what be the matter with harri ask one point to the motionless form of the man in the green sweater be he dead i suppose so answer Thursday coolly but he stoop to examine hetty 's victim roll he over so that he face be upward no he be not hurt much i be sorry to say the bullet glance off he forehead and stun he that be all take the brute if you want he and go they obey in silence several step forward and raise the unconscious harri bear he to the window where they pass he to those without then they also retreat through the window and the room be clear only then do hetty and beth venture to lower they weapon oh dear cry patsy in a low agitate voice i be so glad you do not kill he hetty i be not return the artist doggedly he deserve death at the least and by kill he i would have cheat the gallows then she glance around at the horrify face of she friend and burst into tear chapter xx defend the press in the front room bob west and the detective be have a busy time at the first rush they each fire a shot over the head of the mob merely to let they know the place be guard in the darkness it be impossible for the striker to tell how many armed man confront they so they fall back a little but form a cordon around the entire building from the printing office to the old mill be a distance of only a few hundred foot and every able-bodied inhabitant of millville except peggy mcnutt and sara cotting -- who have discreetly disappear at the first sign of danger -- be assist joe wegg to protect the electric cable he be try to connect the man from royal be scatter all along the line peer through the dim light to discover a vulnerable point of attack but deter from interfere by the determination of the stalwart defender mob be invariably cowardly and this one compose of the lowest stratum of mixed american and foreign laborer be no exception to the general rule however when word be finally pass along from the mill that the dynamo be run and supply power to the printing press a howl of rage go up and a sudden rush be make for the line the attack concentrate at one point the defender promptly group themselves in front of the threaten pole and seth davi the blacksmith wield a heavy sledge hammer do valiant service clear a space around he with little difficulty joe wegg arthur weldon cox the detective lon taft nick thome and even little skim clark be all in the melee fight desperately for time to enable Thursday smith to work he press use whatever cudgel they have be able to pick up to keep the assailant from the pole slowly however they be force back by superior number until finally one of the mill hand clamber up the pole and cut the wire never mind say arthur to joe as they retreat fight toward the printing office i think they have have time to run off the edition provide smith be ready with the form the mob be by this time in a ugly mood and the nearer joe and arthur edge toward the printing office the more numerous they enemy become the millville people be get rather the worst of the scrimmage when out rush Thursday smith swing a stout iron bar he have take from the press and with this terrible weapon he strike out so vigorously that the diversion in they favor enable the retreat villager to gain the office where booth and bob west fire several shot that effectually check the mob stand back ye villain cry a loud voice as major doyle march calmly down the road from the mill how dare ye interfere with a gentleman one of the leader confront he menacingly the major slap he face with the flat of he hand and then kick the fellow in the shin do not i say to get out o ' my way he roar and to the surprise of everyone -- even the major perhaps -- they fall hack and allow he to walk leisurely into the printing office have succeed in they primary attempt to cut the wire and find the determine band of defender more dangerous than they have think the workman retreat in the direction of royal where there be more to be gain by rioting than in millville when at last the town be clear of they arthur who be considerably batter and bruise but please with the triumphant ending of the adventure drive the girl and the major to the farm they urge hetty to accompany they but she declare she be not a bit nervous and prefer to sleep at the hotel i think the trouble be over for to-night say west and all agree with he cox and booth decide to sleep in the printing office and after the

wire which have be tamper with and in make a proper and permanent connection of the cable to the printing office that evening the village be again brilliantly light and thereafter the big dynamo whirl peacefully and without interruption the girl have a busy day as uncle john have predict for all the exciting incident of the evening and night before have to be write up and the next day 's paper teem with news of a character to interest all its reader beth 's editorial declare the neighborhood well rid of the paper mill which have be of little advantage but have cause no end of annoyance because of the rough and mischievous character of the workman employ in this statement nearly everyone agree with she several have be wound in the riot of the eventful evening but none seriously injure the workman take away they damage comrade and lon taft drive over to huntingdon and have he head sew up by the doctor other villager suffer mere bruise but all who engage in the fight pose as hero and even peggy mcnutt who figure as not present tell marvelous tale of how he have worst seven mill hand in a stand-up fight use only he invincible fist the following forenoon the liveryman at the junction bring to millville a passenger who have arrive by the morning train -- a quiet boyish-looking man with a shock of brick-red hair and a thin freckled face he be drive directly to the merrick farm where uncle john receive he cordially but with surprise and at once favor the new arrival with a long interview in he private room the girl who have not yet go to the office await somewhat impatiently the result of this conference for they already know the red-headed youth to be the great fogerty -- admit by even he would-be rival the king of new york detective also they know that uncle john have employ he some time ago to ferret out the mystery of the identity of Thursday smith and the fact of fogerty 's presence indicate he have something to report however when mr merrick come out of the private room he usually cheery countenance wear a troubled expression fogerty be invariably placid and inscrutable so no explanation could be glean from he demeanor ready for town my dear ask uncle john yes the surrey be wait answer louise then go along and fogerty and i will join you at the office presently i want to confer with the major and arthur before -- before take any step to -- what be the news uncle demand patsy impatiently you shall know in good time who be Thursday smith by and by dear do not bother I now but that remind I you be to say nothing to -- to -- Thursday about mr fogerty 's arrival treat he -- Thursday you know -- just as you have always do for the present at least whatever we determine on in regard to this man during we conference we must not forget that he have act most gallantly since he come to millville we really owe he a debt of gratitude with this somewhat incomprehensible statement the girl be force to content themselves feel quite helpless they drive to the office and leave the man to settle the fate of Thursday smith the pressman be now the man-of-all-work about the modest but trim little publishing plant he attend to whatever job printing come in make the etching from hetty 's drawing cast the stereotype make up the form and operate the press but aside from this mechanical work smith take the telegraphic news receive by hetty edit and condensed it and write the black-letter heading over the various item all this with a general supervision over the girl compositor keep the man busy from daybreak to midnight in spite of this the tribune be essentially a girl ' paper since Thursday smith be the only man employ on it -- not count the dummy editor arthur weldon who do nothing but keep the book and find this not a arduous task hetty at miss brigg ' desk attend the telegraph instrument and long-distance telephone receive news over both wire and still find time to draw she daily cartoon and additional humorous sketch which she work in whenever the mood seize she the typesetting be do by the dwyer sister -- a colorless pair but quite reliable -- while the reportorial and editorial work be divide between louise beth and patsy none of whom shirk a single duty indeed they have come to love this work dearly and be enthusiastic over the _ tribune _ which they fondly believe be be watch with envious admiration by all the journalistic world this belief be not wholly due to egotism they exchange both city and country have show considerable interest in the millville experiment as they call it and only a few day before the lead journal of a good-sized city have comment at length on the girl ' newspaper and after indulge in some humorous remark conclude quite seriously with the statement that its evident sincerity clean contents and typographical neatness render the _ millville daily tribune _ worthy a better setting than the somnolent country village whose census be too low to be officially record but that be all right say patsy smile at the praise we have never have dare to start a newspaper anywhere else because a journal that will do for millville might not make a hit if it bump against experienced competition we be woefully ignorant when we begin a few week ago comment beth glance with pride at she latest editorial which she think have catch the oracular tone of the big city newspaper and we be not expert journalist even yet add louise with a sigh we have improve to be sure but i imagine there be still lot of room for improvement one trouble say patsy be that every inhabitant of millville want to see he or she name in print every day whether he or she have do anything worthy of publication or not if the name be not print we have make a enemy and if it be the paper be sure to suffer more or less ridicule that be quite true my dear respond louise the reporter i have say everything about every one of they that have ever happen or threaten to happen since we start the paper and it be drive I crazy to discover anything more about these stupid native that will do to print hetty have overhear this conversation and now look up with a smile have you ` local happening ' column be prepare for to-morrow mr weldon she inquire no i be about to start out to unearth some item reply louise wearily let I do it for you i have a hour or so to spare and i will not need to leave my desk suggest the artist it be my duty you know hetty and i have no right to evade it evade it for to-day go home and rest i 'll do you column for to-morrow and after the vacation you can tackle the thrilling situation with better courage thank you hetty but i will not go home i 'll wait here to see fogerty fogerty exclaim the artist with a start of surprise do you mean the detective yes say louise regret she have inadvertently mention the name but what be there now to detect asked hetty suspiciously we trouble seem end with the burning of the mill and the flitting of skeelty and he workman louise hardly know how to reply but patsy who trust the queer girl artist say quite frankly : there remain the mystery of Thursday smith to fathom you know hetty flush and a indignant look sweep over she face what right have anyone to solve that mystery she ask defiantly be not that Thursday smith 's own business perhaps return patsy somewhat amuse but smith have not be able to discover who he be -- or be rather -- and seem really anxious to know hetty bent over she desk for a time then she look up and she thin feature be white and draw with anxiety when you discover who Thursday smith be say she the millville tribune will lose its right bower why before he accident or whatever it be that make he lose he memory he be a unusual man a man of exceptional ability you know that we be all incline to admit it answer patsy but what then man of ability declare hetty slowly be of two class : the very successful who attain high and honorable position or the clever scoundrel who fasten themselves like leech on humanity and bleed they victim with heartless unconcern what will you gain if you unmask the past of Thursday smith you uncover a rogue or a man of affair and in either case you will lose you pressman better leave the curtain draw miss doyle and accept Thursday smith as he be there be so much good sense in this reasoning that all three girl be impressed and begin to regret that uncle john have call fogerty to untangle the skein but it be now too late for such repentance and after all they be curious to discover who they remarkable employee really be even while the awkward silence that have fall upon the group of girl continue the door open to admit uncle john fogerty major doyle and arthur weldon except for the detective they be stern-faced and uncompromising chapter xxii unmask quintus fogerty be as unlike the typical detective as one could imagine small in size slight and boyish he year could not readily be determine by the ordinary observer he face be deeply furrowed and line yet a few pace away it seem the face of a boy of eighteen he cold gray eye be persistently stare but convey no inkling of he thought he brick-red hair be as unkempt as if it have never know a comb yet the attire of the great detective be as fastidiously neat as if he have dress for a important social function take altogether there be something mistrustful and uncanny about fogerty 's look and he habit of eternally puff cigarette render he companionship unpleasant yet of the man 's professional ability there be no doubt mr merrick and arthur weldon have have occasion to employ he before with result that justify they faith in he the detective greet the young lady with polite bow supplement by a aimless compliment on the neatness of they office never would have recognize it as a newspaper sanctum say he in he thin piping voice no litter no stale pipe lie about no cursing and quarrel no excitement whatever the editorial room be the index to the workshop i 'll see if the mechanical department be keep as neatly he open the door to the back room pass through and close it softly behind he mr merrick make a dive for the door and follow fogerty what be the verdict arthur ask louise curiously why i -- i believe the verdict be not render yet he hastily reply and follow mr merrick into the pressroom now then cry patsy grab the major firmly you 'll not stir a step sir until you tell we the news what news patricium inquire the old gentleman blandly who be Thursday smith the identical individual he be now say the major do not prevaricate sir who be he what do he do what be he right name be it because you be especially interested in this man my dear or be ye simply consume with feminine curiosity be good daddy tell we all about it say patsy coaxingly the man Thursday then be likely enough the brother of robinson crusoe 's man Friday major you be trifling or mayhap a ex-president of the united state or forby the senator from oklahoma belike he be once minister to borneo a ' come home in a hurry a ' forget who he be but john merrick will be want I he escape and open the door then with he hand on the knob he turn and add : why do not ye come in I journalistic investigator and see the fun for yerselve i suspect there be a item in store for ye then he go in and they take the hint and enter the pressroom in a flutter group fogerty stand with he hand in he pocket intently watch the dwyer girl set type while at he elbow mr merrick be explain in a casual voice how many m 's be require to make a newspaper column in another part of the long room arthur weldon be lean over a table contain the half-empty form as if critically examine they smith array in overalls and jumper be clean and oil the big press a daily newspaper say the major loudly as he hold up a warning finger to the bevy of niece behind whom hetty 's pale face appear mean a daily grind for all concern in it there be no vacation for the paper no hyphen no skip a day or two if it have a bad cold it be the tyrant that lead its slave by the nose metaphorically and have no conscience just as regularly as the world roll ` round the press roll out the newspaper and human life or death make little difference to either of the revolutionist while he speak the major lead the way across the room to the stereotype plant which bring he party to a position near the press smith glance at they and go on with he work it be not unusual to have the pressroom thus invade presently fogerty stroll over smoking he eternal cigarette and stand watch the pressman as if interested in the oiling of the complicated machine smith feeling himself under observation glance up again in a unconcerned way and as he face the detective fogerty give a cleverly assume start and exclaim : good god instantly Thursday smith straighten up and look at the man questioningly fogerty stretch out he hand and say as if in wonder : why melville old man what be you do here we wonder what have become of you all these month shake hand my boy i be glad i have find you smith lean against the press and stare at he with dilate eye everyone in the room be regard the scene with intense but repress excitement what be wrong harold continue fogerty as if hurt by the other 's hesitation to acknowledge they acquaintance you have not forget I have you i be mccormick you know and you and i have have many a good time together in the past smith pass he hand across he forehead with a dazed gesture what name do you call I sir he ask melville harold melville of east sixty-sixth street i be sure i be right there can not be two like you in the world you know Thursday smith step down from the platform and with a staggering gait walk to a stool on which he weakly sink he wipe the bead of perspiration from he forehead and look at fogerty with a half frightened air and you -- be -- mccormick he falter of course smith stare a moment and then shake he head it be no use he say despairingly i can not recall a single memory of either harold melville or -- or he friend mccormick pardon I sir i must confess my mind be absolutely blank concern all my life previous to the last two year until this moment i -- i could not recall my own name h be muttered fogerty you recall it now do not you no you tell I my name be melville and you seem to recognize I as a man whom you once know i accept you statement in good faith but i can not corroborate it from my own knowledge that be queer retort fogerty he cold eye fix upon the man 's face let I explain please say smith and related he curious experience in practically the same word he have employ when confide it to mr merrick i have hope he conclude that if ever i meet one who know I formerly or hear my right name mention my memory would come back to I but in this i be sorely disappointed do you know I well sir pretty well answer the detective after a slight hesitation then tell I something about myself tell I who i be here -- in public ask fogerty with a suggestive glance at the spectator who have involuntarily crowd nearer smith flush but gaze firmly into the face surround he why not he return these young lady and mr merrick accept I without knowledge of my antecedent they be entitle to as full a explanation as -- as i be you place I melville in a rather embarrassing position declare fogerty this be a queer case -- the queerest in all my experience better let I post you in a private interview smith tremble a bit from nervousness but he persist in he demand these people be entitle to the truth say he tell we frankly all you know about I and do not mince word -- whatever the truth may be oh it be not so bad announce the detective with a shrug or at least it would not be in new york among you old aristocratic haunt but here in a quiet country town among these generous and simple-hearted folk who have befriend you the thing be rather difficult to say say it command smith i will many new yorker remember the firm of melville & ford the cleverest pair of confidence man who ever undertake to fleece the wealthy lamb of the metropolis confidence man gasp smith in a voice of horror yes put it mildly you be both jolly good fellow and make a host of friend you be well-groomed ride in automobile frequent good club and have a stunning establishment on sixty-sixth street where you entertain lavishly you could afford to for there be where you fleece you victim but it be not so very bad as i say you choose the wealthy son of the super-rich who be glad to know such popular men-about-town as harold melville and edgar ford when one set of innocent have be so thoroughly trim that they compare note and begin to avoid you you have only to pick up another bunch of lamb for new york contain many distinct flock of the species as they could afford to lose none of they ever complain to the police although the central office have a eye on you and know you method perfectly finally you make a mistake -- or rather ford do for he be not as clever as you be he bring a imitation millionaire to you house a fellow who be put up a brazen front on the smallest sort of a roll you win he money and he denounce you get away with a pack of marked card for evidence at this you both take fright and decide on a hasty retreat gathering together you plunder -- which be a royal sum i be convinced -- you and ford jump into a motor car and -- vanish from new york the balance of you history i base on premise ford have be locate in chicago where with a ample supply of money he be repeat he new york operation but harold melville have never be hear of until this day i think the true explanation be easily arrive at goad by cupidity -- and perhaps envy of you superior talent -- ford take advantage of the situation and find the automobile speeding along a desert road knock you on the head tumble you out of the car and make off with you combined winnings the blow have the effect -- not so uncommon as you think -- of destroy you recollection of you past life and you have for two year be wander in total ignorance of what cause you affliction during this recital smith sit with he eye eagerly fix upon the speaker 's face dwelling upon every word at the conclusion of the story he drop he face in he hand a moment visibly shudder then again he look up and after read the circle of pity face confront he he bravely meet mr merrick 's eye sir he say in a voice that falter in spite of he effort to render it firm you now know who i be when i first come to you i be a mere irresponsible hobo a wander tramp who have adopt the name of Thursday smith because he be ignorant of he own but who have no cause to be ashamed of he manhood to-day i be discover in my true guise as harold melville the disreputable trickster i be not fit to remain in you employ -- to associate with honest man and woman you will forgive my imposition i think because you know how thoroughly ignorant i be of the truth but i will impose upon you no longer i be sorry sir for i have be happy here but i will go thank you for the kindly generosity that prompt you to accept I as i seem to be not as i be he rise he face show evidence of suffering and bow gravely hetty hewitt walk over and stand by he side lay she hand gently upon he arm but Thursday smith do not know john merrick very well the little gentleman have silently listen observe meanwhile the demeanor of the accuse and now he smile in he pleasant whimsical way and catch smith 's hand in both he own man man he cry you be misjudge both I and yourself i do not know this fellow melville you do not know he either but i do know Thursday smith who have win my confidence and by he manly act and i 'll stand by he through thick and thin i be harold melville -- the gambler -- the confidence man you be nothing of the sort you be just Thursday smith and no more responsible for harold melville than i be hooray exclaim patsy doyle enthusiastically uncle 's right Thursday you be we friend and the mainstay of the _ millville daily tribune _ we shall not allow you to desert we just because you have discover that you -- you -- ancestor -- be not quite respectable that be it exactly assert beth it be like hear a tale of a ancestor Thursday or of some member of you family who live before you you can not be responsible in any way for another man 's wickedness as i look at it say louise reflectively you be just two year old Thursday and innocent of any wrongdoing before that day you first find yourself there be no use we consider melville at all add uncle john cheerfully i be sorry we ever hear of he except that in one way it clear up a mystery Thursday smith we like you and trust you do not doubt yourself because of this tale i 'll vouch for you fairness and integrity forget melville who have never really exist so far as any of we be concerned be yourself and count on we friendship and regard which Thursday smith have fairly win hetty be cry softly she cheek lay against Thursday 's sleeve the man stand as if turn to stone but he cheek be flush he eye sparkling and he head proudly poise fogerty light a fresh cigarette watch the scene with a imperturbable smile suddenly smith awake to life he half turn look wonderingly at hetty and then fold she thin form in he arm and press a kiss on she forehead fogerty cough uncle john jerk out he handkerchief and blow he nose like a bugle call the major 's eye be moist for the old soldier be sympathetic as a child but patsy a little catch in she voice impulsively put she arm around the unashamed pair and murmur : i be so glad hetty i be so glad Thursday but -- dear I -- be not we go to have any paper to-morrow morning that relieve the tension and everybody laugh Thursday release hetty and shake uncle john 's hand most gratefully then they all want to shake hand and do until it come to fogerty 's turn but now smith draw back and look askance at the detective i do not know you mr mccormick he say with dignity my name 's not mccormick it be fogerty say the other without malice i be simply test you memory by claim to be a old friend personally i never know harold melville but i be mighty glad to make Thursday smith 's acquaintance and will consider it a honor if you 'll shake my hand smith be too happy to refuse he take fogerty 's hand chapter xxiii the journalist abdicate mr merrick tell Thursday smith in a apologetic way how he have hire fogerty to unravel the mystery of he former life and how the great detective have go to work so intelligently and skillfully that with the aid of a sketch hetty have once make of the pressman and which mr merrick send on he have be able to identify the man and unearth the disagreeable detail of he history Thursday be too humble by this time and too grateful besides to resent uncle john 's interference he admit that after all it be better he should know the truth i have nothing to bother I now but the future he say and with god 's help i mean to keep the name of Thursday smith clean and free from any reproach after the interview he go about he duty as before and hetty sit down at she desk and take the telegraphic news that come click over the wire as if nothing important in she life have occur but the girl journalist be all excitement and already be begin to plan the thing they might do to make hetty and Thursday happier cox and booth have go away and mr merrick thank fogerty for he skillful service and give he a fat check it be a mighty interesting case sir declare the detective and i be as glad as any of you that it have end so comfortably whatever melville might have be -- and he record be a little worse than i related it -- there be no doubt of Thursday smith 's honesty he be a mighty fine fellow and fate play a proper trick when she blot out he unscrupulous mind and leave he as innocent as a unborn babe he will do well in he new life i be sure and that girl of he hetty hewitt -- i have know of she reckless way for year -- have also redeem herself and turn out a regular brick all of which mr merrick be unusual in real life more 's the pity and therefore it make even a cold-blooded detective feel good to witness it mr merrick smile benignantly and fogerty drive over to the junction to catch he train after luncheon patsy while arrange she galley proof inquire of louise for the local column hetty say she would attend to it be the reply but we be all upset to-day and thing be at six and seven the column be all prepared miss doyle announce hetty where be it Thursday have make it ready for the press it be -- illustrate she confess i would rather you would not see it until the paper be out if you can trust I to be sure say patsy that be one responsibility i be relieved of anyhow the paper be a bit uneven in appearance next morning but when patsy come down to breakfast she find both uncle john and the major roar with laughter over hetty 's local the first item state that mr thorne take tea at sam cotting 's last evening -lrb- the cotting be notoriously inhospitable -rrb- and the picture show mr thorne a sour-faced woman depart from the store with a package of tea then come the announcement that eph hildreth get shoot at west 's hardware store and there be a picture of west weigh out a pound of buckshot for he customer the next item say : we distinguished fellow citizen marshall peggy mcnutt be discover unconscious on he front porch at 3 pm the drawing of mcnutt be one of the best of the series it be he habit to snooze in a easy chair on he porch every afternoon and hetty depict the little man with both foot -- meat and wood -- on the rail he mouth open and eye shut while lusty snore be indicate by radiate line and exclamation point the widow clark 's cow occupy the next square be tethered to a stake while skim approach the animal with pail and milking-stool below the drawing be the word : mr skimton clark cowward a few other local hit be conclude by a picture of hon ojoy boglin shake he fist at mr skeelty who hold a package of money in he grasp label insurance below be the simple legend : o joy the artist 's cleverness become the subject of conversation at the breakfast table and arthur remark : you will not be able to hold hetty in millville long she talent enable she to draw big salary in new york and it be not likely she will consent to bury herself in this little town i be not so sure say patsy if we can hold Thursday smith we can hold hetty you know we will not need to hold either of they for long observe beth for in another three week or so we must leave here and return to the city when of course the _ millville daily tribune _ must suspend publication i have be think of that say uncle john so have i declare patsy for a long time i be puzzle what to do for i hate dreadfully to kill we dear _ tribune _ after we have make it such a nice paper yet i know very well we could not stay here all winter and run it but last night i have a inspiration Thursday will marry hetty i suppose and they can both stay here and run the tribune they be do most of the work now if uncle john agree we will sell out to they on ` easy term ' good gracious patsy chuckle the major wherever can the poor thing borrow money to keep go do you want to load onto a innocent bride a ' groom the necessity of meet a deficit of a couple of hundred dollar every week patsy 's face fall they have no money i know she say except what they earn and they wages 'll be cut off when they begin hire themselves add the major no you can not decently thrust such a incubus on hetty and Thursday -- or on anyone else you have be willing to pay the piper for the sake of the dance but no one else would do it quite true agree arthur the day of the _ millville tribune _ be number let we not settle that question just yet propose mr merrick who have be deep in thought i 'll consider patsy 's proposition for awhile and then talk with Thursday the paper belong to the girl but the outfit be mine and i suppose i may do what i please with it when my niece retire from journalism even the major could not demur at this statement and so the conversation drop during the next few day uncle john visit the printing office several time and look over the complete little plant with speculative eye then one day he make a trip to malvern thirty mile up the railway line from the junction where a successful weekly paper have long be publish he interview the editor examine the outfit critically and after ask numerous question return to millville in excellent spirit then he invite Thursday smith and hetty to dine at the farm on Saturday evening which be the one evening in the week they be free there be no Sunday morning paper Thursday have buy a new suit of clothes since he come to the _ tribune _ and hetty after much urge finally prevail upon he to accept the invitation when the young man appear at the farm he wear he new suit with a air of perfect ease that disguise its cheapness and it be notice that he seem quite at home in the handsome living-room where the party assemble after dinner i be in search of information Thursday say uncle john in he pleasant way will you permit I to question you a bit certainly sir and you hetty ask anything you like sir thank you to begin with what be you future plan i understand of course you be to be marry but -- afterward we have not consider that as yet sir reply Thursday thoughtfully of course we shall stay with the _ tribune _ as long as you care to employ we service but -- well i have be give to understand the young lady plan to return to new york at the end of September and in that case of course the paper will suspend my niece will be oblige to abandon journalism to be sure say mr merrick but i see no reason why the paper should suspend how would you and hetty like to remain in millville and run it both Thursday and hetty smile but it be the man who answer we can not afford such a luxury sir would you care to make you future home in millville oh yes exclaim hetty i love the quaint little town dearly and the villager be all my friend i be sure Thursday do not care to go back to new york where -- where harold melville once live but as he truly say we could not make a living with the _ tribune _ even if you give we the use of the plant let we see about that say uncle john i will admit in advance that a daily paper in such a place be absurd none of we quite understand that when we establish the _ tribune _ my niece think a daily the only satisfactory sort of newspaper because they be use to such but it do not take long to convince I -- and perhaps they -- that in spite of all we effort the _ millville daily tribune _ would never thrive it be too expensive to pay its own way and require too much work to be a pleasant plaything only unbounded enthusiasm and energy have enable my clever niece to avoid be swamp by the monster they ambition create that say patsy with a laugh be very clearly and concisely put my dear uncle it be never intend to be a permanent thing anyhow continue mr merrick yet i must express my admiration for the courage and talent my niece have display in force a temporary success where failure be the logical conclusion shortly however they intend to retire gracefully from the field of journalism leave I with a model country newspaper plant on my hand therefore it be i Thursday and hetty and not my niece who have a proposition to place before you while a daily paper be not appropriate in millville a weekly paper distribute throughout chazy county would not only be desirable but could be make to pay a excellent yearly profit through the enterprise of joe wegg millville be destine to grow rapidly from this time on and chazy county be populous enough to support a good weekly paper in any event therefore my proposition be this : to turn the plant over to mr and mr Thursday smith who will change the name to the _ millville weekly tribune _ and run it as a permanent institution you only expense for labor will be one assistant to set type and do odd job since you be so competent that you can attend to all else yourselve we will cut out the expensive news service we have heretofore indulge in and dispense with the private telegraph wire joe wegg say he 'll furnish you with what power you need free of all charge because the paper will boost millville 's interest with which he own interest be identify now then tell I what you think of my proposal hetty and Thursday have listen attentively and they face prove they be enthusiastic over the idea they say at once they would be glad to undertake the proposition however say Thursday after a little reflection there be two thing that might render we acceptance impossible i suppose you will require rent for the outfit but for a time until we get well start we could not afford to pay as much as you have a right to demand i have settle on my demand reply mr merrick and hope you will agree to they you must pay I for the use of the outfit twenty per cent of you net profit over and above all you operating and living expense when this sum have reimburse I for my investment the outfit will belong to you Thursday smith look he amazement that seem hardly business-like sir he protest you be right but this be not entirely a business deal you be save my niece the humiliation of suspend the paper they establish and have labor on so lovingly moreover i regard you and hetty as friend whom i be glad to put in the way of a modest but -- i venture to predict -- a successful business career what be you second objection i hear mr west say the other day that he would soon need the building we occupy to store he farm machinery in true but i have anticipate that i have complete plan for the erection of a new building for the newspaper which will be locate on the vacant lot next to the hotel i purchase the lot a long time ago the new building for which the lumber be already order will be a better one than the shed we be now in and on the second floor i intend to have a cozy suite of room where you and hetty can make a home of you own eh how do that strike you my child they face be full of wonder and delight the new building go with the outfit on the same term continue mr merrick that be i take one-fifth of you net profit for the whole thing but sir suggest Thursday suppose no profit materialize then i have induce you to undertake a poor venture and must suffer the consequence which to I will be no hardship at all in that case i will agree to find some better business for you but i be quite positive you will make a go of the _ millville weekly tribune _ i think so too mr merrick or i would not accept you generous offer reply smith what do you think hetty the idea please I immensely she declare it be a splendid opportunity for we and will enable we to live here quietly and forget the big outside world new york have have a bad influence on both you and I Thursday and here we can begin a new life of absolute respectability when do you intend to be marry ask patsy we have scarcely think of that as yet for until this evening we do not know what the future hold in store for we could not you arrange the wedding before we leave ask beth it would delight we so much to be present at the ceremony i think we owe the young lady that much Thursday say hetty after a brief hesitation nothing could please I better he assert eagerly so they canvass the wedding and patsy propose they transfer the paper to Thursday and hetty -- to become a weekly instead of a daily -- in a week 's time and celebrate the wedding immediately after the second issue so as to give the bridal couple a brief vacation before get to work again neither of they wish to take a wedding trip and mr merrick promise to rush the work on the new building so they could move into they new room in the course of a few week chapter xxiv a cheerful blunder we would like to ask you advice about one thing sir say Thursday smith to mr merrick a little later that same evening would it be legal for I to marry under the name of Thursday smith or must i use my real name -- harold melville uncle john could not answer this question nor could the major or arthur hetty and she fianc have both decide to cling to the name of Thursday smith thereafter and they dislike to be marry under any other -- especially the detestable one of harold melville a act of legislature would render you new name legal i believe say mr merrick but such a act could not be pass until after the date you have plan to be marry but if it be make legal afterward it would not matter greatly suggest the major i do not think it matter at all assert hetty it be the man i be marry not he name i do not much care what he call himself oh but it must be legal you know exclaimed patsy you do not care now perhaps but you might in the future we can not be certain you know that Thursday be entirely free from he former connection with harold melville quite true agree the major then say smith with evident disappointment i must use the hateful name of melville for the wedding and afterward abandon it for as long as possible the niece be greatly please with uncle john 's arrangement which relieve they of the newspaper and also
