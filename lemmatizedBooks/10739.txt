produce by juliet sutherland josephine paoluccus and the online distribute proofread team the essay of arthur schopenhauer translate by t bailey saunder ma on human nature contents human nature government free-will and fatalism character moral instinct ethical reflection translator 's preface the follow essay be draw from the chapter entitle _ zur ethik _ and _ zur rechtslehre und politik _ which be to be find both in schopenhauer 's _ parerga _ and in he posthumous writings as in my previous volume so also in this i have omit a few passage which appear to I to be either antiquated or no longer of any general interest for convenience ' sake i have divide the original chapter into section which i have have to name and i have also have to invent a title which should express they real scope the reader will find that it be not so much _ ethic _ and _ politics _ that be here treat as human nature itself in various aspect tb human nature truth of the physical order may possess much external significance but internal significance they have none the latter be the privilege of intellectual and moral truth which be concern with the objectivation of the will in its highest stage whereas physical truth be concern with it in its lowest for example if we could establish the truth of what up till now be only a conjecture namely that it be the action of the sun which produce thermoelectricity at the equator that this produce terrestrial magnetism and that this magnetism again be the cause of the _ aurora boreali _ these would be truth externally of great but internally of little significance on the other hand example of internal significance be furnish by all great and true philosophical system by the catastrophe of every good tragedy nay even by the observation of human conduct in the extreme manifestation of its morality and immorality of its good and its evil character for all these be expression of that reality which take outward shape as the world and which in the highest stage of its objectivation proclaim its innermost nature to say that the world have only a physical and not a moral significance be the greatest and most pernicious of all error the fundamental blunder the real perversity of mind and temper and at bottom it be doubtless the tendency which faith personify as anti-christ nevertheless in spite of all religion -- and they be system which one and all maintain the opposite and seek to establish it in they mythical way -- this fundamental error never become quite extinct but raise its head from time to time afresh until universal indignation compel it to hide itself once more yet however certain we may feel of the moral significance of life and the world to explain and illustrate it and to resolve the contradiction between this significance and the world as it be form a task of great difficulty so great indeed as to make it possible that it have remain for I to exhibit the true and only genuine and sound basis of morality everywhere and at all time effective together with the result to which it lead the actual fact of morality be too much on my side for I to fear that my theory can ever be replace or upset by any other however so long as even my ethical system continue to be ignore by the professorial world it be kant 's moral principle that prevail in the university among its various form the one which be most in favor at present be the dignity of man i have already expose the absurdity of this doctrine in my treatise on the _ foundation of morality _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- therefore i will only say here that if the question be ask on what the alleged dignity of man rest it would not be long before the answer be make that it rest upon he morality in other word he morality rest upon he dignity and he dignity rest upon he morality -lrb- footnote 1 : § 8 -rrb- but apart from this circular argument it seem to I that the idea of dignity can be apply only in a ironical sense to a be whose will be so sinful whose intellect be so limited whose body be so weak and perishable as man 's how shall a man be proud when he conception be a crime he birth a penalty he life a labor and death a necessity -- _ quid superbit homo cujus conceptio culpa nascus poena labor vita necesse morus _ therefore in opposition to the above-mentioned form of the kantian principle i should be incline to lay down the follow rule : when you come into contact with a man no matter whom do not attempt a objective appreciation of he accord to he worth and dignity do not consider he bad will or he narrow understanding and perverse idea as the former may easily lead you to hate and the latter to despise he but fix you attention only upon he suffering he need he anxiety he pain then you will always feel you kinship with he you will sympathise with he and instead of hatred or contempt you will experience the commiseration that alone be the peace to which the gospel call we the way to keep down hatred and contempt be certainly not to look for a man 's alleged dignity but on the contrary to regard he as a object of pity the buddhist as the result of the more profound view which they entertain on ethical and metaphysical subject start from the cardinal vice and not the cardinal virtue since the virtue make they appearance only as the contrary or negation of the vice accord to schmidt 's _ history of the eastern mongolian _ the cardinal vice in the buddhist scheme be four : lust indolence anger and avarice but probably instead of indolence we should read pride for so it stand in the _ lettre édifiantes et curieuses _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- where envy or hatred be add as a fifth i be confirm in correct the statement of the excellent schmidt by the fact that my render agree with the doctrine of the sufi who be certainly under the influence of the brahmin and buddhist the sufi also maintain that there be four cardinal vice and they arrange they in very striking pair so that lust appear in connection with avarice and anger with pride the four cardinal virtue oppose to they would be chastity and generosity together with gentleness and humility -lrb- footnote 1 : edit of 1819 vol vi p 372 -rrb- when we compare these profound idea of morality as they be entertain by oriental nation with the celebrated cardinal virtue of plato which have be recapitulate again and again -- justice valor temperance and wisdom -- it be plain that the latter be not base on any clear lead idea but be choose on grounds that be superficial and in part obviously false virtue must be quality of the will but wisdom be chiefly a attribute of the intellect -lrb- greek : sophrosyna -rrb- which cicero translate _ temperantium _ be a very indefinite and ambiguous word and it admit therefore of a variety of application : it may mean discretion or abstinence or keep a level head courage be not a virtue at all although sometimes it be a servant or instrument of virtue but it be just as ready to become the servant of the greatest villainy it be really a quality of temperament even geulinx -lrb- in the preface to this _ ethic _ -rrb- condemn the platonic virtue and put the follow in they place : diligence obedience justice and humility which be obviously bad the chinese distinguish five cardinal virtue : sympathy justice propriety wisdom and sincerity the virtue of christianity be theological not cardinal : faith love and hope fundamental disposition towards other assume the character either of envy or of sympathy be the point at which the moral virtue and vice of mankind first diverge these two diametrically opposite quality exist in every man for they spring from the inevitable comparison which he draw between he own lot and that of other accord as the result of this comparison affect he individual character do the one or the other of these quality become the source and principle of all he action envy build the wall between _ thee _ and _ I _ thicker and stronger sympathy make it slight and transparent nay sometimes it pull down the wall altogether and then the distinction between self and not-self vanish valor which have be mention as a virtue or rather the courage on which it be base -lrb- for valor be only courage in war -rrb- deserve a closer examination the ancient reckon courage among the virtue and cowardice among the vice but there be no corresponding idea in the christian scheme which make for charity and patience and in its teaching forbid all enmity or even resistance the result be that with the modern courage be no longer a virtue nevertheless it must be admit that cowardice do not seem to be very compatible with any nobility of character -- if only for the reason that it betray a overgreat apprehension about one 's own person courage however may also be explain as a readiness to meet ill that threaten at the moment in order to avoid greater ill that lie in the future whereas cowardice do the contrary but this readiness be of the same quality as _ patience _ for patience consist in the clear consciousness that greater evil than those which be present and that any violent attempt to flee from or guard against the ill we have may bring the other upon we courage then would be a kind of patience and since it be patience that enable we to practice forbearance and self control courage be through the medium of patience at least akin to virtue but perhaps courage admit of be consider from a higher point of view the fear of death may in every case be trace to a deficiency in that natural philosophy -- natural and therefore rest on mere feeling -- which give a man the assurance that he exist in everything outside he just as much as in he own person so that the death of he person can do he little harm but it be just this very assurance that would give a man heroic courage and therefore as the reader will recollect from my _ ethic _ courage come from the same source as the virtue of justice and humanity this be i admit to take a very high view of the matter but apart from it i can not well explain why cowardice seem contemptible and personal courage a noble and sublime thing for no lower point of view enable I to see why a finite individual who be everything to himself -- nay who be himself even the very fundamental condition of the existence of the rest of the world -- should not put he own preservation above every other aim it be then a insufficient explanation of courage to make it rest only on utility to give it a empirical and not a transcendental character it may have be for some such reason that calderon once utter a sceptical but remarkable opinion in regard to courage nay actually deny its reality and put he denial into the mouth of a wise old minister address he young sovereign although he observe natural fear be operative in all alike a man may be brave in not let it be see and it be this that constitute courage : _ que aunque el natural temor en todo obra igualmente no mostrarle e ser valiente y esto es lo que hace el valor _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ la hija del aire _ ii 2 -rrb- in regard to the difference which i have mention between the ancient and the modern in they estimate of courage as a virtue it must be remember that by virtue _ virtus _ -lrb- greek : areta -rrb- the ancient understand every excellence or quality that be praiseworthy in itself it might be moral or intellectual or possibly only physical but when christianity demonstrate that the fundamental tendency of life be moral it be moral superiority alone than henceforth attach to the notion of virtue meanwhile the earlier usage still survive in the elder latinist and also in italian writer as be prove by the well-known meaning of the word _ virtuoso _ the special attention of student should be draw to this wider range of the idea of virtue amongst the ancient as otherwise it might easily be a source of secret perplexity i may recommend two passage preserve for we by stobaeus which will serve this purpose one of they be apparently from the pythagorean philosopher metopo in which the fitness of every bodily member be declare to be a virtue the other pronounce that the virtue of a shoemaker be to make good shoe this may also serve to explain why it be that in the ancient scheme of ethic virtue and vice be mention which find no place in ours as the place of courage amongst the virtue be a matter of doubt so be that of avarice amongst the vice it must not however be confound with greed which be the most immediate meaning of the latin word _ avaritium _ let we then draw up and examine the argument _ pro et contra _ in regard to avarice and leave the final judgment to be form by every man for himself on the one hand it be argue that it be not avarice which be a vice but extravagance its opposite extravagance spring from a brutish limitation to the present moment in comparison with which the future exist as it do only in thought be as nothing it rest upon the illusion that sensual pleasure possess a positive or real value accordingly future need and misery be the price at which the spendthrift purchase pleasure that be empty fleeting and often no more than imaginary or else feed he vain stupid self-conceit on the bow and scrape of parasite who laugh at he in secret or on the gaze of the mob and those who envy he magnificence we should therefore shun the spendthrift as though he have the plague and on discover he vice break with he betime in order that later on when the consequence of he extravagance ensue we may neither have to help to bear they nor on the other hand have to play the part of the friend of timon of athen at the same time it be not to be expect that he who foolishly squander he own fortune will leave another man 's intact if it should chance to be commit to he keep nay _ suus profusus _ and _ alienus appeten _ be by sallust very rightly conjoin hence it be that extravagance lead not only to impoverishment but also to crime and crime amongst the moneyed class be almost always the result of extravagance it be accordingly with justice that the _ koran _ declare all spendthrift to be brother of satan but it be superfluity that avarice bring in its train and when be superfluity ever unwelcome that must be a good vice which have good consequence avarice proceeds upon the principle that all pleasure be only negative in its operation and that the happiness which consist of a series of pleasure be a chimaera that on the contrary it be pain which be positive and extremely real accordingly the avaricious man forego the former in order that he may be the better preserve from the latter and thus it be that _ bear and forbear _ -- _ sustine et abstine _ -- be he maxim and because he know further how inexhaustible be the possibility of misfortune and how innumerable the path of danger he increase the means of avoid they in order if possible to surround himself with a triple wall of protection who then can say where precaution against disaster begin to be exaggerate he alone who know where the malignity of fate reach its limit and even if precaution be exaggerate it be a error which at the most would hurt the man who take it and not other if he will never need the treasure which he lay up for himself they will one day benefit other whom nature have make less careful that until then he withdraw the money from circulation be no misfortune for money be not a article of consumption : it only represent the good thing which a man may actually possess and be not one itself coin be only counter they value be what they represent and what they represent can not be withdraw from circulation moreover by hold back the money the value of the remainder which be in circulation be enhance by precisely the same amount even though it be the case as be say that many a miser come in the end to love money itself for its own sake it be equally certain that many a spendthrift on the other hand love spending and squander for no better reason friendship with a miser be not only without danger but it be profitable because of the great advantage it can bring for it be doubtless those who be nearest and dearest to the miser who on he death will reap the fruit of the self-control which he exercise but even in he lifetime too something may be expect of he in case of great need at any rate one can always hope for more from he than from the spendthrift who have lose he all and be himself helpless and in debt _ ma da el duro que el desnudo _ say a spanish proverb the man who have a hard heart will give more than the man who have a empty purse the upshot of all this be that avarice be not a vice on the other side it may be say that avarice be the quintessence of all vice when physical pleasure seduce a man from the right path it be he sensual nature -- the animal part of he -- which be at fault he be carry away by its attraction and overcome by the impression of the moment he act without thinking of the consequence when on the other hand he be bring by age or bodily weakness to the condition in which the vice that he could never abandon end by abandon he and he capacity for physical pleasure die -- if he turn to avarice the intellectual desire survive the sensual money which represent all the good thing of this world and be these good thing in the abstract now become the dry trunk overgrow with all the dead lust of the flesh which be egoism in the abstract they come to life again in the love of the mammon the transient pleasure of the sens have become a deliberate and calculated lust of money which like that to which it be direct be symbolical in its nature and like it indestructible this obstinate love of the pleasure of the world -- a love which as it be outlive itself this utterly incorrigible sin this refine and sublimate desire of the flesh be the abstract form in which all lust be concentrated and to which it stand like a general idea to individual particulars accordingly avarice be the vice of age just as extravagance be the vice of youth this _ disputatio in utramque partem _ -- this debate for and against -- be certainly calculate to drive we into accept the _ juste milieu _ morality of aristotle a conclusion that be also support by the follow consideration every human perfection be ally to a defect into which it threaten to pass but it be also true that every defect be ally to a perfection hence it be that if as often happen we make a mistake about a man it be because at the beginning of we acquaintance with he we confound he defect with the kind of perfection to which they be ally the cautious man seem to we a coward the economical man a miser the spendthrift seem liberal the rude fellow downright and sincere the foolhardy person look as if he be go to work with a noble self-confidence and so on in many other case \* \* \* \* \* no one can live among man without feel draw again and again to the tempting supposition that moral baseness and intellectual incapacity be closely connect as though they both spring direct from one source that that however be not so i have show in detail -lrb- 1 -rrb- that it seem to be so be merely due to the fact that both be so often find together and the circumstance be to be explain by the very frequent occurrence of each of they so that it may easily happen for both to be compel to live under one roof at the same time it be not to be deny that they play into each other 's hand to they mutual benefit and it be this that produce the very unedifying spectacle which only too many man exhibit and that make the world to go as it go a man who be unintelligent be very likely to show he perfidy villainy and malice whereas a clever man understand how to conceal these quality and how often on the other hand do a perversity of heart prevent a man from see truth which he intelligence be quite capable of grasp -lrb- footnote 1 : in my chief work vol ii ch xix -rrb- nevertheless let no one boast just as every man though he be the greatest genius have very definite limitation in some one sphere of knowledge and thus attest he common origin with the essentially perverse and stupid mass of mankind so also have every man something in he nature which be positively evil even the best nay the noblest character will sometimes surprise we by isolate trait of depravity as though it be to acknowledge he kinship with the human race in which villainy -- nay cruelty -- be to be find in that degree for it be just in virtue of this evil in he this bad principle that of necessity he become a man and for the same reason the world in general be what my clear mirror of it have show it to be but in spite of all this the difference even between one man and another be incalculably great and many a one would be horrify to see another as he really be oh for some asmodeus of morality to make not only roof and wall transparent to he favorite but also to lift the veil of dissimulation fraud hypocrisy pretence falsehood and deception which be spread over all thing to show how little true honesty there be in the world and how often even where it be least to be expect behind all the exterior outwork of virtue secretly and in the innermost recess unrighteousness sit at the helm it be just on this account that so many man of the better kind have four-footed friend : for to be sure how be a man to get relief from the endless dissimulation falsity and malice of mankind if there be no dog into whose honest face he can look without distrust for what be we civilised world but a big masquerade where you meet knight priest soldier man of learn barrister clergyman philosopher and i do not know what all but they be not what they pretend to be they be only mask and as a rule behind the mask you will find moneymaker one man i suppose put on the mask of law which he have borrow for the purpose from a barrister only in order to be able to give another man a sound drubbing a second have choose the mask of patriotism and the public welfare with a similar intent a third take religion or purity of doctrine for all sort of purpose man have often put on the mask of philosophy and even of philanthropy and i know not what besides woman have a smaller choice as a rule they avail themselves of the mask of morality modesty domesticity and humility then there be general mask without any particular character attach to they like domino they may be meet with everywhere and of this sort be the strict rectitude the courtesy the sincere sympathy the smile friendship that people profess the whole of these mask as a rule be merely as i have say a disguise for some industry commerce or speculation it be merchant alone who in this respect constitute any honest class they be the only people who give themselves out to be what they be and therefore they go about without any mask at all and consequently take a humble rank it be very necessary that a man should be apprise early in life that it be a masquerade in which he find himself for otherwise there be many thing which he will fail to understand and put up with nay at which he will be completely puzzle and that man longest of all whose heart be make of better clay -- _ et meliore luto finxit praecordium titan -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ -lrb- footnote 1 : juvenal _ sit _ 14 34 -rrb- such for instance be the favor that villainy find the neglect that merit even the rarest and the greatest suffer at the hand of those of the same profession the hatred of truth and great capacity the ignorance of scholar in they own province and the fact that true wares be almost always despise and the merely specious one in request therefore let even the young be instruct betime that in this masquerade the apple be of wax the flower of silk the fish of pasteboard and that all thing -- yes all thing -- be toy and trifle and that of two man whom he may see earnestly engage in business one be supply spurious goods and the other pay for they in false coin but there be more serious reflection to be make and worse thing to be record man be at bottom a savage horrible beast we know it if only in the business of tame and restrain he which we call civilisation hence it be that we be terrify if now and then he nature break out wherever and whenever the lock and chain of law and order fall off and give place to anarchy he show himself for what he be but it be unnecessary to wait for anarchy in order to gain enlightenment on this subject a hundred record old and new produce the conviction that in he unrelenting cruelty man be in no way inferior to the tiger and the hyaena a forcible example be supply by a publication of the year 1841 entitle _ slavery and the internal slave trade in the united state of north america : be reply to question transmit by the british anti-slavery society to the american anti-slavery society _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- this book constitute one of the heaviest indictment against the human race no one can put it down with a feeling of horror and few without tear for whatever the reader may have ever hear or imagine or dream of the unhappy condition of slavery or indeed of human cruelty in general it will seem small to he when he read of the way in which those devil in human form those bigoted church-going strictly sabbatarian rascal -- and in particular the anglican priest among they -- treat they innocent black brother who by wrong and violence have get into they diabolical clutch -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's ` note _ -- if schopenhauer be write to-day he would with equal truth point to the misery of the african trade i have slightly abridged this passage as some of the evil against which he protest no longer exist -rrb- other example be furnish by tshudus 's _ travel in peru _ in the description which he give of the treatment of the peruvian soldier at the hand of they officer and by macleod 's _ travel in eastern africa _ where the author tell of the cold-blooded and truly devilish cruelty with which the portuguese in mozambique treat they slave but we need not go for example to the new world that obverse side of we planet in the year 1848 it be bring to life that in england not in one but apparently in a hundred case within a brief period a husband have poison he wife or _ vice versâ _ or both have join in poisoning they child or in torture they slowly to death by starve and ill-treat they with no other object than to get the money for bury they which they have insure in the burial club against they death for this purpose a child be often insure in several even in as many as twenty club at once -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cf _ the time _ 20th 22nd and 23rd sept 1848 and also 12th dec 1853 -rrb- detail of this character belong indeed to the blackest page in the criminal record of humanity but when all be say it be the inward and innate character of man this god _ par excellence _ of the pantheist from which they and everything like they proceed in every man there dwell first and foremost a colossal egoism which break the bound of right and justice with the greatest freedom as everyday life show on a small scale and as history on every page of it on a large do not the recognize need of a balance of power in europe with the anxious way in which it be preserved demonstrate that man be a beast of prey who no sooner see a weaker man near he than he fall upon he without fail and do not the same hold good of the affair of ordinary life but to the boundless egoism of we nature there be join more or less in every human breast a fund of hatred anger envy rancor and malice accumulate like the venom in a serpent 's tooth and wait only for a opportunity of vent itself and then like a demon unchained of storm and rage if a man have no great occasion for break out he will end by take advantage of the smallest and by work it up into something great by the aid of he imagination for however small it may be it be enough to rouse he anger -- _ quantulacunque adeo est occasio sufficit ira -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ -- -lrb- footnote 1 : juvenal _ sit _ 13 183 -rrb- and then he will carry it as far as he can and may we see this in daily life where such outburst be well know under the name of vent one 's gall on something it will also have be observe that if such outburst meet with no opposition the subject of they feel decidedly the better for they afterwards that anger be not without its pleasure be a truth that be record even by aristotle -lrb- 1 -rrb- and he quote a passage from homer who declare anger to be sweeter than honey but not in anger alone -- in hatred too which stand to anger like a chronic to a acute disease a man may indulge with the greatest delight : -lrb- footnote 1 : _ rhet _ i 11 ii 2 -rrb- _ now hatred be by far the longest pleasure man love in haste but they detest at leisure _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : byron _ don juan _ c xiii 6 -rrb- gobineau in he work _ les race humaine _ have call man _ l'animal méchant par excellence _ people take this very ill because they feel that it hit they but he be quite right for man be the only animal which cause pain to other without any further purpose than just to cause it other animal never do it except to satisfy they hunger or in the rage of combat if it be say against the tiger that he kill more than eat he strangle he prey only for the purpose of eat it and if he can not eat it the only explanation be as the french phrase have it that _ se yeux sont plus grands que son estomac _ no animal ever torment another for the mere purpose of torment but man do it and it be this that constitute the diabolical feature in he character which be so much worse than the merely animal i have already speak of the matter in its broad aspect but it be manifest even in small thing and every reader have a daily opportunity of observe it for instance if two little dog be play together -- and what a genial and charming sight it be -- and a child of three or four year join they it be almost inevitable for it to begin hit they with a whip or stick and thereby show itself even at that age _ l'animal méchant par excellence _ the love of teasing and play trick which be common enough may be trace to the same source for instance if a man have express he annoyance at any interruption or other petty inconvenience there will be no lack of people who for that very reason will bring it about : _ animal méchant par excellence _ this be so certain that a man should be careful not to express any annoyance at small evil on the other hand he should also be careful not to express he pleasure at any trifle for if he do so man will act like the jailer who when he find that he prisoner have perform the laborious task of tame a spider and take a pleasure in watch it immediately crush it under he foot : _ l'animal méchant par excellence _ this be why all animal be instinctively afraid of the sight or even of the track of a man that _ animal méchant par excellence _ nor do they instinct they false for it be man alone who hunt game for which he have no use and which do he no harm it be a fact then that in the heart of every man there lie a wild beast which only wait for a opportunity to storm and rage in its desire to inflict pain on other or if they stand in he way to kill they it be this which be the source of all the lust of war and battle in try to tame and to some extent hold it in check the intelligence its appoint keeper have always enough to do people may if they please call it the radical evil of human nature -- a name which will at least serve those with whom a word stand for a explanation i say however that it be the will to live which more and more embittered by the constant suffering of existence seek to alleviate its own torment by cause torment in other but in this way a man gradually develop in himself real cruelty and malice the observation may also be add that as accord to kant matter subsist only through the antagonism of the power of expansion and contraction so human society subsist only by the antagonism of hatred or anger and fear for there be a moment in the life of all of we when the malignity of we nature might perhaps make we murderer if it be not accompany by a due admixture of fear to keep it within bound and this fear again would make a man the sport and laugh stock of every boy if anger be not lie ready in he and keep watch but it be _ schadenfreude _ a mischievous delight in the misfortune of other which remain the worst trait in human nature it be a feeling which be closely akin to cruelty and differ from it to say the truth only as theory from practice in general it may be say of it that it take the place which pity ought to take -- pity which be its opposite and the true source of all real justice and charity _ envy _ be also oppose to pity but in another sense envy that be to say be produce by a cause directly antagonistic to that which produce the delight in mischief the opposition between pity and envy on the one hand and pity and the delight in mischief on the other rest in the main on the occasion which call they forth in the case of envy it be only as a direct effect of the cause which excite it that we feel it at all that be just the reason why envy although it be a reprehensible feeling still admit of some excuse and be in general a very human quality whereas the delight in mischief be diabolical and its taunt be the laughter of hell the delight in mischief as i have say take the place which pity ought to take envy on the contrary find a place only where there be no inducement to pity or rather a inducement to its opposite and it be just as this opposite that envy arise in the human breast and so far therefore it may still be reckon a human sentiment nay i be afraid that no one will be find to be entirely free from it for that a man should feel he own lack of thing more bitterly at the sight of another 's delight in the enjoyment of they be natural nay it be inevitable but this should not rouse he hatred of the man who be happier than himself it be just this hatred however in which true envy consist least of all should a man be envious when it be a question not of the gift of fortune or chance or another 's favor but of the gift of nature because everything that be innate in a man rest on a metaphysical basis and possess justification of a higher kind it be so to speak give he by divine grace but unhappily it be just in the case of personal advantage that envy be most irreconcilable thus it be that intelligence or even genius can not get on in the world without beg pardon for its existence wherever it be not in a position to be able proudly and boldly to despise the world in other word if envy be arouse only by wealth rank or power it be often keep down by egoism which perceive that on occasion assistance enjoyment support protection advancement and so on may be hope for from the object of envy or that at least by intercourse with he a man may himself win honor from the reflect light of he superiority and here too there be the hope of one day attain all those advantage himself on the other hand in the envy that be direct to natural gift and personal advantage like beauty in woman or intelligence in man there be no consolation or hope of one kind or the other so that nothing remain but to indulge a bitter and irreconcilable hatred of the person who possess these privilege and hence the only remain desire be to take vengeance on he but here the envious man find himself in a unfortunate position for all he blow fall powerless as soon as it be know that they come from he accordingly he hide he feeling as carefully as if they be secret sin and so become a inexhaustible inventor of trick and artifice and device for conceal and mask he procedure in order that unperceive he may wind the object of he envy for instance with a air of the utmost unconcern he will ignore the advantage which be eat he heart out he will neither see they nor know they nor have observe or even hear of they and thus make himself a master in the art of dissimulation with great cunning he will completely overlook the man whose brilliant quality be gnawing at he heart and act as though he be quite a unimportant person he will take no notice of he and on occasion will have even quite forget he existence but at the same time he will before all thing endeavor by secret machination carefully to deprive those advantage of any opportunity of show themselves and become known then out of he dark corner he will attack these quality with censure mockery ridicule and calumny like the toad which spurt its poison from a hole no less will he enthusiastically praise unimportant people or even indifferent or bad performance in the same sphere in short he will become a protea in stratagem in order to wind other without show himself but what be the use of it the trained eye recognize he in spite of it all he betray himself if by nothing else by the way in which he timidly avoid and fly from the object of he envy who stand the more completely alone the more brilliant he be and this be the reason why pretty girl have no friend of they own sex he betray himself too by the causeless hatred which he show -- a hatred which find vent in a violent explosion at any circumstance however trivial though it be often only the product of he imagination how many such man there be in the world may be recognize by the universal praise of modesty that be of a virtue invent on behalf of dull and commonplace people nevertheless it be a virtue which by exhibit the necessity for deal considerately with the wretched plight of these people be just what call attention to it for we self-consciousness and we pride there can be nothing more flattering than the sight of envy lurk in its retreat and plot its scheme but never let a man forget that where there be envy there be hatred and let he be careful not to make a false friend out of any envious person therefore it be important to we safety to lay envy bare and a man should study to discover its trick as it be everywhere to be find and always go about _ incognito _ or as i have say like a venomous toad it lurk in dark corner it deserve neither quarter nor sympathy but as we can never reconcile it let we rule of conduct be to scorn it with a good heart and as we happiness and glory be torture to it we may rejoice in its suffering : _ den neid wirst nimmer du versöhnen so magst du ihn getrost verhöhnen dein glück dein ruhm ist ihm ein leiden : magst drum a seiner quaal dich weiden _ we have be take a look at the _ depravity _ of man and it be a sight which may well fill we with horror but now we must cast we eye on the _ misery _ of he existence and when we have do so and be horrify by that too we must look back again at he depravity we shall then find that they hold the balance to each other we shall perceive the eternal justice of thing for we shall recognize that the world be itself the last judgment on it and we shall begin to understand why it be that everything that live must pay the penalty of its existence first in living and then in die thus the evil of the penalty accord with the evil of the sin -- _ malum poenae _ with _ malum culpa _ from the same point of view we lose we indignation at that intellectual incapacity of the great majority of mankind which in life so often disgust we in this _ sansara _ as the buddhist call it human misery human depravity and human folly correspond with one another perfectly and they be of like magnitude but if on some special inducement we direct we gaze to one of they and survey it in particular it seem to exceed the other two this however be a illusion and merely the effect of they colossal range all thing proclaim this _ sansara _ more than all else the world of mankind in which from a moral point of view villainy and baseness and from a intellectual point of view incapacity and stupidity prevail to a horrifying extent nevertheless there appear in it although very spasmodically and always as a fresh surprise manifestation of honesty of goodness nay even of nobility and also of great intelligence of the think mind of genius they never quite vanish but like single point of light gleam upon we out of the great dark mass we must accept they as a pledge that this _ sansara _ contain a good and redeeming principle which be capable of break through and of fill and free the whole of it \* \* \* \* \* the reader of my _ ethic _ know that with I the ultimate foundation of morality be the truth which in the _ veda _ and the _ vedanta _ receive its expression in the established mystical formulum _ tat twam asus -lrb- this be thyself _ -rrb- which be speak with reference to every living thing be it man or beast and be call the _ mahavakya _ the great word action which proceed in accordance with this principle such as those of the philanthropist may indeed be regard as the beginning of mysticism every benefit render with a pure intention proclaim that the man who exercise it act in direct conflict with the world of appearance for he recognize himself as identical with another individual who exist in complete separation from he accordingly all disinterested kindness be inexplicable it be a mystery and hence in order to explain it a man have to resort to all sort of fiction when kant have demolish all other argument for theism he admit one only that it give the best interpretation and solution of such mysterious action and of all other like they he therefore allow it to stand as a presumption unsusceptible indeed of theoretical proof but valid from a practical point of view i may however express my doubt whether he be quite serious about it for to make morality rest on theism be really to reduce morality to egoism although the english it be true as also the lowest class of society with we do not perceive the possibility of any other foundation for it the above-mentioned recognition of a man 's own true be in another individual objectively present to he be exhibit in a particularly beautiful and clear way in the case in which a man already destine to death beyond any hope of rescue give himself up to the welfare of other with great solicitude and zeal and try to save they of this kind be the well-known story of a servant who be bite in a courtyard at night by a mad dog in the belief that she be beyond hope she seize the dog and drag it into a stable which she then lock so that no one else might be bite then again there be the incident in naple which tischbein have immortalise in one of he _ aquarelle _ a son flee from the lava which be rapidly streaming toward the sea be carry he aged father on he back when there be only a narrow strip of land leave between the devour element the father bid the son put he down so that the son may save himself by flight as otherwise both will be lose the son obey and as he go cast a glance of farewell on he father this be the moment depict the historical circumstance which scott represent in he masterly way in _ the heart of midlothian _ chap ii be of a precisely similar kind where of two delinquent condemn to death the one who by he awkwardness cause the capture of the other happily set he free in the chapel by overpower the guard after the execution-sermon without at the same time make any attempt on he own behalf nay in the same category must also be place the scene which be represent in a common engraving which may perhaps be objectionable to western reader -- i mean the one in which a soldier kneel to be shoot be try by wave a cloth to frighten away he dog who want to come to he in all these case we see a individual in the face of he own immediate and certain destruction no longer think of save himself so that he may direct the whole of he effort to save some one else how could there be a clearer expression of the consciousness that what be be destroy be only a phenomenon and that the destruction itself be only a phenomenon that on the other hand the real being of the man who meet he death be untouched by that event and live on in the other man in whom even now as he action betray he so clearly perceive it to exist for if this be not so and it be he real be which be about to be annihilate how could that be spend its last effort in show such a ardent sympathy in the welfare and continue existence of another there be two different way in which a man may become conscious of he own existence on the one hand he may have a empirical perception of it as it manifest itself externally -- something so small that it approach vanish point set in a world which as regard time and space be infinite one only of the thousand million of human creature who run about on this planet for a very brief period and be renew every thirty year on the other hand by go down into the depths of he own nature a man may become conscious that he be all in all that in fact he be the only real be and that in addition this real be perceive itself again in other who present themselves from without as though they form a mirror of himself of these two way in which a man may come to know what he be the first grasp the phenomenon alone the mere product of _ the principle of individuation _ whereas the second make a man immediately conscious that he be _ the thing-in-itself _ this be a doctrine in which as regard the first way i have kant and as regard both i have the _ veda _ to support I there be it be true a simple objection to the second method it may be say to assume that one and the same being can exist in different place at the same time and yet be complete in each of they although from a empirical point of view this be the most palpable impossibility -- nay absurdity -- it be nevertheless perfectly true of the thing-in-itself the impossibility and the absurdity of it empirically be only due to the form which phenomenon assume in accordance with the principle of individuation for the thing-in-itself the will to live exist whole and undivided in every be even in the smallest as completely as in the sum-total of all thing that ever be or be or will be this be why every be even the smallest say to itself so long as i be safe let the world perish -- _ dum ego salvus sim pereat mundus _ and in truth even if only one individual be leave in the world and all the rest be to perish the one that remain would still possess the whole self-being of the world uninjured and undiminished and would laugh at the destruction of the world as a illusion this conclusion _ per impossible _ may be balance by the counter-conclusion which be on all fours with it that if that last individual be to be annihilate in and with he the whole world would be destroy it be in this sense that the mystic angela silesius -lrb- 1 -rrb- declare that god could not live for a moment without he and that if he be to be annihilate god must of necessity give up the ghost : _ ich weiss dass ohne mich gott nicht ein nu kann leben werd ' ich zunicht er muss von noth den geist aufgeben _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- angelus silesius see _ counsel and maxim _ p 39 note -rrb- but the empirical point of view also to some extent enable we to perceive that it be true or at least possible that we self can exist in other being whose consciousness be separate and different from we own that this be so be show by the experience of somnambulist although the identity of they ego be preserve throughout they know nothing when they awake of all that a moment before they themselves say do or suffer so entirely be the individual consciousness a phenomenon that even in the same ego two consciousness can arise of which the one know nothing of the other government it be a characteristic fail of the german to look in the cloud for what lie at they foot a excellent example of this be furnish by the treatment which the idea of _ natural right _ have receive at the hand of professor of philosophy when they be call upon to explain those simple relation of human life which make up the substance of this right such as right and wrong property state punishment and so on they have recourse to the most extravagant abstract remote and meaningless conception and out of they build a tower of babel reach to the cloud and take this or that form accord to the special whim of the professor for the time be the clearest and simplest relation of life such as affect we directly be thus make quite unintelligible to the great detriment of the young people who be educate in such a school these relation themselves be perfectly simple and easily understand -- as the reader may convince himself if he will turn to the account which i have give of they in the _ foundation of morality _ § 17 and in my chief work bk i § 62 but at the sound of certain word like right freedom the good being -- this nugatory infinitive of the cupola -- and many other of the same sort the german 's head begin to swim and fall straightway into a kind of delirium he launch forth into high-flown phrase which have no meaning whatever he take the most remote and empty conception and string they together artificially instead of fix he eye on the fact and look at thing and relation as they really be it be these thing and relation which supply the idea of right and freedom and give they the only true meaning that they possess the man who start from the preconceived opinion that the conception of right must be a positive one and then attempt to define it will fail for he be try to grasp a shadow to pursue a spectre to search for what do not exist the conception of right be a negative one like the conception of freedom its content be mere negation it be the conception of wrong which be positive wrong have the same significance as _ injury _ -- _ laesio _ -- in the widest sense of the term a injury may be do either to a man 's person or to he property or to he honor and accordingly a man 's rights be easy to define : every one have a right to do anything that injure no one else to have a right to do or claim a thing mean nothing more than to be able to do or take or vise it without thereby injure any one else _ simplex sigillum verus _ this definition show how senseless many question be for instance the question whether we have the right to take we own life as far as concern the personal claim which other may possibly have upon we they be subject to the condition that we be alive and fall to the ground when we die to demand of a man who do not care to live any longer for himself that he should live on as a mere machine for the advantage of other be a extravagant pretension although man 's power differ they rights be alike they rights do not rest upon they power because right be of a moral complexion they rest on the fact that the same will to live show itself in every man at the same stage of its manifestation this however only apply to that original and abstract right which a man possess as a man the property and also the honor which a man acquire for himself by the exercise of he power depend on the measure and kind of power which he possess and so lend he right a wider sphere of application here then equality come to a end the man who be better equipped or more active increase by add to he gain not he right but the number of the thing to which it extend in my chief work -lrb- 1 -rrb- i have prove that the state in its essence be merely a institution exist for the purpose of protect its member against outward attack or inward dissension it follow from this that the ultimate ground on which the state be necessary be the acknowledged lack of right in the human race if right be there no one would think of a state for no one would have any fear that he rights would be impaired and a mere union against the attack of wild beast or the element would have very little analogy with what we mean by a state from this point of view it be easy to see how dull and stupid be the philosophaster who in pompous phrase represent that the state be the supreme end and flower of human existence such a view be the apotheosis of philistinism -lrb- footnote 1 : 1 bk ii ch xlvii -rrb- if it be right that rule in the world a man would have do enough in build he house and would need no other protection than the right of possess it which would be obvious but since wrong be the order of the day it be requisite that the man who have build he house should also be able to protect it otherwise he right be _ de facto _ incomplete the aggressor that be to say have the right of might -- _ faustrecht _ and this be just the conception of right which spinoza entertain he recognize no other he word be : _ unusquisque tantum juri habet quantum potentium valet _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- each man have as much right as he have power and again : _ uniuscujusque jus potentium ejus definitur _ each man 's right be determine by he power -lrb- 2 -rrb- hobbe seem to have start this conception of right -lrb- 3 -rrb- and he add the strange comment that the right of the good lord to all thing rest on nothing but he omnipotence -lrb- footnote 1 : _ tract theol pol _ ch ii § 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ethic _ iv xxxvii 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : particularly in a passage in the _ de cive _ i § 14 -rrb- now this be a conception of right which both in theory and in practice no longer prevail in the civic world but in the world in general though abolish in theory it continue to apply in practice the consequence of neglect it may be see in the case of china threaten by rebellion within and foe without this great empire be in a defenceless state and have to pay the penalty of have cultivate only the art of peace and ignore the art of war there be a certain analogy between the operation of nature and those of man which be a peculiar but not fortuitous character and be base on the identity of the will in both when the herbivorous animal have take they place in the organic world beast of prey make they appearance -- necessarily a late appearance -- in each species and proceed to live upon they just in the same way as soon as by honest toil and in the sweat of they face man have win from the ground what be need for the support of they society a number of individual be sure to arise in some of these society who instead of cultivate the earth and living on its produce prefer to take they life in they hand and risk health and freedom by fall upon those who be in possession of what they have honestly earn and by appropriate the fruit of they labor these be the beast of prey in the human race they be the conquer people whom we find everywhere in history from the most ancient to the most recent time they vary fortune as at one moment they succeed and at another fail make up the general element of the history of the world hence voltaire be perfectly right when he say that the aim of all war be robbery that those who engage in it be ashamed of they doings be clear by the fact that government loudly protest they reluctance to appeal to arm except for purpose of self-defence instead of try to excuse themselves by tell public and official lie which be almost more revolting than war itself they should take they stand as bold as brass on macchiavellus 's doctrine the gist of it may be state to be this : that whereas between one individual and another and so far as concern the law and morality of they relation the principle _ do not do to other what you would not like do to yourself _ certainly apply it be the converse of this principle which be appropriate in the case of nation and in politics : _ what you would not like do to yourself do to other _ if you do not want to be put under a foreign yoke take time by the forelock and put you neighbor under it himself whenever that be to say he weakness offer you the opportunity for if you let the opportunity pass it will desert one day to the enemy 's camp and offer itself there then you enemy will put you under he yoke and you failure to grasp the opportunity may be pay for not by the generation which be guilty of it but by the next this macchiavellian principle be always a much more decent cloak for the lust of robbery than the rag of very obvious lie in a speech from the head of the state lie too of a description which recall the well-known story of the rabbit attack the dog every state look upon its neighbor as at bottom a horde of robber who will fall upon it as soon as they have the opportunity \* \* \* \* \* between the serf the farmer the tenant and the mortgagee the difference be rather one of form than of substance whether the peasant belong to I or the land on which he have to get a living whether the bird be mine or its food the tree or its fruit be a matter of little moment for as shakespeare make shylock say : _ you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live _ the free peasant have indeed the advantage that he can go off and seek he fortune in the wide world whereas the serf who be attach to the soil _ gleba adscriptus _ have a advantage which be perhaps still greater that when failure of crop or illness old age or incapacity render he helpless he master must look after he and so he sleep well at night whereas if the crop fail he master toss about on he bed try to think how he be to procure bread for he man as long ago as menander it be say that it be better to be the slave of a good master than to live miserably as a freeman another advantage possess by the free be that if they have any talent they can improve they position but the same advantage be not wholly withhold from the slave if he prove himself useful to he master by the exercise of any skill he be treat accordingly just as in ancient rome mechanic foreman of workshop architect nay even doctor be generally slave slavery and poverty then be only two form i might almost say only two name of the same thing the essence of which be that a man 's physical power be employ in the main not for himself but for other and this lead partly to he be over-loaded with work and partly to he get a scanty satisfaction for he need for nature have give a man only as much physical power as will suffice if he exert it in moderation to gain a sustenance from the earth no great superfluity of power be he if then a not inconsiderable number of man be relieve from the common burden of sustain the existence of the human race the burden of the remainder be augmented and they suffer this be the chief source of the evil which under the name of slavery or under the name of the proletariat have always oppress the great majority of the human race but the more remote cause of it be luxury in order it may be say that some few person may have what be unnecessary superfluous and the product of refinement -- nay in order that they may satisfy artificial need -- a great part of the exist power of mankind have to be devote to this object and therefore withdraw from the production of what be necessary and indispensable instead of building cottage for themselves thousand of man build mansion for a few instead of weave coarse material for themselves and they family they make fine cloth silk or even lace for the rich and in general manufacture a thousand object of luxury for they pleasure a great part of the urban population consist of workman who make these article of luxury and for they and those who give they work the peasant have to plough and sow and look after the flock as well as for themselves and thus have more labor than nature originally impose upon they moreover the urban population devote a great deal of physical strength and a great deal of land to such thing as wine silk tobacco hop asparagus and so on instead of to corn potato and cattle-breeding further a number of man be withdraw from agriculture and employ in ship-building and seafaring in order that sugar coffee tea and other goods may be import in short a large part of the power of the human race be take away from the production of what be necessary in order to bring what be superfluous and unnecessary within the reach of a few as long therefore as luxury exist there must be a corresponding amount of over-work and misery whether it take the name of poverty or of slavery the fundamental difference between the two be that slavery originate in violence and poverty in craft the whole unnatural condition of society -- the universal struggle to escape from misery the sea-trade attend with so much loss of life the complicated interest of commerce and finally the war to which it all give rise -- be due only and alone to luxury which give no happiness even to those who enjoy it nay make they ill and bad-tempered accordingly it look as if the most effective way of alleviate human misery would be to diminish luxury or even abolish it altogether there be unquestionably much truth in this train of thought but the conclusion at which it arrive be refute by a argument possess this advantage over it -- that it be confirm by the testimony of experience a certain amount of work be devote to purpose of luxury what the human race lose in this way in the _ muscular power _ which would otherwise be available for the necessity of existence be gradually make up to it a thousandfold by the _ nervous power _ which in a chemical sense be thereby release and since the intelligence and sensibility which be thus promote be on a higher level than the muscular irritability which they supplant so the achievement of mind exceed those of the body a thousandfold one wise counsel be worth the work of many hand : -lrb- greek : ho en sophon bouleuma ta pollon cheira nika -rrb- a nation of nothing but peasant would do little in the way of discovery and invention but idle hand make active head science and the art be themselves the child of luxury and they discharge they debt to it the work which they do be to perfect technology in all its branch mechanical chemical and physical a art which in we day have bring machinery to a pitch never dream of before and in particular have by steam and electricity accomplished thing the like of which would in earlier age have be ascribe to the agency of the devil in manufacture of all kind and to some extent in agriculture machine now do a thousand time more than could ever have be do by the hand of all the well-to-do educate and professional class and could ever have be attain if all luxury have be abolish and every one have return to the life of a peasant it be by no mean the rich alone but all class who derive benefit from these industry thing which in former day hardly any one could afford be now cheap and abundant and even the lowest class be much better off in point of comfort in the middle age a king of england once borrow a pair of silk stocking from one of he lord so that he might wear they in give a audience to the french ambassador even queen elizabeth be greatly pleased and astonished to receive a pair as a new year 's present to-day every shopman have they fifty year ago lady wear the kind of calico gown which servant wear now if mechanical science continue to progress at the same rate for any length of time it may end by save human labor almost entirely just as horse be even now be largely supersede by machine for it be possible to conceive that intellectual culture might in some degree become general in the human race and this would be impossible as long as bodily labor be incumbent on any great part of it muscular irritability and nervous sensibility be always and everywhere both generally and particularly in antagonism for the simple reason that it be one and the same vital power which underlie both further since the art have a softening effect on character it be possible that quarrel great and small war and duel will vanish from the world just as both have become much rarer occurrence however it be not my object here to write a _ utopia _ but apart from all this the argument use above in favor of the abolition of luxury and the uniform distribution of all bodily labor be open to the objection that the great mass of mankind always and everywhere can not do without leader guide and counsellor in one shape or another accord to the matter in question judge governor general official priest doctor man of learn philosopher and so on be all a necessity they common task be to lead the race for the greater part so incapable and perverse through the labyrinth of life of which each of they accord to he position and capacity have obtain a general view be he range wide or narrow that these guide of the race should be permanently relieve of all bodily labor as well as of all vulgar need and discomfort nay that in proportion to they much greater achievement they should necessarily own and enjoy more than the common man be natural and reasonable great merchant should also be include in the same privileged class whenever they make far-sighted preparation for national need the question of the sovereignty of the people be at bottom the same as the question whether any man can have a original right to rule a people against its will how that proposition can be reasonably maintain i do not see the people it must be admit be sovereign but it be a sovereign who be always a minor it must have permanent guardian and it can never exercise its rights itself without create danger of which no one can foresee the end especially as like all minor it be very apt to become the sport of design sharper in the shape of what be call demagogue voltaire remark that the first man to become a king be a successful soldier it be certainly the case that all prince be originally victorious leader of army and for a long time it be as such that they bear sway on the rise of stand army prince begin to regard they people as a means of sustain themselves and they soldier and treat they accordingly as though they be a herd of cattle which have to be tend in order that it might provide wool milk and meat the why and wherefore of all this as i shall presently show in detail be the fact that originally it be not right but might that rule in the world might have the advantage of have be the first in the field that be why it be impossible to do away with it and abolish it altogether it must always have its place and all that a man can wish or ask be that it should be find on the side of right and associate with it accordingly say the prince to he subject : i rule you in virtue of the power which i possess but on the other hand it exclude that of any one else and i shall suffer none but my own whether it come from without or arise within by one of you try to oppress another in this way then you be protect the arrangement be carry out and just because it be carry out the old idea of kingship develop with time and progress into quite a different idea and put the other one in the background where it may still be see now and then flit about like a spectre its place have be take by the idea of the king as father of he people as the firm and unshakable pillar which alone support and maintain the whole organization of law and order and consequently the rights of every man -lrb- 1 -rrb- but a king can accomplish this only by inborn prerogative which reserve authority to he and to he alone -- a authority which be supreme indubitable and beyond all attack nay to which every one render instinctive obedience hence the king be rightly say to rule by the grace of god he be always the most useful person in the state and he service be never too dearly repay by any civil list however heavy -lrb- footnote 1 : we read in stobaeus _ florilegium _ ch xliv 41 of a persian custom by which whenever a king die there be a five day ' anarchy in order that people might perceive the advantage of have king and law -rrb- but even as late a writer as macchiavellus be so decidedly imbue with the earlier or mediaeval conception of the position of a prince that he treat it as a matter which be self-evident : he never discuss it but tacitly take it as the presupposition and basis of he advice it may be say generally that he book be merely the theoretical statement and consistent and systematic exposition of the practice prevail in he time it be the novel statement of it in a complete theoretical form that lend it such a poignant interest the same thing i may remark in pass apply to the immortal little work of la rochefaucauld who however take private and not public life for he theme and offer not advice but observation the title of this fine little book be open perhaps to some objection : the contents be not as a rule either _ maxim _ or _ reflection _ but _ aperçus _ and that be what they should be call there be much too in macchiavellus that will be find also to apply to private life right in itself be powerless in nature it be might that rule to enlist might on the side of right so that by means of it right may rule be the problem of statesmanship and it be indeed a hard problem as will be obvious if we remember that almost every human breast be the seat of a egoism which have no limit and be usually associate with a accumulate store of hatred and malice so that at the very start feeling of enmity largely prevail over those of friendship we have also to bear in mind that it be many million of individual so constitute who have to be keep in the bond of law and order peace and tranquillity whereas originally every one have a right to say to every one else : _ i be just as good as you be _ a consideration of all this must fill we with surprise that on the whole the world pursue its way so peacefully and quietly and with so much law and order as we see to exist it be the machinery of state which alone accomplish it for it be physical power alone which have any direct action on man constitute as they generally be it be for physical power alone that they have any feeling or respect if a man would convince himself by experience that this be the case he need do nothing but remove all compulsion from he fellow and try to govern they by clearly and forcibly represent to they what be reasonable right and fair though at the same time it may be contrary to they interest he would be laugh to scorn and as thing go that be the only answer he would get it would soon be obvious to he that moral force alone be powerless it be then physical force alone which be capable of secure respect now this force ultimately reside in the mass where it be associate with ignorance stupidity and injustice accordingly the main aim of statesmanship in these difficult circumstance be to put physical force in subjection to mental force -- to intellectual superiority and thus to make it serviceable but if this aim be not itself accompany by justice and good intention the result of the business if it succeed be that the state so erect consist of knave and fool the deceiver and the deceive that this be the case be make gradually evident by the progress of intelligence amongst the mass however much it may be repress and it lead to revolution but if contrarily intelligence be accompany by justice and good intention there arise a state as perfect as the character of human affair will allow it be very much to the purpose if justice and good intention not only exist but be also demonstrable and openly exhibit and can be call to account publicly and be subject to control care must be take however lest the result participation of many person in the work of government should affect the unity of the state and inflict a loss of strength and concentration on the power by which its home and foreign affair have to be administer this be what almost always happen in republic to produce a constitution which should satisfy all these demand would accordingly be the highest aim of statesmanship but as a matter of fact statesmanship have to consider other thing as well it have to reckon with the people as they exist and they national peculiarity this be the raw material on which it have to work and the ingredient of that material will always exercise a great effect on the complete scheme statesmanship will have achieve a good deal if it so far attain its object as to reduce wrong and injustice in the community to a minimum to banish they altogether and to leave no trace of they be merely the ideal to be aim at and it be only approximately that it can be reach if they disappear in one direction they creep in again in another for wrong and injustice lie deeply root in human nature attempt have be make to attain the desire aim by artificial constitution and systematic code of law but they be not in complete touch with the fact -- they remain a asymptote for the simple reason that hard and fast conception never embrace all possible case and can not be make to meet individual instance such conception resemble the stone of a mosaic rather than the delicate shading in a picture nay more : all experiment in this matter be attend with danger because the material in question namely the human race be the most difficult of all material to handle it be almost as dangerous as a explosive no doubt it be true that in the machinery of the state the freedom of the press perform the same function as a safety-valve in other machinery for it enable all discontent to find a voice nay in do so the discontent exhaust itself if it have not much substance and if it have there be a advantage in recognize it betime and apply the remedy this be much better than to repress the discontent and let it simmer and ferment and go on increase until it end in a explosion on the other hand the freedom of the press may be regard as a permission to sell poison -- poison for the heart and the mind there be no idea so foolish but that it can not be put into the head of the ignorant and incapable multitude especially if the idea hold out some prospect of any gain or advantage and when a man have get hold of any such idea what be there that he will not do i be therefore very much afraid that the danger of a free press outweigh its utility particularly where the law offer a way of redress wrong in any case however the freedom of the press should be govern by a very strict prohibition of all and every anonymity generally indeed it may be maintain that right be of a nature analogous to that of certain chemical substance which can not be exhibit in a pure and isolate condition but at the most only with a small admixture of some other substance which serve as a vehicle for they or give they the necessary consistency such as fluorine or even alcohol or prussic acid pursue the analogy we may say that right if it be to gain a footing in the world and really prevail must of necessity be supplement by a small amount of arbitrary force in order that notwithstanding its merely ideal and therefore ethereal nature it may be able to work and subsist in the real and material world and not evaporate and vanish into the cloud as it do in hesoid birth-right of every description all heritable privilege every form of national religion and so on may be regard as the necessary chemical base or alloy inasmuch as it be only when right have some such firm and actual foundation that it can be enforce and consistently vindicate they form for right a sort of -lrb- greek : os moi pou sto -rrb- -- a fulcrum for support its lever linnaeus adopt a vegetable system of a artificial and arbitrary character it can not be replace by a natural one no matter how reasonable the change might be or how often it have be attempt to make it because no other system could ever yield the same certainty and stability of definition just in the same way the artificial and arbitrary basis on which as have be show the constitution of a state rest can never be replace by a purely natural basis a natural basis would aim at do away with the condition that have be mention : in the place of the privilege of birth it would put those of personal merit in the place of the national religion the result of rationalistic inquiry and so on however agreeable to reason this might all prove the change could not be make because a natural basis would lack that certainty and fixity of definition which alone secure the stability of the commonwealth a constitution which embody abstract right alone would be a excellent thing for nature other than human but since the great majority of man be extremely egoistic unjust inconsiderate deceitful and sometimes even malicious since in addition they be endowed with very scanty intelligence there arise the necessity for a power that shall be concentrate in one man a power that shall be above all law and right and be completely irresponsible nay to which everything shall yield as to something that be regard as a creature of a higher kind a ruler by the grace of god it be only thus that man can be permanently hold in check and govern the united state of north america exhibit the attempt to proceed without any such arbitrary basis that be to say to allow abstract right to prevail pure and unalloyed but the result be not attractive for with all the material prosperity of the country what do we find the prevail sentiment be a base utilitarianism with its inevitable companion ignorance and it be this that have pave the way for a union of stupid anglican bigotry foolish prejudice coarse brutality and a childish veneration of woman even worse thing be the order of the day : most iniquitous oppression of the black freeman lynch law frequent assassination often commit with entire impunity duel of a savagery elsewhere unknown now and then open scorn of all law and justice repudiation of public debt abominable political rascality towards a neighbouring state follow by a mercenary raid on its rich territory -- afterwards seek to be excuse on the part of the chief authority of the state by lie which every one in the country know to be such and laugh at -- a ever-increasing ochlocracy and finally all the disastrous influence which this abnegation of justice in high quarter must have exercise on private moral this specimen of a pure constitution on the obverse side of the planet say very little for republic in general but still less for the imitation of it in mexico guatemalum colombium and peru a peculiar disadvantage attach to republic -- and one that might not be look for -- be that in this form of government it must be more difficult for man of ability to attain high position and exercise direct political influence than in the case of monarchy for always and everywhere and under all circumstance there be a conspiracy or instinctive alliance against such man on the part of all the stupid the weak and the commonplace they look upon such man as they natural enemy and they be firmly hold together by a common fear of they there be always a numerous host of the stupid and the weak and in a republican constitution it be easy for they to suppress and exclude the man of ability so that they may not be outflank by they they be fifty to one and here all have equal rights at the start in a monarchy on the other hand this natural and universal league of the stupid against those who be possess of intellectual advantage be a one-sided affair it exist only from below for in a monarchy talent and intelligence receive a natural advocacy and support from above in the first place the position of the monarch himself be much too high and too firm for he to stand in fear of any sort of competition in the next place he serve the state more by he will than by he intelligence for no intelligence could ever be equal to all the demand that would in he case be make upon it he be therefore compel to be always avail himself of other man 's intelligence see that he own interest be securely bind up with those of he country that they be inseparable from they and one with they he will naturally give the preference to the best man because they be he most serviceable instrument and he will bestow he favor upon they -- as soon that be as he can find they which be not so difficult if only a honest search be make just in the same way even minister of state have too much advantage over rise politician to need to regard they with jealousy and accordingly for analogous reason they be glad to single out distinguished man and set they to work in order to make use of they power for themselves it be in this way that intelligence have always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe stupidity and the advantage which it gain be very great in general the monarchical form of government be that which be natural to man just as it be natural to bee and ant to a flight of crane a herd of wander elephant a pack of wolf seek prey in common and many other animal all of which place one of they number at the head of the business in hand every business in which man engage if it be attend with danger -- every campaign every ship at sea -- must also be subject to the authority of one commander everywhere it be one will that must lead even the animal organism be construct on a monarchical principle : it be the brain alone which guide and govern and exercise the hegemony although heart lung and stomach contribute much more to the continue existence of the whole body these philistine can not on that account be allow to guide and lead that be a business which belong solely to the brain government must proceed from one central point even the solar system be monarchical on the other hand a republic be as unnatural as it be unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the art and science accordingly we find that everywhere in the world and at all time nation whether civilised or savage or occupy a position between the two be always under monarchical government the rule of many as homer say be not a good thing : let there be one ruler one king -lrb- greek : ouk agathon polykoiraniae-ei koirano esto eis basoleus -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ iliad _ ii 204 -rrb- how would it be possible that everywhere and at all time we should see many million of people nay even hundred of million become the willing and obedient subject of one man sometimes even one woman and provisionally even of a child unless there be a monarchical instinct in man which drive they to it as the form of government best suit to they this arrangement be not the product of reflection everywhere one man be king and for the most part he dignity be hereditary he be as it be the personification the monogram of the whole people which attain a individuality in he in this sense he can rightly say : _ l'etat c'est moi _ it be precisely for this reason that in shakespeare 's historical play the king of england and france mutually address each other as _ france _ and _ england _ and the duke of austrium go by the name of he country it be as though the king regard themselves as the incarnation of they nationality it be all in accordance with human nature and for this very reason the hereditary monarch can not separate he own welfare and that of he family from the welfare of he country as on the other hand mostly happen when the monarch be elect as for instance in the state of the church -lrb- 1 -rrb- the chinese can conceive of a monarchical government only what a republic be they utterly fail to understand when a dutch legation be in china in the year 1658 it be oblige to represent that the prince of orange be they king as otherwise the chinese would have be incline to take holland for a nest of pirate live without any lord or master -lrb- 2 -rrb- stobaeus in a chapter in he _ florilegium _ at the head of which he write _ that monarchy be best _ collect the best of the passage in which the ancient explain the advantage of that form of government in a word republic be unnatural and artificial they be the product of reflection hence it be that they occur only as rare exception in the whole history of the world there be the small greek republic the roman and the carthaginian but they be all render possible by the fact that five-sixth perhaps even seven-eighths of the population consist of slave in the year 1840 even in the united state there be three million slave to a population of sixteen million then again the duration of the republic of antiquity compare with that of monarchy be very short republic be very easy to find and very difficult to maintain while with monarchy it be exactly the reverse if it be utopian scheme that be wanted i say this : the only solution of the problem would be a despotism of the wise and the noble of the true aristocracy and the genuine nobility bring about by the method of generation -- that be by the marriage of the noblest man with the cleverest and most intellectual woman this be my utopia my republic of plato -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- the reader will recollect that schopenhauer be write long before the papal territory be absorb into the kingdom of italy -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see jean nieuhoff _ l'ambassade de la compagnie orientale des province uny ver l'empereur de la chine _ traduit par jean le charpentier à leyde 1665 ch 45 -rrb- constitutional king be undoubtedly in much the same position as the god of epicurus who sit upon high in undisturbed bliss and tranquillity and do not meddle with human affair just now they be the fashion in every german duodecimo-principality a parody of the english constitution be set up quite complete from upper and lower house down to the habeas corpus act and trial by jury these institution which proceed from english character and english circumstance and presuppose both be natural and suitable to the english people it be just as natural to the german people to be split up into a number of different stock under a similar number of ruling prince with a emperor over they all who maintain peace at home and represent the unity of the state board it be a arrangement which have proceed from german character and german circumstance i be of opinion that if germany be not to meet with the same fate as italy it must restore the imperial crown which be do away with by its arch-enemy the first napoleon and it must restore it as effectively as possible -lrb- 1 -rrb- for german unity depend on it and without the imperial crown it will always be merely nominal or precarious but as we no longer live in the day of günther of schwarzburg when the choice of emperor be a serious business the imperial crown ought to go alternately to prussium and to austria for the life of the wearer in any case the absolute sovereignty of the small state be illusory napoleon i do for germany what otto the great do for italy : he divide it into small independent state on the principle _ divide et impera _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- here again it be hardly necessary to say that schopenhauer who die in 1860 and write this passage at least some year previously can not be refer to any of the event which culminate in 1870 the whole passage form a striking illustration of he political sagacity -rrb- the english show they great intelligence amongst other way by cling to they ancient institution custom and usage and by hold they sacred even at the risk of carry this tenacity too far and make it ridiculous they hold they sacred for the simple reason that those institution and custom be not the invention of a idle head but have grow up gradually by the force of circumstance and the wisdom of life itself and be therefore suit to they as a nation on the other hand the german michel -lrb- 1 -rrb- allow himself to be persuade by he schoolmaster that he must go about in a english dress-coat and that nothing else will do accordingly he have bully he father into give it to he and with he awkward manners this ungainly creature present in it a sufficiently ridiculous figure but the dress-coat will some day be too tight for he and incommode he it will not be very long before he feel it in trial by jury this institution arise in the most barbarous period of the middle age -- the time of alfr the great when the ability to read and write exempt a man from the penalty of death it be the worst of all criminal procedure instead of judge well verse in law and of great experience who have grow gray in daily unravel the trick and wiles of thief murderer and rascal of all sort and so be well able to get at the bottom of thing it be gossip tailor and tanner who sit in judgment it be they coarse crude unpractised and awkward intelligence incapable of any sustained attention that be call upon to find out the truth from a tissue of lie and deceit all the time moreover they be think of they cloth and they leather and longing to be at home and they have absolutely no clear notion at all of the distinction between probability and certainty it be with this sort of a calculus of probability in they stupid head that they confidently undertake to seal a man 's doom -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- it may be well to explain that michel be sometimes use by the german as a nickname of they nation correspond to john bull as a nickname of the english flügel in he german-english dictionary declare that _ der deutsche michel _ represent the german nation as a honest blunt unsuspicious fellow who easily allow himself to be impose upon even he add with a touch of patriotism by those who be greatly he inferior in point of strength and real worth -rrb- the same remark be applicable to they which dr johnson make of a court-martial in which he have little confidence summon to decide a very important case he say that perhaps there be not a member of it who in the whole course of he life have ever spend a hour by himself in balance probability -lrb- 1 -rrb- can any one imagine that the tailor and the tanner would be impartial judge what the vicious multitude impartial as if partiality be not ten time more to be fear from man of the same class as the accuse than from judge who know nothing of he personally live in another sphere altogether be irremovable and conscious of the dignity of they office but to let a jury decide on crime against the state and its head or on misdemeanor of the press be in a very real sense to set the fox to keep the goose -lrb- footnote 1 : boswell 's _ johnson _ 1780 set 71 -rrb- everywhere and at all time there have be much discontent with government law and public regulation for the most part however because man be always ready to make institution responsible for the misery inseparable from human existence itself which be to speak mythically the curse that be lay on adam and through he on the whole race but never have that delusion be proclaim in a more mendacious and impudent manner than by the demagogue of the _ jetstzeit _ -- of the day we live in as enemy of christianity they be of course optimist : to they the world be its own end and object and accordingly in itself that be to say in its own natural constitution it be arrange on the most excellent principle and form a regular habitation of bliss the enormous and glaring evil of the world they attribute wholly to government : if government they think be to do they duty there would be a heaven upon earth in other word all man could eat drink propagate and die free from trouble and want this be what they mean when they talk of the world be its own end and object this be the goal of that perpetual progress of the human race and the other fine thing which they be never tire of proclaim formerly it be _ faith _ which be the chief support of the throne nowadays it be _ credit _ the pope himself be scarcely more concerned to retain the confidence of the faithful than to make he creditor believe in he own good faith if in time past it be the guilty debt of the world which be lament now it be the financial debt of the world which arouse dismay formerly it be the last day which be prophesy now it be the -lrb- greek : seisachtheium -rrb- the great repudiation the universal bankruptcy of the nation which will one day happen although the prophet in this as in the other case entertain a firm hope that he will not live to see it himself from a ethical and a rational point of view the _ right of possession _ rest upon a incomparably better foundation than the _ right of birth _ nevertheless the right of possession be ally with the right of birth and have come to be part and parcel of it so that it would hardly be possible to abolish the right of birth without endanger the right of possession the reason of this be that most of what a man possess he inherit and therefore hold by a kind of right of birth just as the old nobility bear the name only of they hereditary estate and by the use of those name do no more than give expression to the fact that they own the estate accordingly all owner of property if instead of be envious they be wise ought also to support the maintenance of the rights of birth the existence of a nobility have then a double advantage : it help to maintain on the one hand the rights of possession and on the other the right of birth belong to the king for the king be the first nobleman in the country and as a general rule he treat the nobility as he humble relation and regard they quite otherwise than the commoner however trusty and well-beloved it be quite natural too that he should have more confidence in those whose ancestor be mostly the first minister and always the immediate associate of he own a nobleman therefore appeal with reason to the name he bear when on the occurrence of anything to rouse distrust he repeat he assurance of fidelity and service to the king a man 's character as my reader be aware assuredly come to he from he father it be a narrow-minded and ridiculous thing not to consider whose son a man be free-will and fatalism no thoughtful man can have any doubt after the conclusion reach in my prize-essay on _ moral freedom _ that such freedom be to be seek not anywhere in nature but outside of it the only freedom that exist be of a metaphysical character in the physical world freedom be a impossibility accordingly while we several action be in no wise free every man 's individual character be to be regard as a free act he be such and such a man because once for all it be he will to be that man for the will itself and in itself and also in so far as it be manifest in a individual and accordingly constitute the original and fundamental desire of that individual be independent of all knowledge because it be antecedent to such knowledge all that it receive from knowledge be the series of motive by which it successively develop its nature and make itself cognisable or visible but the will itself as something that lie beyond time and so long as it exist at all never change therefore every man be what he be and place in the circumstance which for the moment obtain but which on they part also arise by strict necessity can absolutely never do anything else than just what at that moment he do do accordingly the whole course of a man 's life in all its incident great and small be as necessarily predetermine as the course of a clock the main reason of this be that the kind of metaphysical free act which i have describe tend to become a know consciousness -- a perceptive intuition which be subject to the form of space and time by means of those form the unity and indivisibility of the act be represent as draw asunder into a series of state and event which be subject to the principle of sufficient reason in its four form -- and it be this that be mean by _ necessity _ but the result of it all assume a moral complexion it amount to this that by what we do we know what we be and by what we suffer we know what we deserve further it follow from this that a man 's _ individuality _ do not rest upon the principle of individuation alone and therefore be not altogether phenomenal in its nature on the contrary it have its root in the thing-in-itself in the will which be the essence of each individual the character of this individual be itself individual but how deep the root of individuality extend be one of the question which i do not undertake to answer in this connection it deserve to be mention that even plato in he own way represent the individuality of a man as a free act -lrb- 1 -rrb- he represent he as come into the world with a give tendency which be the result of the feeling and character already attach to he in accordance with the doctrine of metempsychosis the brahmin philosopher also express the unalterable fixity of innate character in a mystical fashion they say that brahma when a man be produce engrave he doings and suffering in write character on he skull and that he life must take shape in accordance therewith they point to the jagged edge in the suture of the skull-bone as evidence of this writing and the purport of it they say depend on he previous life and action the same view appear to underlie the christian or rather the pauline dogma of predestination -lrb- footnote 1 : _ phaedrus _ and _ law bk _ x -rrb- but this truth which be universally confirm by experience be attend with another result all genuine merit moral as well as intellectual be not merely physical or empirical in its origin but metaphysical that be to say it be give _ a priori _ and not _ a posteriori _ in other word it lie innate and be not acquire and therefore its source be not a mere phenomenon but the thing-in-itself hence it be that every man achieve only that which be irrevocably establish in he nature or be bear with he intellectual capacity need it be true to be develop just as many natural product need to be cultivate in order that we may enjoy or use they but just as in the case of a natural product no cultivation can take the place of original material neither can it do so in the case of intellect that be the reason why quality which be merely acquire or learn or enforce -- that be quality _ a posteriori _ whether moral or intellectual -- be not real or genuine but superficial only and possess of no value this be a conclusion of true metaphysics and experience teach the same lesson to all who can look below the surface nay it be prove by the great importance which we all attach to such innate characteristic as physiognomy and external appearance in the case of a man who be at all distinguish and that be why we be so curious to see he superficial people to be sure -- and for very good reason commonplace people too -- will be of the opposite opinion for if anything fail they they will thus be enable to console themselves by think that it be still to come the world then be not merely a battlefield where victory and defeat receive they due recompense in a future state no the world be itself the last judgment on it every man carry with he the reward and the disgrace that he deserve and this be no other than the doctrine of the brahmin and buddhist as it be teach in the theory of metempsychosis the question have be raise what two man would do who live a solitary life in the wild and meet each other for the first time hobbe pufendorf and rousseau have give different answer pufendorf believe that they would approach each other as friend hobbe on the contrary as enemy rousseau that they would pass each other by in silence all three be both right and wrong this be just a case in which the incalculable difference that there be in innate moral disposition between one individual and another would make its appearance the difference be so strong that the question here raise might be regard as the standard and measure of it for there be man in whom the sight of another man at once rouse a feeling of enmity since they inmost nature exclaim at once : that be not I there be other in whom the sight awaken immediate sympathy they inmost nature say : _ that be I over again _ between the two there be countless degree that in this most important matter we be so totally different be a great problem nay a mystery in regard to this _ a priori _ nature of moral character there be matter for varied reflection in a work by bastholm a danish writer entitle _ historical contribution to the knowledge of man in the savage state _ he be strike by the fact that intellectual culture and moral excellence be show to be entirely independent of each other inasmuch as one be often find without the other the reason of this as we shall find be simply that moral excellence in no wise spring from reflection which be develop by intellectual culture but from the will itself the constitution of which be innate and not susceptible in itself of any improvement by means of education bastholm represent most nation as very vicious and immoral and on the other hand he report that excellent trait of character be find amongst some savage people as for instance amongst the orotchys the inhabitant of the island savu the tungus and the pelew islander he thus attempt to solve the problem how it be that some tribe be so remarkably good when they neighbor be all bad it seem to I that the difficulty may be explain as follow : moral quality as we know be heritable and a isolate tribe such as be describe might take its rise in some one family and ultimately in a single ancestor who happen to be a good man and then maintain its purity be it not the case for instance that on many unpleasant occasion such as repudiation of public debt filibuster raid and so on the english have often remind the north american of they descent from english penal colonist it be a reproach however which can apply only to a small part of the population it be marvellous how _ every man 's individuality _ -lrb- that be to say the union of a definite character with a definite intellect -rrb- accurately determine all he action and thought down to the most unimportant detail as though it be a dye which pervade they and how in consequence one man 's whole course of life in other word he inner and outer history turn out so absolutely different from another be as a botanist know a plant in its entirety from a single leaf as cuvier from a single bone construct the whole animal so a accurate knowledge of a man 's whole character may be attain from a single characteristic act that be to say he himself may to some extent be construct from it even though the act in question be of very trifling consequence nay that be the most perfect test of all for in a matter of importance people be on they guard in trifle they follow they natural bent without much reflection that be why seneca 's remark that even the smallest thing may be take as evidence of character be so true : _ argumenta morum ex minimis quoque licet capere _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- if a man show by he absolutely unscrupulous and selfish behavior in small thing that a sentiment of justice be foreign to he disposition he should not be trust with a penny unless on due security for who will believe that the man who every day show that he be unjust in all matter other than those which concern property and whose boundless selfishness everywhere protrude through the small affair of ordinary life which be subject to no scrutiny like a dirty shirt through the hole of a ragged jacket -- who i ask will believe that such a man will act honourably in matter of _ meum _ and _ tuum _ without any other incentive but that of justice the man who have no conscience in small thing will be a scoundrel in big thing if we neglect small trait of character we have only ourselves to blame if we afterwards learn to we disadvantage what this character be in the great affair of life on the same principle we ought to break with so-called friend even in matter of trifling moment if they show a character that be malicious or bad or vulgar so that we may avoid the bad turn which only wait for a opportunity of be do we the same thing apply to servant let it always be we maxim : better alone than amongst traitor -lrb- footnote 1 : _ ep _ 52 -rrb- of a truth the first and foremost step in all knowledge of mankind be the conviction that a man 's conduct take as a whole and in all its essential particulars be not govern by he reason or by any of the resolution which he may make in virtue of it no man become this or that by wish to be it however earnestly he act proceed from he innate and unalterable character and they be more immediately and particularly determine by motive a man 's conduct therefore be the necessary product of both character and motive it may be illustrate by the course of a planet which be the result of the combined effect of the tangential energy with which it be endowed and the centripetal energy which operate from the sun in this simile the former energy represent character and the latter the influence of motive it be almost more than a mere simile the tangential energy which properly speak be the source of the planet 's motion whilst on the other hand the motion be keep in check by gravitation be from a metaphysical point of view the will manifest itself in that body to grasp this fact be to see that we really never form anything more than a conjecture of what we shall do under circumstance which be still to happen although we often take we conjecture for a resolve when for instance in pursuance of a proposal a man with the greatest sincerity and even eagerness accept a engagement to do this or that on the occurrence of a certain future event it be by no means certain that he will fulfil the engagement unless he be so constitute that the promise which he give in itself and as such be always and everywhere a motive sufficient for he by act upon he through consideration of honor like some external compulsion but above and beyond this what he will do on the occurrence of that event may be foretell from true and accurate knowledge of he character and the external circumstance under the influence of which he will fall and it may with complete certainty be foretell from this alone nay it be a very easy prophecy if he have be already see in a like position for he will inevitably do the same thing a second time provide that on the first occasion he have a true and complete knowledge of the fact of the case for as i have often remark a final cause do not impel a man by be real but by be know _ causa finali non movet secundum suum esse reale sed secundum esse cognitum _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- whatever he fail to recognize or understand the first time could have no influence upon he will just as a electric current stop when some isolate body hinder the action of the conductor this unalterable nature of character and the consequent necessity of we action be make very clear to a man who have not on any give occasion behave as he ought to have do by show a lack either of resolution or endurance or courage or some other quality demand at the moment afterwards he recognize what it be that he ought to have do and sincerely repent of he incorrect behavior he think to himself _ if the opportunity be offer to I again i should act differently _ it be offer once more the same occasion recur and to he great astonishment he do precisely the same thing over again -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : suarez _ disp metaph _ xxiii § § 7 and 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : cf _ world as will _ ii pp 251 ff _ sqq _ -lrb- third edition -rrb- -rrb- the best example of the truth in question be in every way furnish by shakespeare 's play it be a truth with which he be thoroughly imbue and he intuitive wisdom express it in a concrete shape on every page i shall here however give a instance of it in a case in which he make it remarkably clear without exhibit any design or affectation in the matter for he be a real artist and never set out from general idea he method be obviously to work up to the psychological truth which he grasp directly and intuitively regardless of the fact that few would notice or understand it and without the smallest idea that some dull and shallow fellow in germany would one day proclaim far and wide that he write he work to illustrate moral commonplace i allude to the character of the earl of northumberland whom we find in three play in succession although he do not take a lead part in any one of they nay he appear only in a few scene distribute over fifteen act consequently if the reader be not very attentive a character exhibit at such great interval and its moral identity may easily escape he notice even though it have by no means escape the poet 's he make the earl appear everywhere with a noble and knightly grace and talk in language suitable to it nay he sometimes put very beautiful and even elevated passage into he mouth at the same time he be very far from write after the manner of schiller who be fond of paint the devil black and whose moral approval or disapproval of the character which he present could be hear in they own word with shakespeare and also with goethe every character as long as he be on the stage and speaking seem to be absolutely in the right even though it be the devil himself in this respect let the reader compare duke alba as he appear in goethe with the same character in schiller we make the acquaintance of the earl of northumberland in the play of _ richard ii _ where he be the first to hatch a plot against the king in favor of bolingbroke afterwards henry iv to whom he even offer some personal flattery -lrb- act ii sc 3 -rrb- in the follow act he suffer a reprimand because in speaking of the king he talk of he as richard without more ado but protest that he do it only for brevity 's sake a little later he insidious word induce the king to surrender in the follow act when the king renounce the crown northumberland treat he with such harshness and contempt that the unlucky monarch be quite broken and lose all patience once more exclaim to he : _ fiend thou torment ` st I ere i come to hell _ at the close northumberland announce to the new king that he have send the head of the former king 's adherent to london in the follow tragedy _ henry iv _ he hatch a plot against the new king in just the same way in the fourth act we see the rebel unite make preparation for the decisive battle on the morrow and only wait impatiently for northumberland and he division at last there arrive a letter from he say that he be ill and that he can not entrust he force to any one else but that nevertheless the other should go forward with courage and make a brave fight they do so but greatly weaken by he absence they be completely defeat most of they leader be capture and he own son the valorous hotspur fall by the hand of the prince of wale again in the follow play the _ second part of henry iv _ we see he reduce to a state of the fiercest wrath by the death of he son and madden by the thirst for revenge accordingly he kindle another rebellion and the head of it assemble once more in the fourth act just as they be about to give battle and be only wait for he to join they there come a letter say that he can not collect a proper force and will therefore seek safety for the present in scotland that nevertheless he heartily wish they heroic undertake the best success thereupon they surrender to the king under a treaty which be not keep and so perish so far be character from be the work of reason choice and consideration that in any action the intellect have nothing to do but to present motive to the will thereafter it look on as a mere spectator and witness at the course which life take in accordance with the influence of motive on the give character all the incident of life occur strictly speak with the same necessity as the movement of a clock on this point let I refer to my prize-essay on _ the freedom of the will _ i have there explain the true meaning and origin of the persistent illusion that the will be entirely free in every single action and i have indicate the cause to which it be due i will only add here the follow teleological explanation of this natural illusion since every single action of a man 's life seem to possess the freedom and originality which in truth only belong to he character as he apprehend it and the mere apprehension of it by he intellect be what constitute he career and since what be original in every single action seem to the empirical consciousness to be always be perform anew a man thus receive in the course of he career the strongest possible moral lesson then and not before he become thoroughly conscious of all the bad side of he character conscience accompany every act with the comment : _ you should act differently _ although its true sense be : _ you could be other than you be _ as the result of this immutability of character on the one hand and on the other of the strict necessity which attend all the circumstance in which character be successively place every man 's course of life be precisely determine from alpha right through to omega but nevertheless one man 's course of life turn out immeasurably happier nobler and more worthy than another 's whether it be regard from a subjective or a objective point of view and unless we be to exclude all idea of justice we be lead to the doctrine which be well accept in brahmanism and buddhism that the subjective condition in which as well as the objective condition under which every man be bear be the moral consequence of a previous existence macchiavellus who seem to have take no interest whatever in philosophical speculation be draw by the keen subtlety of he very unique understanding into the follow observation which possess a really deep mean it show that he have a intuitive knowledge of the entire necessity with which character and motive be give all action take place he make it at the beginning of the prologue to he comedy _ clitium _ _ if _ he say _ the same man be to recur in the world in the way that the same circumstance recur a hundred year would never elapse without we finding ourselves together once more and do the same thing as we be do now -- se nel mondo tornassino i medesimi uomini como tornano i medesimi casi non passarebbono mai cento anni che noi non ci trovassimo un altra volta insieme a fare le medesime cose che hora _ he seem however to have be draw into the remark by a reminiscence of what augustine say in he _ de civitate dei _ bk xii ch xiii again fate or the -lrb- greek : eimarmena -rrb- of the ancient be nothing but the conscious certainty that all that happen be fast bind by a chain of cause and therefore take place with a strict necessity that the future be already ordain with absolute certainty and can undergo as little alteration as the past in the fatalistic myth of the ancient all that can be regard as fabulous be the prediction of the future that be if we refuse to consider the possibility of magnetic clairvoyance and second sight instead of try to explain away the fundamental truth of fatalism by superficial twaddle and foolish evasion a man should attempt to get a clear knowledge and comprehension of it for it be demonstrably true and it help we in a very important way to a understanding of the mysterious riddle of we life predestination and fatalism do not differ in the main they differ only in this that with predestination the give character and external determination of human action proceed from a rational being and with fatalism from a irrational one but in either case the result be the same : that happen which must happen on the other hand the conception of _ moral freedom _ be inseparable from that of _ originality _ a man may be say but he can not be conceive to be the work of another and at the same time be free in respect of he desire and act he who call he into existence out of nothing in the same process create and determine he nature -- in other word the whole of he quality for no one can create without create a something that be to say a be determine throughout and in all its quality but all that a man say and do necessarily proceed from the quality so determine for it be only the quality themselves set in motion it be only some external impulse that they require to make they appearance as a man be so must he act and praise or blame attach not to he separate act but to he nature and be that be the reason why theism and the moral responsibility of man be incompatible because responsibility always revert to the creator of man and it be there that it have its center vain attempt have be make to make a bridge from one of these incompatible to the other by means of the conception of moral freedom but it always break down again what be _ free _ must also be _ original _ if we will be _ free _ we will be also _ the original element _ and conversely pre-kantian dogmatism try to separate these two predicament it be thereby compel to assume two kind of freedom one cosmological of the first cause and the other moral and theological of human will these be represent in kant by the third as well as the fourth antimony of freedom on the other hand in my philosophy the plain recognition of the strictly necessary character of all action be in accordance with the doctrine that what manifest itself even in the organic and irrational world be _ will _ if this be not so the necessity under which irrational being obviously act would place they action in conflict with will if i mean there be really such a thing as the freedom of individual action and this be not as strictly necessitate as every other kind of action but as i have just show it be this same doctrine of the necessary character of all act of will which make it needful to regard a man 's existence and be as itself the work of he freedom and consequently of he will the will therefore must be self-existent it must possess so-called _ a-se-ity _ under the opposite supposition all responsibility as i have show would be at a end and the moral like the physical world would be a mere machine set in motion for the amusement of its manufacturer place somewhere outside of it so it be that truth hang together and mutually advance and complete one another whereas error get jostle at every corner what kind of influence it be that _ moral instruction _ may exercise on conduct and what be the limit of that influence be question which i have sufficiently examine in the twentieth section of my treatise on the _ foundation of morality _ in all essential particulars a analogous influence be exercise by _ example _ which however have a more powerful effect than doctrine and therefore it deserve a brief analysis in the main example work either by restrain a man or by encourage he it have the former effect when it determine he to leave undo what he want to do he see i mean that other people do not do it and from this he judge in general that it be not expedient that it may endanger he person or he property or he honor he rest content and gladly find himself relieve from examine into the matter for himself or he may see that another man who have not refrain have incur evil consequence from do it this be example of the deterrent kind the example which encourage a man work in a twofold manner it either induce he to do what he would be glad to leave undo if he be not afraid lest the omission might in some way endanger he or injure he in other ' opinion or else it encourage he to do what he be glad to do but have hitherto refrain from do from fear of danger or shame this be example of the seductive kind finally example may bring a man to do what he would have otherwise never think of do it be obvious that in this last case example work in the main only on the intellect its effect on the will be secondary and if it have any such effect it be by the interposition of the man 's own judgment or by reliance on the person who present the example the whole influence of example -- and it be very strong -- rest on the fact that a man have as a rule too little judgment of he own and often too little knowledge o explore he own way for himself and that he be glad therefore to tread in the footstep of some one else accordingly the more deficient he be in either of these quality the more be he open to the influence of example and we find in fact that most man 's guide star be the example of other that they whole course of life in great thing and in small come in the end to be mere imitation and that not even in the pettiest matter do they act accord to they own judgment imitation and custom be the spring of almost all human action the cause of it be that man fight shy of all and any sort of reflection and very properly mistrust they own discernment at the same time this remarkably strong imitative instinct in man be a proof of he kinship with ape but the kind of effect which example exercise depend upon a man 's character and thus it be that the same example may possibly seduce one man and deter another a easy opportunity of observe this be afford in the case of certain social impertinence which come into vogue and gradually spread the first time that a man notice anything of the kind he may say to himself : _ for shame how can he do it how selfish and inconsiderate of he really i shall take care never to do anything like that _ but twenty other will think : _ aha if he do that i may do it too _ as regard morality example like doctrine may it be true promote civil or legal amelioration but not that inward amendment which be strictly speak the only kind of moral amelioration for example always work as a personal motive alone and assume therefore that a man be susceptible to this sort of motive but it be just the predominate sensitiveness of a character to this or that sort of motive that determine whether its morality be true and real though of whatever kind it be it be always innate in general it may be say that example operate as a means of promote the good and the bad quality of a character but it do not create they and so it be that seneca 's maxim _ velle non discitur _ -- _ will can not be learn _ -- also hold good here but the innateness of all truly moral quality of the good as of the bad be a doctrine that consort better with the metempsychosis of the brahmin and buddhist accord to which a man 's good and bad deed follow he from one existence to another like he shadow than with judaism for judaism require a man to come into the world as a moral blank so that in virtue of a inconceivable free will direct to object which be neither to be seek nor avoid -- _ liberum arbitrium indifferentia _ -- and consequently as the result of reason consideration he may choose whether he be to be a angel or a devil or anything else that may lie between the two though i be well aware what the jewish scheme be i pay no attention to it for my standard be truth i be no professor of philosophy and therefore i do not find my vocation in establish the fundamental idea of judaism at any cost even though they for ever bar the way to all and every kind of philosophical knowledge _ liberum arbitrium indifferentia _ under the name of _ moral freedom _ be a charming doll for professor of philosophy to dandle and we must leave it to those intelligent honorable and upright gentleman character man who aspire to a happy a brilliant and a long life instead of to a virtuous one be like foolish actor who want to be always have the great part -- the part that be mark by splendor and triumph they fail to see that the important thing be not _ what _ or _ how much _ but _ how _ they act since _ a man do not alter _ and he _ moral character _ remain absolutely the same all through he life since he must play out the part which he have receive without the least deviation from the character since neither experience nor philosophy nor religion can effect any improvement in he the question arise what be the meaning of life at all to what purpose be it play this farce in which everything that be essential be irrevocably fix and determine it be play that a man may come to understand himself that he may see what it be that he seek and have seek to be what he want and what therefore he be _ this be a knowledge which must be impart to he from without _ life be to man in other word to will what chemical re-agent be to the body : it be only by life that a man reveal what he be and it be only in so far as he reveal himself that he exist at all life be the manifestation of character of the something that we understand by that word and it be not in life but outside of it and outside time that character undergo alteration as a result of the self-knowledge which life give life be only the mirror into which a man gaze not in order that he may get a reflection of himself but that he may come to understand himself by that reflection that he may see _ what _ it be that the mirror show life be the proof sheet in which the compositor ' error be bring to light how they become visible and whether the type be large or small be matter of no consequence neither in the externals of life nor in the course of history be there any significance for as it be all one whether a error occur in the large type or in the small so it be all one as regard the essence of the matter whether a evil disposition be mirror as a conqueror of the world or a common swindler or ill-natured egoist in one case he be see of all man in the other perhaps only of himself but that he should see himself be what signify therefore if egoism have a firm hold of a man and master he whether it be in the form of joy or triumph or lust or hope or frantic grief or annoyance or anger or fear or suspicion or passion of any kind -- he be in the devil 's clutch and how he get into they do not matter what be needful be that he should make haste to get out of they and here again it do not matter how i have describe _ character _ as _ theoretically _ a act of will lie beyond time of which life in time or _ character in action _ be the development for matter of practical life we all possess the one as well as the other for we be constitute of they both character modify we life more than we think and it be to a certain extent true that every man be the architect of he own fortune no doubt it seem as if we lot be assign to we almost entirely from without and impart to we in something of the same way in which a melody outside we reach the ear but on look back over we past we see at once that we life consist of mere variation on one and the same theme namely we character and that the same fundamental bass sound through it all this be a experience which a man can and must make in and by himself not only a man 's life but he intellect too may be possess of a clear and definite character so far as he intellect be apply to matter of theory it be not every man however who have a intellect of this kind for any such definite individuality as i mean be genius -- a original view of the world which presuppose a absolutely exceptional individuality which be the essence of genius a man 's intellectual character be the theme on which all he work be variation in a essay which i write in weimar i call it the knack by which every genius produce he work however various this intellectual character determine the physiognomy of man of genius -- what i might call _ the theoretical physiognomy _ -- and give it that distinguish expression which be chiefly see in the eye and the forehead in the case of ordinary man the physiognomy present no more than a weak analogy with the physiognomy of genius on the other hand all man possess _ the practical physiognomy _ the stamp of will of practical character of moral disposition and it show itself chiefly in the mouth since character so far as we understand its nature be above and beyond time it can not undergo any change under the influence of life but although it must necessarily remain the same always it require time to unfold itself and show the very diverse aspect which it may possess for character consist of two factor : one the will-to-live itself blind impulse so-called impetuosity the other the restraint which the will acquire when it come to understand the world and the world again be itself will a man may begin by follow the craving of desire until he come to see how hollow and unreal a thing be life how deceitful be its pleasure what horrible aspect it possess and this it be that make people hermit penitent magdalene nevertheless it be to be observe that no such change from a life of great indulgence in pleasure to one of resignation be possible except to the man who of he own accord renounce pleasure a really bad life can not be change into a virtuous one the most beautiful soul before it come to know life from its horrible side may eagerly drink the sweet of life and remain innocent but it can not commit a bad action it can not cause other suffer to do a pleasure to itself for in that case it would see clearly what it would be do and whatever be its youth and inexperience it perceive the suffering of other as clearly as its own pleasure that be why one bad action be a guarantee that numberless other will be commit as soon as circumstance give occasion for they somebody once remark to I with entire justice that every man have something very good and humane in he disposition and also something very bad and malignant and that accord as he be move one or the other of they make its appearance the sight of other ' suffering arouse not only in different man but in one and the same man at one moment a inexhaustible sympathy at another a certain satisfaction and this satisfaction may increase until it become the cruellest delight in pain i observe in myself that at one moment i regard all mankind with heartfelt pity at another with the greatest indifference on occasion with hatred nay with a positive enjoyment of they pain all this show very clearly that we be possess of two different nay absolutely contradictory way of regard the world : one accord to the principle of individuation which exhibit all creature as entire stranger to we as definitely not ourselves we can have no feeling for they but those of indifference envy hatred and delight that they suffer the other way of regard the world be in accordance with what i may call the _ tat-twam-asus _ -- _ this-is-thyself _ principle all creature be exhibit as identical with ourselves and so it be pity and love which the sight of they arouse the one method separate individual by impassable barrier the other remove the barrier and bring the individual together the one make we feel in regard to every man _ that be what i be _ the other _ that be not what i be _ but it be remarkable that while the sight of another 's suffer make we feel we identity with he and arouse we pity this be not so with the sight of another 's happiness then we almost always feel some envy and even though we may have no such feeling in certain case -- as for instance when we friend be happy -- yet the interest which we take in they happiness be of a weak description and can not compare with the sympathy which we feel with they suffering be this because we recognize all happiness to be a delusion or a impediment to true welfare no i be incline to think that it be because the sight of the pleasure or the possession which be deny to we arouse envy that be to say the wish that we and not the other have that pleasure or those possession it be only the first way of look at the world which be found on any demonstrable reason the other be as it be the gate out of this world it have no attestation beyond itself unless it be the very abstract and difficult proof which my doctrine supplies why the first way predominate in one man and the second in another -- though perhaps it do not exclusively predominate in any man why the one or the other emerge accord as the will be move -- these be deep problem the path of night and day be close together : -lrb- greek : engus gar nuktos de kai aematos eisi keleuthous -rrb- it be a fact that there be a great and original difference between one empirical character and another and it be a difference which at bottom rest upon the relation of the individual 's will to he intellectual faculty this relation be finally determine by the degree of will in he father and of intellect in he mother and the union of father and mother be for the most part a affair of chance this would all mean a revolting injustice in the nature of the world if it be not that the difference between parent and son be phenomenal only and all chance be at bottom necessity as regard the freedom of the will if it be the case that the will manifest itself in a single act alone it would be a free act but the will manifest itself in a course of life that be to say in a series of act every one of these act therefore be determine as a part of a complete whole and can not happen otherwise than it do happen on the other hand the whole series be free it be simply the manifestation of a individualise will if a man feel inclined to commit a bad action and refrain he be keep back either -lrb- 1 -rrb- by fear of punishment or vengeance or -lrb- 2 -rrb- by superstition in other word fear of punishment in a future life or -lrb- 3 -rrb- by the feeling of sympathy include general charity or -lrb- 4 -rrb- by the feeling of honor in other word the fear of shame or -lrb- 5 -rrb- by the feeling of justice that be a objective attachment to fidelity and good-faith couple with a resolve to hold they sacred because they be the foundation of all free intercourse between man and man and therefore often of advantage to himself as well this last think not indeed as a thought but as a mere feeling influence people very frequently it be this that often compel a man of honor when some great but unjust advantage be offer he to reject it with contempt and proudly exclaim : _ i be a honorable man _ for otherwise how should a poor man confront with the property which chance or even some worse agency have bestow on the rich whose very existence it be that make he poor feel so much sincere respect for this property that he refuse to touch it even in he need and although he have a prospect of escape punishment what other thought be it that can be at the bottom of such a man 's honesty he be resolve not to separate himself from the great community of honorable people who have the earth in possession and whose law be recognize everywhere he know that a single dishonest act will ostracise and proscribe he from that society for ever no a man will spend money on any soil that yield he good fruit and he will make sacrifice for it with a good action -- that every action in which a man 's own advantage be ostensibly subordinate to another 's -- the motive be either -lrb- 1 -rrb- self-interest keep in the background or -lrb- 2 -rrb- superstition in other word self-interest in the form of reward in another life or -lrb- 3 -rrb- sympathy or -lrb- 4 -rrb- the desire to lend a help hand in other word attachment to the maxim that we should assist one another in need and the wish to maintain this maxim in view of the presumption that some day we ourselves may find it serve we turn for what kant call a good action do from motive of duty and for the sake of duty there be as will be see no room at all kant himself declare it to be doubtful whether a action be ever determine by pure motive of duty alone i affirm most certainly that no action be ever so do it be mere babble there be nothing in it that could really act as a motive to any man when he shelter himself behind verbiage of that sort he be always actuate by one of the four motive which i have describe among these it be obviously sympathy alone which be quite genuine and sincere _ good _ and _ bad _ apply to character only _ à potiorus _ that be to say we prefer the good to the bad but absolutely there be no such distinction the difference arise at the point which lie between subordinate one 's own advantage to that of another and not subordinate it if a man keep to the exact middle he be _ just _ but most man go a inch in they regard for other ' welfare to twenty yard in regard for they own the source of _ good _ and of _ bad character _ so far as we have any real knowledge of it lie in this that with the bad character the thought of the external world and especially of the living creature in it be accompany -- all the more the greater the resemblance between they and the individual self -- by a constant feeling of _ not i not i not i _ contrarily with the good character -lrb- both be assume to exist in a high degree -rrb- the same thought have for its accompaniment like a fundamental bass a constant feeling of _ i i i _ from this spring benevolence and a disposition to help all man and at the same time a cheerful confident and tranquil frame of mind the opposite of that which accompany the bad character the difference however be only phenomenal although it be a difference which be radical but now we come to _ the hardest of all problem _ : how be it that while the will as the thing-in-itself be identical and from a metaphysical point of view one and the same in all its manifestation there be nevertheless such a enormous difference between one character and another -- the malicious diabolical wickedness of the one and set off against it the goodness of the other show all the more conspicuously how be it that we get a tiberius a caligulum a carcallum a domitian a nero and on the other hand the antonine titus hadrian nerva how be it that among the animal nay in a higher species in individual animal there be a like difference -- the malignity of the cat most strongly develop in the tiger the spite of the monkey on the other hand goodness fidelity and love in the dog and the elephant it be obvious that the principle of wickedness in the brute be the same as in man we may to some extent modify the difficulty of the problem by observe that the whole difference be in the end only one of degree in every living creature the fundamental propensity and instinct all exist but they exist in very different degree and proportion this however be not enough to explain the fact we must fall back upon the intellect and its relation to the will it be the only explanation that remain a man 's intellect however by no means stand in any direct and obvious relation with the goodness of he character we may it be true discriminate between two kind of intellect : between understanding as the apprehension of relation in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason and cognition a faculty akin to genius which act more directly be independent of this law and pass beyond the principle of individuation the latter be the faculty which apprehend idea and it be the faculty which have to do with morality but even this explanation leave much to be desire _ fine mind be seldom fine soul _ be the correct observation of jean paul although they be never the contrary lord bacon who to be sure be less a fine soul than a fine mind be a scoundrel i have declare space and time to be part of the principle of individuation as it be only space and time that make the multiplicity of similar object a possibility but multiplicity itself also admit of variety multiplicity and diversity be not only quantitative but also qualitative how be it that there be such a thing as qualitative diversity especially in ethical matter or have i fall into a error the opposite of that in which leibnitz fall with he _ identita indiscernibilium _ the chief cause of intellectual diversity be to be find in the brain and nervous system this be a fact which somewhat lessen the obscurity of the subject with the brute the intellect and the brain be strictly adapt to they aim and need with man alone there be now and then by way of exception a superfluity which if it be abundant may yield genius but ethical diversity it seem proceeds immediately from the will otherwise ethical character would not be above and beyond time as it be only in the individual that intellect and will be unite the will be above and beyond time and eternal and character be innate that be to say it be spring from the same eternity and therefore it do not admit of any but a transcendental explanation perhaps some one will come after I who will throw light into this dark abyss moral instinct a act do by instinct differ from every other kind of act in that a understanding of its object do not precede it but follow upon it instinct be therefore a rule of action give _ à priori _ we may be unaware of the object to which it be direct as no understanding of it be necessary to its attainment on the other hand if a act be do by a exercise of reason or intelligence it proceed accord to a rule which the understanding have itself devise for the purpose of carry out a preconceived aim hence it be that action accord to rule may miss its aim while instinct be infallible on the _ à priori _ character of instinct we may compare what plato say in the _ philebus _ with plato instinct be a reminiscence of something which a man have never actually experience in he lifetime in the same way as in the _ phaedo _ and elsewhere everything that a man learn be regard as a reminiscence he have no other word to express the _ à priori _ element in all experience there be then three thing that be _ à priori _ : -lrb- 1 -rrb- theoretical reason in other word the condition which make all experience possible -lrb- 2 -rrb- instinct or the rule by which a object promote the life of the sens may though unknown be attain -lrb- 3 -rrb- the moral law or the rule by which a action take place without any object accordingly rational or intelligent action proceeds by a rule lay down in accordance with the object as it be understand instinctive action proceeds by a rule without a understanding of the object of it moral action proceeds by a rule without any object at all _ theoretical reason _ be the aggregate of rule in accordance with which all my knowledge -- that be to say the whole world of experience -- necessarily proceed in the same manner _ instinct _ be the aggregate of rule in accordance with which all my action necessarily proceed if it meet with no obstruction hence it seem to I that instinct may most appropriately be call _ practical reason _ for like theoretical reason it determine the _ must _ of all experience the so-called moral law on the other hand be only one aspect of _ the better consciousness _ the aspect which it present from the point of view of instinct this better consciousness be something lie beyond all experience that be beyond all reason whether of the theoretical or the practical kind and have nothing to do with it whilst it be in virtue of the mysterious union of it and reason in the same individual that the better consciousness come into conflict with reason leave the individual to choose between the two in any conflict between the better consciousness and reason if the individual decide for reason should it be theoretical reason he become a narrow pedantic philistine should it be practical a rascal if he decide for the better consciousness we can make no further positive affirmation about he for if we be to do so we should find ourselves in the realm of reason and as it be only what take place within this realm that we can speak of at all it follow that we can not speak of the better consciousness except in negative term this show we how it be that reason be hinder and obstruct that _ theoretical reason _ be suppress in favor of _ genius _ and _ practical reason _ in favor of _ virtue _ now the better consciousness be neither theoretical nor practical for these be distinction that only apply to reason but if the individual be in the act of choose the better consciousness appear to he in the aspect which it assume in vanquish and overcome the practical reason -lrb- or instinct to use the common word -rrb- it appear to he as a imperative command a _ ought _ it so appear to he i say in other word that be the shape which it take for the theoretical reason which render all thing into object and idea but in so far as the better consciousness desire to vanquish and overcome the theoretical reason it take no shape at all on the simple ground that as it come into play the theoretical reason be suppress and become the mere servant of the better consciousness that be why genius can never give any account of its own work in the morality of action the legal principle that both side be to be hear must not be allow to apply in other word the claim of self and the sens must not be urge nay on the contrary as soon as the pure will have find expression the case be close _ nec audienda altera par _ the lower animal be not endow with moral freedom probably this be not because they show no trace of the better consciousness which in we be manifest as morality or nothing analogous to it for if that be so the lower animal which be in so many respects like ourselves in outward appearance that we regard man as a species of animal would possess some _ raison d'être _ entirely different from we own and actually be in they essential and inmost nature something quite other than ourselves this be a contention which be obviously refute by the thoroughly malignant and inherently vicious character of certain animal such as the crocodile the hyaena the scorpion the snake and the gentle affectionate and contented character of other such as the dog here as in the case of man the character as it be manifest must rest upon something that be above and beyond time for as jacob böhme say -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ there be a power in every animal which be indestructible and the spirit of the world draw it into itself against the final separation at the last judgment _ therefore we can not call the lower animal free and the reason why we can not do so be that they be want in a faculty which be profoundly subordinate to the better consciousness in its highest phase i mean reason reason be the faculty of supreme comprehension the idea of totality how reason manifest itself in the theoretical sphere kant have show and it do the same in the practical : it make we capable of observe and survey the whole of we life thought and action in continual connection and therefore of act accord to general maxim whether those maxim originate in the understanding as prudential rule or in the better consciousness as moral law -lrb- footnote 1 : _ epistle _ 56 -rrb- if any desire or passion be arouse in we we and in the same way the lower animal be for the moment fill with this desire we be all anger all lust all fear and in such moment neither the better consciousness can speak nor the understanding consider the consequence but in we case reason allow we even at that moment to see we action and we life as a unbroken chain -- a chain which connect we earlier resolution or it may be the future consequence of we action with the moment of passion which now fill we whole consciousness it show we the identity of we person even when that person be expose to influence of the most varied kind and thereby we be enable to act accord to maxim the lower animal be want in this faculty the passion which seize it completely dominate it and can be check only by another passion -- anger for instance or lust by fear even though the vision that terrify do not appeal to the sens but be present in the animal only as a dim memory and imagination man therefore may be call irrational if like the lower animal they allow themselves to be determine by the moment so far however be reason from be the source of morality that it be reason alone which make we capable of be rascal which the lower animal can not be it be reason which enable we to form a evil resolution and to keep it when the provocation to evil be remove it enable we for example to nurse vengeance although at the moment that we have a opportunity of fulfil we resolution the better consciousness may manifest itself as love or charity it be by force of reason in pursuance of some evil maxim that we act against it thus goethe say that a man may use he reason only for the purpose of be more bestial than any beast : _ er hat vernunft doch braucht er sie allein um theirischer al jede thier zu sein _ for not only do we like the beast satisfy the desire of the moment but we refine upon they and stimulate they in order to prepare the desire for the satisfaction whenever we think that we perceive a trace of reason in the lower animal it fill we with surprise now we surprise be not excite by the good and affectionate disposition which some of they exhibit -- we recognize that as something other than reason -- but by some action in they which seem to be determine not by the impression of the moment but by a resolution previously make and keep elephant for instance be report to have take premeditated revenge for insult long after they be suffer lion to have requite benefit on a opportunity tardily offer the truth of such story have however no bearing at all on the question what do we mean by reason but they enable we to decide whether in the lower animal there be any trace of anything that we can call reason kant not only declare that all we moral sentiment originate in reason but he lay down that reason _ in my sense of the word _ be a condition of moral action as he hold that for a action to be virtuous and meritorious it must be do in accordance with maxim and not spring from a resolve take under some momentary impression but in both contention he be wrong if i resolve to take vengeance on some one and when a opportunity offer the better consciousness in the form of love and humanity speak its word and i be influence by it rather than by my evil resolution this be a virtuous act for it be a manifestation of the better consciousness it be possible to conceive of a very virtuous man in whom the better consciousness be so continuously active that it be never silent and never allow he passion to get a complete hold of he by such consciousness he be subject to a direct control instead of be guide indirectly through the medium of reason by means of maxim and moral principle that be why a man may have weak reasoning power and a weak understanding and yet have a high sense of morality and be eminently good for the most important element in a man depend as little on intellectual as it do on physical strength jesus say _ bless be the poor in spirit _ and jacob böhme have the excellent and noble observation : _ whoso lie quietly in he own will like a child in the womb and let himself be lead and guide by that inner principle from which he be spring be the noblest and richest on earth _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ epistle _ 37 -rrb- ethical reflection the philosopher of the ancient world unite in a single conception a great many thing that have no connection with one another of this every dialogue of plato 's furnish abundant example the greatest and worst confusion of this kind be that between ethic and politics the state and the kingdom of god or the moral law be so entirely different in they character that the former be a parody of the latter a bitter mockery at the absence of it compare with the moral law the state be a crutch instead of a limb a automaton instead of a man \* \* \* \* \* the _ principle of honor _ stand in close connection with human freedom it be as it be a abuse of that freedom instead of use he freedom to fulfil the moral law a man employ he power of voluntarily undergo any feeling of pain of overcome any momentary impression in order that he may assert he self-will whatever be the object to which he direct it as he thereby show that unlike the lower animal he have thought which go beyond the welfare of he body and whatever make for that welfare it have come about that the principle of honor be often confuse with virtue they be regard as if they be twin but wrongly for although the principle of honor be something which distinguish man from the lower animal it be not in itself anything that raise he above they take as a end and aim it be as dark a delusion as any other aim that spring from self use as a means or casually it may be productive of good but even that be good which be vain and frivolous it be the misuse of freedom the employment of it as a weapon for overcome the world of feeling that make man so infinitely more terrible than the lower animal for they do only what momentary instinct bid they while man act by idea and he idea may entail universal ruin before they be satisfied there be another circumstance which help to promote the notion that honor and virtue be connect a man who can do what he want to do show that he can also do it if what he want to do be a virtuous act but that those of we action which we be ourselves oblige to regard with contempt be also regard with contempt by other people serve more than anything that i have here mention to establish the connection thus it often happen that a man who be not afraid of the one kind of contempt be unwilling to undergo the other but when we be call upon to choose between we own approval and the world 's censure as may occur in complicated and mistaken circumstance what become of the principle of honor then two characteristic example of the principle of honor be to be find in shakespeare 's _ henry vi _ part ii act iv sc 1 a pirate be anxious to murder he captive instead of accept like other a ransom for he because in take he captive he lose a eye and he own honor and that of he forefather would in he opinion be stain if he be to allow he revenge to be buy off as though he be a mere trader the prisoner on the other hand who be the duke of suffolk prefer to have he head grace a pole than to uncover it to such a low fellow as a pirate by approach he to ask for mercy just as civic honor -- in other word the opinion that we deserve to be trust -- be the palladium of those whose endeavor it be to make they way in the world on the path of honorable business so knightly honor -- in other word the opinion that we be man to be fear -- be the palladium of those who aim at go through life on the path of violence and so it be that knightly honor arise among the robber-knight and other knight of the middle age \* \* \* \* \* a theoretical philosopher be one who can supply in the shape of idea for the reason a copy of the presentation of experience just as what the painter see he can reproduce on canvas the sculptor in marble the poet in picture for the imagination though they be picture which he supply only in sowing the idea from which they spring a so-called practical philosopher on the other hand be one who contrarily deduce he action from idea the theoretical philosopher transform life into idea the practical philosopher transform idea into life he act therefore in a thoroughly reasonable manner he be consistent regular deliberate he be never hasty or passionate he never allow himself to be influence by the impression of the moment and indeed when we find ourselves among those full presentation of experience or real object to which the body belong -- since the body be only a objectify will the shape which the will assume in the material world -- it be difficult to let we body be guide not by those presentation but by a mere image of they by cold colourless idea which be related to experience as the shadow of orcus to life and yet this be the only way in which we can avoid do thing of which we may have to repent the theoretical philosopher enrich the domain of reason by add to it the practical philosopher draw upon it and make it serve he \* \* \* \* \* accord to kant the truth of experience be only a hypothetical truth if the supposition which underlie all the intimation of experience -- subject object time space and causality -- be remove none of those intimation would contain a word of truth in other word experience be only a phenomenon it be not knowledge of the thing-in-itself if we find something in we own conduct at which we be secretly pleased although we can not reconcile it with experience see that if we be to follow the guidance of experience we should have to do precisely the opposite we must not allow this to put we out otherwise we should be ascribe a authority to experience which it do not deserve for all that it teach rest upon a mere supposition this be the general tendency of the kantian ethic \* \* \* \* \* innocence be in its very nature stupid it be stupid because the aim of life -lrb- i use the expression only figuratively and i could just as well speak of the essence of life or of the world -rrb- be to gain a knowledge of we own bad will so that we will may become a object for we and that we may undergo a inward conversion we body be itself we will objectify it be one of the first and foremost of object and the deed that we accomplish for the sake of the body show we the evil inherent in we will in the state of innocence where there be no evil because there be no experience man be as it be only a apparatus for living and the object for which the apparatus exist be not yet disclose a empty form of life like this a stage untenanted be in itself like the so-called real world null and void and as it can attain a meaning only by action by error by knowledge by the convulsion of the will it wear a character of insipid stupidity a golden age of innocence a fool ' paradise be a notion that be stupid and unmeaning and for that very reason in no way worthy of any respect the first criminal and murderer cain who acquire a knowledge of guilt and through guilt acquire a knowledge of virtue by repentance and so come to understand the meaning of life be a tragical figure more significant and almost more respectable than all the innocent fool in the world put together \* \* \* \* \* if i have to write about _ modesty _ i should say : i know the esteemed public for which i have the honor to write far too well to dare to give utterance to my opinion about this virtue personally i be quite content to be modest and to apply myself to this virtue with the utmost possible circumspection but one thing i shall never admit -- that i have ever require modesty of any man and any statement to that effect i repel as a slander the paltry character of most man compel the few who have any merit or genius to behave as though they do not know they own value and consequently do not know other people 's want of value for it be only on this condition that the mob acquiesce in tolerate merit a virtue have be make out of this necessity and it be call modesty it be a piece of hypocrisy to be excuse only because other people be so paltry that they must be treat with indulgence \* \* \* \* \* human misery may affect we in two way and we may be in one of two opposite mood in regard to it in one of they this misery be immediately present to we we feel it in we own person in we own will which imbue with violent desire be everywhere break and this be the process which constitute suffer the result be that the will increase in violence as be show in all case of passion and emotion and this increase violence come to a stop only when the will turn and give way to complete resignation in other word be redeem the man who be entirely dominate by this mood will regard any prosperity which he may see in other with envy and any suffer with no sympathy in the opposite mood human misery be present to we only as a fact of knowledge that be to say indirectly we be mainly engage in look at the suffering of other and we attention be withdraw from we own it be in they person that we become aware of human misery we be fill with sympathy and the result of this mood be general benevolence philanthropy all envy vanish and instead of feel it we be rejoice when we see one of we tormented fellow-creature experience any pleasure or relief after the same fashion we may be in one of two opposite mood in regard to human baseness and depravity in the one we perceive this baseness indirectly in other out of this mood arise indignation hatred and contempt of mankind in the other we perceive it directly in ourselves out of it there arise humiliation nay contrition in order to judge the moral value of a man it be very important to observe which of these four mood predominate in he they go in pair one out of each division in very excellent character the second mood of each division will predominate \* \* \* \* \* the categorical imperative or absolute command be a contradiction every command be conditional what be unconditional and necessary be a _ must _ such as be present by the law of nature it be quite true that the moral law be entirely conditional there be a world and a view of life in which it have neither validity nor significance that world be properly speak the real world in which as individual we live for every regard pay to morality be a denial of that world and of we individual life in it it be a view of the world however which do not go beyond the principle of sufficient reason and the opposite view proceeds by the intuition of idea \* \* \* \* \* if a man be under the influence of two opposite but very strong motive a and b and i be greatly concern that he should choose a but still more that he should never be untrue to he choice and by change he mind betray I or the like it will not do for I to say anything that might hinder the motive b from have its full effect upon he and only emphasise a for then i should never be able to reckon on he decision what i have to do be rather to put both motive before he at the same time in as vivid and clear a way as possible so that they may work upon he with they whole force the choice that he then make be the decision of he inmost nature and stand firm to all eternity in say _ i will do this _ he have say _ i must do this _ i have get at he will and i can rely upon its work as steadily as one of the force of nature it be as certain as fire kindle and water wet that he will act accord to the motive which have prove to be stronger for he insight and knowledge may be attain and lose again they may be change or improve or destroy but will can not be change that be why _ i apprehend i perceive i see _ be subject to alteration and uncertainty _ i will _ pronounced on a right apprehension of motive be as firm as nature itself the difficulty however lie in get at a right apprehension a man 's apprehension of motive may change or be correct or pervert and on the other hand he circumstance may undergo a alteration \* \* \* \* \* a man should exercise a almost boundless toleration and placability because if he be capricious enough to refuse to forgive a single individual for the meanness or evil that lie at he door it be do the rest of the world a quite unmerited honor but at the same time the man who be every one 's friend be no one 's friend it be quite obvious what sort of friendship it be which we hold out to the human race and to which it be open to almost every man to return no matter what he may have do \* \* \* \* \* with the ancient _ friendship _ be one of the chief element in morality but friendship be only limitation and partiality it be the restriction to one individual of what be the due of all mankind namely the recognition that a man 's own nature and that of mankind be identical at most it be a compromise between this recognition and selfishness \* \* \* \* \* a lie always have its origin in the desire to extend the dominion of one 's own will over other individual and to deny they will in order the better to affirm one 's own consequently a lie be in its very nature the product of injustice malevolence and villainy that be why truth sincerity candor and rectitude be at once recognize and value as praiseworthy and noble quality because we presume that the man who exhibit they entertain no sentiment of injustice or malice and therefore stand in no need of conceal such sentiment he who be open cherish nothing that be bad \* \* \* \* \* there be a certain kind of courage which spring from the same source as good-nature what i mean be that the good-natured man be almost as clearly conscious that he exist in other individual as in himself i have often show how this feeling give rise to good-nature it also give rise to courage for the simple reason that the man who possess this feeling care less for he own individual existence as he live almost as much in the general existence of all creature accordingly he be little concerned for he own life and its belongings this be by no mean the sole source of courage for it be a phenomenon due to various cause but it be the noblest kind of courage as be show by the fact that in its origin it be associate with great gentleness and patience man of this kind be usually irresistible to woman \* \* \* \* \* all general rule and precept fail because they proceed from the false assumption that man be constitute wholly or almost wholly alike a assumption which the philosophy of helvetius expressly make whereas the truth be that the original difference between individual in intellect and morality be immeasurable \* \* \* \* \* the question as to whether morality be something real be the question whether a well-grounded counter-principle to egoism actually exist as egoism restrict concern for welfare to a single individual _ viz _ the man 's own self the counter-principle would have to extend it to all other individual \* \* \* \* \* it be only because the will be above and beyond time that the sting of conscience be ineradicable and do not like other pain gradually wear away no a evil deed weigh on the conscience year afterwards as heavily as if it have be freshly commit \* \* \* \* \* character be innate and conduct be merely its manifestation the occasion for great misdeed come seldom strong counter-motive keep we back we disposition be reveal to ourselves by we desire thought emotion when it remain unknown to other reflect on all this we might suppose it possible for a man to possess in some sort a innate evil conscience without ever have do anything very bad \* \* \* \* \* _ do not do to other what you would not like do to yourself _ this be perhaps one of those argument that prove or rather ask too much for a prisoner might address it to a judge \* \* \* \* \* stupid people be generally malicious for the very same reason as the ugly and the deform similarly genius and sanctity be akin however simple-minded a saint may be he will nevertheless have a dash of genius in he and however many error of temperament or of actual character a genius may possess he will still exhibit a certain nobility of disposition by which he show he kinship with the saint \* \* \* \* \* the great difference between law without and law within between the state and the kingdom of god be very clear it be the state 's business to see that _ every one should have justice do to he _ it regard man as passive being and therefore take no account of anything but they action the moral law on the other hand be concern that _ every one should do justice _ it regard man as active and look to the will rather than the deed to prove that this be the true distinction let the reader consider what would happen if he be to say conversely that it be the state 's business that every one should do justice and the business of the moral law that every one should have justice do to he the absurdity be obvious as a example of the distinction let I take the case of a debtor and a creditor dispute about a debt which the former deny a lawyer and a moralist be present and show a lively interest in the matter both desire that the dispute should end in the same way although what they want be by no mean the same the lawyer say _ i want this man to get back what belong to he _ and the moralist _ i want that man to do he duty _ it be with the will alone that morality be concerned whether external force hinder or fail to hinder the will from work do not in the least matter for morality the external world be real only in so far as it be able or unable to lead and influence the will as soon as the will be determine that be as soon as a resolve be take the external world and its event be of no further moment and practical do not exist for if the event of the world have any such reality -- that be to say if they possess a significance in themselves or any other than that derive from the will which be affect by they -- what a grievance it would be that all these event lie in the realm of chance and error it be however just this which prove that the important thing be not what happen but what be will accordingly let the incident of life be leave to the play of chance and error to demonstrate to man that he be as chaff before the wind the state concern itself only with the incident -- with what happen nothing else have any reality for it i may dwell upon thought of murder and poison as much as i please : the state do not forbid I so long as the axe and rope control my will and prevent it from become action ethic ask : what be the duty towards other which justice impose upon we in other word what must i render the law of nature ask : what need i not submit to from other that be what must i suffer the question be put not that i may do no injustice but that i may not do more than every man must do if he be to safeguard he existence and than every man will approve be do in order that he may be treat in the same way himself and further that i may not do more than society will permit I to do the same answer will serve for both question just as the same straight line can be draw from either of two opposite direction namely by oppose force or again as the angle can give the sine or the sine the angle it have be say that the historian be a inverted prophet in the same way it may be say that a teacher of law be a inverted moralist -lrb- _ viz _ a teacher of the duty of justice -rrb- or that politics be inverted ethic if we exclude the thought that ethic also teach the duty of benevolence magnanimity love and so on the state be the gordian knot that be cut instead of be untie it be columbus ' egg which be make to stand by be break instead of balanced as though the business in question be to make it stand rather than to balance it in this respect the state be like the man who think that he can produce fine weather by make the barometer go up \* \* \* \* \* the pseudo-philosopher of we age tell we that it be the object of the state to promote the moral aim of mankind this be not true it be rather the contrary which be true the aim for which mankind exist -- the expression be parabolic -- be not that a man should act in such and such a manner for all _ opera opera _ thing that have actually be do be in themselves matter of indifference no the aim be that the will of which every man be a complete specimen -- nay be the very will itself -- should turn whither it need to turn that the man himself -lrb- the union of thought and will -rrb- should perceive what this will be and what horror it contain that he should show the reflection of himself in he own deed in the abomination of they the state which be wholly concern with the general welfare check the manifestation of the bad will but in no wise check the will itself the attempt would be impossible it be because the state check the manifestation of he will that a man very seldom see the whole abomination of he nature in the mirror of he deed or do the reader actually suppose there be no people in the world as bad as robespierre napoleon or other murderer do he fail to see that there be many who would act like they if only they could many a criminal die more quietly on the scaffold than many a non-criminal in the arm of he family the one have perceive what he will be and have discard it the other have not be able to discard it because he have never be able to perceive what it be the aim of the state be to produce a fool 's paradise and this be in direct conflict with the true aim of life namely to attain a knowledge of what the will in its horrible nature really be \* \* \* \* \* napoleon be not really worse than many not to say most man he be possess of the very ordinary egoism that seek its welfare at the expense of other what distinguish he be merely the greater power he have of satisfy he will and greater intelligence reason and courage add to which chance give he a favourable scope for he operation by means of all this he do for he egoism what a thousand other man would like to do for theirs but can not every feeble lad who by little act of villainy gain a small advantage for himself by put other to some disadvantage although it may be equally small be just as bad as napoleon those who fancy that retribution come after death would demand that napoleon should by unutterable torment pay the penalty for all the numberless calamity that he cause but he be no more culpable than all those who possess the same will unaccompanied by the same power the circumstance that in he case this extraordinary power be add allow he to reveal the whole wickedness of the human will and the suffering of he age as the necessary obverse of the medal reveal the misery which be inextricably bind up with this bad will it be the general manipulation of this will that constitute the world but it be precisely that it should be understand how inextricably the will to live be bind up with and be really one and the same as this unspeakable misery that be the world 's aim and purpose and it be a aim and purpose which the appearance of napoleon do much to assist not to be a unmeaning fool ' paradise but a tragedy in which the will to live understand itself and yield -- that be the object for which the world exist napoleon be only a enormous mirror of the will to live the difference between the man who cause suffering and the man who suffer it be only phenomenal it be all a will to live identical with great suffering and it be only by understand this that the will can mend and end \* \* \* \* \* what chiefly distinguish ancient from modern time be that in ancient time to use napoleon 's expression it be affair that reign : _ les paroles aux chose _ in modern time this be not so what i mean be that in ancient time the character of public life of the state and of religion as well as of private life be a strenuous affirmation of the will to live in modern time it be a denial of this will for such be the character of christianity but now while on the one hand that denial have suffer some abatement even in public opinion because it be too repugnant to human character on the other what be publicly deny be secretly affirm hence it be that we see half measure and falsehood everywhere and that be why modern time look so small beside antiquity \* \* \* \* \* the structure of human society be like a pendulum swing between two impulse two evil in polar opposition _ despotism _ and _ anarchy _ the further it get from the one the nearer it approach the other from this the reader might hit on the thought that if it be exactly midway between the two it would be right far from it for these two evil be by no means equally bad and dangerous the former be incomparably less to be fear its ill exist in the main only as possibility and if they come at all it be only one among million that they touch but with anarchy possibility and actuality be inseparable its blow fall on every man every day therefore every constitution should be a nearer approach to a despotism than to anarchy nay it must contain a small possibility of despotism end of the project gutenberg ebook of the essay of arthur schopenhauer by arthur schopenhauer
