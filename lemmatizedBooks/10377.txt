mansion-house it lay in the midst of a demesne of considerable extent and richly wooded with venerable timber but apart from the somber majesty of these giant group and the variety of the undulating ground on which they stand there be little that could be deem attractive in the place a certain air of neglect and decay and a indescribable gloom and melancholy hung over it in darkness it seem darker than any other tract when the moonlight fall upon its glade and hollow they look spectral and awful with a sort of churchyard loneliness and even when the blush of the morning kiss its broad woodland there be a melancholy in the salute that sadden rather than cheer the heart of the beholder this antique melancholy and neglect place we shall call for distinctness sake gray forest it be

wherewith to console himself and in the consciousness of these possession he find some imperfect assuagement of those bitter feeling of suppress scorn and resentment which a sense of lose station and slight importance engender mr marston 's early habit have unhappily be of a kind to aggravate rather than alleviate the annoyance incidental to reduce means he have be a gay man a voluptuary and a gambler he vicious taste have survive the means of they gratification he love for he wife have be nothing more than one of those vehement and headstrong fancy which in self-indulgent man sometimes

all observer but equally impossible be it to converse with she for even a minute without hearing in the gentle and melancholy music of she voice the sad echo of those grief to which she early beauty have be sacrifice a undying sense of lose love and happiness depart never to come again one morning mr marston have walk as be he custom when he expect the messenger who bring from the neighbor post office he letter some way down the broad straight avenue with its double row of lofty tree at each side when he encounter the nimble emissary on he return he take the letter-bag in silence it contain but two letter -- one address to mademoiselle de barras chez m marston and the other to himself he take they both dismiss the messenger and opening that address to himself read as follow while he slowly retrace he step towards the house : -- dear richard i be a whimsical fellow as you doubtless remember and have lately grow they tell I rather hippish besides i do not know to which infirmity i

suit you convenience -- yours & c wynston e berkley ps -- direct to I at -- hotel in chester as i shall probably be there by the time this reach you ill-bred and push as ever quoth mr marston angrily as he thrust the unwelcome letter into he pocket this fellow wallow in wealth without one nearer relative on earth than i and associate more nearly still with I the -- pshaw not affection -- the recollection of early and intimate companionship leave I unaided for year of desertion and suffer to the buffeting of the world and the trouble of all but overwhelming pecuniary difficulty and now with the cool confidence of one entitle to respect and welcome invite himself to my house come here he continue after a gloomy pause and still pacing slowly towards the house to collect amusing material for next season 's gossip -- story about the married benedick -- the bankrupt beau -- the outcast tenant of a cheshire wilderness and as he say this he look at the neglect prospect before he with a eye almost of hatred aye to see the nakedness of the land be he come but he shall be disappoint he money may buy he a cordial welcome at a inn but curse I if it shall purchase he a reception here he again open and glance through the letter aye purposely put in such a way that i can not decline it without affront he he continue doggedly well then he have no one to blame but himself -- affront he shall be i shall effectually put a end to this humorous excursion egad it be rather hard if a man can not keep he poverty to himself sir wynston berkley be a baronet of large fortune -- a selfish fashionable man and a inveterate bachelor he and marston have be schoolfellow and the violent and implacable temper of the latter have as little impressed he companion with feeling of regard as the frivolity and selfishness of the baronet have win the esteem of he relative as boy they have little in common upon which to rest the basis of a friendship or even a mutual liking berkley be gay cold and satirical he cousin -- for cousin they be -- be jealous haughty and relentless they negative disinclination to one another 's society not unnaturally engender by uncongenial and unamiable disposition have for a time give place to actual hostility while the two young man be at oxford in some intrigue marston discover in he cousin a too-successful rival the consequence be a bitter and furious quarrel which but for the prompt and peremptory interference of friend marston would undoubtedly have push to a bloody issue time have however heal this rupture and the young man come to regard one another with the same feeling and eventually to re-establish the same sort of cold and indifferent intimacy which have subsist between they before they angry collision under these circumstance whatever suspicion marston might have feel on the receipt of the unexpected and indeed unaccountable proposal which have just reach he he certainly have little reason to complain of any violation of early friendship in the neglect with which sir wynston have hitherto treat he in decide to decline he proposed visit however marston have not consult the impulse of spite or anger he know the baronet well he know that he cherish no good will towards he and that in the project which he have thus unexpectedly broach whatever indirect or selfish scheme might possibly be at the bottom of it no friendly feeling have ever mingle he be therefore resolve to avoid the trouble and the expense of a visit in all respects distasteful to he and in a gentlemanlike way but at the same time as the reader may suppose with very little anxiety as to whether or not he gay correspondent should take offence at he reply to decline once for all the propose distinction with this resolution he enter the spacious and somewhat dilapidated mansion which call he master and enter a sit room appropriate to he daughter 's use he find she there in company with she beautiful french governess he kiss he child and salute she young preceptress with formal courtesy mademoiselle say he i have get a letter for you and rhoda he continue address he pretty daughter bring this to you mother and say i request she to read it he give she the letter he himself have just receive and the girl trip lightly away upon she mission have he narrowly scrutinise the countenance of the fair frenchwoman as she glance at the direction of that which he have just place in she hand he might have see certain transient but very unmistakable evidence of excitement and agitation she quickly conceal the letter however and with a sigh the momentary flush which it have call to she cheek subside and she be tranquil as usual mr marston remain for some minute -- five eight or ten we can not say precisely -- pretty much where he have stand on first enter the chamber doubtless await the return of he messenger or the appearance of he wife at length however he leave the room himself to seek she but during he brief stay he previous resolution have be remove by what influence we can not say but remove completely it unquestionably be and a final determination that sir wynston berkley should become he guest have fixedly take its place as marston walk along the passage which lead from this room he encounter mr marston and he daughter well say he you have read wynston 's letter yes she reply return it to he and what answer richard do you purpose give he she be about to hazard a conjecture but check herself remember that even so faint a evidence of a disposition to advise might possibly be resent by she cold and imperious lord i have consider it and decide to receive he he reply ah i be afraid -- that be i hope -- he may find we housekeeping such as he can enjoy she say with a involuntary expression of surprise for she have scarcely have a doubt that she husband would have prefer evade the visit of he fine friend under he gloomy circumstance if we modest fare do not suit he say marston with sullen bitterness he can depart as easily as he come we poor gentleman can but do we best i have think it over and make up my mind and how soon my dear richard do you intend fix he arrival she inquire with the natural uneasiness of one upon whom in a establishment whose pretension considerably exceed its resource the perplexing care of housekeeping devolve why as soon as he please reply he i suppose you can easily have he room prepare by tomorrow or next day i shall write by this mail and tell he to come down at once have say this in a cold decisive way he turn and leave she as it seem not care to be tease with further question he take he solitary way to a distant part of he wild park where far from the likelihood of disturbance or intrusion he be often wont to amuse himself for the live-long day in the sedentary sport of shooting rabbit and there we leave he for the present signify to the distant inmate of he house the industrious pursuit of he unsocial occupation by the drop fire that sullenly from hour to hour echo from the remote wood mr marston issue she order and have set on foot all the necessary preparation for so unwonted a event as a stranger 's visit of some duration she betake herself to she little boudoir -- the scene of many a hour of patient but bitter suffering unseen by human eye and unknown except to the just searcher of heart to whom belong mercy -- and vengeance mr marston have but two friend to whom she have ever speak upon the subject nearest she heart -- the estrangement of she husband a sorrow to which even time have fail to reconcile she from she child this grief be carefully conceal to they she never utter the semblance of a complaint anything that could by possibility have reflect blame or dishonor upon they father she would have perish rather than have allow they so much as to suspect the two friend who do understand she feeling though in different degree be one a good and venerable clergyman the rev doctor danver a frequent visitor and occasional guest at gray forest where he simple manners and unaffected benignity and tenderness of heart have win the love of all with the exception of its master and command even he respect the

next to that of she daughter she greatest comfort and pleasure mademoiselle de barras be of a noble though ruin french family and a certain nameless elegance and dignity attest spite of she fall condition the purity of she descent she be accomplish -- possess of that fine perception and sensitiveness and that ready power of self-adaptation to the peculiarity and mood of other which we term tact -- and be moreover gifted with a certain natural grace and manners the most winning imaginable in short she be a fascinating companion and when the melancholy circumstance of she own situation and the sad history of she once rich and noble family be take into account with she striking attraction of person and air the combination of all these association and impression render she one of the most interesting person that could well be imagine the circumstance of mademoiselle de barras 's history and descent seem to warrant on mr marston 's part a closer intimacy and confidence than usually subsist between party mutually occupy such a relation mr marston have hardly establish herself in this little apartment when a light foot approach a gentle tap be give at the door and mademoiselle de barras enter ah mademoiselle so kind -- such pretty flower pray sit down say the lady with a sweet and grateful smile as she take from the tapered finger of the foreigner the little bouquet which she

kindness -- and so it be with mademoiselle 's bouquet and gentle kiss mr marston 's heart be touch she eye fill with bright tear she smile gratefully upon she fair and humble companion and as she smile she tear overflow and she weep in silence for some minute my poor mademoiselle she say at last you be so very very kind mademoiselle say nothing she lower she eye and press the poor lady 's hand apparently to interrupt a embarrassing silence and to give a more cheerful tone to they little interview the governess in a gay tone on a sudden say -- and so madame we be to have a visitor miss rhoda

smile and while mademoiselle re-adjust the tiny flower which form the bouquet she have just present to she mr marston good-naturedly recount to she all she know of sir wynston berkley which in substance amount to no more than we have already state when she conclude the young frenchwoman continue for some time silent still busy with she flower but suddenly she heave a deep sigh and shake she head you seem disquieted mademoiselle say mr marston in a tone of kindness i be think madame she say still look upon the flower which she be adjust and again sigh profoundly i be thinking of what you

she visibly as she lean over the gentle lady 's neck and murmur dear madame how happy -- how very happy you make I such a spectator as he look at that gentle lady might have see for one dreamy moment a lithe and painted serpent coil round and round and hiss in she ear a few minute more and mademoiselle be in the solitude of she own apartment she shut and bolt the door and take from she desk the letter which she have that morning receive throw herself into a armchair and study the document profoundly she actual revision and scrutiny of the letter itself be interrupt by long interval of profound abstraction and after a full hour thus spend she lock it carefully up again and with a clear brow and a gay smile rejoin she pretty pupil for a walk we must now pass over a interval of a few day and come at once to the arrival of sir wynston berkley which duly occur upon the evening of the day appoint the baronet descend from he chaise but a short time before the hour at which the little party which form the family at gray forest be wont to assemble for the social meal of supper a few minute devote to the mystery of the toilet with the aid of a accomplished valet enable he to appear as he conceive without disadvantage at this domestic reunion sir wynston berkley be a particularly gentleman-like person he be rather tall and elegantly make with gay easy manners and something indefinably aristocratic in he face which however be a little more worn than he year would have strictly account for but sir wynston have be a roué and spite of the cleverest possible make up the ravages of excess be very traceable in the lively beau of fifty perfectly well dress and with a manner that be ease and gaiety itself he be at home from the moment he enter the room of course anything like genuine cordiality be out of the question but mr marston embrace he relative with perfect good breeding and the baronet appear determine to like everybody and be please with everything he have not be five minute in the parlor chat gaily with mr and mr marston and they pretty daughter when mademoiselle de barras enter the room as she move towards mr marston sir wynston rise and observe she with evident admiration say in a undertone inquiringly to marston who be beside he -- and this that be mademoiselle de barras my daughter 's governess and mr marston 's companion say marston drily ha say sir wynston i think you be but three at home just now and i be right you son be at cambridge i hear so from we old friend jack manbury jack have he boy there too egad dick it seem but last week that you and i be there together yes say marston look gloomily into the fire as if he see in its smoke and flicker the phantom of murder time and opportunity but i hate look back wynston the past be to I but a medley of ill-luck and worse management why what a ungrateful dog you be return sir wynston gaily turn he back upon the fire and glance round the spacious and handsome though somewhat fade apartment i be on the point of congratulating you on the possession of the finest park and noblest demesne in cheshire when you begin to grumble egad dick all i can say to you complaint be that i do not pity you and there be dozen who may honestly envy you -- that be all in spite of this cheer assurance marston remain sullenly silent supper however have now be serve and the little party assume they place at the table i be sorry wynston i have no sport of any kind to offer you here say marston except indeed some good trout-fishing if you like it i have three mile of excellent fishing at you command my dear fellow i be a mere cockney rejoin sir wynston i be not a sportsman i never try it and should not like to begin now no dick what i much prefer be abundance of you fresh air and the enjoyment of you scenery when i be at rouen three year ago -- ha -- rouen mademoiselle will feel a interest in that it be she birth-place interrupted marston glancing at the frenchwoman yes -- rouen -- ah -- yes say mademoiselle with very evident embarrassment sir wynston appear for a moment a little disconcerted too but rally speedily and pursue he detail of he doings at that fair town of normandy marston know sir wynston well and he rightly calculate that whatever effect he experience of the world might have have in intensify he selfishness or harden he heart it certainly could have have none in improve a character originally worthless and unfeeling he know moreover that he wealthy cousin be gifted with a great deal of that small cunning which be available for mask the little scheming of frivolous and worldly man and that sir wynston never take trouble of any kind without a sufficient purpose have its center in he own personal gratification this visit greatly puzzle marston it give he even a vague sense of uneasiness could there exist any flaw in he own title to the estate of gray forest he have a unpleasant doubtful sort of remembrance of some apprehension of this kind when he be but a child have be whisper in the family could this really be so and could the baronet have be lead to make this unexpected visit merely for the purpose of personally examine into the condition or a property of which he be about to become the legal invader the nature of this suspicion afford at all event a fair gauge of marston 's estimate of he cousin 's character and as he revolve these doubt from time to time and as he think of mademoiselle de barras 's transient but unaccountable embarrassment at the mention of rouen by sir wynston -- a embarrassment which the baronet himself appear for a moment to reciprocate -- undefined glimmer suspicion of another kind flicker through the darkness of he mind he be effectually puzzle he surmise and conjecture baffle and he more than half repent that he have accede to he cousin 's proposal and admit he as a inmate of he house although sir wynston comport himself as if he be conscious of be the very most welcome visitor who could possibly have establish himself at gray forest he be doubtless fully aware of the real feeling with which he be regard by he host if he have in reality a object in prolong he stay and wish to make the postponement of he departure the direct interest of he entertainer he unquestionably take effectual measure for that purpose the little party break up every evening at about ten o'clock and sir wynston retire to he chamber at the same hour he find little difficulty in induce marston to amuse he there with a quiet game of piquet in he own room therefore in the luxurious ease of dress gown and slipper he sit at card with he host often until a hour or two past midnight sir wynston be exorbitantly wealthy and very reckless in expenditure the stake for which they play although they gradually become in reality pretty heavy be in he eye a very unimportant consideration marston on the other hand be poor and play with the eye of a lynx and the appetite of a shark the ease and perfect good-humor with which sir wynston lose be not unimproved by he entertainer who as may readily be suppose be not sorry to reap this golden harvest provide without the slightest sacrifice on he part of pride or independence if indeed he sometimes suspect that he guest be a little more anxious to lose than to win he be also quite resolve not to perceive it but calmly persist in night after night give sir wynston as he term it he revenge or in other word treat he to a repetition of he loss all this be very agreeable to marston who begin to treat he visitor with at all event more external cordiality and distinction than at first a incident however occur which disturb these amicable relation in a unexpected way it become necessary here to mention that mademoiselle de barras 's sleep apartment open from a long corridor it be en suite with two dress room each opening also upon the corridor but wholly unused and unfurnished some five or six other apartment also open at either side upon the same passage these little local detail be premise it so happen that one day marston who have go out with the intention of angling in the trout-stream which flow through he park though at a considerable distance from the house have unexpectedly return to procure some tackle which he have forget be walk briskly through the corridor in question to he own apartment when to he surprise the door of one of the desert dressing-room of which we have speak be cautiously push open and sir wynston berkley issue from it marston be almost beside he as he do so and sir wynston make a motion as if about instinctively to draw back again and at the same time the keen ear of he host distinctly catch the sound of rustling silk and a tiptoe tread hastily withdraw from the desert chamber sir wynston look nearly as much confuse as a man of the world can look marston stop short and scan he visitor for a moment with a very peculiar expression you have catch I peeping dick i be a inveterate explorer say the baronet with a effectual effort to shake off he embarrassment a open door in a fine old house be a temptation which -- that door be usually close and ought to be keep so interrupted marston drily there be nothing whatever to be see in the room but dust and cobweb pardon I say sir wynston more easily you forget the view from the window aye the view to be sure there be a good view from it say marston with as much of he usual manner as he could resume so soon and at the same time carelessly open the door again he walk in accompany by sir wynston and both stand at the window together look out in silence upon a prospect which neither of they see yes i do think it be a good view say marston and as he turn carelessly away he dart a swift glance round the chamber the door open toward the french lady 's apartment be close but not actually shut this be enough and as they leave the room marston repeat he invitation to he guest to accompany he but in a tone which show that he scarcely follow the meaning of what he himself be say he walk undecidedly toward he own room then turn and go down stair in the hall he meet he pretty child ha rhoda say he you have not be out today no papa but it be so very fine i think i shall go now yes go and mademoiselle can accompany you do you hear rhoda mademoiselle go with you and you have better go at once a few minute more and marston from the parlor-window behold rhoda and the elegant french girl walk together towards the woodland he watch they gloomily himself unseen until the crowd underwood conceal they receding figure then with a sigh he turn and reascend the great staircase i shall sift this mystery to the bottom thought he i shall foil the conspirator if so they be with they own weapon art with art chicane with chicane duplicity with duplicity he be now in the long passage which we have just speak of and glance back and before he to ascertain that no chance eye discern he he boldly enter mademoiselle 's chamber she writing desk lay upon the table it be lock and coolly take it in he hand marston carry it into he own room bolt he chamber-door and take two or three bunch of key he carefully try nearly a dozen in succession and when almost despair of success at last find one which fit the lock turn and open the desk sustain throughout he dishonorable task by some strong and angry passion the sight of the open escritoire check and startle he for a moment violate privilege invade secrecy base perfidious espionage upbraid and stigmatize he as the intricacy of the outraged sanctuary open upon he intrusive gaze he feel for a moment shocked and humble he be impel to lock and replace the desk where he have originally find it without have effect he meditated treason but this hesitation be transient the fiery and reckless impulse which have urge he to the act return to enforce its consummation with a guilty eye and eager hand he search the contents of this tiny repository of the fair norman 's write secret ha the very thing he mutter as he detect the identical letter which he himself have hand to mademoiselle de barras but a few day before the handwriting strike I ill-disguised i think i know it we shall see he have open the letter it contain but a few line : he hold he breath while he read it first he grow pale then a shadow come over he face and then another and another darker and darker shade upon shade as if a exhalation from the pit be momentarily blacken the air about he he say nothing there be but one long gentle sigh and in he face a mortal sternness as he fold the letter again replace it and lock the desk of course when mademoiselle de barras return from she accustomed walk she find everything in she room to all appearance undisturbed and just as when she leave it while this young lady be make she toilet for the evening and while sir wynston berkley be worry himself with conjecture as to whether marston 's evil look when he encounter he that morning in the passage exist only in he own fancy or be in good truth very grim and significant reality marston himself be stride alone through the wildest and darkest solitude of he park haunt by he own unholy thought and it may be by those other evil and unearthly influence which wander as we know in desert place darkness overtake he and the chill of night in these lonely tract in he solitary walk what fearful company have he be keep as the shades of night deepen round he the sense of the neighborhood of ill the consciousness of the foul fancy or which where he be now tread he have be for hour the sport oppress he with a vague and unknown terror a certain horror of the thought which have be he comrade through the day which he could not now shake off and which haunt he with a ghastly and defiant pertinacity scare while they half-enrage he he stalk swiftly homewards like a guilty man pursue marston be not perfectly satisfied though very nearly with the evidence now in he possession the letter the steal perusal of which have so agitate he that day bear no signature but independently of the handwriting which seem spite of the constraint of a attempt disguise to be familiar to he eye there exist in the matter of the letter short as it be certain internal evidence which although not actually conclusive raise in conjunction with all the other circumstance a powerful presumption in aid of he suspicion he resolve however to sift the matter further and to bide he time meanwhile he manner must indicate no trace of he dark surmise and bitter thought deception in its two great branch simulation and dissimulation be easy to he he habitual reserve and gloom would divest any accidental and momentary disclosure of he inward trouble of everything suspicious or unaccountable which would have characterize such display and eccentricity in another man he rapid and reckless ramble a kind of physical vent for the paroxysm which have so agitate he throughout the greater part of the day have soil and disorder he dress and thus have help to give to he whole appearance a certain air of haggard wildness which in the privacy of he chamber he hasten carefully and entirely to remove at supper marston be apparently in unusually good spirit sir wynston and he chat gaily and fluently upon many subject grave and gay among they the inexhaustible topic of popular superstition happen to turn up and especially the subject of strange prophecy of the fate and fortune of individual singularly fulfil in the event of they afterlife by-the-by dick this be rather a nervous topic for I to discuss say sir wynston how so ask he host why do not you remember urge the baronet no i do not recollect what you allude to reply marston in all sincerity why do not you remember eton pursued sir

detail of housekeeping while thus engage she be disturb by a respectful tap at she door and a elderly servant who have be for many year in the employment of mr marston present himself well merton do

reach the door of mademoiselle de barras 's chamber she hear voice within exert in evident excitement she stop in amazement they be those of she husband and mademoiselle startle confound and amaze she push open the door and enter she husband be sit one hand clutch upon the arm of the chair he occupy and the other extended and clench as it seem with the emphasis of rage upon the desk that stand upon the table he face be darken with the stormiest passion and he gaze be fix upon the frenchwoman who be stand with a look half-guilty half-imploring at a little distance there be something to mr marston so utterly unexpected and even so shocking in this tableau that she stand for some seconds pale and breathless and gaze with a vacant stare of fear and horror from she husband to the french girl and from she to she husband again the three figure in this strange group remain fixed silent and aghast for several seconds mr marston endeavor to speak but though she lip move no sound escape she and from very weakness she sink half-fainting into a chair marston rise throw as he do so a guilty and furious glance at the young frenchwoman and walk a step or two toward the door he hesitate however and turn just as mademoiselle burst into tear throw she arm round mr marston 's neck and passionately exclaim protect I madame i implore from the insult and suspicion of you husband marston stand a little behind he wife and he and the governess exchange a glance of keen significance as the latter sink sob like a injured child into its mother 's embrace upon the poor lady 's tortured bosom madame

center of the apartment alone erect with heave breast and burning cheek -- beautiful thoughtful guilty -- the very type of the fall angelic there for a time she heart all confusion she mind darken we must leave she various course before she and as yet without resolution to choose among they a lose spirit bear on the eddy of the storm fearless and self-reliant but with no star to guide she on she dark malign and forlorn way mr marston in she own room review the agitating scene through which she have just be so unexpectedly carry the tremendous suspicion which at the first disclosure of the tableau we have describe smite the heart and brain of the poor lady with the stun of a thunderbolt have be indeed subsequently disturbed and afterwards contradict but the shock of she first impression remain still upon she mind and heart she feel still through every nerve the vibration of that maddening terror and despair which have overcome she sens for a moment the surprise the shock the horror outlive the obliterate influence of what follow she be in this agitation when mademoiselle de barras enter she chamber resolve with all she art to second and support the success of she prompt measure in the recent critical emergency she have come she say to bid she dear madame farewell for she be resolve to go she own room have be invade that insult and reproach might be heap upon she how utterly unmerited mr marston know she have be call by every foul name which apply to the spy and the maligner she could not bear it some one have evidently be endeavor to procure she removal and have but too effectually succeed mademoiselle be determine to go early the next morning nothing should prevent or retard she departure she resolution be take in this strain do mademoiselle run on but in a subdue and melancholy tone and weep profusely the wild and ghastly suspicion which have for a moment flash terribly upon the mind of mr marston have fade away under the influence of reason and reflection although indeed much painful excitement still remain before mademoiselle de barras have visit she room marston 's temper she know but too well it be violent bitter and impetuous and though he care little if at all for she she have ever perceive that he be angrily jealous of the slightest intimacy or confidence by which any other than himself might establish a influence over she mind that he have learn the subject of some of she most interesting conversation with mademoiselle she could not doubt for he have violently upbraid that young lady in she presence with have discuss it and here now be mademoiselle herself take refuge with she from galling affront and unjust reproach incensed wound and weep the whole thing be consistent all the circumstance bear plainly in the same direction the evidence be conclusive and mr marston 's thought and feeling respect she fair young confidante quickly find they old level and flow on tranquilly and sadly in they accustomed channel while mademoiselle de barras be thus with the persevere industry of the spider repair the mesh which a chance breath have shatter she would perhaps have be in she turn shock and startle could she have glance into marston 's mind and see in what be pass there the real extent of she danger marston be walk as usual alone and in the most solitary region of he lonely park one hand grasp he walk stick not to lean upon it but as if it be the handle of a battle-axe the other be bury in he bosom he dark face look upon the ground and he stride onward with a slow but energetic step which have the air of deep resolution he find himself at last in a little churchyard lie far among the wild forest of he demesne and in the midst of which cover with ivy and tufted plant now ruddy with autumnal tint stand the ruin wall of a little chapel in the dilapidated vault close by lay bury many of he ancestor and under the little wavy hillock of fern and nettle sleep many a humble villager he sit down upon a worn tombstone in this lowly ruin and with he eye fix upon the ground he surrender he spirit to the stormy and evil thought which he have invite long and motionless he sit there while he foul fancy and scheme begin to assume shape and order the wind rush through the ivy rouse he for a moment and as he raise he gloomy eye it alight accidentally upon a skull which some wanton hand have fix in a crevice of the wall he avert he glance quickly but almost as quickly refix he gaze upon the impassive symbol of death with a expression glowering and contemptuous and with a angry gesture strike it down among the weed with he stick he leave the place and wander on through the wood man can not control the thought that flit across they mind he mutter as he go along anymore than they can direct the shadow of the cloud that sail above they they come and pass and leave no stain behind what then of omen and that wretched effigy of death stuff -- pshaw murder indeed i be incapable of murder i have draw my sword upon a man in fair duel but murder out upon the think out upon it he stamp upon the ground with a pang at once of fury and horror he walk on a little stop again and folding he arm lean against a ancient tree mademoiselle de barras _ vous êtes une traîtresse _ and you shall go yes go you shall you have deceive I and we must part he say this with melancholy bitterness and after a pause continue : i will have no other revenge no though i dare say she will care but little for this very little if at all and then as to the other person he resume after a pause it be not the first time he have act like a trickster he have cross I before and i will choose a opportunity to tell he my mind i will not mince matter with he either and will not spare he one insulting syllable that he deserve he wear a sword and so do i if he please he may draw it he shall have the opportunity but at all event i will make it impossible for he to prolong he disgraceful visit at my house on reach home and he own study the servant merton present himself and he master too deeply excite to hear he then appoint the next day for the purpose there be no contend against marston 's peremptory will and the man reluctantly withdraw here be apparently a matter of no imaginable moment whether this menial should be discharge on that day or on the morrow and yet mighty thing be involve in the alternative there be a deeper gloom than usual over the house the servant seem to know that something have go wrong and look grave and mysterious marston be more than ever dark and moody mr marston 's dim and swollen eye show that she have be weep mademoiselle absented herself from supper on the plea of a bad headache rhoda see that something she know not what have occur to agitate she elder and be depressed and anxious the old clergyman whom we have already mention have call and stay to supper dr danver be a man of considerable learning strong sense and remarkable simplicity of character he thoughtful blue eye and well-marked countenance be full of gentleness and benevolence and elevated by a certain natural dignity of which purity and goodness without one debase shade of self-esteem and arrogance be the animate spirit mr marston loved and respect this good minister of god and many a time have seek and find in he gentle and earnest counsel and in the overflow tenderness of he sympathy much comfort and support in the progress of she sore and protracted earthly trial most especially at one critical period in she history have he endear himself to she by interpose and successfully to prevent a formal separation which -lrb- as end forever the one hope that cheer she on even in the front of despair -rrb- she would probably not long have survive with mr marston however he be far from be a favorite there be that in he lofty and simple purity which abashed and silently reproach the sensual bitter disappointed man of the world the angry pride of the scornful man feel its own meanness in the grand presence of a simple and humble christian minister and the very fact that all he habit have lead he to hold such a character in contempt make he but the more unreasonably resent the involuntary homage which its exhibition in dr danver 's person invariably extort from he he feel in this good man 's presence under a kind of irritating restraint that he be in the presence of one with whom he have and could have no sympathy whatever and yet one whom he could not help both admire and respect and in these conflict feeling be involve certain gloomy and humbling inference about himself which he hate and almost fear to contemplate it be well however for the indulgence of sir wynston 's conversational propensity that dr danver have happen to drop in for marston be doggedly silent and sullen and mr marston be herself scarcely more disposed than he to maintain she part in a conversation so that have it not be for the opportune arrival of the good clergyman the supper must have be dispatch with a very awkward and unsocial taciturnity marston thought and perhaps not erroneously that sir wynston suspect something of the real state of affair and he be therefore incense to perceive as he think in he manner very evident indication of he be in unusually good spirit thus dispose the party sit down to supper one of we number be miss say sir wynston affect a slight surprise which perhaps he do not feel mademoiselle de barras -- i trust she be well say doctor danver look towards marston i suppose she be i do not know say marston drily why how should he know say the baronet gaily but with something almost imperceptibly sarcastic in he tone we friend marston be privileged to be as ungallant as he please except where he have the happy privilege to owe allegiance but i a gay young bachelor of fifty be naturally curious i really do trust that we charming french friend be not unwell he address he inquiry to mr marston who with some slight confusion reply : -- no nothing at least serious merely a slight headache i be sure she will be quite well enough to come down to breakfast she be indeed a very charming and interesting young person say doctor danver there be a certain simplicity about she which argue a good and kind heart and a open nature very true indeed doctor observe berkley with the same faint but to marston exquisitely provoke approximation to sarcasm there be as you say a very charming simplicity do not you think so marston marston look at he for a moment but continue silent poor mademoiselle -- she be indeed a most affectionate creature say mr marston who feel call upon to say something come marston will you contribute nothing to the general fund of approbation say sir wynston who be gifted by nature with a amiable talent for tease which he be fond of exercise in a quiet way we have all but you say something handsome of we absent young friend i never praise anybody wynston not even you say marston with a obvious sneer well well i must comfort myself with the belief that you silence cover a great deal of good-will and perhaps a little admiration too answer he cousin significantly comfort yourself in any honest way you will my dear wynston retort marston with a degree of asperity which to all but the baronet himself be unaccountable you may be right you may be wrong on a subject so unimportant it matter very little which you be at perfect liberty to practice delusion if you will upon yourself by-the-bye mr marston be not you son about to come down here ask doctor danver who perceive that the altercation be become on marston 's part somewhat testy if not positively rude yes i expect he in a few day reply he with a sudden gloom you have not see he sir wynston ask the clergyman i have that pleasure yet to come say the baronet a pleasure it be i do assure you say doctor danver heartily he be a handsome lad with the heart of a hero -- a fine frank generous lad and as merry as a lark yes yes interrupted marston he be well enough and have do pretty well at cambridge doctor danver take some wine it be strange but yet mournfully true that the praise which the good doctor danver thus bestow upon he son be bitter to the soul of the unhappy marston they jar upon he ear and sting he heart for he conscience convert they into so many latent insult and humiliation to himself you wine be very good marston i think you claret be many degree better than any i can get say sir wynston sip a glass of he favorite wine you country gentleman be sad selfish dog and with all you grumble manage to collect the best of whatever be worth have about you we sometimes succeed in collect a pleasant party retort marston with ironical courtesy though we do not always command the means of entertain they quite as we would wish it be the habit of doctor danver without respect of person or place to propose before take he departure from whatever domestic party he chance to be throw among for the evening to read some verse from that holy book on which he own hope and peace be found and to offer up a prayer for all to the throne of grace marston although he usually absent himself from such exercise do not otherwise discourage they but upon the present occasion start from he gloomy reverie he himself be the first to remind the clergyman of he customary observance evil thought loom upon the mind of marston like measureless black mist upon a cold smooth sea they rest grow and darken there and no heaven-sent breath come silently to steal they away under this dread shadow he mind lay wait like the deep before the spirit of god move upon its water passive and awful why for the first time now do religion interest he the unseen intangible be even now at work within he a dreadful power shake he very heart and soul there be some strange ghastly wrestling go on in he own immortal spirit a struggle that make he faint which he have no power to determine he look upon the holy influence of the good man 's prayer -- a prayer in which he could not join -- with a dull superstitious hope that the word invite better influence though utter by another and with other object would like a spell chase away the foul fiend that be busy with he soul marston sate look into the fire with a countenance of stern gloom upon which the wayward light of the flickering hearth sport fitfully while at a distant table doctor danver sate down and take he well-worn bible from he pocket turn over its leaf and begin in gentle but impressive tone to read sir wynston be much too well breed to evince the slightest disposition to aught but the most proper and profound attention the faintest imaginable gleam of ridicule might perhaps have be discern in he feature as he lean back in he chair and close he eye compose himself to at least a attitude of attention no man could submit with more cheerfulness to a inevitable bear in these thing then thou hast no concern the judgment trouble thee not thou hast no fear of death sir wynston berkley yet there be a heart beating near thee the mystery of which could they glide out and stand before thy face would perchance appal thee cold easy man of the world aye couldst thou but see with those cunning eye of thine but twelve brief hour into futurity each syllable that fall from that good man 's lip unheeded would peal through thy heart and brain like maddening thunder hearken hearken sir wynston berkley perchance these be the farewell word of thy better angel -- the last pleading of despise mercy the party break up doctor danver take he leave and ride homeward down the broad avenue between the gigantic rank of elm that close it in the full moon be rise above the distant hill the mist lay like sleep lake in the lap of the hollow and the broad demesne look tranquil and sad under this chasten and silvery glory the good old clergyman think as he pursue he way that here at least in a spot so beautiful and sequester the stormy passion and fall contention of the outer world could scarcely penetrate yet in that calm secluded spot and under the cold pure light which fall so holily what a hell be welter and glare -- what a spectacle be that moon to go down upon as sir wynston be leave the parlor for he own room marston accompany he to the hall and say -- i sha not play tonight sir wynston ah ha very particularly engage suggest the baronet with a faint mock smile well my dear fellow we must endeavor to make up for it tomorrow -- eh i do not know that say marston and -- in a word there be no use sir in we masquerade with one another each know the other each understand the other i wish to have a word or two with you in you room tonight when we sha not be interrupted marston speak in a fierce and grating whisper and he countenance more even than he accent betray the intensity of he bridled fury sir wynston however smile upon he cousin as if he voice have be melody and he look all sunshine very good marston just as you please he say only do not be later than one as i shall be get into bed about that hour perhaps upon second thought it be as well to defer what i have to say say marston musingly tomorrow will do as well so perhaps sir wynston i may not trouble you tonight just as suit you best my dear marston reply the baronet with a tranquil smile only do not come after the hour i have stipulate so say the baronet mount the stair and make he way to he chamber he be in excellent spirit and in high good-humor with himself : the object of he visit to gray forest have be as he now flatter himself attain he have conduct a affair require the profoundest mystery in its prosecution and the nicest tactic in its management almost to a triumphant issue he have perfectly mask he design and completely outwit marston and to a person who pique himself upon he clever diplomacy and vaunted that he have never yet sustain a defeat in any object which he have seriously propose to himself such a combination of success be for the moment quite intoxicating sir wynston not only enjoy he own superiority with all the vanity of a selfish nature but he no less enjoy with a keen and malicious relish the intense mortification which he be well assure marston must experience and all the more acutely because of the utter impossibility circumstance as he be of he take any step to manifest he vexation without compromise himself in a most unpleasant way animated by these amiable feeling sir wynston berkley sate down and write the follow short letter address to mr gray wynston hall : -- mr gray on receipt of this have the sit room and several bedroom put in order and thoroughly air prepare for my use the suite of three room over the library and draw room and have the two great wardrobe and the cabinet in the state bedroom remove into the large dress room which

he own i shall meet mary on reach town have clavering -lrb- shabby dog -rrb- pay he iou yet tell the little opera woman she have better be quiet she ought to know I by this time i shall do what be

they himself in person to the post office in the neighbor village early next morning these little matter complete sir wynston stir he fire lean back in he easy chair and smile blandly over the sunny prospect of he imaginary triumph it here become necessary to describe in a few word some of the local relation of sir wynston 's apartment the bedchamber which he occupy open from the long passage of which we have already speak -- and there be two other smaller apartment open from it in train in the further of these which be enter from a lobby communicate by a back stair with the kitchen and servant ' apartment lay sir wynston 's valet and the intermediate chamber be fit up as a dress room for the baronet himself these circumstance it be necessary to mention that what follow may be clearly intelligible while the baronet be pen these record of vicious scheme -- dire waste of wealth and time -- irrevocable time -- marston pace he study in a very different frame of mind there be a gloom and disorder in the room accordant with those of he own mind shelf of ancient tome darken by time and upon which the dust of year lay sleep -- dark oaken cabinet fill with pile of deed and papers among which the nimble spider be crawl -- and from the dusky wall several stark pale ancestor look down coldly from they tarnished frame a hour and another hour pass -- and still marston pace this melancholy chamber a prey to he own fall passion and dark thought he be not a superstitious man but in the vision which haunt he perhaps be something which make he unusually excitable -- for he experience a chill of absolute horror as standing at the farther end of the room with he face turn towards the entrance he behold the door noiselessly and slowly push open by a pale thin hand and a figure dress in a loose white robe glide softly in he stand for some seconds gaze upon this apparition as it move hesitatingly towards he from the dusky extremity of the large apartment before he perceive that the form be that of mr marston hey ha -- mr marston -- what on earth have call you hither he ask sternly you ought to have be at rest a hour ago get to you chamber and leave I i have business to attend to now dear richard you must forgive I she say drawing near and look up into he haggard face with a sweet and touching look of timidity and love i could not rest until i see you

frank earnest noble he be disarm he hang he head gloomily upon he breast and be silent for a time she come nearer and lay she hand upon he arm he look darkly into she upturned eye and a feeling which have not touch he heart for many a day -- a emotion of pity transient indeed but vivid revisit he he take she hand in he and say in gentler term than she have hear he use for a long time -- no indeed

study door lock it and take out the key shut it in the drawer of one of the cabinet now it will need more than accident or impulse to lead I to he i can not go at least without reflection without premeditation avaunt fiend i have baffle you he stand in the center of the room cower and scowl as he say this and look round with a glance half-defiant half-fearful as if he expect to see some dreadful form in the dusky recess of the desolate chamber he sit himself by the smouldering fire in somber and agitate rumination he be restless he rise again unbuckled he sword which he have not loose since evening and throw it hastily into a corner he look at he watch it be half-past twelve he glance at the door and thence at the cabinet in which he have place the key then he turn hastily and sate down again he lean he elbow on he knee and he chin upon he clenched hand still he be restless and excited once more he arise and pace up and down he consult he watch again it be now but a quarter to one sir wynston 's man have receive the letter and he master 's permission to retire to rest get into he bed and be soon begin to dose we have already mention that he and sir wynston 's apartment be separate by a small dress room so that any ordinary noise or conversation could be hear but imperfectly from one to the other the servant however be startle by a sound of something fall on the floor of he master 's apartment and break to piece by the violence of the shock he sate up in he bed listen and hear some sentence speak vehemently and gabble very fast he think he distinguish the word wretch and god and there be something so strange in the tone in which they be speak that the man get up and steal noiselessly through the dress room and listen at the door he hear he as he think walk in he slipper through the room and make he customary arrangement previously to get into bed he know that he master have a habit of speak when alone and conclude that the accidental breakage of some glass or chimney-ornament have elicit the volley of word he have hear well know that except at the usual hour or in obedience to sir wynston 's bell nothing more displeased he master than he presume to enter he sleeping-apartment while he be there the servant quietly retreat and perfectly satisfied that all be right compose himself to slumber and be soon begin to dose again the adventure of the night however be not yet over waking as man sometimes do without any ascertainable cause without a start or a uneasy sensation without even a disturbance of the attitude of repose he open he eye and beheld merton the servant of whom we have speak standing at a little distance from he bed the moonlight fall in a clear flood upon this figure : the man be ghastly pale there be a blotch of blood on he face he hand be clasp upon something which they nearly conceal and he eye fix on the servant who have just awaken shone in the cold light with a wild and lifeless glitter this specter draw close to the side of the bed and stand for a few moment there with a look of agony and menace which startle the newly-awakened man who rise upright and say -- mr merton mr merton -- in god 's name what be the matter merton recoil at the sound of he voice and as he do so drop something on the floor which roll away to a distance and he stand gaze silently and horribly upon he interrogator mr merton i say what be it urge the man be you hurt you face be bloody merton raise he hand to he face mechanically and sir wynston 's man observe that it too be cover with blood why man he say vehemently and actually freezing with horror you be all bloody hand and face all over blood my hand be cut to the bone say merton in a harsh whisper and speak to himself rather than address the servant -- i wish it be my neck i wish to god i bleed to death you have hurt you hand mr merton repeat the man scarce know what he say aye whisper merton wildly draw toward the bedside again who tell you i hurt my hand it be cut to the bone sure enough he stoop for a moment over the bed and then cower down toward the floor to search for what he have drop why mr merton what bring you here at this hour urge the man after a pause of a few seconds it be draw toward morning aye aye say merton doubtfully and start upright again while he conceal in he bosom what he have be in search of near morning

for tonight thus speak in a resolute and somewhat angry under-key the valet stand between merton and the entrance of the dressing-room and signing with he hand toward the other door of the apartment continue -- go down i say mr merton go down you may as well quietly for i tell you plainly you shall neither go a step further nor stay here a moment longer the man draw he shoulder up and make a sort of shiver moan and clasp he hand together shake they as it seem in great agony he then turn abruptly and hurry from the room by the door lead to the kitchen by my faith say the servant i be glad he be go the poor chap be turn crazy as sure as i be a living man i 'll not have he prowl about here anymore however that i be resolve on in pursuance of this determination by no mean a imprudent one as it seem he fasten the door communicate with the lower apartment upon the inside he have hardly do this when he hear a step traverse the stable-yard which lay under the window of he apartment he look out and see merton walk hurriedly across and into a stable at the farther end feeling no very particular curiosity about he movement the man hurry back to he bed merton 's eccentric conduct of late have become so generally remark and discuss among the servant that sir wynston 's man be by no means surprise at the oddity of the visit he have just have nor after the first few moment of doubt before the appearance of blood have be account for have he entertain any suspicion whatever connect with the man 's unexpected presence in the room merton be in the habit of come up every night to take down sir wynston 's boot whenever the baronet have ride in the course of the day and this attention have be civilly undertake as a proof of good-will toward the valet whose duty this somewhat soiling and ungentlemanlike process would otherwise have be so far the nature of the visit be explain and the remembrance of the friendly feeling and good office which have be mutually interchange as well as of the inoffensive habit for which merton have earn a character for himself speedily calm the uneasiness for a moment amount to actual alarm with which the servant have regard he appearance we must now pass on to the morrow and ask the reader 's attention for a few moment to a different scene in contact with gray forest upon the northern side and divide by a common boundary lay a demesne in many respects present a very striking contrast to its grander neighbor it be a comparatively modern place it could not boast the towering timber which enriched and overshadow the vast and vary expanse of its aristocratic rival but if it be inferior in the advantage of antiquity and perhaps also in some of those of nature its superiority in other respects be striking and important gray forest be not more remarkable for its wild and neglect condition than be newton park for the care and elegance with which it be keep no one could observe the contrast without at the same time divine its cause the proprietor of the one be a man of wealth fully commensurate with the extent and pretension of the residence he have choose the owner of the other be a man of broken fortune under a green shade which nearly meet above a very young man scarcely one-and-twenty of a frank and sensible rather than a strictly handsome countenance be walk follow by half a dozen dog of as many breed and size this young

encounter have terminate in the defeat of marston mervyn however promptly write to he opponent offer he the free use of the water for which they have thus sharply contest and receive a curt and scarcely civil reply decline the propose courtesy this exhibition of resentment on marston 's part have be follow by some rather angry collision where chance or duty happen to throw they together it be but justice to say that upon all such occasion marston be the aggressor but mervyn be a somewhat testy old gentleman and have a certain pride of he own which be not to be trifle with thus though near neighbor the parent of the young friend be more than stranger to each other on mervyn 's side however this estrangement be unalloyed with bitterness and simply of that kind which the great

rusty mr marston have order they to leave the thing as they be and have use very stern language to the witness they have then leave the room secure both door this witness undergo a severe and search examination but he evidence be clear and consistent in conclusion marston produce a dagger which be stain with blood and ask the man whether he recognize it smith at once state this to have be the

be upon the previous night jame carney one of marston 's servant be next swear and examine he have he say observe a strange and unaccountable agitation and depression in merton 's manner for some day past he have also be several time disturb at night by he talk aloud to himself and walk to and fro in he room they bedroom be separate by a thin partition in which be a window through which carney have on the night of the murder observe a light in merton 's room and on look in have see he dress hastily he also see he twice take up and again lay down the red-hafted knife which have be find in the bed of the murder man he know it by the handle be break near the end he have no suspicion of merton have any mischievous intention and lay down again to rest he afterwards hear he pass out of he room and go slowly up the back-stairs lead to the upper story shortly after this he have fall asleep and do not hear or see he return he then describe as smith have already do the scene which present itself in the morning on he accompany he into sir wynston 's bedchamber the next witness examine be a little irish boy who describe himself as a poor scholar he testimony be somewhat singular he depose that he have come to the house on the precede evening and have be give some supper and be afterwards permit to sleep among the hay in one of the loft he have however discover what he consider a snugger berth this be a unused stable in the further end of which lay a quantity of hay among this he have lie down and go to sleep he be however awaken in the course of the night by the entrance of a man whom he see with perfect distinctness in the moonlight and he description of he dress and appearance tally exactly with those of merton this man occupy himself for sometime in wash he hand and face in a stable bucket which happen to stand by the door and during the whole of this process he continue to moan and mutter like one in woeful perturbation he say distinctly twice or thrice by -- i be do for and every now and then he mutter and nothing for it after all when he have do wash he hand he take something from he coat-pocket and look at it shake he head at this time he be stand with he back turn toward the boy so that he could not see what this object might be the man however put it into he breast and then begin to search hurriedly as it seem for some hiding place for it after look at the pavement and poke at the chink of the wall he suddenly go to the window and force up the stone which form the sill under this he throw the object which the boy have see he examine with so much perplexity and then he readjust the stone and remove the evidence of its have be recently stir the boy be a little frightened but very curious about all that he see and when the man leave the stable in which he lay he get up and follow to the door peep after he he see he put on a outside-coat and hat near the yard gate and then with great caution unbolt the wicket constantly look back towards the house and so let himself out the boy be uneasy and sit in the hay wide-awake until morning he then tell the servant what he have see and one of the man have raise the stone which he have not strength to lift they find the dagger which smith have identify as belong to he master this weapon be stain with blood and some hair which be find to correspond in color with sir wynston 's be stick in the crevice between the blade and the handle it appear very strange that one man should have employ two distinct instrument of this kind observe mervyn after a pause a silence follow yes strange it do seem strange say marston clear he voice yet it be clear say another of the jury that the same hand do employ they it be prove that the knife be in merton 's possession just as he leave he chamber and prove also that the dagger be secrete by he after he quit the house yes say marston with a grisly sort of smile and glance sarcastically at mervyn while he address the last speaker -- i thank you for recall my attention to the fact it certainly be not a very pleasant suggestion that there still remain within my household a undetected murderer mervyn ruminate for a time and say he should wish to put a few more question to smith and carney they be accordingly recall and examine in great detail with a view to ascertain whether any indication of the presence of a second person have visit the chamber with merton be discoverable nothing however appear except that the valet mention the noise and the exclamation which he have indistinctly hear you do not mention that before sir say marston sharply i do not think of it sir reply the man the gentleman be ask I so many question but i tell you sir about it in the morning oh ah -- yes yes -- i believe you do say marston but you then say that sir wynston often talk when he be alone eh sir yes sir and so he use which be the reason i do not go into the room when i hear it reply the man how long afterwards be it when you see merton in you own room ask mervyn i could not say sir answer smith i be soon asleep and can not say how long i sleep before he come be it a hour pursue mervyn i can not say say the man doubtfully be it five hour ask marston no sir i be sure it be not five could you swear it be more than half-an-hour persist marston no i could not swear that answer he i be afraid mr mervyn you have find a mare 's nest say marston contemptuously i have do my duty sir retort mervyn cynically which plainly require that i shall have no doubt which the evidence of the witness can clear up unsifted and unsatisfied i happen to think it of some moment to ascertain if possible whether more person than one be engage in this atrocious murder you do not seem to think the question so important a one different man sir take different view view sir in matter of this sort especially where they tend to multiply suspicion and to implicate other ought to be support by something more substantial than mere fancy retort marston i do not know what you call fancy reply mervyn testily but here be two deadly weapon a knife and a dagger each it would seem employ in do this murder if you see nothing odd in that i can not enable you to do so well sir say marston grimly the whole thing be as you term it odd and i can see no object in you pick out this particular singularity for long-winded criticism except to cast scandal upon my household by leave a hideous and vague imputation float among the member of it sir sir this be a foul way he cry sternly to gratify a paltry spite mr marston say mervyn rise and thrust he hand into he pocket while he confront he to the full as sternly the country know in which of we heart the spite if any there be between we be harbor i owe you no friendship but sir i cherish no malice either and against the worst enemy i have on earth i be incapable of pervert a opportunity like this and inflict pain under the pretence of discharge a duty marston be on the point of retort but the coroner interpose and besought they to confine they attention strictly to the solemn inquiry which they be summon together to prosecute there remain still to be examine the surgeon who have accompany the coroner for the purpose of report upon the extent and nature of the injury discoverable upon the person of the decease he accordingly depose that have examine the body he find no less than three deep wound inflict with some sharp instrument two of they have actually penetrate the heart and be of course suppose to cause instant death besides these there be two contusion one upon the back of the head the other upon the forehead with a slight abrasion of the eyebrow there be a large lock of hair tear out by the root at the front of the head and the palm and finger of the right hand be cut this evidence have be take the jury once more repair to the chamber where the body lay and proceed with much minuteness to examine the room with a view to ascertain if possible more particularly the exact circumstance of the murder the result of this elaborate scrutiny be as follow : -- the decease they conjecture have fall asleep in he easy chair and while he be unconscious the murderer have steal into the room and before attack he victim have secure the bedroom-door upon the inside this be argue from the non-discovery of blood upon the handle or any other part of the door it be suppose that he have then approach sir wynston with the view either of rob or of murder he while he sleep and that the decease have awaken just after he have reach he that a brief and desperate struggle have ensue in which the assailant have strike he victim with he fist upon the forehead and have stunned he have hurriedly clutch he by the hair and stab he with the dagger which lay close by upon the chimneypiece force he head violently against the back of the chair this part of the conjecture be support by the circumstance of there be discover a lock of hair upon the ground at the spot and a good deal of blood the carpet too be tumbled and a water-decanter which have stand upon the table close by be lie in fragment upon the floor it be suppose that the murderer have then drag the half-lifeless body to the bed where have substitute the knife which he have probably bring to the room in the same pocket from which the boy afterwards see he take the dagger he dispatch he and either hear some alarm -- perhaps the movement of the valet in the adjoining room or from some other cause -- he drop the knife in the bed and be not able to find it again the wound upon the hand of the dead man indicate he have catch and struggle to hold the blade of the weapon with which he be assail the impression of a bloody hand thrust under the bolster where it be sir wynston 's habit to place he purse and watch when make he arrangement for the night supply the motive of this otherwise unaccountable atrocity after some brief consultation the jury agree upon a verdict of willful murder against john merton a finding of which the coroner express he entire approbation marston as a justice of the peace have information embody the principal part of the evidence give before the coroner swear against merton and transmit a copy of they to the home office a reward for the apprehension of the culprit be forthwith offer but for some month without effect marston have in the interval write to several of sir wynston 's many relation announce the catastrophe and request that step might immediately be take to have the body remove meanwhile undertaker be busy in the chamber of death the corpse be enclose in lead and that again in cedar and a great oak shell cover with crimson cloth and goldhead nail and with a gilt plate record the age title & c & c of the decease be screw down firmly over all nearly a fortnight elapse before any reply to marston 's letter be receive a short epistle at last arrive from lord h -- the late sir wynston 's uncle deeply regret the sad and inexplicable occurrence and add that the will which on receipt of the distressing intelligence be immediately open and read contain no direction whatever respect the sepulture of the deceased which have therefore better be complete as modestly and expeditiously as possible in the neighborhood and in conclusion he direct that the account of the undertaker & c employ upon the melancholy occasion might be send in to mr skelton who have kindly undertake to leave london without any delay for the purpose of complete these last arrangement and who would in any matter of business connect with the deceased represent he lord h -- as executor of the late baronet this letter be follow in a day or two by the arrival of skelton a well-dressed languid impertinent london tuft-hunter a good deal fade with a somewhat sallow and puffy face charge with a pleasant combination at once of meanness insolence and sensuality -- just such a person as sir wynston 's parasite might have be expect to prove however well disposed to impress the native with high notion of he extraordinary refinement and importance he very soon discover that in marston he have stumble upon a man of the world and one thoroughly verse in the way and character of london life after some ineffectual attempt therefore to overawe and astonish he host mr skelton become aware of the fruitlessness of the effort and condescend to abate somewhat of he pretension marston could not avoid invite this person to pass the night at he house a invitation which be accept of course and next morning after a late breakfast mr skelton observe with a yawn -- and now about this body -- poor berkley -- what do you propose to do with he i have no proposition to make say marston drily it be no affair of mine except that the body may be remove without more delay i have no suggestion to offer h -- 's notion be to have he bury as near the spot as may be say skelton marston nod there be a kind of vault be not there in the demesne a family burial-place inquire the visitor

doubt -- be she what she seem or -- a tigress mr marston on the other hand procrastinate from day to day the painful task of announce to mademoiselle de barras the stern message with which she have be charge by she husband and thus several week have pass and she begin to think that he silence upon the subject notwithstanding he see the young french lady at breakfast every morning amount to a kind of tacit intimation that the sentence of banishment be not to be carry into immediate execution but to be keep suspend over the unconscious offender it be now six or eight week since the hearse carry away the remains of the ill-fated sir wynston berkley have drive down the dusky avenue the autumn be deepen into winter and as marston gloomily tread the wood of gray forest the withered leaf whirl drearily along he pathway and the gust that sway the mighty branch above he be rude and ungenial it be a bleak and somber day and as he break into a long and picturesque vista deep among the most sequestered wood he suddenly see before he and scarcely twenty pace from the spot on which he stand a apparition which for some moment absolutely freeze he to the earth travel-soiled tattered pale and waste john merton the murderer stand before he he do not exhibit the smallest disposition to turn about and make he escape on the contrary he remain perfectly motionless look upon he former master

rapid glance of she flash eye these eye however when mr marston look at she the next moment be sink softly and sadly upon the floor there be a heighten color however in she cheek and a quicker heaving of she bosom which indicate the excitement of a anticipated and painful disclosure the outward contrast of the two woman whose hand be so lovingly lock together be almost as striking as the moral contrast of they heart the one so chastened sad and gentle the other so capable of pride and passion so darkly excitable and yet so mysteriously beautiful the one like a niobe see in the softest moonshine the other a venus light in the glare of distant conflagration mademoiselle dear mademoiselle i be so much grieve at what i have to say that i hardly know how to speak to you say poor mr

occasional fall of the ember upon the hearth there be a knock at the chamber door he back be towards it and without turn or move he call to the applicant to enter the door open -- close again : a light tread be audible -- a tall shadow darken the wall : marston look round and mademoiselle de barras be stand before he without know how or why he rise and stand gaze upon she in silence mademoiselle de barras he say at last in a tone of cold surprise yes poor mademoiselle de barras reply the sweet voice of the young frenchwoman while she lip hardly move as the melancholy tone pass

not and i will not -lrb- as you say -rrb- believe one word of it so pray spare yourself further trouble about the matter she raise she head and dart after he a glance that seem absolutely to blaze and at the same time smite she little hand fast clench upon she breast the word however that tremble on she pale lip be not utter she eye be again cast down and she finger play with the little locket that hang round she neck i must make before i go she say with a deep sigh and a melancholy voice one confidence -- one last confidence : judge I by it you can not choose but believe I now : it be a secret and it must even here be whisper whisper whisper as she speak the color flee from she face and she tone become so strange and resolute that marston turn short upon he heel and stop before she she look in he face he frown but lower he eye she draw nearer lay she hand upon he shoulder and whisper for a few moment in he ear he raise he face suddenly : its feature be sharp and fix its hue be change it be livid and moveless like a face cut in gray stone he stagger back a little and a little more and then a little more and fall backward fortunately the chair in which he have be sit receive he and he lay there insensible as a corpse when at last he eye open there be no gleam of triumph no shade of anger nothing perceptible of guilt or menace in the young woman 's countenance the flush have return to she cheek she dimpled chin have sink upon she full white throat sorrow shame and pride seem struggle in she handsome face and she stand before he like a beautiful penitent who have just make a strange and humbling shrift to she father confessor next day marston be mount he horse for a solitary ride through he park when doctor danver ride abruptly into the courtyard from the back entrance marston touch he hat and say -- i do not stand on form with you doctor and you i know will waive ceremony with I you will find mr marston at home nay my dear sir interrupt the clergyman sit firm in he saddle my business lie with you today the devil it do say marston with discontented surprise truly it do sir repeat he with a look of gentle reproof for the profanity of marston 's ejaculation far more than the rudeness of he manner offend he and i grieve that you surprise should have somewhat carry you away -- well then doctor danver interrupted marston drily and without heed he conclude remark if you really have business with I it be at all event of no very press kind and may be as well tell after supper as now so pray go into the house and rest yourself : we can talk together in the evening my horse be not tire say the clergyman pat he steed 's neck and if you do not object i will ride by you side for a short time and as we go i can say out what i have to tell well well be it so say marston with suppress impatience and without more ceremony he ride slowly along the avenue and turn off upon the soft sward in the direction of the wildest portion of he wooded demesne the clergyman keep close beside he they proceed some little way at a walk before doctor danver speak i have be twice or thrice with that unhappy man at length he say what unhappy man unhappiness be no distinguishing singularity be it say marston sharply no truly you have well say reply doctor danvers true it be that man be bear unto trouble as the spark fly upward i speak however of you servant merton -- a most unhappy wretch ha you have be with he you say reply marston with evident interest and anxiety yes several time and converse with he long and gravely continue the clergyman humph i think that have be the chaplain 's business not yours my good friend observe marston he have be unwell reply dr danver and thus for a day or two i take he duty and this poor man merton have know something of I prefer see I rather than a stranger and so at the chaplain 's desire and he i continue my visit well and you have teach he to pray and sing psalm i suppose and what have come of it all demand marston testily he do pray indeed poor man and i trust he prayer be hear with mercy at the throne of grace say he companion in he earnestness disregard the sneering tone of he companion he be full of compunction and admit he guilt ho that be well -- well for himself -- well for he soul at least you be sure of it he confess confess he guilt marston put he question so rapidly and excitedly that the clergyman look with a slight expression of surprise and recover himself he add in a unconcerned tone -- well well -- it be just as well he do so the evidence be too clear for doubt or mystification he know he have no chance and have take the seemliest course and doubtless the best for he hope hereafter i do not question he upon the subject say doctor danver i even decline to hear he speak upon it at first but he tell I he be resolve to offer no defense and that he see the finger of god in the fate which have overtake he he will plead guilty then i suppose suggest marston watch the countenance of he companion with a anxious and somewhat sinister eye he word seem to imply so much answer he and have thus frankly own he guilt and avow he resolution to let the law take its due course in he case without obstruction or evasion i urge he to complete the grand work he have begin and to confess to you or to some other magistrate fully and in detail every circumstance connect with the perpetration of the dreadful deed marston knit he brow and ride on for some minute in silence at length he say abruptly -- in this it seem to I sir you a little exceed you commission how so my dear sir ask the clergyman why sir answer marston the man may possibly change he mind before the day of trial and it be the hangman 's office not yours my good sir to fasten the halter about he neck you will pardon my freedom but be this deposition make as you suggest it would undoubtedly hang he god forbid mr marston rejoin danver that i should induce the unhappy man to forfeit he last chance of escape and to shut the door of human mercy against himself but on this he seem already resolve he say so he have solemnly declare he resolution to I and even against my warning again and again reiterate the same declaration that i should have think quite enough be i in you place without invite a detailed description of the whole process by which this detestable butchery be consummate what more than the simple knowledge of the man 's guilt do any mortal desire guilty or not guilty be the plain question which the law ask and no more take my advice sir as a poor protestant layman and leave the act of the confessional and inquisition to popish priest nay mr marston you greatly misconceive I as matter stand there exist among the coroner 's jury and thus among the public some faint and unfounded suspicion of the possibility of merton 's have have a accessory or accomplice in the perpetration of this foul murder it be a lie sir -- a malignant d -- d lie -- the jury believe no such thing nor the public neither say marston start in he saddle and speaking in a voice of thunder you have be cram with lie sir malicious unmeaning vindictive lie lie invent to asperse my family and torture my feeling suggest in my presence by that scoundrel mervyn and scout by the common sense of the jury i do assure you reply doctor danver in a voice which seem scarcely audible after the stunning and passionate explosion of marston 's wrath i do not imagine that you could feel thus sorely upon the point nay i think that you yourself be not without such painful doubt again i tell you sir say marston in a tone somewhat calmer but no less stern such doubt as you describe have no existence you unsuspecting ear have be alarm by a vindictive wretch a old scoundrel who have scarce a passion leave but spite towards I few such there be thank god few such villain as would from a man 's very calamity distil poison to kill the peace and character of he family i be sorry mr marston say the clergyman you have form so ill a opinion of a neighbor and i be very sure that mr mervyn mean you no ill in frankly express whatever doubt still rest on he mind after the evidence be take he do -- the scoundrel say marston furiously striking he hand in which he whip be clutch upon he thigh he do mean to wind and torture I and with the same object he persist in circulate what he call he doubt mean I no ill forsooth why my great god sir could any man be so stupid as not to perceive that the suggestion of such suspicion -- absurd contradictory incredible as they be -- be precisely the thing to exasperate feeling sufficiently trouble already and not content with raise the question where it be scout as i say as soon as name the vindictive slanderer proceed to propagate and publish he pretended surmise -- d -- n he mr marston you will pardon I when i say that as a christian minister i can not suffer a spirit so ill as that you manifest and language so unseemly as that you have just utter to pass unreproved say danver solemnly if you will cherish those bitter and unchristian feeling at least for the brief space that i be with you command you fierce unbecoming word marston be about to make a sneering retort but restrain himself and turn he head away the wretched man himself appear now very anxious to make some further disclosure resume doctor danver after a pause and i recommend he to make they to you mr marston as the most natural depository of such a statement well mr danver to cut the matter short as it appear that a confession of some sort be to be make be it so i will attend and receive it the judge will not be here for eight or ten week to come so there be no great hurry about it i shall ride down to the town and see he in the jail some time in the next week with this assurance marston part from the old clergyman and ride on alone through the furze and fern of he wild and somber park after supper that evening marston find himself alone in the parlor with he wife mr marston avail herself of the opportunity to redeem she pledge to mademoiselle de barras she be not aware of the strange interview which have take place between he and the lady for whom she plead the result of she renew entreaty perhaps the reader have anticipate marston listen doubt listen hesitate again put question ponder the answer debate the matter inwardly and at last gruffly consent to give the young lady another trial and permit she to remain some time longer poor mr marston little suspect the dreadful future overwhelm she husband with gratitude for grant to she entreaty -lrb- as he have predetermine to do -rrb- this fatal boon not care to protract this scene -- either from a disinclination to listen to expression of affection which have long lose they charm for he and have become even positively distasteful or perhaps from some instinctive recoil from the warm expression of gratitude from lip which be the truth reveal might justly have tremble with execration and reproach -- he abruptly leave the room and mr marston full of she good news hasten in the kindness of she heart to communicate the fancied result of she advocacy to mademoiselle de barras it be about a week after this that marston be one evening surprise in he study by the receipt of the follow letter from dr danver : -- my dear sir you will be shock to hear that merton be most dangerously ill and at this moment in imminent peril he be thoroughly conscious of he situation and himself regard it as a merciful interposition of providence to spare he the disgrace and terror of the dreadful fate which he anticipate the unhappy man have twice repeat he anxious desire this day to state some fact connect with the murder of the late sir wynston berkley which he say it be of the utmost moment that you should hear he say that he could not leave the world in peace without have make this disclosure which he especially desire to make to yourself and entreat that you will come to receive he communication as early as you can in the morning this be indeed needful as the physician say that he be fast sinking i offer no apology for add my earnest solicitation to those or the die man and be dear sir you very obedient servant j danver he regard it as a merciful interposition of providence mutter marston as he close the letter with a sneer well some man have odd notion of mercy and providence to be sure but if it please he certainly i shall not complain for one marston be all this evening in better spirit than he have enjoy for month or even year a mountain seem to have be lift from he heart he join in the conversation during and after supper listen with apparent interest talk with animation and even laugh and jest it be needless to say all this flow not from the healthy cheer of a heart at ease but from the excited and almost feverish sense of sudden relief next morning marston ride into the old-fashioned town at the further end of which the dingy and grate front of the jail look warningly out upon the rustic passenger he pass the sentry and make he inquiry of the official at the hatch he be relieve from the necessity of push these into detail however by the appearance of the physician who at that moment pass from the interior of the prison dr danver tell I he expect to see you here this morning say the medical man after the customary salutation have be interchange you call i believe be connect with the prisoner john merton yes sir so it be say marston be he in a condition pray to make a statement of considerable length far from it mr marston he have but a few hour to live answer the physician and be now insensible but i believe he last night see dr danver and tell he whatever be weigh upon he mind ha -- and can you say where dr danver now be inquire marston anxiously and hurriedly not here be he no but i see he as i come here not ten minute since ride into the town it be market-day and you will probably find he somewhere in the high street for a hour or two to come answer he marston thank he and lose in abstraction ride down to the little inn enter a sit room and write a hurry line to dr danver entreat he attendance there as a place where they might converse less interruptedly than in the street and commit this note to the waiter with the injunction to deliver it at once and a intimation of where dr danver be probably to be find he await with intense and agitating anxiety the arrival of the clergyman it be not for nearly ten minute however which he impatience magnify into a eternity that the well-known voice of dr danver reach he from the little hall it be in vain that marston strove to curb he violent agitation : he heart swell as if it would smother he he feel as it be the chill of death pervade he frame and he could scarcely see the door through which he momentarily expect the entrance of the clergyman a few minute more and dr danver enter the little apartment my dear sir say he gravely and earnestly as he grasp the cold hand of marston i be rejoice to see you i have matter of great moment and the strangest mystery to lay before you i dare say -- i be sure -- that be i suspect so much answer marston breathing fast and look very pale i hear at the prison that the murderer merton be fast die and now be in a unconscious state and from the physician that you have see he at he urgent entreaty last night my mind misgive I sir i fear i know not what i long yet dread to hear the wretched man 's confession for god 's sake tell I do it implicate anybody else in the guilt no no one specifically but it have throw a hideous additional mystery over the occurrence listen to I my dear sir and the whole narrative as he state it to I shall be relate now to you say dr danver marston have close the door carefully and they sate down together at the further end of the apartment marston breathless and ghastly pale he lip compress -- he brow knit -- and he dark dilated gaze fix immovably upon the speaker dr danver on the other hand tranquil and solemn and with perhaps some shade of awe overcast the habitual sweetness of he countenance he confession be a strange one renew dr danver shake he head gravely he say that the first idea of the crime be suggest by sir wynston 's man accidentally mention a few day after they arrival that he master sleep with he bank-note to the amount of some hundred of pound in a pocketbook under he pillow he declare that as the man mention this circumstance something mutter the infernal suggestion in he ear and from that moment he be the slave of that one idea it be ever present with he he contend against it in vain he dread and abhor it but still it possess he he feel he power of resistance yield this horrible stranger which have steal into he heart wax in power and importunity and torment he day and night he resolve to fly from the house he give notice to you and mr marston of he intended departure but accident protracted he stay until that fatal night which seal he doom the influence which have master he force he to rise from he bed and take the knife -- the discovery of which afterwards help to convict he -- and lead he to sir wynston 's chamber he enter it be a moonlight night here the clergyman glance round the room lower he voice and advance he lip so near to marston that they head nearly touch in this tone and attitude he continue he narrative for a few minute at the end of this brief space marston rise up slowly and with a movement backward every feature string with horror and say in a long whisper the one word yes which seem like the hiss of a snake before he make he last deadly spring both be silent for a time at last marston break out with hoarse vehemence dreadful -- horrible -- oh god god -- my god how frightful and throw himself into a chair he clasp he hand across he eye and forehead while the sweat of agony literally pour down he pale face truly it be so say the clergyman scarcely above he breath and after a long interval -- horrible indeed well say marston rise suddenly to he foot wipe the dew of horror from he face and look wildly round like one newly awake from a nightmare i must make the most of this momentous and startling disclosure i shall spare no pain to come at the truth say he energetically meanwhile my dear sir for the sake of justice and of mercy observe secrecy leave I to sift this matter give no note anywhere that we suspect observe this reserve and security and with it detection will follow breathe but one word and you arm the guilty with double caution and turn licentious gossip loose upon the fame of a innocent and troubled family once more i entreat -- i expect -- i implore silence -- silence at least for the present -- silence i quite agree with you my dear mr marston answer dr danver i have not divulge one syllable of that poor wretch 's confession save to yourself alone you as a magistrate a relative of the murder gentleman and the head of that establishment among whom the guilt rest be invest with a interest in detect and power of sift the truth in this matter such as none other possess i clearly see with you too the inexpediency and folly of talk for talk 's sake of this affair i mean to keep my counsel and shall most assuredly irrespectively even of you request -- which should however of course have weight with I -- maintain a strict and cautious silence upon this subject some little time longer they remain together and marston bury in strange thought take he leave and ride slowly back to gray forest month pass away -- a year and more -- and though no new character appear upon the stage the relation which have subsist among the old one become in some respects very materially alter a gradual and disagreeable change come over mademoiselle de barras 's manner she affectionate attention to mr marston become less and less frequent nor be the change merely confine to this grow coldness there be something of a positive and still more unpleasant kind in the alteration we have note there be a certain independence and carelessness convey in a hundred intangible but significant little incident and look -- a something which without be open to formal rebuke or remonstrance yet border in effect upon impertinence and even insolence this indescribable and provoke self-assertion imply in glance tone emphasis and general bearing surprised mr marston far more than it irritated she as often as she experience one of these study slight or insinuate impertinence she revolve in she own mind all the incident of they past intercourse in the vain endeavor to recollect some one among they which could possibly account for the offensive change so manifest in the conduct of the young frenchwoman mr marston although she sometimes rebuke these artful affront by a grave look a cold tone or a distant manner yet have too much dignity to engage in a petty warfare of annoyance and have in reality no substantial and well-defined ground of complaint against she such as would have warrant she either in take the young lady herself to task or in bring she conduct under the censure of marston one evening it happen that mr marston and mademoiselle de barras have be leave alone together after the supper-party have disperse they have be for a long time silent mr marston resolve to improve the tate-à-tate for the purpose of elicit from mademoiselle a explanation of she strange behavior mademoiselle say she i have lately observe a very marked change in you conduct to I indeed say the frenchwoman yes mademoiselle you must be yourself perfectly aware of that change it be a study and intentional one continue mr marston in a gentle but dignified tone although i have feel some doubt as to whether it be advisable so long as you observe toward I the form of external respect and punctually discharge the duty you have undertake to open any discussion whatever upon the subject yet i have think it better to give you a fair opportunity of explain frankly should you desire to do so the feeling and impression under which you be act ah you be very oblige madame say she coolly it be quite clear mademoiselle that you have either misunderstand I or that you be dissatisfy with you situation among we : you conduct can not otherwise be account for say mr marston gravely my conduct -- _ ma fous _ what conduct retort the handsome frenchwoman confidently and with a disdainful glance if you question the fact mademoiselle say the elder lady it be enough you ungracious manner and ungentle look i presume arise from what appear to you a sufficient and well-defined cause of which however i know nothing i really be not aware say mademoiselle de barras with a supercilious smile that my look and my manner be subject to so strict a criticism or that it be my duty to regulate both accord to so nice and difficult a standard well mademoiselle continue mr marston it be plain that whatever may be the cause of you dissatisfaction you be resolve against confide it to I i only wish to know frankly from you own lip whether you have form a wish to leave this situation if so i entreat you to declare it freely you be very oblige indeed madame say the pretty foreigner drily but i have no such wish at least at present very well mademoiselle reply mr marston with gentle dignity i regret you want of candor on you own account you would i be sure be much happier be you to deal frankly with I may i now have you permission madame to retire to my room ask the french girl rise and make a low courtesy -- that be if madame have nothing further to censure certainly mademoiselle i have nothing further to say reply the elder lady the frenchwoman make another and a deeper courtesy and withdraw mr marston however hear as she be design to do the young lady titter and whisper to herself as she light she candle in the hall this scene mortified and grieve poor mr marston inexpressibly she be little if at all accessible to emotion of anger and certainly none such mingled in the feeling with which she regard mademoiselle de barras but she have find in this girl a companion and even a confidante in she melancholy solitude she have believe she affectionate sympathetic tender and the disappointment be as bitter as unimagined the annoyance which she be fate to receive from mademoiselle de barras be destine however to grow in number and in magnitude the frenchwoman sometimes take a fancy for some unrevealed purpose to talk a good deal to mr marston and on such occasion would persist notwithstanding that lady 's marked reserve and discouragement in chat away as if she be conscious that she conversation be the most welcome entertainment possible to she really unwilling auditor no one of they interview do she ever suffer to close without in some way or other suggest or insinuate something mysterious and untold to the prejudice of mr marston those vague and intangible hint the meaning of which for a instant legible and terrific seem in another moment to dissolve and disappear tortured mr marston like the intrusion of a specter and this along with the portentous change rather feel than visible in mademoiselle 's conduct toward she invest the beautiful frenchwoman in the eye of she former friend and patroness with a indefinable character that be not only repulsive but formidable mr marston 's feeling with respect to this person be still further disturb by the half-conveyed hint and innuendo of she own maid who never lose a opportunity of insinuate she intense dislike of the frenchwoman and appear perpetually to be upon the very verge of make some explicit charge or some shocking revelation respect she which however she as invariably evade and even when mr marston once or twice insist upon she explain she meaning distinctly she elude she mistress 's desire and leave she still in the same uneasy uncertainty marston on he part however much he conduct might tend to confirm suspicion certainly do nothing to dissipate the painful and undefined apprehension respect himself which mademoiselle de barras with such malign and mysterious industry labor to raise he spirit and temper be liable to strange fluctuation in the midst of that excited gaiety to which until lately he have be so long a stranger would sometimes intervene paroxysm of the blackest despair all the ghastlier for the contrast and with a suddenness so abrupt and overwhelming that one might have fancy he cross by the shadow of some terrific apparition sometimes for a whole day or even more he would withdraw himself from the society of he family and in morose and moody solitude take he meal alone in he library and steal out unattended to wander among the thicket and glade of he park sometimes again he would sit for hour in the room which have be sir wynston 's and with a kind of horrible resolution often loiter there till after nightfall in such hour the servant would listen with curious awe as they hear he step pacing to and fro in that desert and inauspicious chamber while he voice in broken sentence be also imperfectly audible as if maintain a muttered dialogue these eccentric practice gradually invest he in the eye of he domestic with a certain preternatural mystery which enhance the fear with which they habitually regard he and be subsequently confirm by he give order to have the furniture take out of the ominous suite of room and the door nail up and secure he give no reason for this odd and abrupt measure and gossip of course report that the direction have originate in he have encounter the specter of the murder baronet in one of these strange and unseasonable visit to the scene of the fearful catastrophe in addition to all this marston 's conduct towards he wife become strangely capricious he avoid she society more than ever and when he do happen to exchange a few word with she they be sometimes harsh and violent and at other remorsefully gentle and sad and this without any change of conduct upon she part to warrant the wayward uncertainty of he treatment under all these circumstance mr marston 's unhappiness and uneasiness greatly

of the whole household and the spectacle of she mother 's agony have fill she with fear perplexity and anguish scared and stunned with a vague sense of danger like a young bird that for the first time cower under a thunderstorm she nestle in she mother 's bosom there with a sense of protection and of boundless love and tenderness she lay frightened wonder and weep two or three day pass and dr danver come and sate for several hour with poor mr marston to comfort and console be of course out of he power the nature of the bereavement far more terrible than death -- its recent occurrence --

and the think what will become of my darling when i be go who will guard and love my child when i be in my grave to whom be she to look for tenderness and protection then perpetually haunt she and superad the pang of a still wilder despair to the desolation of a broken heart it be not for more than a week after this event that one day willett with a certain air of anxious mystery enter the silent and darkened chamber where mr marston lay she have a letter in she hand the seal and handwriting be mr marston 's it be long before the injured wife be able to open it when she do so the follow sentence meet she eye : -- gertrude you can be ignorant neither of the nature nor of the consequence of the decisive step i have take : i do not seek to excuse it for the censure of the world its meddling and mouthing hypocrisy i care absolutely nothing i have long set it at defiance and you yourself gertrude when you deliberately reconsider the circumstance of estrangement and coldness under which though beneath the same roof we have live for year without either sympathy or confidence can scarcely if at all regret the rupture of a tie which have long cease to be anything better than a irksome and galling formality i do not desire to attribute to you the smallest blame there be a incompatibility not of temper but of feeling which make we stranger though call one another man and wife upon this fact i rest my own justification we living together under these circumstance be i dare say equally undesired by we both it be in fact but a deference to the formal hypocrisy of the world at all event the irrevocable act which separate we forever be do and i have now merely to state so much of my intention as may relate in anywise to you future arrangement i have write to you cousin and former guardian mr latimer tell he how matter stand between we you i tell he shall have without opposition from I the whole of you own fortune to you own separate use together with whatever shall be mutually agree upon as reasonable from my income for you support and that of my daughter it will be necessary to complete you arrangement with expedition as i purpose return to gray forest in about three week and as of course a meeting between you and those by whom i shall be accompany be wholly out of the question you will see the expediency of lose no time in adjust everything for yours and my daughter 's departure in the detail of course i shall not interfere i think i have make myself clearly intelligible and would recommend you communicate at once with mr latimer with a view to complete temporary arrangement until you final plan shall have be decide upon richard marston the reader can easily conceive the feeling with which this letter be peruse we shall not attempt to describe they nor shall we weary he patience by a detail of all the circumstance attend mr marston 's departure suffice it to mention that in less than a fortnight after the receipt of the letter which we have just copy she have forever left the mansion of gray forest in a small house in a sequestered part of the rich county of warwick the residence of mr marston and she daughter be for the present fixed and there for a time the heart-broken and desolate lady enjoy at least the privilege of a immunity from the intrusion of all external trouble but the blow under which the feeble remains of she health and strength be gradually to sink have strike too surely home and from month to month -- almost from week to week -- the progress of decay be perceptible meanwhile though grieve and humble and longing to comfort he unhappy mother charle marston for the present absolutely dependant upon he father have no choice but to remain at cambridge and to pursue he study there at gray forest marston and the partner of he guilt continue to live the old servant be all gradually dismiss and new one hire by mademoiselle de barras there they dwell shun by everybody in a stricter and more desolate seclusion than ever the novelty of the unrestraint and licence of they new mode of life speedily pass away and with it the excited and guilty sense of relief which have for a time produce a false and hollow gaiety the sense of security prompt in mademoiselle a hundred indulgence which in she former precarious position she would not have dream of outbreak of temper sharp and sometimes violent begin to manifest themselves on she part and renew disappointment and blacker remorse to darken the soul of marston himself often in the dead of the night the servant would overhear they bitter and fierce altercation ring through the melancholy mansion and often the reckless use of terrible and mysterious epithet of crime they quarrel increase in violence and in frequency and before two year have pass feeling of bitterness hatred and dread alone seem to subsist between they yet upon marston she continue to exercise a powerful and mysterious influence there be a dogged apathetic submission on he part and a grow insolence on hers constantly more and more strikingly visible neglect disorder and decay too be more than ever apparent in the dreary air of the place doctor danver save by rumor and conjecture know nothing of marston and he abandon companion he have more than once feel a strong disposition to visit gray forest and expostulate face to face with its guilty proprietor this idea however he have upon consideration dismiss not on account of any shrink from the possible repuls and affront to which the attempt might subject he but from a thorough conviction that the endeavor would be utterly fruitless for good while it might very obviously expose he to painful misinterpretation and suspicion and leave it to be imagine that he have be influence if by no meaner motive at least by the prompting of a coarse curiosity meanwhile he maintain a correspondence with mr marston and have even once or twice since she departure visit she latterly however this correspondence have be a good deal interrupted and its interval have be supply occasionally by rhoda whose letter although she herself appear unconscious of the mournful event the approach of which they too plainly indicate be painful record of the rapid progress of mortal decay he have just receive one of those ominous letter at the little post office in the town we have already mention and full of the melancholy news it contain dr danver be return slowly towards he home as he ride into a lonely road traverse a undulating tract of some three mile in length the singularity it may be of he costume attract the eye of another passenger who be as it turn out no other than marston himself for two or three mile of this desolate road they way happen to lie together marston 's first impulse be to avoid the clergyman he second which he obey be to join company and ride along with he at all event for so long as would show that he shrink from no encounter which fortune or accident present there be a spirit of bitter defiance in this which cost he a painful effort how do you do parson danver say marston touch he hat with the handle of he whip danver think he have seldom see a man so change in so short a time he face have grow sallow and waste and he figure slightly stoop with a appearance almost of feebleness mr marston say the clergyman gravely and almost sternly though with some embarrassment it be a long time since you and i have see one another and many and painful event have pass in the interval i scarce know upon what term we meet i be prompt to speak to you and in a tone perhaps which you will hardly brook and yet if we keep company as it seem likely we may i can not and i ought not to be silent well mr danver i accept the condition -- speak what you will say marston with a gloomy promptitude if you exceed you privilege and grow uncivil i need but use my spur and leave you behind I preach to the wind ah mr marston say dr danver almost sadly after a considerable pause when i saw you close beside I my heart be trouble within I you look on I as something from the nether world and expect to see the cloven hoof say marston bitterly and raise he boot foot a little as he speak but after all i be but a vulgar sinner of flesh and blood without enough of the preternatural about I to frighten a old nurse much less to agitate a pillar of the church mr marston you talk sarcastically but you feel that recent circumstance as well as old recollection might well disturb and trouble I at sight of you answer dr danver well -- yes -- perhaps it be so say marston hastily and sullenly and become silent for a while my heart be full mr marston charge with grief when i think of the sad history of those with whom in my mind you must ever be associate say doctor danver aye to be sure say marston with stern impatience but then you have much to console you you have get you comfort and you respectability all the dearer too from the contrast of other people 's misfortune and degradation then you have you religion moreover -- yes interrupted danver earnestly and hasten to avoid a sneer upon this subject god be bless i be a humble follower of he gracious son we redeemer and though i trust i should bear with patient submission whatever chastisement in he wisdom and goodness he might see fit to inflict upon I yet i do praise and bless he for the mercy which have hitherto spare I and i do feel that mercy all the more profoundly from the affliction and trouble with which i daily see other overtaken and in the matter of piety and decorum doubtless you bless god also say marston sarcastically that you be not as other man be nor even as this publican nay mr marston god forbid i should harden my sinful heart with the wicked pride of the pharisee evil and corrupt be i already over much too well i know the vileness of my heart to make myself righteous in my own eye reply dr danver humbly but sinner as i be i be yet a messenger of god whose mission be one of authority to he fellow-sinner and woe be I if i speak not the truth at all season and in all place where my word may be profitably hear well doctor danver it seem you think it you duty to speak to I of course respect my conduct and my spiritual state i shall save you the pain and trouble of open the subject i shall state the case for you in two word say marston almost fiercely i have put away my wife without just cause and be live in sin with another woman come what have you to say on this theme speak out deal with I as roughly as you will i will hear it and answer you again alas mr marston and do not these thing trouble you exclaim dr danver earnestly do they not weigh heavy upon you conscience ah sir do you not remember that slowly and surely you be draw towards the hour of death and the day of judgment the hour or death yes i know it be come and i await it with indifference but for the day of judgment with its book and trumpet my dear doctor pray do not expect to frighten I with that marston speak with a angry scorn which have the effect of interrupt the conversation for some moment they ride on side by side for a long time without speak at length however marston unexpectedly break the silence -- doctor danver say he you ask I some time ago if i fear the hour of death and the day of judgment i answer you truly i do not fear they nay death i think i could meet with a happier and a quieter heart than any other chance that can befall I but there be other fear fear that do trouble I much doctor danver look inquiringly at he but neither speak for a time you have not see the catastrophe of the tragedy yet say marston with a stern stony look make more horrible by a forced smile and something like a shudder i wish i could tell you -- you doctor danver -- for you be honorable and gentle-hearted i wish i durst tell you what i fear the only only thing i really do fear no mortal know it but myself and i see it come upon I with slow but unconquerable power oh god -- dreadful spirit -- spare I again they be silent and again marston resume -- doctor danver do not mistake I he say turn sharply and fix he eye with a strange expression upon he companion i dread nothing human i fear neither death nor disgrace nor eternity i have no secret to keep -- no exposure to apprehend but i dread -- i dread -- he pause scowl darkly as if sting with pain turn away mutter to himself and gradually become much excited i can not tell you now sir and i will not he say abruptly and fiercely and with a countenance darken with a wild and appalling rage that be wholly unaccountable i see you search I with you eye suspect what you will sir you sha not inveigle I into admission aye pry -- whisper -- stare -- question conjecture sir -- i suppose i must endure the world 's impertinence but d -- n I if i gratify it it would not be easy to describe dr danver ' astonishment at this unaccountable explosion of fury he be resolve however to bear he companion 's violence with temper they ride on slowly for fully ten minute in utter silence except that marston occasionally mutter to himself as it seem in excited abstraction danver have at first feel naturally offend at the violent and insulting tone in which he have be so unexpectedly and unprovokedly address but this feeling of irritation be but transient and some fearful suspicion as to marston 's sanity flit through he mind in a calmer and more dogged tone he companion now address he : -- there be little profit you see doctor in worry I about you religion say marston it be but sowing the wind and reap the whirlwind and to say the truth the longer you pursue it the less i be in the mood to listen if ever you be curse and persecute as i have be you will understand how little tolerant of gratuitous vexation and contradiction a man may become we have squabble over religion long enough and each hold he own faith still continue to sun yourself in you happy delusion and leave I untroubled to tread the way of my own dark and cheerless destiny thus say he make a sullen gesture of farewell and spur he horse cross the broken fence at the roadside and so at a listless pace through gap and by farm-road penetrate towards he melancholy and guilty home two year have now pass since the decisive event which have forever separated marston from she who have love he so devotedly and so fatally two year to he of disappointment abasement and secret rage two year to she of gentle and heart-broken submission to the chastening hand of heaven at the end of this time she die marston read the letter that announce the event with a stern look and silently but the shock he feel be terrific no man be so self-abandoned to despair and degradation that at some casual moment thought of amendment -- some gleam of hope however faint and transient from the distant future -- will not visit he with marston those thought have somehow ever be associate with vague idea of a reconciliation with the be whom he have forsake -- good and pure and look at she from the darkness and distance of he own fallen state almost angelic as she seem but she be now dead he could make she no atonement she could never smile forgiveness upon he this long-familiar image -- the last that have reflect for he one ray of the lose peace and love of happier time -- have vanish and henceforward there be before he nothing but storm and fear marston 's embarrassed fortune make it to he a object to resume the portion of he income heretofore devote to the separate maintenance of he wife and daughter in order to effect this it become of course necessary to recall he daughter rhoda and fix she residence once more at gray forest no more dreadful penalty could have be inflict upon the poor girl -- no more agonizing ordeal than that she be thus doom to undergo she have idolize she mother and now adore she memory she know that mademoiselle de barras have betray and indirectly murder the parent she have so devotedly love she know that that woman have be the curse the fate of she family and she regard she naturally with feeling of mingled terror and abhorrence the intensity of which be indescribable the few scattered friend and relative whose sympathy have be move by the melancholy fate of poor mr marston be unanimously agree that the intended removal of the young and innocent daughter to the polluted mansion of sin and shame be too intolerably revolting to be permit but each of these virtuous individual unhappily think it the duty of the other to interpose and with a run commentary of wonder and reprobation and much virtuous criticism event be suffer uninterruptedly to take they sinister and melancholy course it be about two month after the death of mr marston and on a bleak and ominous night at the wintry end of autumn that poor rhoda in deep mourning and pale with grief and agitation descend from a chaise at the well-known door of the mansion of gray forest whether from consideration for she feeling or as be more probable from pure indifference rhoda be conduct on she arrival direct to she own chamber and it be not until the next morning that she see she father he enter she room unexpectedly he be very pale and as she think greatly altered but he seem perfectly collect and free from agitation the marked and even shocking change in he appearance and perhaps even the trifling though painful circumstance that he wear no mourning for the beloved be who be go cause she after a moment 's mute gaze in he face to burst into a irrepressible flood of tear marston wait stoically until the paroxysm have subside and then take she hand with a look in which a dogged sternness be contend with something like shame he say : -- there there you can weep when i be go i sha not say very much to you at present rhoda and only wish you to attend to I for one minute listen rhoda the lady whom you have be in the habit -lrb- here he slightly avert he eye -rrb- of call mademoiselle de barras be no longer so she be marry she be my wife and consequently you will treat she with the respect due to -- he would have say a mother but could not and supply the phrase by add to that relation rhoda be unable to speak but almost unconsciously bow she head in token of attention and submission and she father press she hand more kindly as he continue : -- i have always find you a dutiful and obedient child rhoda and expect no other conduct from you mr marston will treat you with proper kindness and consideration and desire I to say that you can whenever you please keep strictly to yourself and need not unless you feel so disposed attend the regular meal of the family this privilege may suit you present depressed spirit and you must not scruple to use it after a few word more marston withdraw leave he daughter to she reflection and bleak and bitter enough they be some week pass away and perhaps we shall best consult we reader ' ease by substitute for the formal precision of narrative a few extract from the letter which rhoda write to she brother still at cambridge these will convey she own impression respect the scene and personage among whom she be now to move the house and place be much neglect and the former in some part suffer almost to go to decay the window break in the last storm nearly eight month ago they tell I be still unmended and the roof too unrepaired the pretty garden near the well among the lime tree that we darling mother be so fond of be all but obliterate with weed and grass and since my first visit i have not have heart to

be alter a good deal -- more however in the character than in the contour of she face and figure certainly however she have grow a good deal fuller and she color be higher and whether it be fancy or not i can not say but certainly to I it seem that the expression of she face have acquire something habitually lower and malicious and which i know not how inspire I with a undefinable dread she have however be tolerably civil to I but seem contemptuous and rude to my father and i be afraid he be very wretched i have see they exchange such look and overheard such intemperate and even appalling altercation between they as indicate something worse and deeper than ordinary ill-will this make I additionally wretched especially as i can not help think that some mysterious cause enable she to frighten and tyrannise over my poor father i sometimes think he absolutely detest she yet though fiery altercation ensue he ultimately submit to this bad and cruel woman oh my dear charle you have no idea of the shocking or rather the terrifying reproach i have hear interchange between they as i accidently pass the room where they be sit -- such term as have send I to my room feeling as if i be in a horrid dream and make I cry and tremble for hour after i get there i see my father very seldom and when i do he take but little notice of I poor willett you know return with I she accompany I in my walk and be constantly drop hint about mademoiselle from which i know not what to gather i often fear that my father have some secret and mortal ailment he generally look ill and sometimes quite wretchedly he come twice lately to my room i think to speak to I on some matter of importance but he say only a sentence or two and even these break and incoherent he seem unable to command spirit for the interview and indeed he grow so agitate and strange that i be alarmed and feel greatly relieve when he leave I i do not you see disguise my feeling dear charle i do not conceal from you the melancholy and anguish of my present situation how intensely i long for you promise arrival i have not a creature to whom i can say one word in confidence except poor willett who though very good-natured and really dear to I be yet far from be a companion i sometimes think my intense anxiety to see you here be almost selfish for i know you will feel as acutely as i do the terrible change observable everywhere but i can not help longing for you return dear charle and count the day and the very hour till you arrive be cautious in write to I not to say anything which you would not wish mademoiselle to see for willett tell I that she know that she often examine and even intercept the letter that arrive and though willett may be mistaken and i hope she be yet it be better that you should be upon you guard ever since i hear this i have bring my letter to the post office myself instead of leave they with the rest upon the hall table and you know it be a long walk for I i go to church every Sunday and take willett along with I no one from this seem to think of do so but ourselves i see the mervyn there mr mervyn be particularly kind and i know that she wish to offer I a asylum at newton park and you can not think with how much tenderness and delicacy she convey the wish but i dare not hint the subject to my father and earnestly as i desire it i could not but feel that i should go there not to visit but to reside and so even in this in many respects delightful project be mingle the bitter apprehension of dependence -- something so humiliating that kindly and delicately as the offer be make i could not bring myself to embrace it i have a great deal to say to you and long to see you these extract will enable the reader to form a tolerably accurate idea of the general state of affair at gray forest some particulars must however be add marston continue to be the same gloomy and joyless be as heretofore sometimes moody and apathetic sometimes wayward and even savage but never for a moment at ease never social -- a isolate disdainful ruin man one day as rhoda sate and read under the shade of some closely-interwoven evergreen in a lonely and sheltered part of the neglect pleasure-grounds with she honest maid willett in attendance she be surprise by the sudden appearance of she father who stand unexpectedly before she though he attitude for some time be fix he countenance be trouble with anxiety and pain and he sunken eye rest upon she with a fiery and fret gaze he seem lose in thought for a while and then touch willett sharply on the shoulder say abruptly : go i shall call you when you be wanted walk down that alley and as he speak he indicate with he walking-cane the course he desire she to take when the maid be sufficiently distant to be quite out of hearing marston sate down beside rhoda upon the bench and take she hand in silence he grasp be cold and alternately relax and contract with a agitate uncertainty while he eye be fix upon the ground and he seem meditate how to open the conversation at last as if suddenly awake from a fearful reverie he say -- you correspond with charle yes sir she reply with the respectful formality prescribe by the usage of the time we correspond regularly aye aye and pray when do you last hear from he he continue about a month since sir she reply ha -- and -- and -- be there nothing strange -- nothing -- nothing mysterious and menacing in he letter come come you know what i speak of he stop abruptly and stare in she face with a agitate gaze no indeed sir there be not anything of the kind she reply i have be greatly shocked i may say incensed say marston excitedly by a passage in he last letter to I not that it say anything specific but -- but it amaze I -- it enrage I he again check himself and rhoda much surprised and even shock say stammeringly -- i be sure sir that dear charle would not intentionally say or do anything that could offend you ah as to that i believe so too but it be not with he i be indignant no no poor charle i believe he be as you say disposed to conduct himself as a son ought to do respectfully and obediently yes yes charle be very well but i fear he be lead a bad life notwithstanding -- a very bad life he be become subject to influence which never visit or torment the good believe I he be marston shake he head and mutter to himself with a look of almost craven anxiety and then whisper to he daughter -- just read this and then tell I be it not so read it read it and pronounce as he thus speak he place in she hand the letter of which he have speak and with the passage to which he invite she attention fold down it be to the following effect : -- i can not tell you how shocked i have be by a piece of scandal as i must believe it convey to I in a anonymous letter and which be of so very delicate a nature that without you special command i should hesitate to pain you by its recital i trust it may be utterly false indeed i assume it to be so it be enough to say that it be of a very distressing nature and affect the lady -lrb- mademoiselle de barras -rrb- whom you have recently honor with you hand now you see cry marston with a shudder fierceness as she return the letter with a blanched cheek and tremble hand -- now you see it all be you stupid -- the stamp of the cloven hoof -- eh rhoda unable to gather he meaning but at the same time with a heart full and tremble very much stammer a few frightened word and become silent it be he i tell you that do it all and if charle be not live a evil life he could not have spread he net for he say marston vehemently he can not go near anything good but like a scoundrel he know where to find a congenial nature and when he do he have skill enough to practice upon it i know he well and he art and he smile aye and he scowl and he grin too he go like he master up and down and to and fro upon the earth for ceaseless mischief there be not a friend of mine he can get hold of but he whisper in he ear some damned slander of I he be draw they all into a common understanding against I and he take a actual pleasure in tell I how the thing go on -- how one after the other he have convert my friend into conspirator and libeler to blast my character and take my life and now the monster essay to lure my child into the hellish confederation who be he father who be he falter rhoda you never see he retort marston sternly no no you can not have see he and you probably never will but if he do come here again do not listen to he he be half-fiend and half-idiot and no good come of he mouthing and mutter avoid he i warn you avoid he let I see : how shall i describe he let I see you remember -- you remember berkley -- sir wynston berkley well he greatly resemble that dead villain : he have all the same grin and shrug and monkey air and he face and figure be like but he be a grimed ragged waste piece of sin little better than a beggar -- a shrunken malignant libel on the human shape avoid he i tell you avoid he : he be steep in lie and poison like the very serpent that betray we beware of he i say for if he once gain you ear he will delude you spite of all you vigilance he will make you he accomplice and thenceforth inevitably there be nothing but mortal and implacable hatred between we frighten at this wild language rhoda do not answer but look up in he face in silence a fearful transformation be there -- a scowl so livid and maniacal that she very sens seem leave she with terror perhaps the sudden alteration observable in she countenance as this spectacle so unexpectedly encounter she recall he to himself for he add hurriedly and in a tone of gentler meaning -- rhoda rhoda watch and pray my daughter my child keep you heart pure and nothing bad can approach you for ill no no you be good and the good need not fear suddenly marston burst into tear as he end this sentence and weep long and convulsively she do not dare to speak or even to move but after a while he cease appear uneasy half ashamed and half angry and look with a horrified and bewildered glance into she face he say -- rhoda child what -- what have i say my god what have i be say do i -- do i look ill oh rhoda rhoda may you never feel this he turn away from she without await she answer and walk away with the appearance of intense agitation as if to leave she he turn again however and with a face pallid and sunken as death approach she slowly -- rhoda say he do not tell what i have say to anyone -- do not i conjure you even to charle i speak too much at random and say more than i mean -- a foolish rambling habit : so do not repeat one word of it not one word to any living mortal you and i rhoda must have we little secret he end with a attempt at a smile so obviously painful and fear-stricken that as he walk hurriedly away the astounded girl burst into a bitter flood of tear what be what could be the meaning of the shocking scene she have then be force to witness she dare not answer the question yet one ghastly doubt haunt she like she shadow -- a suspicion that the malignant and hideous light of madness be already glare upon he mind as lean upon the arm of she astonished attendant she retract she step the tree the flower the familiar hall-door the echo passage -- every object that meet she eye -- seem strange and unsubstantial and she glide on among they in a horrid dream time pass on : there be no renewal of the painful scene which dwell so sensibly in the affrighted imagination of rhoda marston 's manner be change towards she he seem shy cow and uneasy in she presence and thenceforth she see less than ever of he meanwhile the time approach which be to witness the long expect and by rhoda the intensely pray for arrival of she brother some four or five day before this event mr marston have as he say some business in chester and further design to meet he son there take he departure from gray forest leave poor rhoda to the guardianship of she guilty stepmother and although she have see so little of she father yet the very consciousness of he presence have give she a certain confidence and sense of security which vanish at the moment of he departure fear-stricken and wretched as he have be he removal nevertheless seem to she to render the lonely and inauspicious mansion still more desolate and ominous than before she have with a vague and instinctive antipathy avoid all contact and intercourse with mr marston or as for distinctness sake we shall continue to call she mademoiselle since she return and she on she part have appear to acquiesce with a sort of scornful nonchalance in the tacit understanding that she and she former pupil should see and hear as little as might be of one another meanwhile poor willett with she good-natured honesty and she inexhaustible gossip endeavor to amuse and reassure she young mistress and sometimes even with some partial success we must now follow mr marston in he solitary expedition to chester when he take he place in the stagecoach he have the whole interior of the vehicle to himself and thus continue to be its solitary occupant for several mile the coach however be eventually hail bring to and the door be open dr danver get in and take he place opposite to the passenger already establish there the worthy man be so busy in direct the disposition of he luggage from the window and in arrange the sundry small parcel with which he be charge that he do not recognize he companion until they be in motion when he do so it be with no very pleasurable feeling and it be probable that marston too would have gladly escape the coincidence which thus reduce they once more to the temporary necessity of a tate-à-tate embarrassing as each feel the situation to be there be however no avoid it and after a recognition and a few forced attempt at conversation they become by mutual consent silent and uncommunicative the journey though in point of space a mere trifle be in those slowcoach day a matter of fully five hour ' duration and before it be complete the sun have set and darkness begin to close whether it be that the descend twilight dispel the painful constraint under which marston have seem to labor or that some more purely spiritual and genial influence have gradually dissipate the repulsion and distrust with which at first he have shrink from a renewal of intercourse with dr danver he suddenly accost he thus dr danver i have be fifty time on the point of speak to you -- confidentially of course -- while sit here opposite to you what i believe i could scarcely bring myself to hint to any other man living yet i must tell it and soon too or i fear it will have tell itself dr danver intimate he readiness to hear and advise if desire and marston resume abruptly after a pause -- pray doctor danver have you hear any story of a odd kind any surmise -- i do not mean of a moral sort for those i hold very cheap -- to my prejudice indeed i should hardly say to my prejudice i mean -- i ought to say -- in short have you hear people remark upon any fancied eccentricity or that sort of thing about I he put the question with obvious difficulty and at last seem to overcome he own reluctance with a sort of angry and excited self-contempt and impatience doctor danver be a little puzzle by the interrogatory and admit in reply that he do not comprehend its drift doctor danver he resume sternly and dejectedly i tell you in the chance interview we have some month ago that i be haunt by a certain fear i do not define it nor do i think you suspect its nature it be a fear of nothing mortal but of the immortal tenant of this body my mind sir be begin to play I trick my guide mock and terrify I there be a perceptible tinge of horror in the look of astonishment with which dr danver listen you be a gentleman sir and a christian clergyman what i have say and shall say be confide to you honor to be hold sacred as the confession of misery and hide from the coarse gaze of the world i have become subject to a hideous delusion it come at interval i do not think any mortal suspect it except maybe my daughter rhoda it come and disappear and come again i keep my pleasant secret for a long time but at last i let it slip and commit myself fortunately to but one person and that my daughter and even so i hardly think she understand I i recollected myself before i have disclose the grotesque and infernal chimera that haunt I marston pause he be stoop forward and look upon the floor of the vehicle so that he companion could not see he countenance a silence ensue which be interrupt by marston who once more resume sir say he i know not why but i have long intensely long for some trustworthy ear into which to pour this horrid secret why i repeat i can not tell for i expect no sympathy and hate compassion it be i suppose the restless nature of the devil that be in I but be it what it may i will speak to you but to you only for the present at least to you alone doctor danver again assure he that he might repose the most entire confidence in he secrecy the human mind i take it must have either comfort in the past or hope in the future he continue otherwise it be in danger to I sir the past be intolerably repulsive one boundless barren and hideous golgotha of dead hope and murder opportunity the future still blacker and more furious people with dreadful feature of horror and menace and lose itself in utter darkness sir i do not exaggerate between such a past and such a future i stand upon this miserable present and the only comfort i still be capable of feeling be that no human be pity I that i stand aloof from the insult of compassion and the hypocrisy of sympathetic morality and that i can safely defy all the respectable scoundrel in christendom to enhance by one feather 's weight the load which i myself have accumulate and which i myself hourly and unaided sustain doctor danver here introduce a word or two in the direction of they former conversation no sir there be no comfort from that quarter either say marston bitterly you but cast you seed as the parable term you teaching upon the barren sea in waste they on I my fate be it what it may be as irrevocably fix as though i be dead and judge a hundred year ago this cursed dream he resume abruptly that everyday enslave I more and more have reference to that -- that occurrence about wynston berkley -- he be the hero of the hellish illusion at certain time sir it seem to I as if he though dead be still invest with a sort of spurious life go about unrecognized except by I in squalor and contempt and whisper away my fame and life labor with the malignant industry of a fiend to involve I in the mesh of that special perdition from which alone i shrink and to which this emissary of hell seem to have predestine I sir this be a monstrous and hideous extravagance a delusion but after all no more than a trick of the imagination the reason the judgment be untouched i can not choose but see all the damned phantasmagoria but i do not believe it real and this be the difference between my case and -- and -- madness they be now enter the suburb of chester and doctor danver pained and shocked beyond measure by this unlooked-for disclosure and not know what remark or comfort to offer relieved he temporary embarrassment by look from the window as though attract by the flash of the lamp among which the vehicle be now move marston however lay he hand upon he arm and thus recall he for a moment to a forced attention it must seem strange to you doctor that i should trust this cursed secret to you keep he say and truth to say it seem so to myself i can not account for the impulse the irresistible power of which have force I to disclose the hateful mystery to you but the fact be this begin like a speck this one idea have gradually darken and dilate until it have fill my entire mind the solitary consciousness of the gigantic mastery it have establish there have grow intolerable i must have tell it the sense of solitude under this aggressive and tremendous delusion be agony hourly death to my soul that be the secret of my talkativeness my sole excuse for plague you with the dream of a wretched hypochondriac doctor danver assure he that no apology be need and be only restrain from add the expression of that pity which he really feel by the fear of irritate a temper so full of bitterness pride and defiance a few minute more and the coach have reach its destination they bid one another farewell and part at that time there reside in a decent mansion about a mile from the town of chester a dapper little gentleman whom we shall call doctor parke this gentleman be the proprietor and sole professional manager of a private asylum for the insane and enjoy a high reputation and a proportionate amount of business in he melancholy call it be about the second day after the conversation we have just sketch that this little gentleman have visit accord to he custom all he domestic patient be about to take he accustomed walk in he somewhat restricted pleasure grounds when he servant announce a visitor a gentleman he repeat you have see he before -- eh no sir reply the man he be in the study sir ha a professional call well we shall see so say the little gentleman summon he gravest look and hasten to the chamber of audience on enter he find a man dress well but gravely have in he air and manner something of high breeding in countenance striking dark-featured and stern furrow with the line of pain or thought rather than of age although he dark hair be largely mingle with white the physician bow and request the stranger to take a chair he however nod slightly and impatiently as if to intimate a intolerance of ceremony and advance a step or two say abruptly -- my name sir be marston i have come to give you a patient the doctor bow with a still deeper inclination and pause for a continuance of the communication thus auspiciously commence you be dr parke i take it for grant say marston in the same tone you most obedient humble servant sir reply he with the polite formality of the day and another grave bow doctor demand marston fix he eye upon he sternly and significantly tap he own forehead can you stay execution the physician look puzzle hesitate and at last request he visitor to be more explicit can you say marston with the same slow and stern articulation and after a considerable pause -- can you prevent the malady you profess to cure -- can you meet and defeat the enemy halfway -- can you scare away the spirit of madness before it take actual possession and while it be still only hover about its threaten victim sir he reply in certain case -- in very many indeed -- the enemy as you well call it may thus be meet and effectually worst at a distance timely interposition in ninety case out of a hundred be everything and i assure you i hear you question with much pleasure inasmuch as i assume it to have reference to the case of the patient about whom you desire to consult I and who be therefore i hope as yet merely menace with the misfortune from which you would save he i myself be that patient sir say marston with a effort you surmise be right i be not mad but unequivocally menace with madness it be not to be mistaken sir there be no misunderstand the tremendous and intolerable sign that glare upon my mind and pray sir have you consult you friend or you family upon the course best to be pursue inquire dr parke with grave interest no sir he answer sharply and almost fiercely i have no fancy to make myself the subject of a writ _ de lunatico inquirendo _ i do not want to lose my liberty and my property at a blow the course i mean to take have be advise by no one but myself -- be know to no other i now disclose it and the cause of it to you a gentleman and my professional adviser in the expectation that you will guard with the strictest secrecy my spontaneous revelation this you promise I certainly mr marston i have neither the disposition nor the right to withhold such a promise answer the physician well then i will first tell you the arrangement i propose with you permission to make and then i shall answer all you question respect my own case resume marston gloomily i wish to place myself under you care to live under you roof reserve my full liberty of action i must be free to come and to go as i will and on the other hand i undertake that you shall find I a amenable and docile patient enough in addition i stipulate that there shall be no attempt whatever make to communicate with those who be connect with I : these term agree upon i place myself in you hand you will find in I as i say before a deferential patient and i trust not a troublesome one i hope you will excuse my add that i shall myself pay the charge of my sojourn here from week to week in advance the propose arrangement be a strange one and although dr parke dimly foresee some of the embarrassment which might possibly arise from he accept it there be yet so much that be reasonable as well as advantageous in the proposal that he could not bring himself to decline it the preliminary arrangement conclude dr parke proceed to he more strictly professional investigation it be of course needless to recapitulate the detail of marston 's torment fancy with which the reader have indeed be already sufficiently acquaint doctor parke have attentively listen to the narrative and satisfied himself as to the physical health of he patient be still sorely puzzle as to the probable issue of the awful struggle already but too obviously commence between the mind and its destroyer in the strange case before he one satisfactory symptom unquestionably be the as yet transitory nature of the delusion and the evident and energetic tenacity with which reason contend for she vital ascendancy it be a case however which for many reason sorely perplex he but of which notwithstanding he be disposed whether rightly or wrongly the reader will speedily see to take by no mean a decidedly gloomy view have disburden he mind of this horrible secret marston feel for a time a sense of relief amounting almost to elation with far less of apprehension and dismay than he have do so for month before he that night repair to he bedroom there be nothing in he case doctor parke believe to warrant he keep any watch upon marston 's action and accordingly he bid he good-night in the full confidence of meet he if not better at least not worse on the ensue morning he miscalculate however marston have probably himself be conscious of some come crisis in he hideous malady when he take the decisive step of place himself under the care of doctor parke certain it be that upon that very night the disease break forth in a new and appalling development doctor parke whose bedroom be next to that occupy by marston be awaken in the dead of night by a howl more like that of a beast than a human voice and which gradually swell into a absolute yell then come some horrid laughter and entreaty thick and frantic then again the same unearthly howl the practice ear of doctor parke recognize but too surely the terrific import of those sound spring from he bed and seize the candle which always burn in he chamber in anticipation of such sudden and fearful emergency he hurry with a palpitating heart and spite of he long habituation to such scene as he expect with a certain sense of horror to the chamber of he aristocratic patient late as it be marston have not yet go to bed he candle be still burn and he himself half dress stand in the center of the floor shake and livid he eye burn with the preterhuman fire of insanity as doctor parke enter the chamber another shout or rather yell thunder from the lip of this demoniac effigy and the mad-doctor stand freezing with horror in the doorway and yet exert what remain to he of presence of mind in the vain endeavor in the flare light of the candle to catch and fix with he own practiced eye the gaze of the maniac second after second and minute after minute he stand confront this frightful slave of satan in the momentary expectation that he would close with and destroy he on a sudden however this brief agony of suspense be terminate a change like a awakening consciousness of reality or rather like the withdrawal of some hideous and visible influence from within pass over the tense and darkened feature of the wretched be a look of horrified perplexity doubt and inquiry supervene and he at last say in a subdue and sullen tone to doctor parke : who be you sir what do you want here who be you sir i say who be i why you physician sir doctor parke sir the owner of this house sir reply he with all the sternness he could command and yet white as a specter with agitation for shame sir for shame to give way thus what do you mean by create this causeless alarm and disturb the whole household at so unseasonable a hour for shame sir go to you bed undress yourself this moment for shame doctor parke as he speak be reassure by the arrival of one of he servant alarm by the unmistakable sound of violent frenzy he sign however to the man not to enter feeling confident as he do that the paroxysm have spend itself aye aye mutter marston look almost sheepishly doctor parke to be sure what be i thinking of how cursedly absurd and this he continue glance at he sword which he throw impatiently upon a sofa as he speak folly -- nonsense a false alarm as you say doctor i beg you pardon as marston speak he proceed with much agitation slowly to undress himself he have however but commence the process when turn abruptly to doctor parke he say with a countenance of horror and in a whisper -- by -- doctor it have be upon I worse than ever i would have swear i have the villain with I for hour -- hour sir -- torture I with he damned sneering threat till by -- i could stand it no longer and take my sword oh doctor can not you save I can nothing be do for I pale cover with the dew of horror he utter these last word in accent of such implore despair as might have bear across the dreadful gulf the prayer of dive for that one drop of water which never be to cool he burn tongue when rhoda learn that she father on leave gray forest have fix no definite period for he return she begin to feel she situation at home so painful and equivocal that have take honest willett to counsel she come at last to the resolution of accept the often convey invitation of mr mervyn and sojourning at all event until she father 's return at newton park my dear young friend say the kind lady as soon as she hear rhoda 's little speech to its close i can scarcely describe the gratification with which i see you here the happiness with which i welcome you to newton park nor indeed the anxiety with which i constantly contemplated you try and painful position at gray forest indeed i ought to be angry with you for have refuse I this happiness so long but you have make amends at last though indeed it be impossible to have defer it longer you must not fancy however that i will consent to lose you so soon as you seem to have intend no no i have find it too hard to catch you to let you take wing so easily besides i have other to consult as well as myself and person too who be just as anxious as i be to make a prisoner of you here the good mr mervyn accompany these word with look so sly and emphasis so significant that rhoda be fain to look down to hide she blush and compassionate the confusion she herself have cause the kind old lady lead she to the chamber which be henceforward so long as she consent to remain to be she own apartment how that day be pass and how fleetly its hour speed away it be needless to tell old mervyn have he gentle as well as he grim aspect and no welcome be ever more cordial and tender than that with which he greet the unprotected child of he morose and repulsive neighbor it would be impossible to convey any idea of the countless assiduity and the secret delight with which young mervyn attend they ramble the party be assemble at supper what a contrast do this cheerful happy -- unutterably happy -- gathering present in the mind of rhoda to the dull drear fearful evening which she have long be wont to pass at gray forest as they sate together in cheerful and happy intercourse a chaise drive up to the hall-door and the knock have hardly cease to reverberate when a well-known voice be hear in the hall young mervyn start to he foot and merrily ejaculate charle marston this be delightful disappear and in a instant return with charle himself we pass over all the embrace of

maybe bring to recognize in the just and terrible process the hand of heaven god grant that at last he heart may be soften and he spirit illuminate by the bless influence he have so long and so sternly reject as the old man thus speak -- as if in symbolic answering to he prayer -- a sudden glory from the setting sun stream through the funereal pile of cloud which fill the western horizon and flood the chamber where they be after a silence charle marston say with some little embarrassment -- it may be a strange confession to make though indeed hardly so to you -- for you know but too well the gloomy reserve with which my father have uniformly treat I -- that the exact nature of merton 's confession never reach my ear and once or twice when i approach the subject in conversation with you it seem to I that the subject be one which for some reason it be painful to you to enter upon and so it be in truth my young friend -- so it be for that confession leave behind it many fearful doubt prove indeed nothing but the one fact that morally the wretched man be guilty of the murder charle urge by a feeling of the keenest interest request dr danver to detail to he the particulars of the die man 's narration willingly answer dr danver with a look of gloom and heave a profound sigh -- willingly for you have now come to a age when you may safely be entrust with secret affect you own family and which although thank god as i believe they in no respect involve the honor of anyone of its member yet might deeply involve its peace and its security against the assault of vague and horrible slander here then be the narrative : merton when he be conscious of the approach of death qualify by a circumstantial and detailed statement the absolute confession of guilt which he have at first sullenly make in this he declare that the guilt of design and intention only be he -- that in the act itself he have be anticipate he state that from the moment when sir wynston 's servant have casually mention the circumstance of he master 's usually sleep with he watch and pocketbook under he pillow the idea of rob he have take possession of he mind with the idea of rob he -lrb- under the peculiar circumstance he servant sleep in the apartment close by and the slightest alarm be in all probability sufficient to call he to the spot -rrb- the idea of anticipate resistance by murder have associate itself he have contend against these haunting and grow solicitation of satan with a earnest agony he have intend to leave he place and fly from the mysterious temptation which he feel he want power to combat but accident or fate prevent he in a state of ghastly excitement he have on the memorable night of sir wynston 's murder proceed as have afterwards appear in evidence by the back stair to the baronet 's chamber he have softly steal into it and go to the bedside with the weapon in he hand he draw he breath for the decisive stroke which be to bereave the -lrb- supposedly -rrb- sleep man of life and when stretch he left hand under the clothes it rest upon a dull cold corpse and at the same moment he right hand be immerse in a pool of blood he drop the knife recoil a pace or so with a painful effort however he again grasp with he hand to recover the weapon he have suffer to escape and secure as it afterwards turn out not the knife with which he have meditate the commission of he crime but the dagger which be afterwards find where he have conceal it he be now fully alive to the horror of he situation he be compromise as fully as if he have in very deed drive home the weapon to be find under such circumstance would convict he as surely as if fifty eye have see he strike the blow he have nothing now for it but flight and in order to guard himself against the contingency of be surprise from the door open upon the corridor he bolt it then grope under the murder man 's pillow for the booty which have so fatally fascinate he imagination here he be disappoint what further happen you already know charle listen with breathless attention to this recital and after a painful interval say -- then the actual murderer be after all unascertained this be indeed horrible it be very natural that my father should have feel the danger to which such a disclosure would have expose the reputation of we family yet i should have prefer encounter it be it ten time as great to the equivocal prudence of suppress the truth with respect to a murder commit under my own roof he have however it would seem arrive at some new conclusion say dr danver and be now prepare to throw some unanticipated light upon the whole transaction even as they be talk a knock be hear at the hall-door and after a brief and hurry consultation it be agree that consider the strict condition of privacy attach to this visit by mr marston himself as well as he reserved and wayward temper it might be better for charle to avoid present himself to he father on this occasion a few seconds afterwards the door open and mr marston enter the apartment it be now dark and the servant unbidden place candle upon the table without answer one word to dr danver ' greet marston sit down as it seem in agitate abstraction remove he hat suddenly -lrb- for he have not even make this slight homage to the law of courtesy -rrb- he look round with a care-worn fiery eye and a pale countenance and say -- we be quite alone dr danver -- no one anywhere near dr danver assure he that all be secure after a long and agitate pause marston say -- you remember merton 's confession he admit he intention to kill berkley but deny that he be the actual murderer he speak truth -- no one know it better than i for i be the murderer dr danver be so shocked and overwhelm that he be utterly unable to speak aye sir in point of law and of moral literally and honestly the murderer of wynston berkley i be resolve you shall know it all make what use of it you will -- i care for nothing now but to get rid of the d -- d unsustainable secret and that be do i do not intend to kill the scoundrel when i go to he room but with the just feeling of exasperation with which i regard he it would have be wiser have i avoid the interview and i mean to have do so but he candle be burn i see the light through the door and go in it be he evil fortune to indulge in he old strain of sardonic impertinence he provoke I i strike he -- he strike I again -- and with he own dagger i stab he three time i do not know what i have do i could not believe it i feel neither remorse nor sorrow -- why should i -- but the thing be horrible astounding there he sit in the corner of he cushion chair with the old fiendish smile on still sir i never think that any human shape could look so dreadful i do not know how long i stay there freezing with horror and detestation and yet unable to take my eye from the face do you see it in the coffin sir there be a sneer of triumph on it that be diabolic and prophetic marston be fearfully agitate as he speak and repeatedly wipe from he face the cold sweat that gather there i could not leave the room by the back stair he resume for the valet sleep in the intervene chamber i feel such a appal antipathy to the body that i could scarcely muster courage to pass it but sir i be not easily cow -- i master this repugnance in a few minute -- or rather i act spite of it i know not how but instinctively it seem to I that it be better to lay the body in the bed than leave it where it be shew as its position might that the thing occur in a altercation so sir i raise it and bear it softly across the room and lay it in the bed and while i be carry it it sway forward the arm glide round my neck and the head rest against my cheek -- that be a parody upon a brotherly embrace i do not know at what moment it be but some time when i be carry wynston or lay he in the bed continue marston who speak rather like one pursue a horrible reverie than as a man relate fact to a listener i hear a light tread and soft breathing in the lobby a thunderclap would have stunned I less that minute i move softly hold my breath to the door i believe in moment of strong excitement man hear more acutely than at other time but i think i hear the rustling of a gown go from the door again i wait -- it cease i wait until all be quiet i then extinguish the candle and grope my way to the door there be a faint light in the corridor and i think i see a head project from the chamber-door next to the frenchwoman 's -- mademoiselle 's as i come on it be softly withdraw and the door not quite noiselessly close i could not be absolutely certain but i learn all afterward and now sir you have the story of sir wynston 's murder dr danver groan in spirit be wring alike with fear and sorrow with hand clasp and head bow down in a exceed bitter agony of soul he murmur only the word of the litany -- lord have mercy upon we christ have mercy upon we lord have mercy upon we marston have recover he usual lower aspect and gloomy self-possession in a few moment and be now stand erect and defiant before the humble and afflict minister of god the contrast be terrible -- almost sublime doctor danver resolve to keep this dreadful secret at least for a time to himself he could not make up he mind to inflict upon those whom he love so well as charle and rhoda the shame and agony of such a disclosure yet he be sorely trouble for he be a conflict of duty and mercy of love and justice he tell charle marston when urge with earnest inquiry that what he have hear that evening be intend solely for he own ear and gently but peremptorily decline tell at least until some future time the substance of he father 's communication charle now feel it necessary to see he father for the purpose of let he know the substance of the letter respect mademoiselle and the late sir wynston which have reach he accordingly he proceed accompany by doctor danver on the next morning to the hotel where marston have intimate he intention of pass the night on they inquire for he in the hall the porter appear much perplexed and disturbed and as they press he with question he answer become conflicting and mysterious mr marston be there -- he have sleep there last night he could not say whether or not he be then in the house but he know that no one could be admit to see he he would if the gentleman wish it send they card to -lrb- not mr marston but -rrb- the proprietor and finally he conclude by beg that they would themselves see the proprietor and dispatch a waiter to apprise he of the circumstance of the visit there be something odd and even sinister in all this which along with the whispering and the curious glance of the waiter who happen to hear the errand on which they come inspire the two companion with vague misgiving which they do not care mutually to disclose in a few moment they be show into a small sit room up stair where the proprietor a fussy little gentleman and apparently very uneasy and frightened receive they we have call here to see mr marston say doctor danver and the porter have refer we to you yes sir exactly -- precisely so answer the little man fidget excessively and as it seem grow paler every instant but -- but in fact sir there be there have be -- in short have you not hear of the -- the accident he wind up with a prodigious effort and wipe he forehead when he have do pray sir be explicit : we be near friend of mr marston in fact sir this be he son say doctor danver point to charle marston and we be both uneasy at the reserve with which we inquiry have be meet do i entreat of you say what have happen why -- why hesitate the man i really -- i would not for five hundred pound it have happen in my house the -- the unhappy gentleman have in short -- he glance at charle as if afraid of the effect of the disclosure he be on the point of make and then hurriedly say -- he be dead sir he be find dead in he room this morning at eight o'clock i assure you i have not be myself ever since charle marston be so stunned by this sudden blow that he be upon the point of faint rally however with a strong effort he demand to be conduct to the chamber where the body lay the man assent but hesitate on reach the door and whisper something in the ear of doctor danver who as he hear it raise he hand and eye with a mute expression of horror and turn to charle say -- my dear young friend remain where you be for a few moment i will return to you immediately and tell you whatever i have ascertain you be in no condition for such a scene at present charle indeed feel that the fact be so and sick and giddy suffer doctor danver with gentle compulsion to force he into a seat in silence the venerable clergyman follow he conductor with a palpitating heart he advance to the bedside and twice essay to draw the curtain and twice lose courage but gathering resolution at last he pull the drapery aside and behold all he be to see again of richard marston the bedclothes be draw so as nearly to cover the mouth there be the wound sir whisper the man as with coarse officiousness he draw back the bedclothes from the throat of the corpse and exhibit a gash as it seem nearly sever the head from the body with sickening horror doctor danver turn away from the awful spectacle he cover he face in he hand and it seem to he as if a soft solemn voice whisper in he ear the mystic word whoso sheddeth man 's blood by man shall he blood be shed the hand which but a few year before have unsuspected consign a fellow-mortal to the grave have itself avenge the murder -- marston have perish by he own hand naturally ambitious and intriguing the perilous tendency of such a spirit in mademoiselle de barras have never be school by the mighty and benignant principle of religion of she accidental acquaintance at rouen with sir wynston berkley and she subsequent introduction in a evil hour into the family at gray forest it be unnecessary to speak the unhappy term on which she find marston living with he wife suggest in they mutual alienation the idea of found a double influence in the household and to conceive the idea and to act upon it be in she active mind the same young beautiful fascinating she well know the power of she attraction and determine though probably without one thought of transgress the limit of literal propriety to bring they to bear upon the discontented retired roué for whom she care absolutely nothing except as the instrument and in part the victim of she scheme thus yield to the double instinct that sway she she gratify at the same time she love of intrigue and she love of power at length however come the hour which demand a sacrifice to the evil influence she have hitherto worship on such easy term she find that she power must now be secure by crime and she fall then come the arrival of sir wynston -- he murder -- she elopement with marston and she guilty and joyless triumph at last
