of determine fire come into peggy 's eye as she speak peg you be magnificent exclaimed jess as head by miss prescott they hasten toward the car which jake have already crank the gipsy have pause for a instant evidently the sight of the aëroplanes bewildered and amaze they expect to come on a camp of young folk they have suddenly encounter a group of machine which to they must have savor of the supernatural but as the auto drive off they be due for a even greater surprise follow a swift whisper from roy both boy have jump into the _ red dragon _ in a instant come the sharp bark of the engine the fly machine dash forward almost simultaneously straight at the angry nomad roy head it it be as if a war chariot of old be charge into a group of defiant barbarian for a few moment the gipsy stand they ground but as the machine rise from the ground skim it as it be roy thrust on full power the machine dart over the spot where the gipsy have stand but a instant before but they have go scatter with wild cry of fear they could be see run for they life toward the wood i do not think they 'll trouble we again in a hurry declare roy grimly as he bring the _ red dragon _ round in a circle and head back for the rest from the machine come a cheer miss prescott 's voice ring out as loudly as any the idea just come to I in a second explain roy modestly in answer to the lady ' congratulation and praise it work though do not it like a charm they all agree have not we better be get on ask jimsy a minute later yes there be no know if those fellow will not try a flank attack although i think they have have a big enough scare throw into they to last they quite a while with economy laugh roy who be go to take care of wren ask bess she 'll ride right in the car with I declare miss prescott positively you do not think i be go to risk she in one of those thing of yours do you they all laugh as a matter of fact there be not one of the party that be not more at home in the air than on a road then too roy 's balancing device have about remove the last peril of air travel it be agree to stop at meadville which the map show be about thirty mile to the southeast and purchase a dress and other necessity for they new ward as to what be to be do with she after that nobody have any very definite plan and so the journey be resume with congratulation fly over the way in which they come out of what for a time look like a really serious scrape the weather have hold fair till a short time after the start be make from the scene of the encounter with the gipsy it be peggy who first observe a change in the sky from the southwest billowy mass of slate-colored cloud come roll on obscure the sunlit landscape beneath with a effect of light turn down on a stage turn to jess who occupy the seat behind she she remark : we be go to have some bad kind of a storm girlie jess nod wonder how far we be from meadville she ask quite a way yet i be afraid that we can not make it before the storm break look there be roy come back and jimsy too i guess they want to talk about it this turn out to be the case as roy come swing by he hold a small megaphone to he mouth with one hand while the other grip the steer wheel tightly we be in for a storm girl and a hummer too from the look of it better drop down counsel jimsy jess nod and as at this moment bess who have see the boy 's maneuver come by the news be communicate to she the next thing to do be to look about for a suitable place to land the country over which they be pass be heavily wooded and seemingly sparsely populated beneath they wind a road along which but at some distance behind the tour car could be see come in a cloud of yellow dust the wind begin to grow puffy and it require all the skill of the young aviator to keep they flock of motor-driven bird on even wing before long just as the distant but fast approach cloud curtain begin to be rip and slash by vivid scimitar of lightning roy espy beneath they a field at one end of which stand a prosperous-looking farmhouse surround by building and hay stack it be a ideal spot in which to land and as the road be near by they would have no difficulty in attract the attention of miss prescott when she go by in graceful volplane the aëroplanes light in the field like a alighting flight of carrier pigeon but hardly have they touch the ground when from the farmhouse a man come run in he shirtsleeve he lower limb be garb in overalls and knee-boot on he chin be a goatee and as he draw closer they see that he face be thin and hatchet shaped and anything but agreeable you git out of thar you git out of thar he keep shout as he come along stumble over the stubble for the field have be newly reap why what be the matter we be not hurt anything object roy surely you do not mind we occupy the field for a hour or so till the storm blow over i dao not hey wa'al i do by heck i own all the way daown and all the way up frum this farm and thet 's ther law if we do not have these lady with we we would be only too glad to leave you field rejoin jimsy but you can see for yourself a nasty storm be come up what bizness he gal ride round in they sky-buggy storm the farmer ef any darter uv mine do it i would lock she up on bread a ' water by jim hill i do not doubt it in the least smile peggy sweetly humph grunt the cantankerous old agriculturist not quite sure if he be be make fun of or if he resolution be be admire all i get to say be thet ef you want to stay here you gotter pay that can be arrange speak jimsy with quiet sarcasm a ' pay wa'al too resume the farmer tenaciously how much do you think the lease of you field for a hour or so be worth ask roy the farmer consider a instant and then with a avaricious look in he pin-point blue eye he look up ` bout ten dollar he say at length we do not want to buy it we just want to rent it for a very short time strike in bess with she most innocent expression wa'al it be ten or git off snap the farmer i 'll pay you a fair price for it speak up roy and not a cent more then i 'll drive you off with a shot-gun by chowder oh no you will not will not hey what 'll stop I the law ther law thet 's a good one i think it be a very good one strike in jimsy who now see what roy be drive at humph wa'al if yer a ` goin ' te talk law i 'll je ' tell yer quick thet this be my land and thet you be all a-trespassing you be not very well up on aërial law it seem reply roy in a absolutely unruffled tone do not know nuthin ' ` bout this air-ile law grumble the fellow but somewhat impress by roy 's calm deliberate exterior well then for you information i 'll tell you that under the law of the country recently enact aviator be entitle to land in any safe landing place in time of emergency if they do any damage they must pay for it if not the owner of the land be not entitle to anything for the temporary use of he place five dollar or nothing speak jimsy and if you try to put we off you 'll get into serious trouble

fire be out a smolder blacken hillock be all that remain of the stack ignite by the lightning bolt but the other and the main building of the farm have be save such work be a new task for aëroplanes -- but there be no doubt that have it not be for peggy 's suggestion the hutching farm would have be burn to the ground as it be when the fireman they horse in a lather arrive at the scene the farm hand who have be fight the flame be almost exhaust have they possess the time the young folk would have be glad to tell the curious fireman something about they aëroplanes but it be well into the afternoon and if they intend to keep up they itinerary it be necessary for they to be hurry on a short time after the blaze have be declare out the aëroplanes once more soar aloft and the auto chug off in the direction of meadville the afternoon sun shine sparklingly on the tree and field below all freshen by the downpour of the early afternoon the spirit of all rise as do they machine as they race along before leave the hutching farm the old man have be so move to generosity by the novel manner in which he farm have be save from destruction that he have offer to give back $ 250 of the $ 5 he have demand for the rent of he field of course they have not take it but the evident anguish with which the offer be make afford much amusement to the young aviator as they soar along in peggy 's machine the talk between herself and jess be of the strange finding of the wren and of the child 's curious way both girl recall she odd conduct during the storm and what she have say about the peculiar influence of lightning on she memory depend on it jess declare peggy with conviction that child be no more a gipsy than you or i do you think she be steal from somewhere ask jess readily guess the drift of she friend 's thought i do not know but i be sure they have no legal right to she be the reply oh peg suppose she should turn out to be a miss heiress jess who love a romance clasp she gauntleted hand peggy laugh miss heiress be not so common as you might suppose she say i never meet any one who have encounter any except in story book still it would be great if we have really find a long miss child or -- or something like that conclude jess rather lamely i can not see how we would be benefit the child or its parent either since we have no way of know who the latter be rejoin the practical peggy which remark close the discussion for the time be it be not more than half a hour later when jess utter a sharp cry of alarm from the forward part of the aëroplane a wisp of smoke have suddenly curl upward like a blue serpent of vapor it dissolve in the air almost so quickly as to make jess believe for a instant that she have be the victim of a hallucination but that it be no figment of the imagination be evidence a few moment later by peggy herself arouse by jess 's cry she have make a inspection of the machine with alarming result what these be speedily become manifest jess the machine be on fire she cry afrightedly as if in verification of she word there come a puff of flame and a strong reek of gasoline it be just then that both girl recall that the _ golden butterfly _ carry twenty-five gallon of gasoline without count the reserve supply fire on a aëroplane be even more terrifying than a similar casualty on any other type of machine hardly have peggy 's word confirm the alarming news leave she lip when there come a cry from jess the girl have just glance at the barograph it show that they be then 1500 foot above the surface of the earth the girl have hardly make this discovery before from beneath the bow of the monoplane come a wave of flame drive from the steer wheel by the heat peggy draw back toward she companion she face be ashen white left to itself the aëroplane yaw wildly like a craft without a rudder then suddenly it dash down toward the earth smoke and flame leap from its front part both girl utter a cry of terror as the aircraft fall like a stone hurl into space faster and faster it dash earthward without a control hand to guide it it be at this instant that roy and jimsy become aware of what have happen -lrb- illustration : both girl utter a cry of terror as the air craft fall like a stone hurl into space -rrb- instantly they swing they machine around in time to see the _ golden butterfly _ make she sickening downward swoop both lad utter a cry of fear as they see what appear to mean certain death for the two girl aviator roy 's finger scarcely grasp the wheel of he machine as he see the downward drop jimsy be as badly affect but almost before they could grasp a full realization of the accident the _ golden butterfly _ be almost on the ground it be in a hilly bit of country intersperse by small lake or pond a freak of the wind catch the blaze aëroplane as it fall and drive it right over one of these small body of water the _ golden butterfly _ appear to hesitate for one instant and then plunge right into the water fling the two girl out both be expert swimmer but the shock of the sudden descent and the abrupt manner in which they have be fling into the water have badly unstrung they nerve jess strike out valiantly but the next instant utter a cry : peg peg i be sink peggy pluckily strike out for she chum and succeed in seize she then with brisk stroke she make for the shore luckily only a few yard distant it be at this juncture that the boy ' machine come to earth almost simultaneously high above bess 's _ dart _ hover and presently it too begin to drop downward apparently the accident have not be see from the auto at any rate the car be not turn back toward the scene of the accident as the boy ' aëroplanes strike the earth not far from the bank of the pond toward which peggy be at that moment valiantly struggle the two young aviator leap out and set out at a run to the rescue they reach the bank in the nick of time to pull out the two drench half-exhausted girl at any rate the fall be a lucky one in a way gasp the optimistic peggy as soon as she catch she breath it put out the fire and so it have not only that but the aëroplane buoy up by its broad wing be still float on board the _ red dragon _ be a long bit of rope jimsy produce this and then swim out to the drift _ butterfly _ the rope be make fast to it and the craft drag ashore but when they get it to the bank the problem arise as to how they be go to drag it up the steep acclivity again and again they try bess who have by this time alight aid they but it be all to no purpose even they united strength fail to move the heavy apparatus i have get a idea shout jimsy suddenly during a pause in they laborious operation good do not let it get away i beg of you implore peggy oh peg do not tease besides you do not look a bit cute with you hair all wet and draggled and as for you dress -- goodness this come from jess herself sadly rumpled and in addition wet through before peggy could reply to she chum 's half rally remark jimsy unabashed continue : we 'll hitch this rope to the _ red dragon _ and then start she up for all she be worth jimsy you be a genius a modern marvel a solid promontory of pure gray matter in turn the remark come from each of the party but jimsy bother not at all at the laugh encomium proceed to secure the rope to the _ red dragon _ this do he start up the engine and clamber into he seat all ashore that be go ashore he yell in mock imitation of the steward of a ocean liner there be not a instant 's hesitation as he throw the load upon the engine then the rope tauten it grow tight as a fiddle string goodness it 'll snap and the _ dragon _ will be break cry jess in alarm but no such thing happen instead as the _ dragon 's _ powerful propeller blade bit into the air the _ golden butterfly _ obediently mount the steep bank of the pond five minute later the pretty craft stand on dry land and the party of young aviator be eagerly make a investigation of the damage do the cause of the fire be soon find a tiny leak in the tank have allow some gasoline to drip into the bottom of the chassis or passenger carrier collect here it be plain that a back fire from the carburetor have ignite it neither of the girl could repress a shudder as they think of what might have occur have they be higher in the air and no convenient pond handy for they to drop into in such a case the flame might have reach the gasoline tank before they could be extinguish and inevitably a fearful explosion would have follow i think you be the two luckiest girl in the world declare roy solemnly as he conclude he examination and announce he conclusion naturally they fully agree with he chapter vii a stop for the night it be some two hour later that meadville receive the greatest excitement of its career people rush out of store and house as the flock of aëroplanes come into sight as they gaze down the young aviator feel a momentary regret that they have choose a town in which to pass the first night of they motor flight it appear that they would get into difficulty when they attempt to make a landing but almost simultaneously they spy a public park which appear to offer a favorable landing place as soon as they intention of descend there become manifest however the crowd make a headlong rush for the spot it be too late to seek some other location to alight even have there be one available trust to luck that the eager spectator would get out of they way the four aëroplanes begin they spiral descent roy be first in he big biplane as the ponderous white machine range down close to the park the crowd become well-nigh uncontrollable they swarm beneath the big machine despite roy 's shout of warn skillfully as the boy manipulate the aircraft he could not check its descent once begin out of the way i do not want to hurt you he shout as he dash down but the crowd sheeplike in they stupidity refuse to budge into the midst of they roy perforce be compel to drive once the throng perceive he intention however they scatter wildly that be all seek position of safety but one man a stout red-faced individual who appear dazed or befuddle he stand he ground glare foolishly at the sky ship with a quick turn of he wrist roy sweep the big biplane aside but a wing tip brush the stout man topple he over in a twinkling by the time roy have stop he machine the man be on he foot again bellow furiously he be not hurt but he face be contorted with anger he push he way through the crowd toward the young aviator you young scoundrel he yell i 'll fix you for that i 'll -- look out here come the rest of they shout the crowd at this juncture nobody need any warn this time they flee in all direction as one after the other the _ golden butterfly _ the _ red dragon _ and the pretty graceful _ dart _ drop to earth wa'al look at they gal will yer shout a voice in the crowd what be the country come to demand another man gal gallivant around like gol-dinged bird but the majority of the crowd take the pretty girl aviator to its heart somebody set up a cheer it be still ring out when to the huge relief of the embarrassed girl the auto come roll up with miss prescott and the wren as they still call the latter the girl leave the boy to look after the aëroplanes run to the side of the car and be speedily ensconce in its roomy tonneau we 'll see you at the hotel cry roy as the car roll off again much to the disappointment of the crowd two local constable come up at this juncture and help the boy keep the crowd back from the machine the throng seem souvenir mad many of they insist on write they name with pencil on the wing of the air craft other would have go further and actually strip the aëroplanes of odd part have they not be hold back this be the last time we 'll land in a town of this size declare roy indignantly as he help the constable shove back a obstreperous individual who insist on examine the motor of the _ dart _ with the help of the constable a shelter place for the machine be finally find a livery stable that have go out of business the week before be located across the street from the small park in which they have alight the owner of the property happen to be in the crowd and a bargain with he be soon strike the aëroplanes be then trundle on they landing wheel into this shelter and the door close roy for a small sum engage a tall gangling-looking youth whose name be tam tamma to guard the door and keep off the inquisitive this do thoroughly tire out the boy seek the hotel like most town of its size and importance meadville only boast one hostelry worthy of the name this place the fountain house as it be call be a decent enough look hotel and the young aviator be warmly welcome after supper for in meadville nobody dine miss prescott and the girl saunter out with the wren to obtain some clothing for the waif who have so strangely come into they possession it be odd but somehow they none of they even suggest give up the queer little foundling to the authority as have originally be they intention instead although none of they actually voice it it appear that tacitly they have decide to keep the child with they while they be go on they errand of helpfulness roy and jimsy be seat on the porch of the hotel watch with more or less languid interest the inhabitant of the town pass back and forth many of they linger in front of the hotel for aviator be not common object in that part of the country and already the party have become local celebrity i guess we 'll go inside say roy at length i be get sick of be look at as if i be some sort of natural curiosity same here rejoin jimsy we 'll go in and i 'll play you a game of checkers you be on be the response but as the boy rise to go or rather the instant before they leave they seat there come a heavy step behind roy and a gruff voice snarl : what be you do in that chair sit in it respond roy in not too pleasant a voice the tone in which he have be address have arouse a hot resentment in he toward the speaker turn he see the same red-faced man whom he have be unfortunate enough to knock down instantly he manner change he feel genuinely sorry for the accident and hasten to explain that such be the case but a glowering glance be the only response he receive you do it a-purpose do not tell I snarl the red-faced individual a ' now you git right out uv that chair or -- or i 'll make you both boy stare at the man in amazement he tone be coarse and bully to a degree we be not occupy

man in response get a mortgage on it eh smile jimsy amiably i 'll show you kid how much of a mortgage i have get on it be the reply it be just then that a lad of about roy 's own age but with a surly hang-dog sort of look emerge from the smoking-room of the hotel what be up father he demand address the red-faced man why dan the kid have appropriate my chair oh those fly kid well they 'll see that they be not everything around here respond the lad i reckon jim cassell have some say here eh dad i reckon so son grin the red-faced man in response to this elegant speech now then be you go to give

out dan cassell then i 'll show you how to vacate it -- so with the word he lay hand on the back of the chair and jerk it from under the young aviator roy catch entirely off he guard be fling to the floor of the porch he be up in a flash but as he rise to he foot dan cassell evidently excite by what he deem a great triumph aim a savage blow at he jimsy be rush to he assistance but the red-faced man suddenly block he path hold off son hold off he warn unless you want to get the same dose chapter viii roy make a enemy in the meantime roy have skillfully avoid dan cassell 's blow and be aggressively on the defensive he be a lad who do not care for fight but notwithstanding be a trained boxer something of this seem to dawn on dan cassell as the boy he seek to pummel dodge he attack with such cleverness for a moment dan stand stock-still with double up fist and a scowl on he not unhandsome though weak and vicious feature then with a bellow he rush upon roy who contented himself by sidestep the furious onslaught this appear to enrage dan cassell the more either he interpret it as portray cowardice or else he deem that he have he opponent at he mercy at any rate after a instant 's pause he rush at roy with both fist it be the young aviator 's opportunity look out he warn the next instant the pugnacious dan cassell find himself upon he back regard a multitude of constellation at almost precisely the same time jimsy 's fist happen to collide with the point of the jaw of the fall battler 's father sorry but i simply have to you know remark the nonchalant jimsy as the red-faced man find himself occupy a position not dissimilar to that of he son both boy be heartily sorry for what have happen the more so for the reason that at the very instant that both crestfallen bully be scramble to they foot the hotel door open and several of the guest come out to ascertain the cause of the trouble among they be jonas hardcastle the proprietor of the place what

why about the harm this fellow cassell can do we in every community like this you 'll find one local ` pooh-bah ' who run thing pretty much as he like they have satellite who will do just about as they be tell you mean -- that we would better keep a good lookout on the aëroplanes from my judgment of cassell i do not think he be get nerve enough to attack we directly but he can wreak he vengeance on we machine if we do not watch pretty closely i be inclined to think you be right but do not say a word of all this to the girl it might upset they you and i will decide on a plan of action later on to tell you the truth i be not any too sure of we newly acquire watchman tam tamma nor i we 'll wait till the rest get back and then take a stroll down to that livery stable seem funny

be conclude very well we 'll get the car -- it be in the garage at the hotel -- and incidentally we might get a lunch put up also it may be a long chase the officer regard they with frank amazement my but you city folk rush thing he exclaim i suppose they 'll get busy on this case day after to-morrow exclaim roy disgustedly as they hasten away it be half a hour later that the big touring car with roy at the wheel roll out of the hotel yard jake have be tell off to guard the livery stable and the aëroplanes while the rest remain with miss prescott who be seriously agitate at the accumulation of trouble she party have meet with since set out i declare she say i wish i be back at home where i could get a decent cup of tea and be free of worry the trail of the aëroplane be not difficult to follow it lead down the village main street and thence along a country road till it come to a sort of cross road here it branch off and follow a by-road for a mile or so at a gate in a hedge all sign fail however although it be plain that the machine have be wheel through the gap and take across a field beyond this field lay what appear to be a wilderness of wood and bush stump exclaimed roy as he bring the auto to a stop chapter xii the finding of the butterfly well what next ask jimsy make a search of those wood i suppose reply roy there be nothing else to do no the trail have bring we here reply peggy energetically we must make a determine effort to find the _ butterfly _ maybe they have damage it so that we will not be able to do anything with it when we do get it speak jimsy presently whom do you mean by they ask roy as if you do not know be there any doubt in you mind that that fellow cassell be at the bottom of all this not very much i 'll admit reply roy i wonder if that account for the inactivity of the police in just what way well the fellow 's a local politician and have a lot of ` pull ' he _ must _ have to get away with anything like this be jimsy 's indignant outburst well do not let we waste time speculate put in peggy in she brisk manner the thing to do now be to get back the _ golden butterfly _ you be right peg come from both boy by this time they be out of the car which they leave stand at the roadside while they examine the vicinity for track but the grass in the field be fairly long and no trace remain yet inasmuch as the track of the _ butterfly _ end at the gap in the hedge it be manifest that that be the point at which it have be wheel off the road what next ask jimsy as it become certain that there be little use in search for a trail in the meadow it be like look for a needle in that proverbial haystack strike in peggy in my opinion we need the patience of job and the year of old methuselah opine jimsy roy alone be not discourage it can not be so very far off he urge it stand to reason that they can not have come much further than this since midnight suppose the machine to have be steal about that hour the other agree with he we 'll search all around here include those wood declare peggy well they can not have take it very far into the wood declare jimsy the spread of its wing would prevent that that be so agreed roy i think we be get pretty ` warm ' right now all i be afraid of be that they may have damage it breathe peggy anxiously it would be in line with they other tactic agree roy man who would try to burn down a stable with two boy in it just to obtain revenge for a fancied insult or injury be capable of anything without further waste of time they cross the meadow and come to the edge of the wood at the outskirts of the wood the tree grow thinly and it be plain that it would have be possible to wheel a aëroplane into they shadow despite the breadth of its wing-spread they pass under the outlying tree and presently emerge into a small open space in the midst of which be a hut just beyond this hut be a sight that cause they to shout aloud with joy there apparently unharmed stand the miss aëroplane hurray shout roy dash forward the other be close on he heel in they excitement they pay little or no attention to the surroundings it might have be better for they have they do so as they dash across the clearing two male figure slip off among the thicker tree that lay beyond the open space and the hut a brief examination show they that the aëroplane be undamaged there be a few scratch on it but beyond that it appear in perfect condition we 'll fly back declare jimsy to peggy roy can run the auto home that be agreeable to I respond roy but suppose we examine the vicinity first we might get a clew as to the rascal who be responsible for this that be true agree jimsy then suppose we start with the hut first they accept this proposition eagerly the hut be a substantial look building with a padlock on the door but the portal stand wide open the padlock hanging in a hasp what if anyone pounce on we ask peggy in rather a scared tone no fear of that reply roy the place be plainly unoccupied they enter the hut and find it to be as primitive inside as its exterior would indicate a table and two rude chair stand within these with the exception of a rusty cook stove in one corner form the sole furnishings there be not even a window in the place nothing much to be find here declare roy after a cursory examination i guess this shack be put up by lumberman or hunter it do not seem to have be occupy for a long time i guess the man who take the aëroplane must have be pretty familiar with the place though opine jimsy no doubt of that reply roy but that do not give we any clew to they identity beyond bare suspicion yes and suspicion be not much good in law chime in peggy they -- good gracious the door close suddenly with a bang before jimsy could spring across the room to open it there come a sharp click somebody 's padlock it on the outside he cry and we be prisoner gasp peggy yes and without any chance of get out either declare jimsy there be not even a window in the place well this be worse and more of it cry roy who can have do that the same people that steal the _ golden butterfly _ declare peggy hark outside they hear rapidly retreat footstep follow by a harsh laugh let we out shout roy you can stay there till judgment day for all i care come back a hoarse rasping voice you kid be too fresh and now you be get what be come to you chapter xiii prisoner in the hut it be almost pitch dark within the hut only from a crack under the door could any light enter for a instant after the taunting of the voice of the man who have lock they in reach they ear the trio of youthful prisoner remain silent peggy it be who speak first well what be to be do now she demand we have get to get out of here respond jimsy with embarrassing candor that be plain enough strike in roy but how do you propose to do it i do not know let 's look about maybe there be a chimney or something there be no opening larger than that one where the stove pipe go through i have notice that already respond roy phew this _ be _ a fix for fair i should say so but kick about it will not help we at all let 's make a thorough investigation in the darkness they grope about but could discover nothing that appear to hold out a promise of escape the two boy shake the door violently but it be firm on its hinge next roy propose to cut a way through it with he pocket knife we would be starve to death by the time you cut through that stuff declare jimsy in proof of this he kick the door and the result sound show that it be build of solid wood without any thin panel which might be cut through what next peggy ask the question as the two perspire lad stand perplexed without speak or move jigger if i know speak jimsy can not you or roy think of anything we might try to batter the door down with that table suggest roy it be worth try we have get to get out of here somehow the two boy pick up the heavy roughly make table and commence a violent assault on the door but although they dent it heavily and send some splinter fly the portal hold its own at length they desist from pure weariness the situation look hopeless it look pretty bad speak jimsy it do indeed agree roy peggy i wish we have not bring you along and why pray roy prescott oh because -- because well this be not the sort of thing for a girl well i guess if my brother can stand it i can rejoin the girl pluckily and in a firm voice well there be no use minimize the fix we be in declare roy this be a lonesome bit of country it may be a week before anyone will come around we have just get to get out that be all there be to it i wish you would solve the problem then sigh jimsy it be too much for I i 'll make another search of the premise maybe we can stumble across something that may aid we at any rate it will give we something to do and keep we mind off the predicament we be in roy strike a match of which he have a plentiful supply in he pocket as the yellow flame sputter up in the semi-gloom it show every corner of the small hut but it do not reveal anything that promise a chance to gain they liberty all at once just as the light be sputter out peggy give a cry she eye have be catch by a glistening metal object in one corner of the hut what be it ask roy a gun -- a shot-gun standing in that corner over there huh sniff jimsy a lot of good that do we on the contrary declare peggy stoutly if it be load it may serve to get we free i be from missourus declare jimsy enigmatically what be you idea si ask roy who know that peggy 's idea be usually worth follow up i remember read only a short time ago of a man trap much as we be who escape by blow off the lock of he prison with a gun he carry reply peggy maybe it would work in we case maybe it would if -- rejoin roy if what if the gun be load which be most unlikely well try it and see urge peggy yes do echo jimsy peggy 's plan sound like a good idea maybe some hunter leave it here and the shell be still in it no harm in find out anyway declare roy he strike another match and pick up the gun it be a antique look weapon badly-rusted but on open the breech he utter a cry of joy good luck he exclaim two shell -- one in each barrel well put it to the test urge jimsy all right if this fail though i do not know what we 'll do do not worry about that now try it i be go to do not get peevish roy cross the room to the door raise the gun to he shoulder he place the muzzle about opposite to where he think the padlock must be located look out for a big noise si he warn peggy give a little scream and raise she hand to she ear she dislike firearm ready sing out jimsy all ready come the reply then fire simultaneously with jimsy 's order come a deafening report in that confine space it sound as if a huge cannon have be fire roy stagger back under the kick of the heavy charge once more he announce again a sonorous report sound but this time a section of the door be blow right out of the framework the daylight stream in through it now then for the test cry roy come on jimsy the two boy place they shoulder to the door with a suddenness that be startling it burst open and they face freedom the lock have be fairly drive from its hold by the twice repeat charge of shot the young aviator be free once more but it remain to be see if the man who wish they harm have work they vengeance on the _ golden butterfly _ chapter xiv what be to be do with the wren the _ golden butterfly _ as a examination prove have not be damage during they imprisonment in the hut evidently the man who have slam the door and padlock it have make off at top speed as soon as they have complete what they hope would be a source of sore trouble to the young aviator and now we 'll fly back as agree declare peggy merrily she spirit almost down to zero in the hut have recover themselves marvellously in the fresh open air she be radiant i declare that the stay in the hut have do you good declare jimsy look at she admiringly maybe it have -- by contrast return peggy like a sea trip put in roy i have hear that people who suffer from sea sickness be so much relieve when they get ashore that they imagine they good spirit be due to a change in they condition well that apply to I return peggy i do not think we would get out of that hut so easily how do you suppose that gun come to be there the hunter who use the hut must have leave it there rejoin roy i wonder if they 'll ever know how useful it be to we more likely they 'll be mad when they find that the lock be blow off the door laugh jimsy well so-long folk i be go to start back in

arise the sheep man wave he hat and shout he adieus millbrook be reach that evening just at dusk it prove to be a fair-sized town and the aëroplanes excite as much curiosity there as they have in meadville -- more so in fact for from some flare poster it appear that a aëroplane exhibition and race have be arrange for the next day by a travel company of aviator that evening at the hotel a deputation of citizen wait on the boy and ask they if they would not prolong they stay and take part in the air sport the mayor whose name be jasper hanks mention a prize of five hundred dollar for a

try to do we some harm as he say he main profit come from win the prize offer by the different community humph well so far as that go i do not see why that need keep we out of it nor i but we have have trouble enough and i do not want willingly to run into any more nor i well let 's sleep on it we 'll decide in the morning that be a good idea the two lad go up to bed and sleep as only healthy lad can the next morning dawn bright and clear there be hardly any wind it be real fly weather the aëroplanes have be sheltered in a big shed belong to the hotel before breakfast the boy go out and look they over all be in good shape as they be come out of the shed they be hail by no less a personage than mayor hank well say he be you go to fly we think of do so say roy hesitate a little he want to speak of the conduct of lish kelly but on second thought he decide not to the man might merely have have a fit of bad temper on he he threat might have be only empty one if you be go to fly i have get some entry blank with I say the mayor i wish you would sign 'em he draw out a bunch of blue papers with blank for describe the name of the machine its power driver and other detail this decide the boy all right we 'll enter all we machine say roy let we go into the write room and we 'll sign the entry blank good for you cry the mayor delightedly you 'll be a big drawing card especially the young lady i never hear of gal flyin ' although come to think of it why should not they in the write room they conclude the business when it be do all the machine have be enter in every contest include a altitude one we start at ten sharp so be there admonish the mayor as he depart highly please at have secure quite a flock of young aviator at no cost at all it be as he figure vanish that lish kelly cross the write room he have be sit in a telephone booth and leave the door a crack open have hear every word that have pass he greet the boy with a angry scowl so you be not go to stay out he say gruffly as he pass all right look out for squall chapter xvii the twisted spark plug gracious be we in for more trouble jimsy look blankly at roy but the latter only laugh at he chum 's serious face somehow view in the bright light of early day lish kelly 's threat do not appear nearly as formidable as they have over night nonsense what harm can he do we anyhow we be go to go into this race and we be go to win too just watch we go to tell the girl anything about kelly and he remark no what good would that do it would only scare they that be so too but just the same i do not like the look of kelly 's face when he come through he look to I like a bulldog that have swallow a baby 's boot and do not like the taste of the black on it laugh roy at this juncture the girl come into the room all be radiant and smile in anticipation of the day 's sport well we have be and go and do it announce roy do what demand peggy sign the paperrr-r-r-s be the rejoinder render with great dramatic effect he wave the duplicate entry blank above he head let 's see they begged jess all right look what i have let we in for why -- why -- good gracious roy you have get we down for everything gasp peggy that be right all the way across from soup to nut strike in the slangy jimsy they all laugh the color rise in the girl ' face if only we can win some of they cry jess well the machine be all in fine shape if we do not win it will be because the other fellow have better machine where be the aviation grounds inquire bess at the city park about a mile out of town to the south we can get to it by look down at the trolley track say roy who have consult the mayor on this point then you be go to fly out there ask miss prescott who be also by this time a party to the conference of course and by the way we ought to be get out there pretty soon i want to be look over the grounds and select the best place for landing and so on say roy well please do not get into any more scrape sigh miss prescott what with gipsy firebug and ram we trip have be quite exciting enough for I the boy exchange glance if the man kelly try to carry out he threat thing might be more exciting yet they think but both keep they knowledge to themselves it be arrange that miss prescott should motor out to the city park soon thereafter the young aviator place finish touch on they machine and while a curious crowd gather they take to the air look just like a flock of pigeon say a man in the crowd as they climb skyward quite closely bunch it sure do agree he companion but they thing be prettier than any flock of pigeon i ever see and this opinion be echo by many of the throng at any rate everyone who see the aëroplanes start make up he or she mind to pay a visit to the park and see some more extended flight so that mayor hank ' prediction be verify as the young aviator hover above city park for a short space of time and then drop earthward a veritable sensation be create from a row of hangar mechanician and aviator come run one or two aviator who be aloft practice stunt drop swiftly to earth lish kelly 's troupe be a large one consist of five man and one woman flyer the wife of carlo le roy a cuban aviator outside the grounds several of the frugal individual who desire to see the flight without pay admission also watch as the quintette of strange aëroplanes drop to earth one by one the graceful craft of the air settle to the ground and the young aviator alight member of the arrangement committee hasten to they side shake hand warmly and thank they for they interest in the come contest the kelly aviator gaze curiously some of they resentfully at the newcomer they have all the professional 's antipathy and jealousy of amateur performer as the arrangement committee bustle off after tell we friend to make themselves perfectly at home pepita le roy come up to they she be a handsome woman in a foreign way with large dark eye and a abundance of raven black hair she be rather flashily dress and walk with a sort of swagger that in a vague way remind peggy of carman so you be zee girl aviator she remark as she come up yes i guess that be what they call we rejoin peggy we enjoy fly and have do a lot of it so i have read you name in zee papers oh those awful papers cry jess who hate publicity they be always print thing about we what you do not like it oh no you see we only fly for fun not as a business and -- peggy stop short she feel she have commit a grave breach of tactfulness it be not the thing she feel to boast to a professional woman flyer of they standing as amateur nor be the cuban woman slow to take umbrage at what she consider a insult she eye flash indignantly as she regard the fair-haired slender girl before she so you fly only for fun she say vehemently very well you have all zee fun you want before to-day be ovaire without another word she walk off with the swing walk of she race the girl look at each other with a sort of amuse dismay goodness peggy you should be more careful cry bess you have hurt she feeling dreadfully i be sure i do not mean to declare peggy remorsefully i -- i have no idea that she would flare up like that well after all it do not matter much soothed jess pour oil on the troubled water so to speak i be glad the boy do not hear it though so be i see they be busy on roy 's machine exclaim bess yes the lower left wing be rather warped explain peggy they be fix it wonder who that man be who be monkey with the _ red dragon _ say peggy the next instant i mean that horrid look man in the check suit i do not know see he have a monkey wrench in he hand too exclaimed bess almost simultaneously the boy look round from they work on the biplane and see the man it be lish kelly he be bend over the engine and do something to it with he wrench hey what be you do there yell roy just look at you machine no harm in that be there demand kelly with a red face none at all except that we do not want we machine touch how come it you have that monkey wrench in you hand if you be not tamper with the machinery jimsy speak in a voice that fairly bubble over with indignation do not get sore kid i would not harm you old mowing machine there be not one of mine but could beat it the fastest day it ever fly as he speak kelly slouch off they see he go up to a group of he aviator and begin talk earnestly to they once or twice he motion with he head in they direction so he _ do _ mean mischief after all say roy let 's take a good look at the _ dragon 's _ engine he may have injure it although i do not think he would have have time to hurt it seriously they stroll over to the _ dragon _ with the girl trail behind oh cry peggy as they come up look at that spark plug what be the matter with it demand jimsy look it be all bent and twist out of shape jove si so it be you eye be as sharp as they be pretty cried roy no compliment please oh that horrid man who be he ask jess you appear to know he yes we have some conversation with he this morning laugh roy but to return to the spark plug it be a good thing we carry extra one but we do not cry jimsy in a dismayed tone what you have a supply in a locker on you machine jimsy look confused i have get to make a confession he say you do not bring they cry peggy no the fact be i -- i forget jimsy look miserably from one to the other here be a quandary indeed it might prove hard to get such a commodity as a spark plug in millbrook chapter xviii in search of a new plug it be while they be still discuss the situation that the automobile with jake at the wheel and miss prescott and the wren in the tonneau drive into the grounds what a difference there be in the child since she benefactor have fit she out she look like a dainty ethereal little princess instead of the ragged little waif that have be rescue from the gipsy camp but the mind of we young friend be now intent on different matter time press the altitude flight in which jimsy have plan to take part be to be the first thing on the program if anything be to be do about reequipp the _ dragon _ it must be do quickly tell you what say roy suddenly we 'll get into the car and drive back to town it will not take long and maybe we can dig up a extra one some place if we do not i be out of it for keep groan jimsy oh that kelly i would like to punch he head he double up he fist aggressively but after all what chance have he to prove that kelly have actually damage the plug if confront the man would have probably deny all knowledge of it nobody have actually see he do it so that positive proof be out of the question no they must repair the damage as best they could but roy determine to have the machine closely guard the situation be explain to miss prescott and while she and she small protégé take seat in the grand stand jake be detail to guard the aëroplanes this do the boy get into the machine and prepare to start for town but the girl interfere be not you go to take we along you impolite youth cry bess oh certainly you company be always charming return jimsy with a low bow of course it be but you would not have ask we to come if we have not invite ourselves declare peggy vehemently how can you say so we life would be a dry desert without the girl aviator to liven thing up declare jimsy jimsy bancroft if you be go to get poetical you 'll leave this car cry jess that be just it declare jimsy girl can cry they eye out over romantic hero but when a regular fellow start to get ` mushy ' they go up in the air amidst the chorus of protestation arouse by this ungallant speech roy start the car swiftly it speed out of the grounds but not so swiftly that the keen eye of lish kelly do not see it he call herman le roy the cuban aviator to he le roy you be not in the altitude contest he say hop in my car with I and we 'll follow those kid they be up to something the cuban look at he and smile show two row of white tooth under he small dapperly curl mustache i think señor kelly you have be up to something yourself well you know what i tell you we want that five-hundred-dollar prize carlo and by the look of thing if we do not do something those kid be likely to get it they have fine machine agree the other yes and they be equip with a balancing device that make they much more reliable than ours a balancing device exclaim the cuban as the two man get into the car a small yellow runabout of racy appearance that be what i say and it be a good one too i read a account of it in a aviation paper but the description be too sketchy for I to see how the thing be work those boy must be wonder i be afraid they be that be why we have get to be careful of they but i have get a plan to fix they the whole lot of they what be it i 'll tell you as we go along as the car roll past the group of aëroplanes with jake faithfully stand guard over they kelly hail he in a suave voice any idea where the young folk have go jake who have no idea that kelly have a sinister motive in ask the question reply readily enough yes they have go into millbrook to get another spark plug something happen to one of the plug of that red machine yonder all right thanks kelly drive on do you know what happen to that plug carlo he ask as they reach the open road and bowl forward at a good speed i have get a pretty good guess it be not altogether a accident eh a accident well it be in a sense i happen to be near that machine with a monkey wrench and in some way be careless enough to let it put that plug out of business both man laugh heartily as if kelly 's rascally act have be the most amusing thing in the world you be a genius declare le roy well i reckon i know a thing or two be the modest response besides i need that money but what be you plan i 'll tell you as we go along drive fast but do not keep so close to that other car that they can get sight of we not much fear of that they have a long start of we and be out of sight now so much the better it do not interfere with my plan a bit provide they take the same road back what do you mean to do be you good with a shovel be the cryptic reply i do not understand you i must say you will later on we 'll drive up to that farmhouse yonder yes and what then we 'll borrow two shovel two shovel that be what i say but what on earth have two shovel to do with stop a bunch of kid from enter in a aëroplane race carlo you brain be dull to-day it would take a wizard to understand what you intend to do well you will see later on drive in this gate that be it and now for the shovel chapter xix the trap for more than half a hour eager inquiry be make in millbrook for a spark plug such as they want but all they search be to no avail but suddenly just as they be about to give up in despair a man of whom they have make inquiry recall that not far out of town there be a small garage we 'll try there determine jimsy find out the road they speed to the place it do not look very promise a small badly fit up auto station run by a elderly man with red-rimmed watery eye look out from behind a pair of horn spectacles that somehow give he the odd look of a frog get any spark plug ask jimsy as the machine come to a halt yes all kind say the man in a wheezy asthmatic voice that sound like the exhaust of a dying-down engine good cry jimsy hop out of the car that be we will have all kind next week go on the man i have order 'em goodness then you have not any right now i have get a few possibly you might find what you want among they i 'll try anyway declare jimsy the man lead the way into a dingy sort of shed on a shelf in a dusty corner be a box you can hunt through that say the man wearily if you find what you want wake I up wake you up yes i always take a sleep at this time of day you wake I up when you come in now i be go to doze off again so say he sink into a chair close he eye and presently be snore dead to the world gasp jimsy well that be the quickest thing in the sleep line i ever see as it be no use to waste further time the boy begin rummage in the box it contain all sort of odds and end among they several plug i 'll bet there be not one here that will fit my engine grumble jimsy i do not -- what yes by jiminy eureka hurray i have find one the man wake up with a start what be the matter he demand drowsily nothing that be everything cry jimsy i have find just what i want all right leave the money on that shelf there it be a dollar so say off he go to sleep again while jimsy overjoyed hastily peel a dollar from he roll and depart the last sound he hear be the steady snore of the garage man well there be one fellow that money can not keep awake even if it do talk say jimsy laughingly to himself as with a cry of triumph he rejoin the party wave the plug like a banner or a emblem of victory no time be lose in start the auto up again and they whirl back through millbrook in a cloud of dust pass through the village they retrace they way along the road by which they have come just half a hour before that altitude flight remark jimsy to roy who be drive as they speed through the town fine we 'll make it all right be the rejoinder roy turn on more power and the auto shot ahead like some scared wild thing we 'll only hit the high spot this trip declare roy as the machine plunge and roll along at top speed all at once as they turn a corner they receive a sudden check right ahead of they a man be drive some cow roy jam down the emergency brake cause they all to hold on for dear life to avoid be pitch out by the sudden change of speed wow what a jolt exclaim jimsy it sure do -- the sentence be never complete the auto give a pitch sideways and then plunge into a pit that have be dig across the road and cover with leaf and dust place on a framework of branch down into this pit crash the machine with a sickening jolt the girl scream aloud in fear it appear as if the machine would be a total wreck but that be not the worst of it in the sudden fall into the pit roy have be pitch out and now lay quite still at the roadside jimsy have save himself from be throw by clutch tight hold of the seat he stop the engine and then clamber out of the car hasten to roy 's side to he delight just as he reach he roy sit up and although he face be draw with pain he declare that he injury consist of nothing more serious than a sprain ankle but look at the machine cry jimsy it be smash i be sure of it the pit which have be dig across the road be about three foot deep and the front wheel of the auto rest in it the hind wheel have not enter as the excavation be not a wide one both boy hasten to examine the car to they satisfaction they find that not much damage have be do beyond a slight wrenching of the steering gear this be due to the fact that they have be go at reduce speed gracious suppose we have be come along at the same pace we have be hit up right along exclaimed jimsy we would not be here now declare roy we would be in the next county or thereabout yes we would have keep right on go agree jimsy talk about fly but say who can have do this not much doubt in my mind it be the work of that outfit of kelly 's he tell we to look out for trouble and he appear to be make it for we the precious rascal he might have break all we neck that be true if we would be hit up high speed how be we go to get out of this peggy ask the question just as the man who have be drive the cattle come run up what be the trouble he ask gaze at the odd scene you can see for yourself rejoin roy some rascal dig a trench across the road so as to wreck we machine if possible humph so i see be the rejoinder how be you goin ' ter git out of thar that be a problem if we could get a team of horse -- the man interrupted roy who be act as spokesman tell you what two of my cattle back thar be plow oxen i 'll go back to ther farm git they yoke on 'em and yank you out of here that be pervidin ' you pay I uv course do not worry about that we be willing to pay anything in reason all right then i 'll hook up jeb and jewel the man walk back toward he cattle which be contentedly browse at the side of the road cluck in a odd manner he drive two of they out of the herd and start back toward a farmhouse which be not far distant in a wonderfully short time he be back with he ox in harness gee jeb haw jewel he cry as he come up the ox swing round and the heavy chain attach to they yoke be hitch to the front axle of the car now for it cry roy when this have be do git ap shout the man the slow but powerful ox strain they muscular back the chain tighten and the next moment the car from which peggy and jess and bess have alight rise from the pit then the hind wheel drop into it with a bump but the shock absorber prevent serious damage with the ox strain and pull it be finally haul into the road and they be ready to resume the trip roy reward they helper with a substantial bill and they be all warm in they thanks 'twa not nuthin ' declare the man a ' now i guess i 'll go to ther house and have my hire man fill in this road thing be come to a fine pass when such thing kin happen as the rescue party speed on toward the aviation field they fully agree with the rustic 's opinion have it not be for sheer luck they would have suffer extremely serious consequence as the result of a rascal 's device but as it be kelly 's plot against they appear to have fail chapter xx a attack in the air b-o-o-m the sound of a gun crash out as the auto speed through the gate of the aviation field and rapidly skim across to where the aëroplanes have be park just in time cry peggy that be the five-minute warning gun by this time the grandstand be well fill and a band be play lively air at the start line three of the kelly aëroplanes be gather ready for the signal for the start of the altitude flight the instant the car come to a standstill jimsy be out and in a jiffy have the new spark plug adjust there be no time to test it but he feel pretty confident that it would work all right all ready shout the official in charge of the start arrangement ready rejoin jimsy heartily as he adjust he leather helmet and jake and roy start the engine kelly whose back have be turn while he talk to some of he troup face round at the sound of the boy 's voice what you here he choke out he face purple yes do you know any reason why i should not be ask jimsy with mean emphasis under the lad 's direct gaze kelly 's eye fall he could not face the lad but turn away there if that be not proof of he guilt i would like to know what be declare jimsy to roy but the rascal cover up he track so cleverly that we can not prove anything on he mutter roy disgustedly at the same instant the start bomb boom out the crowd yell and the drummer of the band pound he instrument furiously above the uproar sound the sharp crackerlike report of the motor as more power be apply they roar like battery of gatle gun into the air shot one of they a black biplane it be follow by the other two monoplane and a triplane jimsy ascend last but as this be not a race but a cloud-climbing contest he be in no hurry he be anxious to see what the other air craft could do up they climb ascend the aërial stairway while the crowd below stare up at the risk of stiff neck in the immediate future jimsy choose spiral as he method of rise but the other go upward in curious zigzag this be because they machine be not equip with the stability device and they could not attempt the same tactic before long jimsy be high above the other from below he appear a mere dot in the blue but still he fly on once he glance at he barograph it show he have ascend 5000 foot it be higher than the boy have ever be before but he keep perseveringly on it be cold up there in the region of the upper air and jimsy find himself wish he have put on a sweater it be too long a drop to go down and get one he remark to himself with grim humor beneath he he could see the other aëroplanes but the black one be the only one that appear to be a serious rival the rest do not seem to be try very hard to reach a superlative height the black machine however be steadily rise after a while jimsy could see the face of its occupant it be the cuban le roy now what be he try to do i wonder think jimsy as the black biplane rise to the same level as himself and appear to be go through some odd maneuvering that be mighty funny muse the boy watch he rival i can not make out what he be up to indeed the black biplane be behave queerly now it would swoop toward jimsy and then would dart only to return suddenly it come drive straight at he it be then that jimsy suddenly realize what he rival be try to do to use a slangy but expressive phrase le roy the veteran aviator be try to rattle the boy so that be he game be it think jimsy well i 'll give he a surprise manipulate he spark and gas lever the boy give he graceful red craft full power the dragon shot sharply upward cross le roy 's machine about twenty foot above its upper plane jimsy laugh aloud at the astonished expression on the man 's face as he skim above he i reckon he 'll think that i do know something about drive a aëroplane after all he chuckle as he rise till he barograph record 6000 foot beneath he he could see le roy start to descend something appear to be wrong with the black biplane 's motor it act sluggishly well as he be go down i guess i will too say jimsy to himself 6000 foot be by no mean a record but it be high enough for I suddenly he be plunge into what appear to be a wet and chilly fog in reality it be a cloud that have drift in on he it grow suddenly cold with a almost frosty chill the moisture of the cloud drench he to the skin the lad shiver and he tooth chatter but he keep pluckily to he task before long he emerge into the sunlight once more the crowd which have thrill when the young aviator vanish into the vapor set up a yell when he reappear but at the height he be jimsy of course do not hear it but as he drop lower the shout and cheer become plainly audible the lad wave he hand in acknowledgment then as he near the ground he put he machine through a series of graceful evolution that set the crowd wild the altitude flight be win by number four announce the official after they have examine the barograph with a height of 6000 foot number four be mr jame bancroft gee that sound real dignified laugh jimsy it be a treat to be treat with become dignity once in a while the next flight be a race six time round the course this be win by one of the kelly flyer then come a endurance contest which roy capture handily and some exhibition fly in which bess do some clever work and be delighted to find herself a winner it be soon after this that the gun be fire as a note of warn that the big race be about to begin peggy 's _ golden butterfly _ and roy 's entry the _ red dragon _ borrow for this race because the biplane be too heavy and clumsy for such fast work be wheel to the start line already three of kelly 's machine be there among they be that of señora le roy or as she be bill the cuban skylark the only woman flyer in the world it appear now that she have small claim to the title the crowd set up a cheer for she as she take she seat in a neat-looking monoplane of the bleriot type but when peggy 's dapper figure smartly attire in she aviation costume appear a still louder shout go up kelly scowl blackly he step up to he flyer you have get to win this race or get fire he snarl chapter xxi peggy 's splendid race they be off hurrah there they go these and hundred of other cry and exclamation follow the report of the start gun the cuban woman flyer be off first then come two other of the professional flyer while roy and peggy get away last the race be to be sixty mile out to a small body of water call lake loon and return a trolley line run past the aviation grounds and out to the lake for the guidance of the flyer a car with a huge american flag fly from it blaze a trail below they as it be roy 's craft gain a slight lead on the _ golden butterfly _ and two of the kelly flyer be soon pass by both the boy and he sister but the professional woman flyer still maintain she lead second come another of lish kelly 's aviator in a blue machine this be ben speedwell who enjoy quite a reputation as a skillful and daring air driver the flyer have all strike a level about 1500 foot in the air there be a light head wind but not enough to deter any of the powerfully engine craft glance back for a instant roy see one of the contest aviator drop to earth he companion soon follow overheate engine probably think the boy i must be careful the same thing do not happen to I go at this pace suddenly another aëroplane loom up beside he it be the _ golden butterfly _ good for you sis cry roy as peggy wave she hand roar past in another minute she have shoot past speedwell but the leader the woman flyer be still some distance ahead and appear to steadily maintain the lead she have at last lake loon come into view it be a more or less shallow body of water with a small island in the middle of it as they near it speedwell and roy be fly almost abreast with speedwell just a shade in the lead suddenly speedwell make a spurt and shot ahead of the _ dragon _ at a distance of half a mile from roy who be now last speedwell be above the lake peggy and the woman flyer have already turn and be on they way back with the latter still in the lead roy be watch speedwell intently he see the man bank he machine to take the curve in order to round the lake a appalling climax follow he be turn too sharp he 'll never make it exclaim roy hold he breath the aëroplane sway madly then begin a fierce fight on speedwell 's part to settle it on a even keel but skillful as he be he could not master the overbalanced machine he be lose breathe roy every nerve athrill and then the next minute : cracky he be get it no he be fall again -- ah there be a note of horror in the exclamation the aëroplane in front of roy dive wildly then fairly somersault the strain be too great a wing part it be the end of he exclaim roy in a whisper down shot the broken aëroplane with the velocity of lightning it just dodge the tree on the little island and then it plunge into the lake first spilling speedwell out then down on top of he come the smother of canvas wood and wire he 'll be suffocate if i do not go to he rescue murmur roy it will put I out of the race but i must save he there be a clear spot on the island and toward this the boy dive in the meantime man be put out from shore in a small boat but the boy know that they could not reach the unfortunate speedwell in time to save he life roy make a clever landing on the island and then lose no time in wade out to the half float half submerge wreckage in the midst of it lay speedwell roy drag he ashore the man 's face be purple he limb limp and lifeless and he choke gaspingly another minute in the water would have be he last as roy realize he do what he could for the man roll he on he face to get out the water he have swallow by this time the boat from the shore land on the island the two man get out be he alive they ask of roy yes and he 'll get better too i guess lucky he fall in the water no limb be break well you be a pretty decent sort of fellow to get out of the race to help a injured man say one of the man well i 'll leave he to you now rejoin roy be there a hospital near here there be one ` bout a mile away we can phone for a ambulance good well good-bye with a whirr and a buzz the boy be go and speedily become a speck in the sky in the meantime the aviation field be in a uproar dash toward it have come the two lead aëroplanes from dot in the sky no bigger than shoe button they speedily become manifest as two aëroplanes aquiver with speed blue smoke pour from they exhaust evidently the two aviator be strain they craft to the utmost it be that cuban woman and the young girl flyer yell a man who have a pair of field glass the uproar redouble the two aëroplanes be almost side by side as they rush onward which would win the $ 500 race it be a struggle that have begin some mile back after leave the lake peggy who have hold some speed in reserve while she opponent have key she machine to its top pitch have gradually gain on she but still there be a gap between the two aëroplanes on the return trip no car blaze the way the speed be too great for that for this reason smudge or smoky fire have be light to guide the flyer at a place where it be necessary to make a slight turn peggy make the gain that bring she almost alongside she competitor in make the turn the monoplane fly by the cuban aviatrix could not negotiate it at as sharp a angle as peggy 's machine owe to its not be equip with a equalize or stability device now it be that peggy tension up the _ golden butterfly _ to its full power the engine fairly roar as the propeller blur round the whole fabric tremble under the strain it seem as if nothing make by man could stand the pressure but the _ golden butterfly _ have be build by one of the foremost young aviator in the country and it be sound and true in every part peggy feel no fear of anything give out under the strain and now the aviation park appear in the distance peggy head straight for it hope devoutly that she motor would not heat up and jam under the terrific speed it be be force to the cuban woman glance round anxiously it be a bad move for she like a flash the _ golden butterfly _ shoot by the other machine as the latter wobble badly peggy 's delight be mix with apprehension the motor be begin to smoke plainly it be heat up will it last five minute longer that be the think in peggy 's mind the _ golden butterfly _ be hardly a airship any longer it be a thunderbolt -- a fly arrow before peggy 's eye there be nothing now but the tall red and white pylon that mark the win post could she make it ahead of she rival close behind she she could hear the roar of the other motor but she do not dare to look round for fear of lose ground swiftly she mentally select the spot where she would land and then down shot the _ golden butterfly _ like a pounce fish hawk the speed of the descent fairly take peggy 's breath away she cap have come off and she golden hair stream out in the breeze wildly there be a blur of fly tree then come the grandstand a mere smudge of color a sea of dimly see face and a roar that be like that of a hundred waterfall down shot the _ golden butterfly _ just inside the pylon it run for about a hundred yard and be then bring to a stop peggy prescott have win the great race chapter xxii peggy 's generosity oh peggy it be the proudest moment of my life cry jimsy as a shout excited crowd surround the aëroplane in which peggy still sit feeling daze and a little dizzy oh you wonderful girl cry out bess half laughing and half cry gracious what a exciting finish i think i would go wild when it look as if you be not go to win they help she from the aëroplane while policeman push the crowd back somebody bring a tray with steam hot tea and cracker on it but peggy could not eat she feel faint and dreamy brace up urge jimsy i 'll be all right in a minute it be the strain of those last few minute i never think i would win and i never doubt it declare jess stoutly i wonder where roy be ask peggy anxiously as they enter a box in the grandstand where they could be secluded from the shove curious stare crowd do not know but he be all right depend upon it say jimsy cheerfully hello what be that come now it be a homing aëroplane then a minute later : it be roy look at he come i do not think the _ red dragon _ could go as fast roy it be sure enough he be come at a pace that might have land he as winner of the race if he have not be delay by he errand of mercy ten minute later he have join they first he explain what have happen to the judge of the course kelly crest-fallen and wretched-looking thank he half heartedly for what he have do and say that he would care for speedwell till he get better which by the way be a promise that he do not perform a sudden stir in the crowd cause the little party in the box to look up a man be hastily chalk up some legend on the big black bulletin board it run thus : long-distance race for $ 500 prize start of flight -- 11:01:2 finish of flight -- 12:02:0 maximum height -- 1500 foot wind velocity -- 10 mile from southeast winner -- _ golden butterfly _ win aviator -- miss margaret prescott what a cheer go up then it seem as if the roof would be raise off the grandstand by it it be like a dream sigh peggy just like a dream now do not get fainty peggy or miss margaret prescott admonish jess as jimsy say ` brace up ' the best be yet to come a man come up to where they be sit in he hand he have a slip of pink paper roy reach out for it but the man say that he have instruction to hand it only to peggy it be the check for the prize-winning money he explain peggy take it and sit gaze at it for a minute oh peggy what be you go to do with it ask bess buy some dress or hat or -- none of those thing say peggy i make up my mind before i go into the race as to what i would do with the money if i win and what be that ask miss prescott why it must go toward the wren 's education rejoin the girl oh peggy you darling cry jess fling she arm round she chum in full view of the grandstand and the crowd below as for the wren she gaze up at the girl with wide-open brown eye you be too good to I -- too good she say simply but there be a plaintive quiver in she voice mr jame parker sit on the porch of he home in the foothill of the big smoky gaze out over the landscape seemingly he be watch for something he do watch de sky lak he ` spected de bottom drap clean out uv it pretty soon say uncle jupe he factotum to he wife mandy ` gwan you fool nigger don ' you know dat dem fly

we to fly he would have give we wing i guess yes sir he would sure have give we wing des de same as angel hev he repeat musingly chapter xxiii the moonshiner and the aëroplane this be a beautiful country si yes indeed agree peggy warmly the two be fly high above the romantic scenery of the big smoke mountain of north carolina in the _ golden butterfly _ beneath they lay a wild-looking expanse of country -- peak deep cañons and cliff heavily wood and here and there bare patch crop out let 's drop down on one of those patch and do some explore suggest peggy all right agree roy nothing loath the _ golden butterfly _ be head downward in a few minute they land on a smooth spot surround by tree leave the aëroplane they strike off on a path through the wood wonder if we can not find some huckleberry hereabouts suggest roy oh yes lot would not it be dandy to take home a bucketful by aëroplane there be a little hut off yonder maybe we could get a bucket or something there let 's see if there be any berry first say the practical peggy from out of the hut shuffle a old woman she be a wrinkled and hideous old hag brown as a seasoned meerschaum pipe and in she mouth be a reek corn cob she foot be bare and altogether she be a most repulsive old crone she see roy and peggy almost as soon as they see she for a instant she stand look at they and then raise she voice in a sort of shrill shriek instantly from the wood around several man appear -- wild-looking bearded fellow each of whom carry a rifle what you all want hyar demand one who seem to be the leader we be just take a walk explain roy wa'al we all do not like stranger particlar so it would seem rejoin roy with a bold voice although he heart be beat rather fast how would you all get hyar be the next question from the inquisitor we fly here rejoin roy truthfully but the man 's face grow black with wrath don ' you all lie to I it be not healthy he say i be not in the habit of do so but you say you fly hyar well we do see hyar young stranger you je ' tell I the truth ` bout how you come or by the eternal i 'll make it hot fer you i can only show you that i be speak nothing but the truth rejoin the boy if you 'll come with I i 'll show you what we fly here in the man glance at he suspiciously it be plain that he fear a trap of some sort he eye be wild and shifty as a wolf 's be not you frum the guv-ment he ask i do not know just what you mean i reckin that be jus ' more dum ' lyin ' thank you don ' get sassy young feller it will not do you no good but i 'll come with you come on boy we 'll take a look at this flyin ' thing i reckon that even if it be a trap there be enough of we to take care of a pack of they that be right jeb agree the man some of they who have be hang back in the bush now come forward they be all as wild-looking as they leader jeb the old woman mumble and talk to herself as they stride off behind roy and peggy it be one of the strangest adventure of they life and neither one of they could hit on any explanation of the hillman 's conduct it do not take long to reach the aëroplane and roy turn triumphantly to jeb well he say what do you think now wa'al it be not flyin ' be it of course not but i can make it you kin certainly flap its wing and all that like a burd no it do not flap its wing then how kin it fly propounded jeb a murmur of approval run through the throng jeb 's logic appeal to they primitive intellect nothing can not fly that do not flap its wing say one of they but if it do not fly how in tarnation do it git here ask a old man with a grizzled beard and blacken stump of tooth project from shrunken gum this appear to be a poser for even jeb he have nothing to say if you like i 'll give you a ride in it proffer roy to jeb all right only no monkey trick now what do you mean wa'al in course i know it will not fly but if it do you 'll hev to let I out with this sage remark jeb step gingerly into the chassis of the aëroplane he sit down where he be tell and roy take the wheel jeb 's companion gaze on in awed silence look out jeb cry one do not hit the sky yell another bring I back a star howl the facetious old man I a bit of the moon call another jeb say nothing to this raillery instead he look uneasily about he and hold he rifle which he have insist on bring with he between he knee all right ask roy look back at he as right as i ever will be rejoin jeb with a rather sickly grin you must hold tight warn peggy i be do that say jeb and then with the same sickly grin : say miss do it really fly of course it do as that old man say how could it have get here if it do not i guess i would better go home and git my coat say jeb try to climb out he demeanor have completely change since he have climb into the chassis something in its well-cushioned seat and the sight of the powerful engine and propeller seem to have change he mind about the capability of the _ golden butterfly _ but it be too late with a roar the engine start instantly the little plateau be desert the mountaineer be all behind tree jeb rush for the side of the car sit down screech peggy really fear he would fall over but if jeb 's intention have be to climb out it be foiled -lrb- illustration : take I back to earth er i 'll shoot say a voice in he ear -rrb- wow he yell and again wow-ow-ow lemme out too late now shout roy the aëroplane shot upward carry as a passenger a man temporarily crazy from fright suddenly roy feel the muzzle of a rifle press against the back of he neck take I back to earth er i 'll shoot say a voice in he ear roy obey and so end jeb 's first aëroplane ride it may be add that it be also he last chapter xxiv mr parker 's story it be a gang of moonshiner that you stumble across say mr parker when they tell he of they adventure you be fortunate to escape as you do i guess we have that aëroplane ride we give to jeb to thank for that laugh roy it be not so laughable though when he press that rifle to you neck declare peggy no indeed that be a mighty uncomfortable feeling i can tell you it remind I of a experience i have with moonshiner once say mr parker would you care to hear about it of course they would they be sit on the porch in the twilight after dinner it be a happy group and they have be explode with laughter over roy 's account of jeb 's ride it be a good many year ago when i be in the employ of the government say mr parker that what i be go to tell you about happen i be a young fellow then and a good bit of a dare-devil so i be send at the head of a body of man to rout out moonshiner as you may know from you experience this morning it be mighty dangerous to be suspect of be in the employ of the government and so we pose as drummer and peddler scatter through the mountain each of we work alone so as not to attract attention we job be merely to locate the illicit still and then militia would be send to raid and destroy they and the vile stuff they concoct i have be on the job about a week when i come one night to a desolate-looking little shack on a high mountainside it do not look invite but i have to have shelter for the night so i step to the door and knock a rather comely look woman reply to my summons ` i be a peddler ' i explain ` could i get something to eat and a room here for the night ' she look at I twice before answer ` what you tradin ' in ' she ask with a trace of suspicion i judge from she manner that there be a illicit still in the neighborhood and that be what make she so suspicious ` oh lace ribbon and so forth ' i reply i show she some sample i 'll give you breakfast supper and a bed fer that bit of red ribbon ' she say ` i 'll throw in this bit of blue ' say i gallantly and so the bargain be strike it be a small place but neat and tidy two child be play about and in a corner sit a man try to read a month-old newspaper pop this feller trade in these bit of ribbon fer bed and two meal ' she say proudly exhibit she goods and evidently think she have make a excellent bargain i could see the gleam of triumph in she eye ` humph ' grunt the man ` much good those be ' then he turn to I ` peddler ' he ask ` yes ' say i ` what you tradin ' in ' ` oh silk lace and so forth ' rejoin i repeat my formulum ` humph ' he look at I narrow he eye ` you do not look much like a peddler say he ` no i have see better day ' i say with a sigh but i could see that he be still suspicious ` where would you come from ' be he next question ` south ' say i ` where you go ' ` north ' ` be not much on conversation be yer ' he ask ` no i be not consider a very talkative fellow ' i rejoin we lapse into silence the man smoke i just sit and think the situation over at last supper be announce it be eat almost in silence the man discourage all he wife 's effort at conversation he be sullen and nervous more than ever do i begin to suspect that there be a still in the immediate neighborhood soon after supper i plead fatigue and be show up a flight of stair or rather a ladder to a sort of attic there be a husk mattress there and a pile of rather dirty-looking blanket but in those hill you learn to put up with what you can get i be glad to have find shelter at all but tire as i be for some reason i could not sleep i feel a sort of vague uneasiness i hear the man get up and go out and then later on i hear several voice downstairs there be broad chink in the floor and through these i could look down the man -- there be four of they -- be talk in low voice but now and then i could catch a word all of a sudden i hear one say something about government spy that give I a shock i can tell you i know then they be talk about I my predicament be a bad one if they suspect I i begin to look about I for a way to get out while do this i occasionally look down below the last time i look i get a shock that make my hair stand the fellow be move about the room from one corner one of they get a formidable-looking knife scare to death i redoubled my effort to find a way out at last at one end of the room i find a chimney one of those big stone affair as big as all outdoors i decide to try this i find that it be rough inside and i have not much difficulty in clamber up it i be near the top when i hear a voice from the room below say : ` then we un ` ull kill he right now ' ` yep he be live long enough he be no good ' my heart jump into my mouth i redoubled my effort and emerge from the top of the chimney reach it i lower myself to the roof as gently as possible the eaves come down low to the ground and i have not much difficulty in make my escape noiselessly chapter xxv the wren disappear but as i reach the ground a startling thing happen i miss my footing and find myself roll down a steepish bank at the bottom i fetch up against a odd-looking little hut almost overgrown with bush it be bright moonlight and the door be open inside be a fire and by its light i could see that the place be empty of human life but that a collection of object already familiar to I almost fill it it be a illicit still clearly enough also it be operate by my host up above i listen for sound of pursuit but hear none possibly they have not yet creep into my room to perform they horrible resolve suddenly the silence be break by appalling yell and scream my hair bristle for a instant and then i burst into a laugh it be a pig that i hear at the same instant it dawn on I that it be the pig that they have be discuss dispatch and not I at all you can imagine the revulsion of my feeling but i feel sore at the scare they have give I so i decide to do some work for the government and even up score at the same time enter the shack i scatter the coal of the fire right and leave then i come away no i do _ not _ go back to the cabin it would as you friend jeb say not have be healthy for I instead i set off run at top speed through the wood before long i see a glow on the sky behind I and know that flame be devour the vile stuff that moonshiner make i leave my pack behind I however and i hope that compensate they for the loss of they still i be sure the woman at any rate would value its contents more highly they all burst into a laugh at the conclusion of mr parker 's odd story they be still laugh when mandy rush out on the porch miss wren do be go she shout go they all echo in dismayed tone yes i do go to she room to see de poo ' lamb be com ` foble and she not there i do find dis writin ' too let I look at it demand mr parker it mighty hard to read it sure be a scan-lous bit of writin ' with this comment the color woman handed over to she master a bit of dirty wrap paper on it be scrawl in almost illegible character : u wont git hur agin -- the romany the romany exclaim peggy yes that be the gipsy word for themselves say mr parker i be afraid that the same band that have she before have steal she again what be we to do wail bess hush say jess let mr parker decide what be best they stand about with dismayed face miss prescott be weep softly peggy could hardly keep back she tear the little brown wren have become very dear to all of they it be a hard blow indeed to lose she like this but how could they know that she be here object jimsy why that silly newspaper report that go out when you arrive here about you adventure on the way and the romantic rescue of wren if they have come across that it would have give they a clew they be travel south then wren say and that be two week ago they would have have ample time to reach this vicinity that be so rejoin mr parker solemnly i 'll make telephonic inquiry at once they may have be see in the vicinity while you be do that we 'll examine the room they may have leave a clew there say roy roy and jimsy dart upstairs on this errand on look round the place it be clear enough how the abductor have get in outside the window be a extension roof it would have be very easy for a active man such as gipsy usually be to have clamber in and out again without detection take a lantern they examine the ground outside on a flower bed below the roof be the imprint of a man 's foot notice anything peculiar about it ask jimsy for roy be bend earnestly over the print yes i would know that foot print again anywhere he say see one side of the man 's boot be break the one of the right foot he toe show here on the ground that might be a good clew if it be daylight but right now -- jimsy sigh it be manifestly impossible to do any tracking of the man with the broken boot in the darkness we 'll have to wait till daylight yes bother it all they may be mile away by that time i doubt it i would not wonder if they hide right around here there be lot of good place and they know that the hue and cry will be so hot that they would be catch if they travel that be so maybe we can find they after all let 's hope so well we can do no more good here let 's go in peggy meet they at the door she seem wildly excite over something the mail rider 's just be here she exclaim and listen to this letter it be from a woman living near new york she just get back from europe and in a old newspaper she read a account of we sky cruise she be certain that the wren be she daughter and give a description of she that tally in every particular she say that wren be catch out in a heavy thunderstorm and seek refuge in a gipsy camp as she learn afterward from a farmer who have see she she hunt high and low but have never since have word of the child she right name be sylvium harvey mr jame harvey be she mother and she be rush here as fast as a train will carry she if it be really sylvia harvey then she mother have find she only to lose she again sigh jess do not say that say mr parker come into the room at that moment we 'll leave no stone unturn to find she do you have any success with the telephone no nobody have see a band of people answer to the description you give of the wren 's abductor then we can do nothing more the question come from roy not to-night it would be useless i have notify all the police around and a general alarm will be send out at once and now i order every one to bed we have hard work in front of we tomorrow chapter xxvi capture by gipsy about noon the next day roy and jimsy find themselves at the edge of a wild-looking section of country they be stand at the entrance to a glen densely wood with dark forbidding-looking tree and wall by precipitous and rugged rock look as if the trail end here say jimsy disconsolately it sure do we can not -- gee whilliken what on earth be up now it be the broken-toed boot look here on the muddy bank of this little stream by hooky it be we have strike the trail instead of end it what will we do go back for reënforcements not just yet we 'll reconnoiter a bit see the fellow go up this bank and -- look there jimsy -- there be a little footprint beside he be drag the child along with beat heart the two boy enter the forbidding-looking glen it be almost dark under the tree which make the aspect of the place even more gloomy and desolate look this be a nice cheerful sort of place say jimsy in a low tone as they walk along follow the bank of the stream for the brush be too thick to admit of they walk anywhere else which be what have drive the broken-booted man to leave a tell-tale trail behind he i rather wish i have a gun say jimsy we will not get close enough to they to need it rejoin roy we 'll just spy out they hide place and then go back for reënforcements that be the best idea i do not much fancy a hand-to-hand encounter with a band of such desperate ruffian as those gipsy have show themselves to be do not be scare we will not have any trouble if we be careful i be not scared but if we do get in a tussle with they they could easily overpower we and then we would have do more harm than good for they would take fright and move right off that be my idea we 'll be as cautious as mouse cat better stop talk then i never hear a mouse cat mi-ouw cautiously they creep on the trail still hold good at last they reach the head of the glen where a spring show the source of the brook what next whisper jimsy let 's see if we can find which way that fellow go the ground be spongy all around here and -- ah this way see it jimsy nod they strike off to the right clambering over rock till they reach the summit of a small hill a tall dead tree stand there and jimsy volunteer to climb it in order to spy out the surrounding country for trace of the gipsy but on he return to the ground he be compel to admit that they have gain nothing i think i might see some smoke that would give I a clew to they whereabouts he explain not much chance of they be as foolish as that i guess they know search party be out all over by this time and they be too foxy to light fire i might have think of that admit jimsy it would be about the last thing they would do what will we do now i hardly know hello there be a odd-looking place right over there see that deep cañon that one with the fall tree across it yes i do now let 's look over there all right you be on the two boy strike off in the direction of roy 's discovery it be indeed a odd freak of nature some convulsion of the earth have detach quite a section of land from the surrounding country it be in fact a island in the midst of the wood with only the fall tree for a bridge let 's cross it and examine the place suggest roy with all a boy 's curiosity together they cross the old tree which have evidently fall there by accident although in reality it form a perfect bridge the island be thickly wood and they push forward across it not without some difficulty suddenly they come upon a sight that make they halt dead in they track a man hold a rifle be sit on a fall log the instant he see they he raise he weapon do not come no further he say why not demand roy indignantly see that sign say the man he point to a rudely paint sign on a tree at he back dangir no trespasin that be what it say in bold letter that sprawl across its surface in a untidy fashion the execution of the thing be as bad as its spelling i guess a pretty sick man paint that sign grin jimsy what do you mean be the surly reply why i should judge he be have a awful bad spell at the time be the boy 's rejoinder the man scowl at he fiercely no joking round here he growl now then if you know what be good for you you two kid will vamoose what be the danger if we keep on ask roy why they be try a new kind of explosive back there it might go off the wrong way you way for instance and hurt you be the reply seem a funny sort of place to try out explosive say roy seem a queer sort of place for you two kid to come who be you anyhow oh we be camp down below and we just come out for a stroll well stroll some other place then git away from round here we certainly will flash back roy come on jimsy as there seem nothing else to do jimsy agree they turn away and begin retrace they step no wiser as to the whereabouts of the man with the broken boot than they have be when they set out just as they turn to go however another man come out of the wood behind the man with the rifle when he see the boy he give a abrupt start where do those boy come from he demand i do not know say they be two kid out campin ' and takin ' a stroll take a stroll eh say the other ferociously they be take a stroll look for that wren how do you know because they be the same two kid who steal she from we just as we be go to demand a ransom for she that be before i join the band no wonder i do not know they if i have -- he scowl vindictively well we can not let 'em get away here give I that rifle demand the newcomer the other handed it to he the next instant a report ring out and a bullet whiz over the boy '
