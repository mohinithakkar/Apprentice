be rich and plenteous though in those day taint by he french origin he then i regret to say spat upon the purple whisker of the butterfly and take refuge in flight the long stride of peter quick banta soon overtake he silently struggle he be hale back to the profaned temple of art now young feller say peter quick banta maybe you think you could do it better the world-old retort of the creative artist to he critic any fool could retort the boy which in various form be almost as time-honored as the challenge suspect that only tactful intervention would forestall possible murder i saunter over from my bench but the decorator of sidewalk have himself under control try it he say grimly the boy avidly seize the crayon extend to he you want I to draw a picture there if you do not i 'll break

go to light -- that be not a bird and you know it peter quick banta breathe hard that be a butterfly i see but the lie-lawc it drop -- so the gesture be inimitable and the butterfly she do not come down plop she float -- so the grimy hand flutter and sink they do do they well you put it down on the sidewalk from that moment the outside world cease to exist for the urchin he fall to with concentrated fervor while peter quick banta and i divert the traffic only once do he speak : yellow he say reach but not look up silently the elder artist put the desire crayon in he hand when the last touch be do the boy look up at we not boastfully but with supreme confidence there say he it be crude it be ill-proportioned the color be raw the arrangement be false _ but _ -- the lilac bloom _ and _ -- the butterfly hover the artist have speak through he ordain medium and the presentment of life stand forth i hardly dare look at peter quick banta but beneath he uncouth exterior there lay a great and magnanimous soul son say he you be a wonder wanta keep they crayon unable to speak for the moment the boy take off he ragged cap in one of the most gracious gesture i have ever witness raise dog-like eye of gratitude to he benefactor tactfully peter quick banta proceed to expound for my benefit the technique of the draw give the youngster time to recover before the inevitable question begin where do you learn that nowhere have a few draw lesson at no 19 would you like to work for I how peter quick banta point to the sidewalk that the boy laugh happily that be not work that be fun so the partnership be begin the boy whose name be julien tennier -lrb- soon simplify into tenney for local use -rrb- sharing peter quick banta 's roomy garret success modest but unfailing attend it from the first appearance of the junior member of the firm at coney island where as the local cognoscenti still maintain he revolutionize the art and practice of the sand-dab out of the joint takings grow a bank account eventually peter quick banta come to I about the boy 's education he be a swell say peter quick banta look at that face i do not care if he do crawl outa the gutter i be a artist and i reco ` nize aristocracy when i see it and i want he brung up accordin ' so i induct the youngster into such modest grove of learn as a old half-shelved pedagogue have access to and when the bonnie lassie come to we square to make herself and we famous with she tiny bronze -lrb- this be before she have capture reform and marry cyrus the gaunt -rrb- i take he to she and he fall boyishly and violently in love with she beauty and she genius alike all of which be good for he develop soul she arrange for he art training but you know dominie she use to say wag she head like a profound and thoughtful bird this be all very foolish and shortsighted on my part five year from now that gutter-godling of yours will be do work that will make people forget poor little I and my poor little figurine to which i reply that even if it be true instead of the veriest nonsense about julien tenney or any one else ever eclipse she she would help he just the same but five year from then julien have go over to the philistine ii justly catalogue roberta holland belong to the idle rich she would have object to the latter classification aver that with the rise cost of fur and automobile upkeep she have barely enough to keep she head above the high tide of fifth avenue price as to idleness she scorn the charge have she not throughout the war perform prodigious feat of committee work all of it meritorious and some of it useful she have it have leave she with a dangerous and destructive appetite for do good to people aside from this miss roberta be a distracting young person few look at she once without want to look again and not a few look again to they undoing being-done-good-to be i understand much in vogue in the purlieus of fifth avenue where it be practice with skill and persistence by a large and needy cult of grateful recipient we square do not take to it as recipient we be i fear grudgingly grateful so when miss holland transfer she enthusiasm and activity to we far-away corner of the world she meet with a lack of response which might have discourage one with a less new and superior sense of duty to the lower order she come to we through the bonnie lassie guardian of the gateway from the upper stratum to we humbler domain who -- pagan that she be -- indiscriminately accept all thing beautiful simply for they beauty have arrive miss holland proceed to organize we with all the energy of high-blooded sweet-and-twenty and all the imperiousness of confident wealth and beauty she organize a evening sewing-circle for woman whose eyelid would not stay open after they long day 's work she form cultural improvement class for such as leon coventry the printer who know half the literature of the world and maclachan the tailor to whom carlyle be by way of be light reading she deliver some edifying exhortation upon the subject of americanism to polyglot elsa of the élite restaurant -lrb- who have take upon she sturdy young shoulder the support of a old mother and a paralytic sister so that she two brother might enlist for the war -- a detail of patriotism which the dispenser of platitude might have learn by judicious inquiry -rrb- and so forth and so on miss roberta holland mean well but she have many thing to learn and no master to teach she yet when the flu epidemic return upon we she stand by efficient deft and gallant though still imperious until the day when she clash she lath-and-tinsel sword of theory against the temper steel of the little red doctor 's experience say the little red doctor -lrb- who be press for time at the moment -rrb- : take order or get out which she straighten like a soldier tell I what you want do at the end of the onset when he give she she release from volunteer service she turn shine eye upon he i have never be so treat in my life you be a bully and a brute you be a brick retort the little red doctor i 'll send for you next time we square need help i 'll come say she and they shake hand solemnly thereafter we square feel a little more lenient toward she ministration and even those of we who least approve she activity feel the stir of radiance and color which she bring with she on a day when the local philanthropy market be slack and miss holland seat in the bonnie lassie 's front window be mature some new and benign outrage upon we sensibility she call out to the sculptress at work on a group : there be a queer man make queer mark on you sidewalk that be peter quick banta he be a fellow artist and another man young with a big maney head like a amiable lion quite a beautiful lion he be make more mark let he make all he want they be wave they arm at each other at least the queer man be i think they be go to fight they will not it be only a academic discussion on technique who be the young one he be the ruin of what might have be a big artist no be he what do it drink do he look it the window-gazer peer more intently at the debater below it be a peculiar face awfully interesting though he be quite poorly dress do he need money be that what be wrong that be it bobbie return the bonnie lassie with a half-smile he need the money the rampant philanthropist stir within miss roberta holland 's fatally well-meaning soul would it be a case where i could help i would love to put a real artist back on he foot be you sure he be real on the subject of art the bonnie lassie be never anything but sincere and direct however much she may play she trickery with lesser interest such as life and love and human fate no i be not if he be i doubt whether he would have let himself go so wrong perhaps it be not too late say the amateur missionary hopefully be he a man to whom one could offer money the bonnie lassie 's smile broaden without change in its subtle quality julien tenney be not exactly a pauper he just think he can not afford to do the kind of thing he want and ought to what ought he to do paint -- paint -- paint say the bonnie lassie vehemently five year ago i believe he have the makings of a great painter in he and now look what he be do make mark on sidewalk you mean worse commercial art design and that sort of thing do you ever look at the unearthly beautiful graceful and gloriously dress young super-american who appear in the advertisement ride in super-car or wear super-clothes or brushing super-teeth with super-toothbrushes i suppose so say the girl vaguely he draw those be that what you call pot-boiling one kind and i suppose it pay just a pittance well reply the bonnie lassie evasively he stick to it so it must support he then i be go to help he ` to fulfill he destiny ' be the accept phrase say the bonnie lassie wickedly i 'll call he in for you to look over but you would best leave the arrangement for a later meeting be summon julien tenney enter the house as one quite at home despite he smeary garb of the work artist he presentation to miss holland be as brief as it be formal for she take she departure at once who be she ask julien stare after she bobbie holland a gilded butterfly from uptown what be she do here good o lord say he in pained tone have she get a cause naturally philanthropist worse there be not no sich a animile there be she be a patron of art wow yes she be go to patronize you not if i see she first how do _ i _ qualify as a subject she consider you a waste life where do she get that idea the bonnie lassie remove a small sharp implement from the left eye of a stoical figurine and point it at herself do you think that be fair demand the indignant youth the bonnie lassie reverse the implement and point it at he do you or do you not she challenge invade we humble precinct in a five-thousand-dollar automobile it be my only extravagance do you or do you not maintain a luxurious apartment in gramercy park when you be not down here pose in you attic as a honest working-man oh see here mrs staten i will not stand for that he expostulate you know perfectly well i keep my room here because it be the only place i can work in quietly -- and because peter quick banta would break he foolish old heart if you leave he entirely supplement the sculptress julien flush and stand look like a awkward child do you tell all this stuff to miss holland he ask oh no she think that you pot-boiling be a desperate and barely sufficient expedient to keep the wolf from the door so she be plan to help you realize you destiny which be he query with lift brow to be a great painter the other wince as you know i have mean all along as soon as i have save enough -- oh yes _ i _ know break in the bonnie lassie who can be quite ruthless where art be concerned and _ you _ know but time fly and hell be pave with good intention and if you want to be that kind of a pavement artist -- well i think peter quick banta be a better do you suppose she would let I paint she he ask abruptly if statuette could blink the one upon which the bonnie lassie be busy would certainly have shroud its vision against the dazzling radiance of she smile for this be come about as she have plan it from the moment when she have catch the flash of startled surprise and wonder in he eye as they first rest on bobbie holland here she have guess might be the agency to bring julien tenney to he artistic sens and even so it be now work out but all she say be -- and she say it with a sort of venomous blandness -- my dear boy you can not paint can not i just because i be a little out of practice -- two year be not it since you have touch a palette give I a chance at such a model as she be that be all i ask do you think she so pretty inquire the sculptress disparagingly pretty she be the loveliest thing that -- catch he hostess 's smile he break off you 'll admit it be a well-modeled face he say professionally and -- and -- well unusual pooh ` dangerous ' be the word remember it warn the bonnie lassie she be a devastating whirlwind that child and she come down here partly to get away from the wreckage now if you play you part cleverly -- i be not go to play any part then it be all up how be a patroness of art go to patronize you unless you be a poor and struggle young artist living from hand to mouth by arduous pot-boiling you will not have to play a part as far as the pot-boiling go add he monitress viciously only do not let she know that the reward of you shame run to high-powered car and high-class apartment remember you be poor but honest perhaps she 'll give you money perhaps she will not retort the youth explosively oh it will be do tactfully never fear i 'll bring she around to see you and you 'll have to work the sitting yourself as a setting for the abode of a struggle beginner julien 's attic need no change it be a whim of he to keep it bare and simple he work out he pictorial scheme of elegance best in a environment where there be nothing to distract the eye one could see that miss roberta holland upon she initial visit approve its stark and cleanly poverty -lrb- yes i be there to see the bonnie lassie have take I along to make up that first party -rrb- have do the honor julien drop into the background and presently be curl up over a drawing-board sketch eagerly while the bonnie lassie and i hold the doer of good deed in talk now the shrewd and able tribe of advertising manager do not pay to any but a master-draughtsman the price which jt -- with a arrow transfix the initial -- get and julien be as deft and rapid as he be skillful soon appreciate what be in progress the visitor graciously sit quite still at the conclusion she hold out she hand for the cardboard to be a patroness of art do not necessarily imply that one be a adequate critic miss holland contemplate what be a veritable little gem in black-and-white with cool approbation quite clever she be please to say would you care to sell it i do not think it would be exactly -- a stern glance from the bonnie lassie cut short the refusal he swallow the rest of the sentence would ten dollar be too little ask the visitor with bright beneficence too much he murmur -lrb- the bonnie lassie say that with a little crayoning and retouching he could have sell it for at least fifty time that -rrb- the patroness delicately drop a bill on the table could you some day find time to let I try you in oils he ask do that take long she say doubtfully i be very busy you really should try it bobbie put in the crafty bonnie lassie it might give he the start he need what argument she add later be a secret between the two woman but she have she way the bonnie lassie always do so the bare studio be from time to time irradiated with bobbie holland 's youthful loveliness and laughter for there be much laughter between those two shrewdly foresee that this bird of paradise would return to the bare cage only if it be make amusing for she julien exert himself to the utmost to keep she mind at play and as i can vouch who help train he there be few man of he age who can be as absorb a companion as julien when he choose to exert he charm all the time he be work with a passionate intensity on the portrait let everything else go toss aside the most remunerative offer leave he mail unopened throw himself intensely recklessly into this one single enterprise the fact be he have long be starve for color and be now satiate he soul with it probably it be largely impersonal with he at first the bonnie lassie wise of heart that she be think so but that could not last man who be not otherwise safeguard do not long retain a neutral attitude toward such creature of grace and splendor as bobbie holland between they develop a curious relation it be hardly to be call friendship he be not to bobbie 's recognition a habitant of she world nor certainly be it anything more julien would as soon have renounce easel and canvas as have take advantage of she come to make love to she in this waif of we gutter and ward of we sidewalk artist inher a spirit of the most punctilious and rigid honor the gift perhaps of some forget ancestry more and more as the intimacy grow he desert he uptown haunt and stick to the attic studio above the room where in the dawn day of prosperity he have install peter quick banta in the effete and scandalous luxury of two room a bath and a gas stove yet the picture advance slowly which be the more surprising in that the exotic bobbie seem to find plenty of time for sitting now between visit she take to go to the metropolitan museum and conscientiously study picture and catalogue with a view to help she protégé form sound artistic taste -lrb- when the bonnie lassie hear that she all but choke -rrb- as for julien this be all very well he say one day in the sculptress 's studio but sooner or later she be go to catch I at it what then ask the bonnie lassie not look up from she work she 'll go away let she go you portrait will be finish meantime will not it oh yes that 'll be finish this time the bonnie lassie do look up immediately she look back again in any case she 'll have to go away some day -- will not she i suppose so return he in a gloomy growl i warn you at the outset ` dangerous ' she point out they let it drop there as for the effect upon the girl of julien tenny 's brilliant and unsettling personality i could judge only as i see they occasionally together she lustrous and exotic as a bud orchid he in the non-descript motley of he studio garb serenely unconscious of any incongruity do you think i ask the bonnie lassie who be share my bench one afternoon as julien be take the patroness of art over to where she car wait that she be do he as much good as she think she be or ought to malice ill become one of you age dominie say the bonnie lassie with dignity i be quite serious i protest and very unjust bobbie be a adorable little person when you know she do julien know she well enough to have discover a self-evident fact only pursue my companion ignore the question she be bore and a little spoil so she come down here to escape be bore and to get more spoil julien will not spoil she he certainly do not appear to bear she she be have the table turn on she without know it julien be do she a lot of good already she be far less beneficent and bountiful and all that sort of stuff lassie say i what if i may so express myself be the big idea slang be a execrable thing from a profess scholar she reprove however the big idea be that julien be really painting and it be _ mine _ that big idea might not it be accompany by a little idea to the effect that the experience be likely to cost he pretty dear what will be leave when bobbie holland go pooh do not be a oracular sphinx be all that i get for my pain nor do miss bobbie show any immediate symptom of go if the painting seem at time in danger of stagnation the same could not be say of the fellowship between painter and paintee that nourish along and one day a vagrant wind bring in the dangerous element of historical personality the wind enter at the end of a session displace a hanging above the studio door reveal in bold script upon the plaster béranger 's famous line : dan un grenier qu'on est bien á vingt an do you write that there ask the girl seven long year ago and mean it every word how do you come to know béranger i be french bear ` in a garret how good be life at twenty ' she translate freely i would not have think -- she turn she softly brilliant regard upon he -- that life have be so good to you it have be the rejoinder but never so good as now i have often wonder -- you seem to know so many thing -- where you get you education here and there and everywhere it be only a patchwork sort of thing -lrb- ungrateful young scoundrel so to describe my two-hours-a-day of brain-hammering and the free run of my library -rrb- you be a very puzzling person say she and when a woman say that to a man deep have begin to call to deep -lrb- the bonnie lassie who know everything be my authority for the statement -rrb- to she go the patroness of art on leave julien 's grenier that day cecily she say in the most casual manner she could contrive who _ be _ julien tenney nobody you know what i mean plead the girl _ what _ be he a brand snatch from the pot-boiling return the bonnie lassie quite pleased with she next turn which be more than she companion be please do not be clever be nice and tell I -- ` be nice sweet maid and let who will be clever ' declaim the bonnie lassie who be feel perverse that day you want I to define he social status for you and tell you whether you would better invite he to dinner you would better not he might swallow he knife you know he would not deny the girl in resentful tone i have never know any one with more instinctive good manners he seem to go right naturally all due to my influence and training brag the bonnie lassie i help bring he up then you must know something of he antecedent ask the dominie he say that julien crawl out of a gutter with the manners of a _ preux chevalier _ anyway he never swallow any of _ my _ knife though he be have plenty of opportunity it be very puzzling lament bobbie why let it prey like a worm i ' the bud of you mind you be not go to adopt he perhaps for the moment bobbie holland 's eye be dreamy and she tongue unguarded i do not know what i be go to do with he say she with a gesture as of one who despairingly give over a insoluble problem umph say the bonnie lassie and continue sculpt iii as julien have prophesy it be only a question of time when he would be surprise by he patroness in he true garb and estate the event occur as he be step from he touring-car to get he golf-club from the hallway of he gramercy park apartment at the very moment when bobbie holland emerge from the house next door both she hand fly involuntarily to she cheek as she take in and wholly misinterpret he costume which be not to be wonder at when one consider the similarity of a golfing outfit to a chauffeur 's livery oh she cry out as if something have hurt she julien for once startle out of he accustomed poise uncovered and look at she apprehensively she voice quiver a little as she ask very low do you _ have _ to do that why -- er -- no begin the puzzle julien who fail for the moment to perceive what of tragic portent inher in a prospective afternoon of golf she next word enlighten he i should think you might have let I help before take a -- servant 's position it be a honest occupation he aver do you do this -- regularly she pursue with a effort off and on there be good money in it oh she mourn again then : you be do this so that you can afford to buy paint and canvas and -- and thing to paint I she accuse it be not fair i would do worse than this for that he declare valiantly less than a fortnight later she catch he do worse she have cease to speak to he of he chauffeurdom because it seem to cause he painful embarrassment -lrb- it do and should have -rrb- there have be a big theater party important enough to get itself detail in the valuable column which the papers devote to such matter and afterward supper at the most expensive uptown restaurant miss roberta holland be one of the list guest as she take she place at the table she catch a glimpse of a unmistakable figure disappear through the waiter 's exit and julien tenney who have rise from he little supper party of four -lrb- stag -rrb- hastily but just too late on catch sight of she saw that he be recognize flight instant and permanent have be he original intent now it would not do bolder measure must be devise he appeal to the head-waiter to help he carry out a joke and that functionary develop a sense of humor under the stimulus of a twenty-dollar bill procure he on the spot a ill-fitting coat and a black string tie and give he certain simple direction when the patroness of art next observe the object of she patronage he be perform the humble but useful duty of a omnibus miss holland suddenly lose a perfectly good and hitherto reliable appetite nor be she the only member of the supper party to develop symptom of shock the gilded and stalwart youth on she left follow she glance stare at the amateur servitor with protrude eye cease to eat or drink and fall into a state of semi-coma muttering at interval a expressive monosyllable why not swear out loud caspar ask bobbie presently it 'll do you less harm d'you see that chap over yonder the big fine-looking one fix the fork yes say bobbie faintly well that be -- no by thunder it can not be -- yes by the red-hot hinge it _ be _ do you think you know he know he i _ know _ he he bunk in with I for two week at grandpré he be captain of a machine-gun outfit send down to help we clean out that little wasp 's nest he name 's tenney and if ever there be a hellion in a fight and see -- what he be come to my god well do not cry about it advise the girl serenely though it be hard for she to keep she voice steady there be nothing to do about it be there be not there retort the youth rise purposefully i be go to get he and find he a job that be fit for he if i have to take he into partnership of all the dash-blanked-dod-blizzened -- caspar what be you go to do do not you 'll embarrass he frightfully but he be already head off he prey at the exit bobbie see she painter 's face flame into welcome then stiffen into dismay the pair vanish beyond the watcher 's ken on he return the gilded youth behave strangely from time to time he shake he head from time to time he chuckle and while bobbie be talk to she other neighbor he shoot curious and amuse glance at she he tell she nothing but he interest in he supper return bobbie 's do not to discuss the social aspect of menial service with a practitioner of it who have be admit to a certain implicit equality be a difficult and delicate matter for a girl bring up in roberta holland 's school several time after the restaurant encounter she essay it try both the indirect approach and the method of extreme frankness neither answer julien respond to she advance by alternate mood of extreme gloom and slyly inexplicable amusement bobbie give it up conclude that he be in a very queer mood anyway she be right he be the next episode of they progress take the form of a veritable unmasking which perversely enough only fix the mask tighter upon julien tenney by way of loosen up he wrist for the open season peter quick banta have take advantage of a amiable day to sketch out a composite floral and faunal scheme on the flagging in front of thornsen 's élite restaurant when miss holland in pass pause to observe and wonder at the same moment julien hurry around the corner all but run she down she nod toward the decorator of sidewalk be not he the funny man that you be with the first time i see you the very same respond julien with twinkling eye what be he do he be one of the few remain example of the sidewalk or public-view school of art yes but what do he do it for he living do people give he money for it do you think i might give he something she ask look uncertainly at the artist who on hand and knee and with tongue protrude be put a green head on a red bird too absorb even to notice the onlooker i think he would be tickle pink she take a quarter from she purse hesitate then slip it into she companion 's hand _ you _ give it to he i think he would like it better oh no i do not think he would like it at all in fact i doubt if he would take it from I why not well you see explain julien blandly we be rather intimately connect he raise he voice hello dad the decorator furl he tongue lift he head change he crayon reply hello lad and continue he work what d' you think of _ that _ he add after a moment triumphantly point a yellow crayon at the green-headed red-bird some parrot enthused julien ' t be not a parrot it be a nightingale retort the artist indignantly you black-and-white fellow never do understand color it be a corker anyway say julien dad here be a -- a art patron who want to contribute to the cause the girl whose face have become flush and almost frightened hold out she quarter i -- i -- do not know she begin i be interested in you picture and i think -- mr tenney say -- peter quick banta take the coin with perfect dignity thank you say he there be not much appreciation of art just at this season but if you 'll come down to coney about June i 'll show you some sand-modeling that _ be _ sand-modeling -- 's much as five dollar a day i have take in there miss holland recover she social poise i would like to very much she say cheerfully she and julien walk on in silence suddenly he laugh a little jarringly well he say do that help you to place I i be not try to place you she answer be that quite true he mock no it be not it be a downright lie say bobbie finding courage to raise she eye to he and now i suppose i shall be ` my good man ' or something like that to you do you think it likely you call maclachan that you know he remind she long ago when i be -- when i do not understand we square and now of course we every feeling and thought be a open book to you penetrate vision she lip quiver i do not know why you should want to be so hateful to I for a flash second he eye answer that appeal with a look that thrill and daunt she to keep from be something else that i have no right to be he mutter how many more sitting do you think it will take to finish the picture she ask strive to get on safer ground only one or two i suppose he answer morosely such be julien 's condition of mind after the last sit that he actually leave the precious portrait unguarded by neglect to lock the door of the studio on go out and the bonnie lassie and i happen in beheld it in its fulfillment a slow flush burn its way upward in the bonnie lassie 's face as she study it he be do it she exclaim flower and flame why do i ever take to sculpture one can not get that in the metal he be do it i echo of course technically it be rather a sloppy picture it be a glorious picture i cry naturally that return the exasperating critic it always will be -- when you paint with you heart 's blood do you think you friend bobbie appreciate the medium in which she be present if she do not -- which she probably do say the bonnie lassie she will find out something to she advantage when she see I to-morrow i be go home to ` phone she in answer to the summons bobbie come she look i think as i see she from my bench troubled and perplexed and softened and glowingly lovely at the door of the bonnie lassie 's house she be meet with the challenge direct what have you be do to my artistic ward nothing reply bobbie with unwonted meekness and to prove it related the incident of the touring-car the supper at the taverne splendide and the encounter with the paternal colorist that be not julien 's father say the sculptress he be only a adoptive father but julien adore he as he ought to the real father so i have hear be a french gentleman -- i do not care who he father be cry bobbie -lrb- the bonnie lassie 's face take on the expression of a exclamation point -rrb- i can not bear to think of he have to do servant 's work and i tell he so yesterday do you look like that while you be tell he like what i suppose so and what do he do do he do not do anything then pronounce the bonnie lassie he be a stick of wood -- hardwood -- with a knot-hole for a heart he be not well perhaps he be he be very horrid at the last about what about take money i be a prophetess and you be a patroness bear in we i suppose you _ do _ try to give he money just to loan it enough so that he could go away to study and paint he would not even let I do that so i -- i -- i offer to buy the picture of I and he say -- he say -- cecily do you think he be sometimes a little queer in he head not in the head necessarily _ what _ do he say he say he would buy it himself at the highest price ever pay and he say it so obstinately that i see it be no use so i just tell he that i hope i would see he when i come back -- back from where be you go away yes do not i tell you on a three month ' cruise have you tell he that of course that be when i try to get he to take the money cecily -- the girl 's voice shake a little you 'll tell he will not you that he _ must

promptly rechristen stepfather time the bonnie lassie give he the name she say that only a stepfather could bring up he charge so badly for he clock be both independent and irresponsible though through no fault of they own when they be wind they go when they be unwound they rest seldom be more than half of they simultaneously busy and they difference of opinion as to the hour be radical and irreconcilable the big emphatic eight-day opposite the front door might proclaim that it be eleven only to be at once contradict by the little tinkler on the parlor mantel which announce that it be six thereby start up the cathedral case on the stairway and the grandfather in the dining-room who hold out respectively for eight and two while all the time it be really half-past one thence arise in the early day painful misunderstanding on the part of we square for we be a simple people and deem it the duty of a timepiece to keep time in particular we be befool by grandfather the solemn-voiced anania of a clock with a long-range stroke and a most convincing manner so that schepstein the note-shaver on he way to a profitable appointment at 11 be hear the hour strike -lrb- thirty-five minute in advance of the best professional opinion -rrb- from the house of silvery voice and be impel to the recklessness of hire a pass taxi thereby reach he destination with half a hour to spare and half a

tallafferr 's gout -lrb- which be really vanity in the guise of tight shoe -rrb- and reach the hospital only to find it all over and the patient dead it be a outrage declare the little red doctor fiercely that a old lunatic can move in here from god-knows-where in a pushcart and play merry hell with a hard-working practitioner 's professional duty and you be the one to tell he so dominie you be the diplomat of the square he even inveigle the bonnie lassie into back he up in this preposterous proposal she have she own grievance against the house of silvery voice it be not the way it play trick on time alone say she there be one clock in there that be worse than conscience and she bring she indictment against a raucous timepiece which be wont to lead up to its striking with a long preliminary clack-and-whirr allege that twice when she have quit she sculping early because the clay be obdurate and would not come right and have go for a walk to clear she vision the clock have accost she in these unjustifiable term : clacketty-whirr-rr-rr back-to-yer-worr-rr-rrk yerr-rr-rr-rr _ wrong wrong wrong wrong _ wherefore say the bonnie lassie you appellant pray that you be a dear

over all we square by the divine right of loveliness and kindliness so that evening i go while the little red doctor as a self-constituted committee in wait sit on my bench stepfather time himself open the door to I what might they call you sir if i may ask he inquire with timid courtesy they might call I the dominie hereabouts and they do i have hear of you he motion I to a seat in the bare little room alive with ticking and clicking you have live long here sir long from some interminable distance a voice of time mock I with a subtle and solemn mockery : _ long long long _ my host wait for the clock to finish before he speak again as i afterward discover this be he invariable custom i too be a old man he murmur a hardy sixty i should guess a long life might i ask you a question sir ' as to the folk in this square he hesitate a moment after i have nod be they as one might say friendly neighborly i be a little take aback we be not a intrusive people no one he say have be to see my clock i begin to perceive that this be a sad little man and to mislike my errand you live here quite alone i ask oh no say he quickly you see i have willy woolly pardon I i have not yet present he at he call the fluffy poodle amble over to I sniff at my extended hand and rearing set he paw on my knee he greet you as a friend say my new acquaintance in a tone which indicate that i have be signally honor i trust that we shall see you here often mr dominie would you like to inspect my collection now here be my open the fact be -- i begin and stop from sheer cowardice the job be too distasteful to

-- er -- dr smith you know a physician he say eagerly would he come in do you think willy woolly have be quite feverish to-day i 'll ask he i reply and escape with that excuse when i break it to the little red doctor the mildest thing he say to I be to ask I why i should take he for a dash-binged vet appeal to he curiosity finally overpersuade he and now it be my turn to wait on the bench while he invade the realm of the voice happily for I the weather be amiable it be nearly two hour before my substitute reappear he then try to sneak away without see I balk in this cowardly endeavor he put on a vague professional expression and observe that it be a obscure case for a man of sixty i begin mr merivale -- _ who _ interrupted the little red doctor i be speak of the dog have you then i inquire in insinuate accent become a dash-binged vet a man can not be a brute can he he retort angrily when that animated mop put up he paw and stick he tongue out like a child -- i know i say you take on a new patient probably grati i add with malice for this be one of the little red doctor 's notoriously weak point just the same he be a fool dog on the contrary he be a person of command intellect and nice social discrimination i assert recall willy woolly 's flattering acceptance of myself a faker asseverate my friend he pretend to see thing i sit up straight on my bench thing what kind of thing thing that be not there return the little red doctor and fall to muse they could not be he add presently and argumentatively receive no encouragement when i seek further detail i ask whether he have call the new resident to account for the delinquency of he clock he shake he head i do not have time say he doggedly time why there be nothing but time in that house the little red doctor choose to take my feeble joke at par no time at all none of the clock keep it how do he manage he life then willy woolly do that for he bark he up in the morning jog he elbow at mealtime tuck he in bed at night for all i know thus abortively end we square 's protest against stepfather time and he house of silvery voice the little red doctor 's obscure suggestion stick in my mind and a few night later i make a second call curiosity rather than neighborliness be the incite cause therefore i ought to have be embarrass at the quiet warmth of my reception by both of the tenant interrupt himself in the work of adjust a new acquisition 's mechanism stepfather time settle I into the most comfortable chair and immediately begin to talk of clock good talk it be quaint and flavorous and erudite but my attention keep wander to willy woolly who after politely kiss my hand have settle down behind he master 's chair willy woolly be see thing no pretense about it he mournful eye yearn hither and thither follow some entity that move in the room dimmer than darkness more ethereal than shadow he ear quiver a muffle measure thump sound dull and indeterminate like spirit rap it take I a appreciable time to identify it as the noise of the poodle 's tail beat the floor once he whine a quick quiver eager note and still the amateur of clock murmur he placid lore it be rather more than old nerve could stand the dog i break in upon the stream of erudition surely mr merivale -- willy woolly he look down and the faithful one withdraw himself from he vision long enough to lick the master hand do he disturb you oh no i answer a little confused i only think -- it seem that he be uneasy about something there be finer sensibility than we poor human have say my host gravely then you have notice how he watch and follow he be always like that always since he since be one of the strangest syllable that ever come to my ear it imply nothing to follow it be finality 's self it be -- i seek a word -- interesting and curious i conclude lamely feel how insufficient the word be she come back to he say my host simply no need to ask of whom he speak the pronoun be as final and definitive as he since never have i hear such tenderness as he give to its utterance nor such desolation as dimmed he voice when he add : she never come back to I that evening he speak no more of she yet i feel that i have be admit to a intimacy and as the habit grow upon I thereafter of drop in to listen to the remote restful unworldly quaintness of he philosophy fragment drop here and there build up the outline of the tragedy which have leave he strand in we little backwater of quiet she whom he have cherish since they be boy and girl together have die in the previous winter she have form the whole circle of he existence within which he move attend by willy woolly happily gather he trove she death have leave he not so much alone as alien in the world he be without companionship except that of willy woolly without interest except that of he timepiece and without hope except that of rejoin she once he emerge from a long spell of muse to say in a tone of indescribable conviction : i suppose i be the happiest man in the world any chance incident or remark might turn he thought and speech unconscious of the transition from he favorite technicality back to the past some comment of mine upon a specimen of that dismal songster the cuckoo clock which stand on he mantel have start he into one of he learn exposition the first cuckoo clock as you be doubtless aware sir -- he be always scrupulous to assume knowledge on the part of he hearer no matter how abstruse or technical the subject it be a phase of he inherent courtesy -- be intend to represent not the cuckoo but the blackbird it have a double pipe for the hour ` pit-weep pit-weep ' and a single -- he voice trail into silence as the mechanical bird of he own collection pop forth and pipe its wooden lay willy woolly patter over sit down before it and gaze through and beyond the meaningless face with eye of adoration whose purport there be no mistaking whine lovingly when the cuckoo sound continue the collector without the slightest change of intonation she use to imitate it to puzzle willy woolly a merry heart all be so still after it stop beat the clock forget to strike the poodle turn he absorb regard from the presence that move beyond time and its perish voice trot to he master and nuzzle the frail hand the hand fondle he yes little dog murmur the man he eye sad as those of the animal quest the dimness why do she come to he and not to I he love she dearly do not you little dog but not as i do there be a quiver note of jealousy in he voice why be my vision blind to what he see you have say yourself that there be finer sensibility than ours i suggest he shake he head it lie deeper than that i think he be draw near she he use to have a little bark that he keep for she alone in the dead of night i have hear he give that bark -- since and i know that she be speak to he i think that he will go first perhaps he will tell she that i be come but i should be very lonely willy 's a stout young thing i assert with year of life before he perhaps he return doubtfully a gleam of rare fun light up he pale vague eye can not you see he dodge past saint peter through the pearly gate -lrb- i be bring up a methodist he add in apologetic explanation -rrb- trot along the alabaster street sniff about for she among all the shine one listen for she voice amid the sound of the harp and when he find she hallelujahing with that little bark that be for she alone : ` here i be mistress here i be and _ he be _ come soon mistress you old boy be come soon ' when i retail that conversation to the little red doctor he snort and say that stepfather time be one degree crazier than willy woolly and that i be not much better than a higher moron myself well if i have get to be call a fool by my best friend i would rather be call it in greek than in english it be more euphonious \* \* \* \* \* the pair in number 37 soon settle down to a routine life every morning stepfather time get out he big pushcart and set forth in search of treasure accompany by willy woolly sometimes the dog trot beneath the cart sometimes he ride in it he be always on the job never do he indulge in those divagation so dear to the normal canine heart other dog and they way interested he not cat simply do not exist in he circumscribed life even to the shine mark of a boy on a bicycle he be indifferent and when a dog have reach that stage one may safely say of he that he have renounce the world and all its vanity willy woolly 's one concern in life be he master and they joint business soon they become accept familiar of we square despite the general conviction that they be slightly touch we even become proud of they they lend distinction to the locality by get write up in a Sunday supplement willy woolly be specially photograph therefor a gleam of transient glory which however it may have gratify we local pride leave both of the subject quite indifferent stepfather time might have pay more heed to it have he not at the time be wholly preoccupy in a difficult quest in a basement window far over on avenue d stand a old and battered timepiece of which stepfather time have hear the voice but never see the face each of three attempt to investigate with a view to negotiation have be frustrate by a crabbed and violent-looking man with a repellent club nevertheless the voice alone have ensnare the connoisseur it be by the test of the pipe which he carry on all he quest d in alt and would thus complete the major chord of a chime which he have long be build up -lrb- she have love best of all harmonic combination of the clock bell -rrb- every day he would halt in front of the place and wait to hear it strike and its owner would peer out from behind it and shake a waste fist and curse he with strange hoarse foreign oath while willy woolly tug at he trouser leg and urge he to pass on from that unchancy spot all that he could learn about the basement dweller be that he name be lukisch and he owe for he rent mr lukisch have nothing special against the queer old party who make sheep 's eye at he clock every day he hate he quite impartially as he hate everybody mr lukisch have a bad heart in more sens than one and a grudge against the world which he blame for the badness of he heart also he have definite idea of reprisal which be focus by a dispossess notice and direct particularly upon the person and property of he landlord the clock he need as the instrument of he vengeance therefore he would not have sell it at any price to the sheep-eyed old lunatic of the pushcart who now on the eve of he eviction stand gaze in with wistful contemplation presently he pass on and mr lukisch resume he tinker with the clock 's inside he be very delicate and careful about it for these be the final touch preparatory to he leave the timepiece as a memento when he should quietly depart that evening shortly before nine what might happen after nine or rather on the stroke of nine be no worry of he though it might be and probably would be of the landlord 's provide that heartless extortioner survive it have complete he operation mr lukisch sit down in a rickety chair and gaze at the clock face to face with contemplative satisfaction stepfather time would have be interested in the contrast between those two physiognomy the clock 's face benign and bland would have deceive he but innocent though he be in the way of evil the man 's face might have warn he something within the clock 's mechanism click and check and go on again the sound quite unexpected give mr lukisch a bad start could something have go wrong with the combination suppose a premature release at that panic think something within mr lukisch 's bad heart click and check and do not go on again the fear in he eye fade and be succeed by a expression of surprise and inquiry whether the inquiry be answer nobody could have guess from the still unwinking regard on the face of the victim of heart failure by and by a crowd gather on the sidewalk draw by that mysterious instinct for sensation which attract the casual and the idle two bold spirit enter the door and stand hesitant just inside awed because the clock seem so startlingly alive in that place some one send upstairs for the landlord who arrive to bemoan the unjust fate which have not only mulct he of two month ' rent with nothing to show for it but a rickety clock but have also saddle he with a wholly superfluous corpse he abuse both indiscriminately but chiefly the clock because it give the effect of be sentient so fervently do he curse it

protest on that occasion have subsequently turn out to be far less antique than the worm hole in the woodwork -lrb- artificially blow in with powder -rrb- would have lead the unsuspecting to suppose but about the present legacy there could be no such question it be genuine it be old it be valuable it possess a seraphic note pitch true to the long-desired chord extract a ten-dollar note from he wallet stepfather time wave it beneath the landlord 's wrinkled and covetous nose the landlord capitulate willy woolly sniff at the clock with fur abristle lift up he voice and wail perhaps he delicate nose have already detect the faint unhallowed odor of the chemical within he stubbornly refuse to ride back in the cart with the new acquisition and be accuse of be sulky and childish \* \*

with its bland and hypocritical face and there thrice and no more it sound the passing of the hour with its sweet and false voice bide the stroke of nine meantime willy woolly settle down to keep watch on it and could not be move from that duty every time it strike the half he growl at the hour he bark and rage when stepfather time seek to draw he away to dinner he commit the unpardonable sin of dog-dom he snarl at he master turn this strange manifestation over in he troubled mind the collector decide that willy woolly must be ill and therefore that evening go to seek the little red doctor and he wisdom together they come across the park space opposite the house of silvery voice in time to witness the final scene the new clock strike the half after eight as they reach the turn in the

against the clock case he seem to be try to tear it open with he tooth willy cry he master in a tone such as i suppose the well-loved companion have not hear twice before in he life down willy the dog droop back but it be not in obedience for once he disregard the master 's command perhaps he do not even hear it in the absorption of he dread and rage step by step he withdraw then rush and launch himself straight at the timepiece slight though he bulk be the impetus of the charge do the work the clock reel topple and fall outward through the window then -- from the house of silvery voice rise a roar that smite the heaven a roar and a belch of flame and a spreading poisonous stench that strike the two man in the park to earth when they struggle to they foot again the smoke have part and the house of silvery voice gape open its front wall strip bodily away but within the sound of the busy industry of time go on uninterrupted weave and wobble on he foot stepfather time stagger toward the pot call on the name of willy woolly at the gate he stop put forth he hand and lift from the railing a wopsy woolly fragment no bigger than a sheet of note paper it be red and warm and wet he be go

the man who follow with intent unworldly eye that which i with my lesser vision could not discern and the unseen move swiftly about the desolate room low to the floor and seem finally to stop motionless beneath a caress hand i think to hear that dull measure thumping of a grateful tail but it be only the twelve apostle get ready to strike only once that night do stepfather time speak and then not to I tell she he say in a assure murmur that i sha not be long not-long not-long not-long not-long not-long confirm grandfather from he stance on the stairway in that assurance stepfather

levity pursuant of hopeless phantasm dupe of roseate and pernicious myth -lrb- love-at-first-sight and the like -rrb- butt of the high god ' stinging laughter deserving of nothing kinder than mockery from the aged and the wise -- which be doubtless why we old and sage folk thank heaven daily uplift crack voice and withered hand that we be no longer young a pious and fraudulent litany for which may we be forgive my young friend on the bench stir a shaft of moonlight streaming through the bush upon he face bewitch he to unguarded speech : dominie i have be dream fear to break the spell i stand silent a fairy come down to I and touch she lip to mine so lightly so softly do you know there be fairy in we square dominie always i think she name be happiness be there such a fairy in this world

religion the fourth dimension and one another yet i feel sure that i should see they both again there be a spell weave in we square -- it have hold I these sixty year and more and i wonder at time whether death himself can break it -- which draw back the heart that have once know the place it be a long month though before the butterfly flutter back more radiant than ever she look glowing softly in the brave November sun as she approach my bench but there be something indefinably wistful about she she say that she have come to satisfy she awaken appetite for the high art of r noovo as she

how dare you accuse I of such a thing on the circumstantial evidence of a pink rise petal but worse be come the charge be unprovoked and willful murder butterfly be strange creature this one seem far less concerned over the latter than the former accusation of whom she inquire you have kill a bud poet here i violate a sacred if imply confidence by relate what the bewitch sleeper on the bench have say under the spell of the moon the result be most gratifying the butterfly assure I with indignation that it be only a cold in she head which have be annoy she for day : _ that _ be what make she eye

of the butterfly 's alarm go slow slow have not i lose time enough already perhaps but now you have get all there be do not force the game you have frighten that poor child so that she never can feel sure what you be go to do next neither can i dominie confess the candid youth but you be quite right i 'll clamp on the brake i 'll be as cool and conventional as a slice of lemon on a iced clam ` how well you be look to-night miss leffingwell ' -- that 'll be my nearest approach to unguarded personality trust I dominie and thank you for the tip the memorial and erratic clock of we square be just striking seven of the follow morning meaning approximately eight-forty when my astonished eye again behold martin dyke seat on my bench beautifully though inappropriately clothe in full evening dress with a pink rise in he coat lapel and gaze at number 37 with a wild ecstatic glare what have you be do here all night i ask think i point to the flower where do you get that a fairy gift martin say i do you abide by my well-meant and inspired advice dominie reply the youth with a guilty flush i do my best i -- i try to you must not think -- nothing be settle it be only that -- it be only that age

worry there be thousand of home i suppose in which be bury just such letter as minnie 's farewell to she parent rebellious passionate yearning pitiful ah well the moth must break its chrysali the flower must rend its bond toward the light little minnie be go on the stage a garish and perilous stage it be whereon innocence play a part as sorry as it be brief and now she be make she exit without applause memory bring back a picture of minnie as i have first see she a wee thing blinking and smile in the arm of she madonna-faced mother on a bench in we square and the mother -lrb- who could not wait for the promise return -- she have lie in god 's acre these three year -rrb- croon to she a unforgettable song mournfully prophetic : why do i bring thee sweet into a world of sin -- into a world of wonder and doubt with sorrow and snare for the little white foot -- into a world whence the go out be as dark as the come in old lip readily lend themselves to memory i suppose i must have repeat the final line aloud for the pink man say wearily but politely : very pretty something more in the local line hardly i smile between bartholomew storr 's elegy and william young 's wish-maker ' town stretch a infinite chasm what be this -- now -- god 's acre the kid be talk about be he next question a old local graveyard anything interesting he ask carelessly if you be interested in that sort of thing be you a antiquary sure he reply with such offhand promptitude that i be certain the answer would have be the same have i ask he if he be a dromedary come along then i 'll take you there to reach that little green space of peace amidst we turmoil of the crowded encroach slum we must pass the bonnie lassie 's house where she tiny figurine touch with the fire of she love and she genius which be perhaps one and the same stand ever on guard look out over we square from she window judge by he appearance and conversation i should have suppose my companion to be as little concerned with art as with let we say poetry or local antiquity but he stop dead in he track before the first window finger that be like steel claw bury themselves in my arm the other hand point what be that he mutter fiercely that to which he be point be a pictorial bronze the figure of a girl upright in a cockleshell boat make of a rose-petal she arm outspread to the breeze that be bear she out across sunlit ripple beneath be the legend : far port the face eager laughing passionate adventurous be the face of minnie munn therein the bonnie lassie have be prophetess as well as poet and sculptress for she have finish the bronze before minnie leave we that i answer the strong pink man try to shake loose he grip be a sculpture by cecily willard otherwise mr cyrus staten what 'll she take for it it can not be buy i speak with authority for the figurine that the bonnie lassie set in she window be not for sale but for we of we square who love they anything can be buy he retort with he quiet hoarse persuasiveness at a price i have get the price no matter what it be suddenly i understand my pink and hard acquaintance i understand that stale look in he eye tear do not bring that nothing bring it but sleepless thought beyond the assuagement of tear behind such eye the heart be ache cold and the brain searing hot who should know better than i though the kindly year have bring they healing but here be a wound raw and fresh and savage i put my hand on he shoulder what be little minnie to you i ask and answer myself you be hine you be the man she marry yes i be chri hine you have bring she back to we i say stupidly she make I promise strange how we square bind the heartstrings of those who have once live in it to find it unendurable in life to yearn back to it in the hour of death many have know the experience so we tiny god 's acre shrink to a small fraction of human acreage through pressure of the encroach tenement have fill up until now it have space but for few more of the return law have be invoke and high and learn court appeal to for the jealously guard right to sleep there as minnie munn be so soon to sleep beside she mother i tell hine that i would see the bonnie lassie about the statuette and lead he on through the nagged and echo passage and the iron gate to the white-studded space of grave the new excavation show brown against the bright verdure above it stand the headstone of the munn solemn and proud the cost of a quarter-year 's salary at the pitiful wage which little broken mr munn draw from he municipal clerkship hine 's elegant coat ripple on he chest above what may have be a shudder as he look about he it be crowd he mutter we lie close as we live close in we square i be glad for she father 's sake that minnie wish to come back she say she could not rest peaceful anywhere else she say she have some sort of right to be here the munn belong to what we call the inalienable in we square say i and tell he of the high court decision which secure to the descendant of the original churchyard membership and to they alone the inalienable right to lie in god 's acre provide as in the ancient charter they have die in honorable estate i add : bartholomew storr as sexton have constitute himself watchdog of we grave and censor of we dead he carry one case to the supreme court in a attempt to keep a unhappy woman from sleep in that pious company that sour-faced prohibitionist growl mr hine employ what i suspect to be the blackest anathema in he lexicon be he the sexton the same we mortuary genius i confirm she be a good girl min be say mr hine firmly though it might appear a trifle inconsequentially : i do not care what they say anyway after i meet up with she in which qualify afterthought lay a whole sorrowful and veil history i wait what do they say about she down here he ask jealously oh there be rumor they do not reach she father no : tell I he persist i gotta know because mr hine have already impressed himself upon I as one with whom straight talk would serve best i accede bartholomew storr say that she foot take hold on hell mr hine 's face remain impassive only he hand work slightly perhaps knead a imaginary throat i perceive he to be a person of considerable and perhaps formidable self-control not that she have not she friend the bonnie lassie would have stand by she if she have come back and little mr morse and we dr smith and maclachan who think he have lose he own girl the same way and -- and other plenty and you dominie say the hard pink mr hine my dear sir old man can not afford harsh judgment they be too near they own time yeh say mr hine absently i guess that be right but he mind be plainly elsewhere when would you say would be the best time to do business with old funeral-clothes he ask after a thoughtful pause you want to see bartholomew storr i interpret sure i gotta deliver the death certificate to he if he run the graveyard have not i such be the procedure i believe besides he add with a leer i want to get some of that weepy poetry of he well he 'll sell it to you readily i 'll say he 'll sell it to I return mr hine with a grimness which i fail to comprehend now be as good a time as any to catch he in he office i point to a sign at the farther end of the yard mr hine seem in no hurry to go with he elegantly lacquered cane he pick at the sod undecidedly he chill veil eye rove about the open space he lift he pearl-gray derby and for lack of a handkerchief wipe he forehead with the back of he hand although the may day be cool and brisk with wind he knuckle glisten when they descend i begin to suspect that despite he stony self-command mr hine 's nerve be not all that they should be perhaps you would like I to introduce you to mr storr i hazard the cold and filmy eye gleam with a instant 's dim warmth dominie you be a good guy respond mr hine if a dead cinch at ten to one all fruit up for next week the kind of thing you do not hand on to you own brother would be any use to you -- no i be off again he apologize well -- let 's go we go at the doorstep of bartholomew storr 's office he pause this sexton-guy he say anxiously he do not play the pony ever i would not suppose no more often than he commit murder or go to sleep in church i smile yeh he answer dishearten i gotta get to he some other way on the poetry -- and that be out of my line i do not quite see what you difficulty be by what you tell I it be easier to break into a swell fifth avenue club than into this place except for those have the vested right as you wife have and this sexton-guy handle the concession for -- he be get the say-so he correct himself hastily -- on who go in and who stay out be that right substantially and he would rather keep 'em out than let 'em in bartholomew i explain consider that the honor of god 's acre be in he keep he have a fierce sort of jealousy about it as if he have a proprietary interest in the place i get you mr hine 's cord throat work painfully you do not suppose the old goat would slip min a blackball he gulp how can he as a ` inalienable ' -- yeh i know but be not there something about a clean record i 'll tell _ you _ dominie -- mr hine 's husky but assure voice trail away into a miserable thick whisper -- as to what he say -- about she foot take hold on hell -- i guess there be a time -- i guess about one more slip -- i guess i do not run across she any too quick but there never be a straighter truer girl than min be with I i gotta get she plant _ right _ dominie i gotta do it he conclude with pathetic earnestness i see no difficulty i assure he the charter specify ' _ die _ in honorable estate ' matrimony be a honorable estate how she live before that be between she and a gentler judge than bartholomew storr give she a straight course and a fair judge and i 'll back min to the limit say mr hine so simply and loyally that no suggestion of irreverence could attach to he nevertheless doubt be mingle with determination in he florid face as he ring the bell bartholomew storr open to we himself when he see I he hastily pocket a rhyming dictionary i introduce my companion state by way of a favorable opening that he be interested in memorial poetry very pleased say bartholomew storr in he deep lugubrious tone bereave husband mr hine nod here be a tasty thing i just complete continue the poet and extend a benignant hand toward the visitor he intone nasally : together we have live we life till thou hast go on high but i will come to thee dear wife in the sweet bye-and-bye that style five dollar he say you be on bark mr hine i 'll take it to be publish i suppose on the first anniversary of death shall i look after the insertion in the papers query the oblige poet who split a advertising agent 's percentage on memorial notice place by he sure get any more i would spend a hundred to do this right with a smile of astounded gratification bartholomew accept the roll of bill fresh and crisp as the visitor himself to do he justice i believe that he pleasure be due as much to the recognition of he genius as to the stipend it have earn perhaps you would like a special elegy to be read at the grave he rumble eagerly when and where do the interment take place the other glare at he in stony surprise it be not take place it be to-morrow be not you on i be hine a frown darken the sexton 's heavy feature he shake a reprehensive head a unfortunate case he boom most unfortunate i will not conceal from you mr hine that i have consult we attorney upon this case and unhappily -- unhappily i say -- they hold that there be no basis for exclusion provide the certificate be in form you have it with you impassive and inscrutable mr hine tap he breast-pocket the conscience of a responsible sexton be assuage bartholomew 's expression mollify into that of the flattered poet such be the case he pursue there can be no objection to the reading of a elegy as part of the service who be to officiate the reverend doctor hackett he have retire these two year say the sexton doubtfully he be very old he mind sometimes wander she would not have any one else assert the hard pink mr hine she be as particular about that as about be bury yonder he jerk he head toward the window very well i will be at the grave i always be trust I to guide the reverend gentleman over any breach in he memory excuse I for a moment while i look up my elegy say say mr hine in he hoarse confidential croak as the poet-sexton retire this be dead easy why the guy 's on the make for sale he 'll stand for anything pass out this stuff for other folk to sign he be a crook make no such mistake i advise bartholomew be as honest a man as life in he own belief very likely that be the worst kind pronounce the expert mr hine further commentary be cut off by the return of the sexton-poet if you will kindly give I the death certificate of the late lament say he what become of it after i deliver it ask mr hine read attest and file officially any one else but you see it not necessarily that be all right then hardly have bartholomew storr glance at the document receive from mr hine than he lift a stiffen face what be this he challenge what be what the official tap the paper with a gaunt finger ` minna merivale aged twenty-five ' he read that be the name she go by _ unmarried _ read bartholomew storr in a voice of doom well in the sexton 's eye gleam a unholy savagery of satisfaction take she away _ what _ bury she somewhere else do not think that you can pollute the ground -- bartholomew i break in step hastily in front of mr hine for i have see all the pink ebb out of he face leave it a dreadful sort of gray and i have no desire to be witness of a murder however much i might deem it justified i 'll handle he say mr hine steadily now you you get my hundred in you jeans be not you bribery boom the sexton he draw out the roll of bill and let it fall from he contaminate finger sure bribery rail the other what would you think be not it enough for what i be ask the two man glare at each other i break the silence exactly what be you ask mr hine file that -- he touch the document -- and forget it let min rest out there as my wife like she ought to have be why do not you make she you wife thunder the accuser some invisible thing grip the cord throat of mr hine could not he gulp there be -- another she would not divorce I you sin have find you out declare the self-constituted judge of the dead with a dismal sort of relish yeh that be all right _ i 'll _ pay for it but she be pay already as she live so she have die in sin the inexorable voice answer let she seek burial elsewhere mr hine lean forward he expression and tone be passionless as those of a statistician proffer a tabulation : he word be fit to wring the heart of a stone she be dead be not she he argue gently she can not hurt any one can she ` specially if they do not know bartholomew storr make a gesture of repulsion well who 'll she hurt pursue the other in he form of pure and abstract reasoning not she mother i guess she mother 's wait for she that be what min say when she be -- be go and she father 'll be on the other side of she and that be all min never harm anybody but herself when she be alive how 's she go to do 'em any damage now just lie there rest be reasonable man be pitiful oh man for there be a time not so long past when you with all you stern probity and you unwinking conscience need pity yes and plead for it when the mind be out of control think back bartholomew storr to the day when you stand by another grave close to that which wait to-day for the weary sleeper -- bartholomew storr rest open the door and stand by it grimly wait mr hine turn to I what be this thing dominie a man or a snake will i kill it bartholomew i begin when we -- not a word from you dominie my mind be make up the girl be isabel munn 's daughter i see a tremor shake the gaunt frame when we bury isabel munn you come back in the night to weep at she grave he thrust out a ward hand toward I why do you weep over isabel munn 's grave bartholomew speak no evil of the dead he cry wildly it be not in my mind she be a good and pure woman what would she have be if she have listen to you what do you know who betray I you yourself when you come down with pneumonia after the burial i sit with you through a night of delirium bartholomew storr bow he head my sin have find I out he groan god know i love she and -- and i have not the strength not to tell she i would have give up everything for she my hope of heaven my -- my -- i would have give up my office and go away from god 's acre and that be twenty year ago i -- i do not sleep o ' night yet for think well you be not the only one say the dull voice of mr hine you be tempting I bartholomew storr snarl at he you be try to make I false to my trust just to let she lie by she mother like she mother would ask you if she could do not say it to I he beat he head with he clenched hand recover command of himself he straighten up take a deep breath : i must be guide by my conscience and my god he say professionally and i note a more reverent intonation give to the former than to the latter a bad sign isabel munn 's daughter bartholomew i remind he instead of reply he stagger out of the door through the window we see he a moment later post down the street barehead and stony-eye like one spur by torment thought will he do it do you think query the anxious-visaged mr hine i shake my head in doubt with a man like bartholomew storr one can never tell old memory be restless companion for the old so i find they that night but there be balm for sleeplessness in the leafy quiet of we square i go out to my bench seek it and find a occupant already there we be not the only one that need a jab of dope dominie say mr hine hard and pink and hoarsely confidential as when i first see he no who else though i suspect of course old gloom he be over in the acre do you meet he there what do he say i duck he he never see I he be -- well i guess he be pray say mr hine shamefacedly pray at the munn grave that be it groan and say ' a sign o lord vouchsafe thy servant a sign ' keep say it over and over for guidance to-morrow i murmured mr hine i be not sure that i know bartholomew storr 's god nor can i tell what manner of sign he might give or with what meaning but if i know my god whom i believe to be the true god you minnie be safe with he yeh you be a good guy dominie say mr hine in he emotionless voice i take he home with I to sleep but we do not sleep we smoke minnie munn 's funeral morning dawn clear and fresh no word come from bartholomew storr i try to find he but without avail we 'll go through with it say mr hine quietly how small and insignificant seem we tiny god 's acre as the few mourner creep into it behind minnie munn 's body the gravestone like petty dot upon the teem earth dwarf by the overshadow tenement as if death be but a incident in the vast unhasting continuous sweep of life as indeed perhaps it be then the grandeur of the funeral service which link death to immortality be body forth in the aged minister 's tremble voice and by it the thing which be of life be dwarf to nothingness but my uneasy mind refuse to be bind by the word it be concern with bartholomew storr stand grim haggard inscrutable beside the grave he eye upturn and wait too well i know for what he be wait he sign so too do mr hine still hard still pink still impeccably tailor and still cling to he elegant lacquered cane as he support little broken mr munn very pathetic and decorous in full black even to the glove the sonorous beauty and simplicity of the rite suddenly check falter bartholomew storr lean over anxiously to the minister the poor gentle worn-out old brain be grope now in semi-darkness through which shoot a cross-ray of memory the tremulous voice take on new confidence but the marrow of my spine turn icy as i hear the fatally misplace and confuse word that follow : if any man know -- know just and good cause why this woman -- why this woman -- should not -- bartholomew storr 's gaunt hand shot upward high in air outspread in the gesture of forbiddance he deep voice ring overbear the stumble accent of the clergyman a sign a sign from on high o god thou hast speak through thy servant to forefend a sore offense listen ye people this woman -- he stop as there rise on the opposite side of the open grave another figure with hand and voice lift to heaven in what must surely have be the most ingenuous

rough intimacy of the slum do not cherish false shame about the major fact of life suppose she have query the youth sulkily why that 'll be all right you poor boob return the kindly mayme the judge 'll let she off with a warn how do you know they always do those case be common dolan ought to be can for makin ' a pinch of a lady in the fam ` ly way what if they do let she off lament the youth it

hurt he burst into the hectic grievance of the pampered and spoil child he family be just get a foothold in society -lrb- with a almost holy emphasis on the word -rrb- and now they be disgrace all be up they new precariously hold acquaintance would drop they in he petulant grief he do a amazing thing he produce a bunch of clipping from the local society column set forth in the print company of the shine one the doings -lrb- mostly charitable -rrb- of mr samuel berthelin she daughter mr harri and she son david refer to glowingly as the scion of the wealth and position of the late lament financier mayme be impress like most shop-girl she be a fervent reader of society news -lrb- if shop-girl do not read this fine flower of american democracy nobody would except those who wait eagerly and anxiously for they name to appear -rrb- she perceive -- not know that the advertising leverage of the berthelin loan agency have force those insecure portal of print for the entry of mr berthelin and she progeny -- that she be in the presence of the great capacity for awe be not in mayme 's independent soul but she be interested and sympathetic here be a career worth save let 's go over to the station-house say she i know some of the cop to the white building with the green lantern they go the shoplifting case it appear have already be bail out furthermore everything would be all right and there be little fear of publicity the store itself would see to that vastly relieved and refresh in spirit david berthelin begin to take stock of he companion with grow interest she be decidedly not pretty just as decidedly she be quaint and piquant and quite new to he jejune but also somewhat bored experience from the opening passage of they first conversation he deduce lack the insight to discriminate between honest frankness and immodesty that she be a fly kid on that theory he invite she to breakfast with he mayme accept they go to thomson 's élite restaurant on the corner where david rouse mingled awe and misgiving in the breast of polyglot elsa the cashier by order champagne and mayme reassure she by decline it thus begin a acquaintanceship which swiftly ripen into a queer sort of intimacy more than a little disturbing to we of we square who be interested in mayme young berthelin 's over-ornate roadster linger in we quiet precinct more often than appear to we suitable or safe and black-eyed mayme look demure and a little exalted be whirl away to unknown world always return however at respectable hour when the little red doctor remonstrate with she ostensibly on the score of she health she remind he in one breath that he have not be invite to censor she behavior which be entirely she own affair and in the next -- with he hand catch between hers and she voice low and caressing -- declare that he be the best little old doc in the world and there be nothing to worry about either as to health or conduct indeed she condition seem to be improve i dare say young mr berthelin 's expensive food be one of the thing she need furthermore she cease to be the raggle-taggle hoydenishly clad mayme of the cash department and have be promote to saleswoman quite go in for dress on this point she seek the advice of the bonnie lassie the result go far to justify my prophecy that mayme 's queer little face might yet make its share of trouble in a impressionable world but the bonnie lassie shake she bonnie head privately and say that the fine-feather development be a bad sign and that if young berthelin would obligingly run he seventeen-jeweled roadster off the williamsburgh bridge with himself in it much trouble might be save for all concern if little mayme be head for trouble she go to meet it with a smile face never have she seem so joyous so fill with the desire of life this much be to be count on the credit side the little red doctor say on the debit side -- well to I be depute the unwelcome task of convey the solemn and as it be official protest and warning of we square of course i do it at the worst possible moment it be early one morning when mayme on she bench be look a little hollow-eyed and disillusioned i essay the light and jocular approach to the subject : well mayme how be the ardent swain she turn to I with the old flash in she big shadowed eye : do you say swain or swine dominie ah say i have he change he rôle he be give himself away if that be what you mean i think that would come he -- he want I to take a trip to boston with he i consider this bit of information which be not as surprising or unexpected as mayme appear to deem it have you tell the little red doctor doc would kill he say mayme simply what better reason for tell oh the poor kid : he do not know any better do not he in any case i trust that you know better after this than to have anything more to do with he yep i have cut he out reply mayme listlessly i figure you and doc be right dominie it be no good he kind of game not for girl like I she look up at I with limpid eye in which there be courage and determination and suffer my dear i murmured i hope it be not go to be too hard he be so pretty say mayme mccartney wistfully so he be now that i come to think of it with he clear dark color he wavy hair he languish brown eye he almost girlishly graceful figure and he beautiful clothes he be pretty enough to fascinate any inexperienced imagination but i can not say that he look pretty when a few day later he invade we square in search of a mayme who have vanish beyond he ken -lrb- she have keep she tenement domicile a secret from he -rrb- and address I as you white-whiskered old goat accuse I of have come between he and the girl upon whom he have deign to bestow he lordly favor unfortunately for he the little red doctor chance along just then and inquire none too deferentially what the scion of wealth and position be do in that quarter what business be it of yours red-head counter the offended visitor he then listen with distaste but perforce -lrb- for what else could he do in the grasp of a man of twice he power -rrb- to a brilliant and convincing summary of he character terminate in a withering sketch of he personal and sartorial appearance i do not mean the kid any harm argue the scion suavely i -- i come back to apologize let I catch you snoop around here again and i 'll break every bone in you body the little red doctor answer he i guess this square 's free to everybody i guess you do not own it say the youth retreat to he car notwithstanding the unimpeachable exactitude of this surmise he be see no more in that locality judge then of we dismay locally at learn not a fortnight later from a fellow employee of mayme 's that she have be meet at close time by a swell young guy in a cherry-colored rattler who take she away to dine with he catechize upon the point later on by a self-appointed committee of two consist of the little red doctor and myself mayme say vaguely that it be all right we do not understand this be i believe the usual formulum the last half of it at least be true about that time we in common with the rest of the nation take that upon we mind which be even more important than mayme mccartney 's love affair war loom imminently before we it be only a question of the fitting time to strike and we square be feverishly reckon up its military capacity the great day of the declaration come the nation have draw the sword in the week follow we square be invade she descend upon we from the somber sumptuousness of a gigantic limousine the majestic the impose the formidable the authoritative mr s berthelin we know at once who she be because she lead by the ear as it be she hopeful progeny young david i do not mean that she have a actual auricular grip on he but the effect upon he woe-begone and brow-beaten person be the same he suggest vividly a spoil and pretty lapdog be sternly convey to a detested bath she suggest a vivified bouquet of artificial flower we hastily rally we force to meet she the little red doctor the bonnie lassie and myself mr berthelin open she exordium in a tone of high philippic not even await the formality of introduction but when i insist upon these and she learn that the bonnie lassie be mrs cyrus staten she cringe despite a desire to keep out of the society column quite as genuine as that of mr berthelin 's to get in the cyrus staten frequently figure among the shine one a fact almost painfully appreciate by we visitor after that it be easy to get she into the bonnie lassie 's house where she eloquence could not draw a crowd to get young david there be not quite so easy he make one well-timed and almost successful effort to bolt and even evince sign of balk on the step he punishment be await he no sooner be we all settle in the bonnie lassie 's studio than the mother proceed to regale we with a history and forecast of he career begin with he precocious infant lisping and terminate with he project though wholly indefinite marriage into the highest social circle to do david justice he squirm have you get he a job as a general in the army yet ma'am inquire the little red doctor suavely it be quite lose upon mr berthelin she inform we that a commission as captain in the quartermaster 's department be arrange for and she expect to have the young officer assign to new york so that he could live at home in the comfort and luxury suitable to he wealth and condition and what she want we to understand clearly be that no design little gutter-snipe be to be allow to compromise david 's future she conclude with a imaginative and most unflattering estimate of mayme mccartney 's character manners and moral in the midst of which i hear a gasp it come from mayme standing wide-eyed and white in the doorway the front door have be leave ajar and see the berthelin ' monogrammed car outside she have come in the oratress turn and stare that be a lie say mayme mccartney steadily i be as straight a girl as you own

berthelin and this be the girl she look mayme up and down mayme do the same by she and do it better i could give you a lorny-yette and beat you at the frozen-stare trick say the irrepressible mayme at the conclusion of the duel which end in she favor the little red doctor gurgle i see the bonnie lassie 's eyelid quiver but she face be cold and impassive as she turn to the visitor mr berthelin say she you have make some very damaging statement before witness about miss mccartney 's character what proof have you why he want to _ marry _ she almost yell the mother she be trap he that be another lie say mayme he tell I himself that he be go to marry you do he then he be wrong i would not marry he with a brass ring assert mayme you would not mar -- you would not _ what _ demand the mother

nose green and frequent dubious cellar call for explanation the explanation be barbran barbran come to we from the immeasurable distance to wit washington square let I confess at once that we be a bit supercilious in we attitude toward the sister square far to we west across the alp of broadway we square be a established center of the social respectability when the foot of fifth avenue be still frequent by the occasional cow whose wanderings be responsible for the street-plan of greenwich village we square remain true to the ancient and simple tradition whereas washington square have grow long hair smear its finger with paint and its lip with free verse and go into debt for its inconsiderable laundry bill washington square we suspect of play at life we square have a sufficiently hard time live it we have little in common nevertheless it must be admit that there be veritable human not wholly submerge in the crowd of self-conscious mummer who crowd the occidental park-space and it be at the house of one of these a woman architect with a golden dream of rebuild greenwich village street by street into something simple and beautiful and in the larger sense urban that the bonnie lassie whose artistic deviation often take she far afield meet barbran they go for coffee to a queer little burrow decorate with improve sentiment from the immortal lewi carroll which barbran tell the bonnie lassie be make its blue-smocked bobbed-haired attractive and shrewd little proprietress quite rich barbran hint that she be think of improve on the mole 's hole idea if she could find a suitable location not so much for the money of course -- she tone imply a lordly indifference to such consideration -- as for the fun of the thing the bonnie lassie be amuse but not impressed what do impress she about barbran be a certain gay yet restful charm the sort of difficult thing that we indomitable sculptress love to catch and fix in she wonderful little bronze she set about catch barbran now the way of a snake with a bird be as nothing for fascination compare to the way of the bonnie lassie with the doom person whom she have mark down as a subject barbran hesitate capitulate come to the bonnie lassie 's house mouse about we square in a rapt manner and stay she rent a room from the angel of death -lrb- bogg kill bug be the remainder of he sign which be consider to lend tone and local interest to he whole side of the square -rrb- just over madame tallafferr 's apartment and in the course of time stop at my bench and look at I contemplatively she be a small person with shy soft eye the bonnie lassie send you say i she nod you have come here to live -- heaven only know why -- but we be glad to see you and you want to know about the people so the bonnie lassie say ` ask the dominie he land here from the ark ' do not she barbran sit down and smile at I have seek information i pursue on my own account i learn that you be the only daughter of a western millionaire ranch-owner how do it feel to revel in million romantic say she of course you have design upon we yes humanitarian artistic or sociological oh nothing long and clever like that you grow more interesting have design upon we you doubtless wish my advice no she answer softly : i have do it already rash and precipitate adventuress what have you do already start my design i have rent the basement of number 26 be you a rag-picker in disguise i be go to start a coffee cellar i be think of call it ` the coffee pot ' what do you think so you do wish my advice i will give it to you do you see that plumber 's shop next to the corner saloon i point to the avenue whose ceaseless stream of humanity flow past we square without ever sweep we into its current that be once a tea-shop it be start by a dear little prim little old maiden lady the saloon be run by tough bill manigan the little old lady have a dainty sign paint and hang it up outside she place ` the teacup ' tough bill take a board and paint a sign and hang it up outside _ he _ place ` the hiccup ' the dear little prim little old maiden lady take down she sign and go away yet there be those who say that competition be the life of trade be there a moral to you story mr dominie take it or leave it say i amiably i will not call my cellar ` the coffee pot ' lest a worse thing befall it you be a sensible young woman miss barbara ann waterbury it be true that my parent name I that say she but my friend call I ` barbran ' because i always use to call myself that when i be little and i want to be call barbran here that be very friendly of you i observe she give I a swift suspicious look you think i be a fool she observe calmly but i be not i be go to become a local institution a local institution can not be call barbara ann waterbury unless it be a crêche or a drinking-fountain or something like that can it it can not barbran thank you mr dominie say barbran gratefully she then proceed to sketch out for I she plan for make she coffee cellar and herself a local institution which should lure hopeful seeker for bohemia from the far part of harlem and jersey city and even such outer realm of darkness as new haven and coho that be what i intend to do say barbran as soon as i get my great idea work out what the great idea be i be to learn later and from other lip in fact from the lip of young phil stacey who appear rather elaborately loitering out from behind the fountain shortly after my new friend have depart a peculiar look upon he extremely plain and friendly face young mr stacey be notable if for no other reason than that he represent a flat artistic failure on the part of the bonnie lassie who have try he in bronze in plaster and in clay with equal lack of success there be something untransferable in the boy 's face perhaps its outshine character i know that i never yet have say to any woman who know he no matter what she age condition or sentimental predilection be not he a homely cub that she do not reply indignantly : he be _ sweet _ now when woman -- wonderful woman like the bonnie lassie and stupid woman like mr rosser the twin ' aunt and fastidious woman like madame tallafferr -- unite in term a smile human freckle _ sweet _ there be nothing more to be say adoni may as well take a back seat and the apollo belvedere seek the helpful resource of a beauty parlor say young phil carelessly : dominie who be the newcomer that say i be barbran barbran he repeat with a rise inflection it sound like a breakfast food as she pronounce it it sound like a strain of music say i what be the rest of she name i be not officially authorize to communicate that be you officially authorize to present you friend to she on what do you base you claim to acquaintanceship my boy i ask austerely oh claim well you see a couple of day ago she be on the cross-town car and i -- well i just happen to notice she you know that be all yet i be inform on good and sufficient authority that she appearance be not such as to commend she visually if i may so express myself to the discriminate eye who be the fool -- begin mr stacey hotly tut-tut my young friend say i certain lady whom we both esteem can and will prove to the satisfaction of the fair-minded that none of the young person 's feature be exactly what it should be or precisely where it ought to be nevertheless the net result be surprising and even gratify she be a peach asseverate my companion substantially what i be remark as for you other hint you need no introduction to barbran nobody do _ what _ phil stacey 's plain face become ugly a hostile light glitter in he eye what do you mean by that he growl simply that she be about to become a local institution she be plot against the peace and security of we square to the extent of start a coffee-house at number 26 no cry phil joyously good news as a fad she be a bud millionairess from the west no growl phil he face fall bad news eh it occur to I that she might want some decoration and that you might be the one to do they in he leisure hour my young friend who be a expert accountant by trade -lrb- the term expert appear to be rather a empty compliment since he stipend be only twenty-five dollar a week -rrb- perpetrate impressionistic decoration and scenery for such minor theater as will endure they you be a grand old man dominie say he let 's go we go we find barbran we converse half a hour later when i leave they -- without any strenuous protest on the part of either -- they be deeply engross in a mutual discussion upon decoration religion the high cost of live free verse two-cent transfer charley chaplin aviation ouija and other equally safe topic do i say safe dangerous be what i mean for when a youth who be as homely as young phil stacey and in that particular style of homeliness and a girl who be as far from homely as barbran begin at first sight to explore each other 's opinion they be venture into a dim and haunt region light by will-o ' - the-wisp and beset with peril and pitfall usually they smile as they go phil be smile as i leave they so be barbran i may have smile myself anything but a smile be on phil stacey 's normally cheerful face when some three day thereafter he come to my room dominie say he i want to tap you library have you get any of the work of harvey wheelwright god forbid say i phil look surprised be it as bad as that i do not suppose there be anything wrong with the stuff do not you imperil you decent young soul with it i advise earnestly it reek of poisonous piety the world he paint be so full of nauseating virtue that any self-respecting man would rather live in hell he character all talk like a sunday-school picnic out of the rollo book no such people ever live or ever could live because a righteously enraged populace would have kill 'em in early childhood he be the smuggest fraud and best seller in the united state wheelwright the crudest shrewdest most preposterous panderer to weak-minded -- whew help i do not know what i be start protest my visitor as a literary critic you be some big bertha dominie i begin to suspect that you do not care a awful lot about mr wheelwright 's style of composition just the same i have get to read he all of he do you think i 'll find he stuff in the penny circulator my poor lose boy probably not it be doubtless all out in the hand of eager reader however phil contrived to round it up somewhere the awful and unsuspected result i beheld on my first visit of patronage to barbran 's cellar the occasion be the formal open a large and curious crowd of five person include myself and phil stacey be there outside a old english design of a signboard with a wheel on it creak despairingly in the wind below be a legend : _ at the sign of the wheel _ -- _ the wrightery _ the interior of the cellar be decorate with scene from the novel of harvey wheelwright triumphant virtue discomfited villain benignant blessing chaste embrace edify death-bed and orange-blossom they be unsigned but well i know whose be the shame over the fireplace hang a frame letter from the great soul it begin dear young friend and admirer and end yours for the light harvey wheelwright the guest do as well as could be expect they eat and drink everything in sight they then leave that be to say four of they do finally phil depart glower at I i be a patient soul no sooner have the door slam behind he than i turn to barbran who be look discourage well what have you to say in you defense the way barbran 's eyebrow go up constitute in itself a defense fit to move any jury to acquittal for what she ask for corrupt my young friend stacey you make he paint those picture they be very nice return barbran demurely quite true to the subject they be awful they be a offense to civilization they be a insult to we square of all subject in the world harvey wheelwright why barbran why why why business say barbran explain please say i i get the idea from a friend of mine in washington square she get up a little cellar café build around alice alice in wonderland you know and the look glass though i do not suppose a learn and serious person like you would ever have read such nonsense it happen to be Friday and there be not a hippopotamus in the house i murmured oh say barbran brighten well i think if she could do it with alice i could do it with harvey wheelwright in the name of hatta and the march hare _ why _ because for every one person who read alice nowadays ten read the author of ` reborn through righteousness ' and ` call by the cause ' be not it so mathematically unimpeachable therefore i ought to get ten time as many people as the other place do not you think so she inquire wistfully who be i to withhold a comforting fallacy from a hopeful soul undoubtedly i agree but do you love he who say barbran with a start the faint pink color run up she cheek harvey wheelwright of course whom do you think i mean he be a very estimable writer return barbran primly quite ignore my other query good-night barbran say i sadly i be go out to mourn you lose soul one might reasonably expect to find peace and quiet in the vicinity of one 's own particular bench at 1145 pm in we square but not at all on this occasion there sit phil stacey i challenge he at once what do you do it for to do he justice he do not dodge or pretend to misunderstand pay say he phil do you take money for that stuff not exactly i be take it out in trade i be go to eat there you 'll starve to death i have not get much of a appetite the inevitable effect of overfeed on sweet a uninterrupted diet of harvey wheelwright -- do not speak the swine 's name implore phil or i 'll be sick you have sell you artistic birthright for a mess of pottage probably indigestible at that i do not care he aver stoutly i do not care for anything except -- dominie who tell you she father be a millionaire it be well know i say vaguely he be a cattle king or a emperor of sheep or the sultan of the piggery or something a good thing for barbran too if she expect to keep she cellar go the kind of people who read har -- we unmentionable author do not frequent bohemian coffee cellar they would regard it as reckless and abandon debauchery barbran have shoot at the wrong mark the place have get to be a success declare phil between he tooth he plain face express a sort of desperate determination otherwise the butterfly will fly back west i suggest the boy wince what man could do to make it a success phil stacey do and heroically not only do he eat all he meal there but he go forth into the highway and byway and hale in other patron -lrb- whom he privately pay for -rrb- to a extent which threaten to exhaust he mean we square be conservative not to say distrustful in its bearing toward innovation thornsen 's élite restaurant have always suffice for we inner craving we be i suppose too old to change nor do harvey wheelwright exercise a inspirational sway over we we let the little millionairess and she washington square importation pretty well alone she advertise feebly in the where to eat column catch a few stray outlander but for the most part people do not come until the first of the month that be then too many come they bring they bill with they evening after evening barbran and phil stacey sit in the cellar almost or quite alone so far as i could judge from my occasional visit of patronage -lrb- barbran furnish excellent sweet cider and cake for late comer -rrb- they endure the lack of custom with fortitude not to say indifference but in the morning she soft eye look heavy and once as she be pass my bench deep in thought i surprise a look of blank terror on she face one can understand that even a millionaire 's daughter might spend sleepless night brood over a failure but that look of mortal dread how well i know it how often have i see it precede some sordid or brave tragedy of want and wretchedness in we square what should it mean though on barbran 's sunny face puzzling over the question i put it to the bonnie lassie read I a riddle o lady of the wise heart of what be a child of fortune young strong and charming afraid at the time we be pass the house in which the insecticidal angel of death take carefully select and certify lodger i know whom you mean say the bonnie lassie point up to the little dormer window which be barbran 's outlook on life interpret I a signal what do you see up there it appear to be a handkerchief paste to the window say i adjust my glass upside down say the bonnie lassie how can a handkerchief be upside down i inquire in what be intend to be a tone of sweet reasonableness contempt be all that it bring I metaphorically of course it be a signal of distress in what distress can barbran be in what kind of distress be most people who live next under the roof in we square she be do that just to get into we atmosphere she tell I so herself a millionaire 's daughter -- do millionaire ' daughter wash they own handkerchief and paste they on window to dry do any woman in or out of we square _ ever _ soak she own handkerchief in she own washbowl except when she be desperately save penny do you ever wash one single handkerchief in you room dominie certainly not it be not manly then you think she be not a millionairess look at she shoe when next you see she answer the bonnie lassie conclusively _ i _ think the poor little thing have put she every cent in the world into she senseless cellar and she be go under but good heaven i exclaimed something have get to be do it be go to be who be go to do it I return the bonnie lassie who be least grammatical when most purposeful then say i the fate may as well shut up shop and providence take a day off the universe have temporarily change its management can i help the bonnie lassie focus she gaze in a peculiar manner upon the exact center of my countenance a sort of fairy grin play about she lip i wonder if -- no she sigh no i do not think it would do dominie anyway i have get six without you include phil stacey of course retort the bonnie lassie it be he who come to I for help i be really do this for he i think you be do it for barbran oh she be just a transpose washington squarer answer the tyrant of we square though she be a dear kiddie too underneath the nonsense do i understand -- i

handkerchief dip in turpentine she gently rub it clean it then look -lrb- as she say later in a feeble attempt to palliate she subsequent conduct -rrb- very pink and boyish and pathetic but somehow faithful and reliable and altogether lovable so she kiss it then she try to run away the attempt fail it be not barbran 's nose that get kiss next nor for that matter be it young phil 's then he hold she off and shut he eye for the untrammeled exercise of he reasoning power and again demand of barbran and the fate : what be the use what be the use of what return barbran tremulously of all this you father 's a millionaire and i will not -- i can not -- he be not cry barbran and you can -- you will he be not ejaculate phil what be he he be a school-teacher and i have not get a thing but debt phil receive this untoward news as if a flock of angel ring joy bell have just bring he the gladdest tiding in history after a interlude he say : but why -- because say barbran burrow she nose in he coat : i think it would be a asset i think people would consider it romantic and it would help business see how much that reporter make of it phil wh-wh-why be you treat I like a -- a -- a -- dumbbell for he have thrust she away from he at arm 's - length again there be one other thing between we barbran if there be it be you fault what be it harvey wheelwright he say solemnly do you really like that sickening slush-slinger she raise to he eye in which a righteous hate quiver i loathe he i have always loathe he i despise the very ink he write with and the paper it be print on when i happen in a few minute later they be ritually burn the dear friend and admirer letter in a slow candle-flame and harvey wheelwright as represent by he unctuously roll signature be writhe in merit torment between they they tell I they little romance and he be not go to kansas city say barbran defiantly i be not go anywhere ever away from barbran say young phil and he be go to paint what he want to picture of barbran say young phil and we be go to burn the wheel sign in effigy and wipe off the wall and _ make _ the place a success say barbran and we be go to be marry right away say phil next week say barbran what do you think say both now i know what i ought to have say just as well as maclachan himself i should have point out the folly and recklessness of marry on twenty-five dollar a week and a dowry of debt i should have preach prudence and caution and delay and have point out -- the wind blow the door open : young spring be in the park and the wet odor of little burgeon leaf be bear in waken unwithered memory in my withered heart bless you my child say i it be actually for this as hold out encouragement to they reckless feckless plan that wisdom in the person of maclachan the tailor reprehend I rather than for my historical intention regard the pair what 'll they be marryin ' on demand mac wisdom -- that be to say maclachan spring and youth i say the fragrance of lilac in the air the glow of romance in they heart what better would you ask a bit of prudence say maclachan prudence i retort scornfully the miser of the virtue it may pay its own way through the world but when do it ever take happiness along for a jaunt i be quite pleased with my little epigram until the scot counter upon I with he observation about two young fool and a old one oh well likely enough most unwise and rash and inexcusable that headlong mate and there will be a reckoning to pay baby probably and new need and press anxiety and love will perhaps flutter at the window when want show he grim face at the door and wisdom will be justified of he foreboding and yet -- and yet -- who be i old and lonely and uncompanioned yet once touch with the spheral music and the sacred fire that i should subscribe to the dour orthodoxy of maclachan and that ilk year and year ago a bird fly in at my window a bird of wonderful and flash hue and of lilting melody it come it tarry -- and i let the chill voice of prudence overbear its music it leave I but the song endure the song endure and all life have be the richer for its echo so let they hold and cherish they happiness the two young fool as for the old one would that some good fairy possess of the pigment and secret of perishable youth might come down and paint he nose green plooie of we square whenever plooie go shuffling by my bench i use to think of a old and melancholy song that my grandfather sing : and he skin be so thin you could almost see he bone as he run hobble -- hobble -- hobble over the stone before i could wholly recapture the quaint melody my effort would invariably be nullify by the raucous shriek of he trade which have forever fix the nickname whereby we square know plooie : parapluie-ee-ee-ee-ee à raccommoder he would then recapitulate in english or rather that unreproducible dialect which be he substitute for it oombrellum for mend annie oombrellum for mend so he would pass on he way shatter the peaceful air at half-minute interval with he bilingual disharmony he be pallid meagerly build stoop-shouldered bristly-haired pock-marked and stiff-gaited with a face which would have be totally insignificant but for a obstinate chin and a pair of velvet-black pathetically question eye and he be incurably a outlander for five year he have live among we occupy a cubbyhole in schepstein 's basement full of rib handle crook patch and spring without appreciably improve he speech or he position it be say that he name be garin -- nobody really know or care -- and it be assume from he speech that he be french few umbrella come he way those of we affluent enough to maintain such non-essential patch they ourselves until they be beyond reclamation why plooie do not starve be one of the mystery of we square though by no mean the only one of its kind i have a notion that the bonnie lassie to whom any variety of want or helplessness be its own sufficient recommendation drum up trade for he among she uptown friend something certainly enlist he gratitude for he invariably take off he frowsy cap when he pass she house whether or not she be there to see and he once unbosome himself to I to the extent of declare that she be a kind lady this be the only commentary i ever hear he make upon any one in we square which in turn completely ignore he until the development of he love affair stimulate we condescending and contemptuous interest the object of plooie 's address be a little swiss of unknown derivation and obscure history she appear to be as detach from the surrounding world as the umbrella-mender himself a insignificant bit of a thing she be anaemic and subdue with a sad little face soft hazel eye slightly cross and the deprecating manner of those who scrub other people 's doorstep at fifteen cent a hour for a year they courtship if such it might be term run a uneventful course i have almost say unromantic but who shall tell where be fancy breed or wherein romance consist whenever plooie see the drabble little worker busy on a doorstep he would cross over and open the conversation accord to a invariable formulum annie oombrellum for mend annie oombrellum thereby the little swiss become know as and ever will be call locally annie oombrellum like most close-knit centripetal community we have a fatal penchant for nickname in we square she would look up and smile wanly and shake she head where indeed should the like of she get a umbrella to be mend then would he say -- i shall not attempt to torture the good english alphabet into a reproduction of he singular phonetics : it make fine to-day it do and she would reply yes a fine day and look as if the sun be a little warmer upon she pale skin because of plooie 's greet as perhaps indeed it be after that he would nod solemnly or if feeling especially loquacious venture some prophecy concern the morrow before resume he unproductive round and he lugubrious yawp one day he discover that she speak french from that time the relationship advance rapidly on christmas he give she a pair of red woolen glove on new year 's he take she walking among the tombstone in god 's acre which be a serious and sentimental not to say determinative social step twice in the follow week he carry she bucket from house to house and in the glowing dusk of a crisp winter afternoon they sit together hand in hand on a bench back of my habitual seat and look in each other 's eye and speak infrequently in they own language forgetful of the rest of the world include myself who be perhaps suppose not to understand but even without hear they word i could have guess it be very simple and direct and rather touch plooie say : if one marry themselves and she reply : i believe it well they kiss solemnly and they face in the gleam of the electric light which at that moment splutter into ill-timed and tactless activity be transfigure so that i marveled at the dim splendor of they but the bonnie lassie be scandalize on general principle she mistrust that any marriage be really make in heaven unless she act as earthly agent of it what have those two poverty-stricken little creature to marry on she put the question rhetorically to we square in general and to the two people most concern in particular court of law might have reject they reply as irrelevant humanly however they be convince enough say plooie : who will have a care of that little one if i have not say annie oombrellum : he be so lonely so those two unfortunate unite they misfortune and lo happiness come of it luckily that be all that do come of it what disposition the pair would have make of child have any arrive it be difficult to conjecture only by miraculous compression of rib handle and fabric be space contrived in the basement cubbyhole for annie oombrellum to squeeze in however she set up housekeeping cheerily as a bird with a odd lot of pot and pan which schepstein have pick up at a auction and resell to they at not more than two hundred per cent profit plus a kerosene stove the magnificent wedding gift of the bonnie lassie and she husband cyrus the gaunt twice a week they have meat they be rise in the social scale habitude be the real secret of tolerance as we become accustomed to plooie we square cease to resent he invincible outlandishness we endure he with equanimity although it would be exaggeration to say that we accept he and we certainly do not patronize he professionally nevertheless in a minor degree he nourish annie oombrellum must have lavish care upon he he pinched-in shoulder broaden perceptibly he gait still a halt shuffle grow noticeably brisker there be even a heartier note in he lamentable trade cry : parapluie-ee-ee-ee-ee à raccommoder as for annie oombrellum have some one to look after quite transform she she grow plump and chirpy and bustling as a blithe little sparrow though perhaps duck would be a happier comparison for she be dabble and splash in water all the day long make the stair and porch of she curatorship fairly glisten with cleanliness she rate go up to twenty cent a hour there be rumor that she have start a savings account life stretch out before the little couple smooth and peaceful and sunny with companionship then come the war the calamitous quality of a great world tragedy be that it bring to so many helpless little folk bitter and ignoble tragedy of shame and humiliation and misunderstand with a few racial exception we square be vehemently pro-ally in spirit we fight with valiant france and pray for heroic belgium what a godspeed we give to the few son of gaul who in those early day leave we to fight the good fight how sourly we look upon plooie continue he peaceful round whence arise the rumor i can not say but it be noised about just at that time of wrath and tension that plooie be bear in liège liège that city of fire and slaughter and heroism upon which the eye and hope of the world be turn in wonder and admiration somebody have see the entry on the marriage register the bonnie lassie tell I of it pause at my bench with a little furrow between she bright eye dominie you know emile garin pretty well not at all i reply fail to identify the rickety plooie by he rightful name of course you do never a morning but he stop at you bench and ask if you have a umbrella to mend i never have what of he have you any influence with he not compare with yours the bonnie lassie make a little gesture of despair i can not find he and annie oombrellum will not tell I where he be she only cry that be bad you think he -- he be -- why do not you say it outright dominie _ you _ think he be hide really i expostulated you come to I with accusation against the poor fellow and then undertake to make I responsible for they i do not believe it be true at all aver the bonnie lassie loyally i do not believe plooie be a coward there be some reason why he do not go over and help i want to know what it be perceive that i be expect to provide excuse for the err one i do my best over age i suggest he be only thirty-two bless I he look sixty well -- physical infirmity he can carry a load all day he will not leave annie oombrellum then or perhaps she will not let he when i ask she she cry harder than ever and say that she mother be french and she would go and fight herself if they would have she then i give it up what do you olympian wisdom make of it i do not know but i be afraid the garin be go to have trouble within a few day plooie reappear and he strident falsetto appeal for trade ring shrill in the space of we square trouble develop at once small boy boo at he call he yellow and advise he to go carefully there be a german behind the next tree henrus dumain we little old french david who fight the tragic duel of tooth and claw with he german jonathan in thornsen 's élite restaurant sting he with that most insulting word in any known tongue -- lâche -- and threaten he with uplift cane and poor plooie slink away but i think it be the fact that he who stay at home when other go forward have set a picture of albert of belgium in the window of he cubbyhole that most exasperated we against he tactless to say the least he call grow quavery and furtive annie oombrellum cease to sing at work matter look ill for the garin the evil come to a head the week after david and jonathan break off all relation perhaps that tragedy of shatter friendship -lrb- afterward rejoin through the agency of the great peacemaker death -rrb- have get on we nerve ordinarily have plooie chase a small boy who have tip a barrel down he basement step nothing would have come of it but the chase take he into the midst of a group of the younger and more boisterous element return from a business meeting of the gentleman 's son of avenue b and before he could turn they have surround he here be we little ` ee-ro looka the frenchy that will not fight safety first hey plooie charge umbrella -- backward march plooie do he best to break for a run through which be the worst thing he could have try they collar he by that contact he become they captive they prey what to do with he to loose a prisoner once in the hand be a unthinkable anti-climax somebody develop a inspirational thought : ride he on a rail near by a house front under repair supply a scantling plooie be hustle upon it he fall off they jam he back again he cling wide-eyed white-faced and silent the mob for it be that now bear he with jeer and joke and ribaldry along the edge of the park when they come within my ken he be ride high and the mob be be augmented momentarily from every quarter i look about for terry the cop but terry be elsewhere it be not beyond the bound of reasonable probability that he have absent himself on purpose god hate a coward be a tenet of terry 's creed i confess to a certain sympathy with it myself after all a harsh lesson might not be amiss for plooie the recusant compose my soul to a non-intervention policy i lean back on my bench when a pitiful sight ruin my neutrality along the outer edge of the compact mob trot little annie oombrellum from time to time she dash herself blindly against that human wall which repulse she not too roughly and with indulgent laughter they concern be not with she it be with the coward they prisoner deliver by fate to the stern decree of mob justice i could hear he voice now call out to she in they own language across the supervene head : do not have fear my little one they do I no harm go you home little cat soon i come also do not fear from he forehead run a little stream of blood but there be that in he face which tell I that if he be fearful it be only for she he voice steady and piercing override the clamor of the crowd i begin to entertain doubt as to he essential cowardice annie oombrellum dumb with misery and terror only dash herself the more hopelessly against the barrier of body even the delight of rail-ride a victim become monotonous in time the

be save from a raid a more practical expedient now evolve from the collective brain duck be in the fountain _ drown _ he in the fountain amend a enthusiast whoop with delight the mob turn toward the gate this be become dangerous that there be no real intent to drown the unfortunate umbrella-mender i be well satisfied but mob intent be subject to mob impulse if they once get he into the water the temptation of the playful to push he head under just once more might be too strong plainly the time be ripe for intervention owe to some enthusiastically concerted but ill-directed engineering the scantle with its human burden have jam crosswise of the post now if ever be the opportunity for eloquence of dissuasion for the heroic rôle of horatius at the bridge i be ill-fitted both by temperament and the fullness of year nevertheless i advance into the imminent deadly breach and raise the appeal to reason the result be unsatisfactory some hoot other laugh never mind the dominie yell inky mike lay hold of the rail by a end and haul it around he do not mean nothin ' old bone be no match for young barbarism the rush through the gate brush I aside like a feather i see the tragi-comic parade go by as i lean against a support tree : the advance guard of clamorous urchin the rail-bearer the white-faced figure of plooie jolt aloft bleeding but calm self-forgetful and still call out reassurance to he wife the jostle rabble and upon the edge of it a frantic woman claw sob implore on they sweep i listen for the splash it do not come a lion have rise in the path to be more accurate a lioness to my unsuccessful rôle of horatius a horatium better fit for the fray have succeed in the austere and superb person of madame rachel pinckney pemberton tallafferr aforetime of the sovereign state of virginium where all my eloquence have fail she check that joyously anticipative rabble by the simple query set in the chillest and most peremptory of aristocratic tone as to what they be do i like to think -- the bonnie lassie say that i be flattering myself thereby -- that it be the momentary halt cause by my abortive effort to hold the gate which give time for a greater than my humble self to intervene madame tallafferr in the glory of black silk the pinckney lace the pemberton diamond and accompany by that fat relic of slavery black sally have be take the air genteelly on a bench when the disturbance grate upon she sensitive ear what be that rabble about sally she inquire the aged negress reconnoiter reckon dey 's ridin ' a gentmun on a rail she report a _ gentleman

opine that the neighborhood of the advance mob be no place foh a niggah with perfect faith in the power of she superior she add : you desist 'em mist ` ess sally 's confidence in she mistress be equal or perhaps even excel by she mistress 's confidence in herself lean upon she cane and attend by the faithful though terrify servitor madame tallafferr rustle forward she take she stand upon the brink of the fountain in almost the exact spot where she have disarm maclachan the tailor drunk songful and suicidal two year before since that feat a almost mythologic awe have attach itself to she locally she wait small and thin hawk-eyed imperious and temper like steel the ring of temper steel too be in she voice when at the proper moment she raise it what be you do the clamor of the mob die down the sight of horatium -lrb- i beg she pardon humbly madame tallafferr -rrb- in the path smite they with misgiving as in macaulay 's immortal if somewhat jingly epic those behind cry ` forward ' and those before cry ` back ' that single hale and fiery old lady hold they no more could those two hundred ruffian have defy the challenge of she contemptuous eye than they could have advance into the flaming door of a furnace a cautious voice from the rear inquire : who be the dame she be a witch conjecture some one it be the duchess say another give she the local title of veneration it be the lady that shoot the tailor proclaim a awe-stricken bystander -lrb- legend take strange twist in we square as elsewhere -rrb- some outlander ignorant of we tradition prescribe in a malevolent squeak : t ` row ` er in the drink who speak say madame tallafferr crisp and clear silence then the sound of objurgation as the advocate frantically resist well-meant effort to thrust he into undesirable prominence finally a miniature eruption outward from the mob 's edge follow by a glimpse of a shadowy figure depart at full speed the duchess level a bony finger at inky mike the nearest figure personally know to she who begin a series of contortion suggestive of a desire to crawl into he own pocket michael say the duchess yessum say inky mike whose name happen to be moe sapperstein what be you do to that unfortunate person j-j-just a little j-j-joke reply the other in what be doubtless intend for a light-hearted and care-free tone let he down inky mike hesitate at once snap the duchess and stamp she foot yessum say inky mike meekly loose he hold on the scantle he retreat upon the foot of those behind they let go also plooie slide forward to the ground madame tallafferr 's bony finger -lrb- back by the sparkle of a authoritative diamond -rrb- sweep slowly around a half-circle with very much the easy and significant motion of a machine gun and something of the effect a subtle suggestion of limpness manifest itself in the mass before she address they she raise she voice not a whit she have no need to go about you business she say rabble she add in precisely the tone which one might expect of a well-bred but particularly deadly snake the mob wilt to a purposeless and abashed crowd the crowd disintegrate into individual the individual ask themselves what they be do there and find no sufficient answer slink away plooie be triumphantly escort by madame tallafferr and black sally and -lrb- less triumphantly -rrb- by my limp self to the nearest haven which chance to be the bonnie lassie 's house annie oombrellum patter along beside he fumble he hand and try not to cry but when the bonnie lassie see the melancholy wreck _ she _ cry as much from fury as from pity and say that man be brute and bully and coward and imbecile -- and why have not she cyrus be at home to stop it whereto madame tallafferr complacently respond that mr cyrus staten have not be need : the _ canaille _ would always respect a proper show of authority from its superior and so go home rustling and sparkling after all plooie be not much hurt perhaps more frightened than anything else panic be in fact the reason generally ascribe in we square for he quiet departure with he annie of course on the follow Sunday only the bonnie lassie dissent but as the bonnie lassie reason with she heart instead of she head we accept she theory with habitual and smile indulgence rather than respect -- until the fact bear they out she have it appear call on the plooie to inquire as to they propose course and have rather more than hint that if the head of the house wish to respond to he country 's call we square would look after annie oombrellum to this he return only a stubborn and somber silence the bonnie lassie say afterward that he seem ashamed she add that he have leave good-bye for I and hope the dominie would not think too hard of he recall that i have rather markedly fail to acknowledge he salute on the morning before he departure i feel a qualm of misgive after all judge you neighbor 's soul be a kittle business there be such a insufficiency of datum so schepstein lose a renter the basement cubbyhole remain vacant with only the picture of albert of the kingdom of sorrow in the window as a memento nothing further be see or hear of plooie but schepstein wander far afield in search of tenement sale a full year after encounter annie oombrellum wash down the step of a office far over in lewi street nearly to the river all the plumpness which she have take on in the happy day be go she look wistful and haggard schepstein do the polite -lrb- which as he accurately state cost nothing and might get you something some time -rrb- ask after plooie where be he annie oombrellum shake she head leave you have he ask schepstein astonished at this evidence of iniquity yes say annie oombrellum but there be a ring in she voice that schepstein fail to understand it sound almost like defiance she eye be deep-hollowed and sorrowful but they meet he as squarely as they could consider they cast schepstein be quite shock to observe that there be no shame in they i suppose the shock temporarily unbalanced he principle for have catch sight of one of she shoe he offer to lend she three dollar indefinitely and without interest on she bare note-of-hand -lrb- when he see the other shoe he make it five -rrb- she look at the money anxiously but shake she head well if you ever need a home the basement 's vacant and there be not a better basement in we square annie oombrellum begin to cry quietly and schepstein go on about he business through the ensue year many woman cry quietly or vehemently accord to they nature and many man go away from place that have know they to be no more know of those place and the little kingdom of sorrow shatter blood-soaked and unconquerable stand fast a bulwark between the ravager of the world and he victory until there speed across the death-haunted sea the army that be to turn the scale we square give to that sacrifice what it can never recover : witness the simple memorial in we square many people see ghost we square be well haunt as befit its ancient and diminish glory few hear ghost this be as it ought to be in they very nature ghost should be see not hear yet in the year of grace 1919 under a blaze September sun with a

ruminant accent how nice it must be to look back on a long life of unspotted correctness with not a item in it to be ashamed of it give one such a comfortable basis for sit in judgment she lip drip honey i observe and the poison of asp be under she tongue you quotation be fatally mixed retort my companion from across the park sound plooie 's patient falsetto : parapluie-ee-ee-ee-ee annie

dominie say the bonnie lassie with dignity be not it well curiosity kill a cat you know how shamelessly you garble it be -- never mind the quotation be erroneous anyway it should be : _ suppress _

go to see what be up i should almost prefer that you would go -- and peek dominie say the bonnie lassie you be a despicable old man i 'll be back in a minute do not stay long i plead pity the blind she golden laughter float back to I but there be no mirth in she voice when she return it be so dark in there i can hardly see but the big man be sit on a pile of rib talk to plooie and annie oombrellum 's face be all swollen with cry i see it in the window for a minute pro and con we argue what the probable event might be and how we could best meet it so intent upon we discussion do we become that we do not note the approach of a stranger until he be within a few pace of the bench with my cripple vision i apprehend he only as very tall and straight and wear a loose cape the effect upon the bonnie lassie of he approach be surprising i hear she give a little gasp she get up from the bench she hand fall upon my shoulder it be tremble where i wonder have those two meet and in what circumstance that the mere sight of the stranger cause such emotion in the unusually self-controlled wife of cyrus staten the man speak quickly in a deep and curiously melancholy voice : madame perhaps do I the honor to remember I i -- i -- i -- begin the bonnie lassie the comte de tournon at trouville we meet be it not several year since y-yes certainly at trouville -lrb- now i happen to know that the bonnie lassie have never be at trouville which do not assuage my suspicion -rrb- you be friend of my -- countryman emile garin be you not he pursue in he phraseology of extreme precision with only the faint echo of a accent who i say oh plooie you mean friend well acquaintance would be more accurate he tell I that you monsieur befriend he when he have great need of friend and you madame always so i have come to thank you you be interested in plooie i ask plooie he repeat doubtfully i explain to he and he laugh gently profoundly interested he say i have here one of he finest umbrella which he good wife present to I there be also a lady of whom he speak a _ grande dame _ of very great authority for all the sadness of the deep voice i feel that he eye be twinkling madame tallafferr supply the bonnie lassie she be away on a visit i should like to have meet that queller of mob she ought to be knight knighthood would add nothing to she status say i dryly she be a pinckney and a pemberton besides be a tallafferr with two _ f_s two _ l_s and two _ r_s doubtless i do not comprehend the detail of you american order of merit say the big sad-voiced man courteously but i should have be proud to meet she may i tell she that ask the bonnie lassie eagerly by all means -- when i be go again i feel the smile that must be in the eye but there be other here not so friendly to the little garin that be true be it not yes say the bonnie lassie there be at least a strong suspicion that he be not a deserving case i point out defensively then it be only because he do not explain himself well return the belgian quickly he do not explain himself at all i correct nor do annie oom -- he wife ah that will clarify itself perhaps in time if you will bear with I i should like to tell you a little story to be pass on to those who be not he friend will you not be seat madame the bonnie lassie resume she place on the bench standing before we the big man begin to speak many time since have i wish that i might have take down what he say verbatim so gracious it be so simple so straightly the expression of a great and generous personality emile garin he say be a son of belgium he be poor and he people be little folk of nothing-at-all moreover they be dead so he come to you great country to make he living when we enemy invade my country and the call go out to all son of belgium the little garin be ashamed because he know that he be physically unfit for military service but he try he try everywhere in the morning they must sweep he away from we consul-general 's doorstep here because otherwise he would not -- you speak monsieur nothing i only say ` god forgive we ' aman say the narrator gravely everywhere they reject he as unfit so he become morbid he hide himself away be it not so that be why they leave we square so mysteriously confirm the bonnie lassie after that he hang about the dock he see he chance and crawl into the hold of a vessel as a stowaway he starve it do not matter he be kick it do not matter he be arrest it do not matter nothing matter except that he should reach belgium and he do reach my country at the darkest hour the time when belgium need every man no matter who he be but he could not be a soldier the little garin because he be unable to march he have weak leg at this point the eternal feminine assert itself in the bonnie lassie i _ tell _ you there be something she murmur triumphantly hush say i i be glad to find that he have one true defender here pursue the biographer of plooie though he could not fight in the rank there be use for he there be use for all true son of belgium in those black day he be make driver of a -- a charette i do not know if you have they in you great city he pause and i guess that the rumble of heavy wheel on the asphalt hear near by have come opportunely ah yes there be one a dump-cart supply the bonnie lassie mercus madame a dump-cart it be perhaps not a evidently glorious thing to drive a dump-cart for one 's country -- unless one make it so but it be the best the little garin could do he leg be what you call quaint -- i have already tell you he be faithful and hard-working they help build road near the front the little garin and he big cart not precisely safety-first whisper the bonnie lassie to I maliciously you be interrupt the story say i with dignity one day he be drive a load of mud through a village street here on this side be a hospital there on that side be another hospital down the middle of the road walk a idiot of a sergeant carry a new type of grenade with which we be experiment one move a little lever -- so one count one two three four five one throw the grenade and at the count of ten all about it be destroy for it be of terrible power the idiot sergeant set down the grenade in the middle of the road between the two hospital full of the helplessly wound for what perhaps to sneeze perhaps to light a cigarette heaven only know for the sergeant have the luck to be kill next day by a german shell before he can be court-martial as he set down the grenade the little lever be move the sergeant lose he head he run shout to everybody to run also but the hospital they can not run and the wound they can not run they can only be still and wait in the nearest hospital there be a visitor a great lady a great and greatly love lady the sad voice deepen and soften i know whisper the bonnie lassie i can guess yes but the little garin approach on he big dump-cart do not know he know the danger for he hear the shout and see the people escape he see the grenade too a man run past he shout ` turn you cart you fool and save yourself ' oh yes he can save himself that be easy but what of the people in the hospital who can save they the little garin think hard and swiftly he drive he big dump-cart over the grenade he pull the lever which dump the mud the mud bury the grenade much mud very soft and heavy the grenade explode nevertheless one mule blow through one hospital one through another everything near be cover with mud the great lady be throw to the floor but she be not hurt she rise and attend the injured and calm the terrify the hospital be save it be a glorious thing to have drive a dump-cart for one 's country -- so but what become of we plooie beseech the bonnie lassie the big man spread he arm in a wide gallic gesture they look for he everywhere no sign but by and by some one see a quite large piece of mud on the hospital roof begin to wriggle the little garin be that large piece of mud they bring he down and put he in the hospital which he have save for a long time he have shell-shock even now he can not speak of the war without he nerve be affect when he get out of hospital he do not seem to know who he be or perhaps he do not care shell-shock be a strange thing he go away and he record be lose in the general confusion afterward we seek for he the great lady wish very much to see he but we could find nothing except that he have come back to this country official inquiry be make here and he be trace to we square so i come to see he because he can not speak for himself and will not allow he wife to tell he story -- it be part of the shell-shock which will wear off in time -- i come to speak for he do you -- do you do this sort of thing often ask the bonnie lassie with a queer sort of resonance in she voice the big man answer in a tone which suggest that he be smile : one can not visit all the brave man who suffer for belgium but there be a special reason here the matter of the great and greatly love lady whom the little garin save i see say the bonnie lassie softly after the big man have make he adieu we sit silent for some minute presently she speak there be wonder and

time ill-advised do not be tiresome dominie you know that i be not interested in noah as to we romantic visitant i say i think that cyrus the gaunt would better be watchful i have never know anyone

eye in mendel 's top drawer i suppose the question be how be we go to make it up to plooie i do not think you need worry about that return the bonnie lassie loftily nor be there any occasion for worry

something back of this -- there usually be in the little red doctor 's maneuver -- i rise and we set out as we pass the worth house it seem grimmer and bleaker than ever before there be something

proudest nobility for she beauty and wealth the latter have be unexpectedly leave she by a aged relative she inexorable refusal be set down by the romantic journalist as due to some secret and prior attachment -lrb- he term it a affair de court -rrb- out of the welter of word there stand forth one sentence to tempt the imagination : she meet death as a tryst for that brief flash the reporter have be lift out of he bathos and tawdriness into a clearer element one could well believe that she have meet death as a tryst for if ever i have behold unfaltering hope and unflagging courage glorified and spiritualize into unearthly beauty it be there in that picture face fix by the imperishable magic of the camera no i have not see it i say after reading be it true in part then after a pause you

when it come with a spirit as clear and as noble silence fall and in the stillness we hear the little red doctor commune with memory now and then come a muttered word suicide in a snarl of scornful rejection fool-made definition presently story for a romancer not a physician he seem to be canvass a inadequacy in himself with dissatisfaction then more clearly : love from the first at a glance perhaps the contagion of flame for powder but in that abyss together they see each other 's soul the little red doctor be turn poet say sheldon to I in a incredulous whisper there be the snap and crackle of a match from the shadowed corner the keen gnarled young face spring from the darkness vivid and soften with a strange triumph then recede behind a imperfect circle cloud the next instant by a nimbus of smoke the little red doctor speak ned worth be my friend as well as my patient no need to tell you man who know he why i be fond of he i do not suppose any one ever come in contact with that fantastic and smile humanity of he without love he for it immortal hilarity the phrase might have be coin for he it be not as physician that i go home with ned after pronounce sentence upon he

corner stand voiceless three month of desertion will change any house into a tomb and the worth mansion be never too cheerful anyway since the other of the family die ned have not stay there long enough at a time to humanize it ned 's man set down the grip unstrapp it take he order for some late purchase and leave to execute they i go over to open the two deep-set window on the farther side of the room it be a still close October night and the late scent of warmed-over earth come up to I out of ely crouch 's garden next door from where i stand in the broad embrasure of the south window i be conceal from the room but i could see everything through a tiny gap in the hanging ned sit at he desk sort some papers a sort of stern intentness have settle upon he face without mar its curious faun-like beauty i carry the picture in my mind what be become of you chri he demand presently i come out into the main part of the room oh there you be you 'll look after a few little matter for I will not you he indicate a sheaf of papers you need not be in such a hurry say i with illogical resentment it be not go to be to-morrow or next week be not it something in he tone make I look at he
