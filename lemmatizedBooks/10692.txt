life of general robert edward lee part i _ lee 's early life _ i introduction the name of lee be beloved and respected throughout the world man of all party and opinion unite in this sentiment not only those who think and fight with he but those most violently oppose to he political view and career it be natural that he own people should love and honor he as they great leader and defender in a struggle of intense bitterness -- that he old enemy should share this profound regard and admiration be due solely to the character of the individual he military genius will always be concede and he figure remain a conspicuous landmark in history but this do not account for the fact that he very enemy love the man he private character be the origin of this sentiment the people of the north no less than the people of the south feel that lee be truly great and the harshest critic have be able to find nothing to detract from this view of he the soldier be great but the man himself be greater no one be ever simpler truer or more honest those who know he best love he the most reserved and silent with a bearing of almost austere dignity he impress many person as cold and unsympathetic and he true character be long in reveal itself to the world to-day all man know what he friend know during he life -- that under the grave exterior of the soldier oppress with care and anxiety beat a warm and kindly heart full of a even extraordinary gentleness and sweetness that the man himself be not cold or stiff or harsh but patient forbearing charitable under many trial of he equanimity and magnanimous without effort from the native impulse of he heart friend and foe thus to-day regard he with much the same sentiment as a genuinely honest man incapable of duplicity in thought or deed wholly good and sincere inspired always under all temptation by that _ prisca fide _ which purify and ennoble and resolutely bent in the dark hour as in the bright on the full performance of he duty duty be the sublimest word in we language he write to he son and if we add that other August maxim human virtue should be equal to human calamity we shall have in a few word a summary of the principle which inspire lee the crowning grace of this man who be thus not only great but good be the humility and trust in god which lay at the foundation of he character upon this point we shall quote the word of a gentleman of command intellect a bitter opponent of the south in the war : lee be worthy of all praise as a man he be fearless among man as a soldier he have no superior and no equal in the course of nature my career on earth may soon terminate god grant that when the day of my death shall come i may look up to heaven with that confidence and faith which the life and character of robert e lee give he he die trust in god as a good man with a good life and a pure conscience he have live as he die with this supreme trust in a overrule and merciful providence and this sentiment pervade he whole be be the origin of that August calmness with which he greet the most crush disaster of he military career he faith and humble trust sustain he after the war when the woe of the south wellnigh break he great spirit and he calmly expire as a weary child fall asleep know that its father be near of this eminent soldier and man whose character offer so great a example a memoir be attempt in this volume the work will necessarily be popular rather than full and elaborate as the public and private correspondence of lee be not at this time accessible these will throw a fuller light on the subject but sufficient material be at the disposal of the writer to enable he to present a accurate likeness of lee and to narrate clearly the incident of he career in do so the aim of the author be to measure out full justice to all -- not to arouse old enmity which should be allow to slumber but to treat he subject with the judicial moderation of the student of history a few word will terminate this preface the volume before the reader be begin in 1866 the writer first however inform general lee of he design and have the honor to receive from he in reply the assurance that the work would not interfere with any he might have in contemplation he have not write a line of any work as yet and might never do so but should he write a history of the campaign of the army of northern virginium the propose work would be rather a assistance than a hinderance as the writer have offer promptly to discontinue the work if it be not agreeable to general lee this reply be regard in the light of a assurance that he do not disapprove of it the composition be however interrupted and the work lay aside it be now resume and complete at a time when the death of the illustrious soldier add a new and absorb interest to whatever be connect with he character or career ii the lees of virginium the lees of virginium spring from a ancient and respectable family of essex in england of some member of the family both in the old world and the new a brief account will be give the origin of a individual explain much that be striking and peculiar in he own character and it will be find that general lee inherit many of the trait of he ancestor especially of some eminent personage of he name in virginium the family pedigree be trace back by lee in the life of he father to launcelot lee of london in france who accompany william the conqueror to england after the battle of hasting which subject england to the sway of the norman launcelot lee like other be reward by land wrest from the subdue saxon he estate lay in essex and this be all that be know concern he lionel lee be the next member of the family of whom mention be make he live during the reign of richard coeur de lion and when the king go on he third crusade in the year 1192 lionel lee raise a company of gentleman and march with he to the holy land he career there be distinguish he display special gallantry at the siege of acre and for this he receive a solid proof of king richard 's approbation on he return he be make first earl of litchfield the king present he with the estate of ditchley which become the name afterward of a estate of the lees in virginium and when he die the armor which he have worn in the holy land be place in the department of horse armory in the great tower of london the name of richard lee be next mention as one of the follower of the earl of surrey in he expedition across the scottish border in 1542 two of the family about this period be knight companion of the garter and they banner with the lee arm above be suspend in st george 's chapel in windsor castle the coat-of-arm be a shield band sinister battle and embattled the crest a closed visor surmount by a squirrel hold a nut the motto which may be think characteristic of one of general lee 's trait as a soldier be _ non incautus futurus _ such be the brief notice give of the family in england they seem to have be person of high character and often of distinction when richard lee come to virginium and found the family anew there as launcelot the first lee have found it in england he bring over in he vein some of the best and most valiant blood of the great norman race this richard lee the _ princep _ of the family in virginium be it seem like the rest of he kindred strongly cavalier in he sentiment indeed the lees seem always to have be cavalier the reader will recall the stately old representative of the family in scott 's woodstock -- sir henry lee of ditchley -- who be see stalk proudly through the great apartment of the palace in he lace doublet slash boot and velvet cloak scowl darkly at the puritan intruder sir henry be not a fanciful person but a real individual and the political view attribute to he be those of the lee family who remain faithful to the royal cause in all its hour of adversity it will be see that richard lee the first of the virginia lees be a ardent monarchist he come over during the reign of charle i but return to england bequeath all he land to he servant he subsequently come back to virginium however and live and die there in he will he style himself richard lee of strafford langton in the county of essex esquire it be not certainly know whether he seek refuge in virginium after the failure of the king 's cause or be tempt to emigrate with a view to better he fortune in the new world either may have be the impel motive great number of cavalier come over after the overthrow of charle at naseby but a large emigration have already take place and take place afterward induce by the salubrity of the country the ease of living and the cheapness and fertility of the land on the great river where family impoverished or of fail fortune in england might make new settlement and build on a new foundation this would amply account for the removal of richard lee to virginium and for the ambition he seem to have be inspire with to build and improve without attribute to he any apprehension of probable punishment for he political course very many family have the first-named motive and commence to build great manor-house which be never finish or be too costly for any one of they descendant to possess the abolition of primogeniture despite the opposition of pendleton and other overthrow all this and the lees like other family now possess few of the broad acre which they ancestor acquire to return however to richard lee he have already visit virginium in some official capacity under the royal governor sir william berkeley and have be so much pleased with the soil and climate of the country that he as we have say emigrate finally and cast he lot in the new land he bring a number of follower and servant and come over to westmoreland county in the northern neck of virginium take up extensive tract of land there and set about build manor-house upon they among these it be state be the original stratford house afterward destroy by fire it be rebuild however and become the birthplace of richard henry lee and afterward of general robert e lee we shall speak of it more in detail after finish in a few word we notice of richard lee its founder and the founder of the lee family in virginium he be describe as a person of great force of character and many virtue -- as a man of good stature comely visage enterprising genius sound head vigorous spirit and generous nature this may be suspect to partake of the nature of epitaph but of he courage and energy the proof remain in the action take by he in connection with charle ii inherit it would seem in full measure the royalist and cavalier sentiment of he family he unite with sir william berkeley the royal governor in the irregular proclamation of charle ii in virginium a year or two before he reinstallment on the english throne he have already it be report on the authority of well-supported tradition make a voyage across the atlantic to breda where charle ii be then in exile and offer to erect he standard in virginium and proclaim he king there this proposition the young monarch decline shrink with excellent good sense from a renewal under less favorable circumstance of the struggle which terminate at worcester lee be therefore compel to return without have succeed in he enterprise but he have make it seem a very strong impression in favor of virginium upon the somewhat frivolous young monarch when he come to he throne again charle ii graciously wear a coronation-robe of virginium silk and virginium who have prove so faithful to he in the hour of he need be authorize by royal decree to rank thenceforward in the british empire with england scotland and ireland and bear upon she shield the motto _ en dat virginium quartam _ richard lee return after he unsuccessful mission to the northern neck and address himself thenceforward to the management of he private fortune and the affair of the colony he have now become possess of very extensive estate between the potomac and rappahannock river and elsewhere besides stratford he own plantation call mocke neck mathotick paper-maker 's neck war captain 's neck bishop 's neck and paradise with four thousand acre besides on the potomac land in maryland three island in chesapeake bay a interest in several trading-vessel and innumerable indented and other servant he become a member of the king 's council and live in great elegance and comfort that he be a man of high character and of notable piety for a age of free living and worldly tendency he will show in that document he bequeath he soul to that good and gracious god that give it I and to my bless redeemer jesus christ assuredly trust in and by he meritorious death and passion to receive salvation the attention of the reader have be particularly call to the character and career of richard lee not only because he be the founder of the family in virginium but because the trait of the individual reappear very prominently in the great soldier whose life be the subject of this volume the coolness courage energy and aptitude for great affair which mark richard lee in the seventeenth century be unmistakably present in the character of robert e lee in the nineteenth century we shall conclude we notice of the family by call attention to that great group of celebrated man who illustrate the name in the day of the revolution and exhibit the family characteristic as clearly these be richard henry lee of chantilly the famous orator and statesman who move in the american congress the declaration of independence franci lightfoot lee a scholar of elegant attainment and high literary accomplishment who sign with he more renowned brother the declaration william lee who become sheriff of london and ably second the cause of the colony and arthur lee diplomatist and representative of america abroad where he display as he diplomatic correspondence indicate untiring energy and devotion to the interest of the colony the last of these brother be philip ludwell lee whose daughter matilda marry she second cousin general henry lee this gentleman afterward famous as light-horse harry lee marry a second time and from this union spring the subject of this memoir iii general light-horse harry lee this celebrated soldier who so largely occupy the public eye in the revolution be worthy of notice both as a eminent member of the lee family and as the father of general robert e lee he be bear in 1756 in the county of westmoreland -- which boast of be the birthplace of washington monroe richard

1781 he march with he legion to join greene in the carolina carry with he the high esteem of washington who have witness he skilful and daring operation in the jersey he career in the arduous campaign of the south against cornwalli and the efficient commander of he cavalry arm colonel tarleton may be best understand from general greene 's dispatch and from he own memoirs of the operation of the army which be write with as much modesty as ability from these it be apparent that the small body of the legion cavalry under its active and daring commander be the eye and ear of greene 's army whose movement it accompany everywhere precede its advance and cover its retreat few page of military history be more stir than those in lee 's memoirs describe greene 's retrograde movement to the dan and this alone if the hard work at the eutaw and elsewhere be leave out would place lee 's fame as a cavalry officer upon a lasting basis the distinguished soldier under whose eye the virginian operate do full justice to he courage and capacity i believe write greene that few officer either in europe or america be hold in so high a position of admiration as you be everybody know i have the highest opinion of you as a officer and you know i love you as a friend no man in the progress of the campaign have equal merit with yourself the officer who write those line be not a courtier nor a diplomatist but a blunt and honest soldier who have see lee 's bearing in the most arduous strait and be capable of appreciate military ability add washington 's expression of he love and thanks in a letter write in 1789 and the light in which he be regard by he contemporary will be understand he memoirs of the war in the southern department be a valuable military history and a very interesting book the movement of greene in face of cornwalli be describe with a precision which render the narrative valuable to military student and a picturesqueness which rivet the attention of the general

arduis _ whom no reverse of fortune could cast down the fairness and courtesy of the writer toward he opponent be a attractive characteristic of the work -lrb- 1 -rrb- which be write with a simplicity and directness of style highly agreeable to reader of judgment -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see he observation upon the source of he success over tarleton full of the generous spirit of a great soldier he attribute they in no degree to he own military ability but to the superior character of he large thorough-bred horse which ride over tarleton 's inferior stock he do not state that the famous legion number only two hundred and fifty man and that tarleton command a much larger force of the best cavalry of the british army -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : a new edition of this work precede by

-rrb- before pass to lee 's public career and the narrative of the stormy scene of he after-life let we pause a moment and bestow a glance upon this ancient mansion which be still stand -- a silent and melancholy relic of the past -- in the remote northern neck as the birthplace of a great man it would demand attention but it have other claim still as a venerable memorial of the past and its eminent personage one of the few remain monument of a state of society that have disappear or be disappear the original stratford house be suppose as we have say to have be build by richard lee the first of the family in the new world whoever may have be its founder it be destroy in the time of thoma lee a eminent representative of the name early in the eighteenth century thoma lee be a member of the king 's council a gentleman of great popularity and when it be know that he house have be burn contribution be everywhere make to rebuild it the governor the merchant of the colony and even queen anne in person unite in this subscription the house speedily rise again at a cost of about eighty thousand dollar and this be the edifice still stand in westmoreland the sum expend in its construction must not be estimate in the light of to-day at that time the greater part of the heavy work in house-building be perform by servant of the manor it be fair indeed to say that the larger part of the work thus cost nothing in money and thus the eighty thousand dollar represent only the english brick the carving furniture and decoration the construction of such a edifice have at that day a distinct object these great old manor-house lose in the depths of the country be intend to become the headquarters of the family in all time in they large apartment the eldest son be to uphold the name generation after generation be to pass and some one of the old name still live there and though all this have pass away now and may appear a worn-out superstition and though some person may stigmatize it as contribute to the sentiment of aristocracy the strongest opponent of that old system may pardon in we the expression of some regret that this love of the hearthstone and old family memory should have disappear the great man whose character be seek to be delineate in this volume never lose to the last this home and family sentiment he know the kinship of every one and love the old country-house of the old virginium family -- plain and honest people attach like himself to the virginium soil we pass to a brief description of the old house in which lee be bear stratford the old home of the lees but to-day the property of other stand on a picturesque bluff on the southern bank of the potomac and be a house of very considerable size it be build in the form of the letter h the wall be several foot in thickness in the center be a saloon thirty foot in size and surmount each wing be a pavilion with balustrade above which rise cluster of chimney the front door be reach by a broad flight of step and the grounds be handsome and variegate by the bright foliage of oak cedar and maple-tree here and there in the extensive lawn rise a slender and ghostly old lombardy poplar -- a tree once a great favorite in virginium but now see only here and there the relic of a past generation within the stratford house be as antique as without and with its hall corridor wainscote and ancient moulding take the visitor back to the era of powder and silk stocking such be the mansion to which general harry lee come to live after the revolution and the sight of the old home must have be dear to the soldier 's heart here have flourish three generation of lees dispense a profuse and open-handed hospitality in each generation some one of the family have distinguish himself and attract the best company to stratford the old wall have ring with merriment the great door be wide open everybody be welcome and one could see there a good illustration of a long-passed manner of living which have at least the merit of be hearty open-handed and picturesque general harry lee the careless soldier partook of the family tendency to hospitality he keep open house entertain all comer and hence doubtless spring the pecuniary embarrassment embitter a old age which he eminent public service should have render serene and happy we notice of stratford may appear unduly long to some reader but it be not without a distinct reference to the subject of this volume in this quiet old mansion -- and in the very apartment where richard henry and franci lightfoot lee first see the light -- robert e lee be bear the eye of the child fall first upon the old apartment the great grounds the homely scene around the old country-house -- upon the tall lombardy poplar and the oak through which pass the wind bear to he ear the murmur of the potomac he leave the old home of he family before it could have have any very great effect upon he it would seem but it be impossible to estimate these first influence to decide the depth of the impression which the child 's heart be capable of receive the bright eye of young robert lee must have see much around he to interest he and shape he first view critic charge he with family pride sometimes if he possess that virtue or fail the fact be not strange stratford open before he childish eye a memorial of the old splendor of the lees he see around he old portrait old plate and old furniture tell plainly of the ancient origin and high position of he family old parchment contain history of the deed of he race old genealogical tree trace they line far back into the past old servant grow gray in the house wait upon the child and in a corner of one of the great apartment a old soldier gray too and shatter in health once the friend of washington and greene be write the history of the battle in which he have draw he sword for he native land amid these scene and surroundings pass the first year of robert e lee they must have make they impression upon he character at a period when the mind take every new influence and grow in accordance with it and to the last the man remain simple hearty proud courteous -- the _ country virginian _ in all the texture of he character he always rejoice to visit the country love horse be a excellent rider be fond of plain country talk jest humorous anecdote and chit-chat -- be the plain country gentleman in a word prefer grass and tree and stream to all the city and crowd in the world in the last year of he life he say to a lady : my visit to florida and the white sulphur have not benefit I much but it do I good to go to the white house and see _ the mule walk round and the corn grow _ we notice a last result of the child 's residence now or visit afterward to the country and the sport in which he indulge -- the superb physical health and strength which remain unshaken afterward by all the hardship of war lee to the last be a marvel of sound physical development he frame be as solid as oak and stand the strain of exhausting march loss of sleep hunger thirst heat and cold without fail he when he die it be care which crush he heart he health be perfect v lee 's early manhood and career in the united state army of lee 's childhood we have no memorial except the word of he father long afterward _ robert be always good _ write general henry lee -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : to cc lee February 9 1817 -rrb- that be all but the word indicate much -- that the good man be always good it will be see that when he go to west point he never receive a demerit the good boy be the good young officer and become in due time the good commander-in-chief in the year 1811 general henry lee leave stratford and remove with he family to alexandrium actuate it seem by the desire of afford he child facility for gain they education after he death in 1818 mr lee continue to reside in alexandrium be a communicant of christ church and she child be teach the episcopal catechism by young william meade eventually bishop of virginium we shall see how bishop meade long afterward recall those early day when he and he pupil young robert lee be equally unknown -- how when about to die just as the war begin in earnest he send for the boy he have once instruct now the gray-haired soldier and when he come to the bedside exclaim : god bless you robert i can not call you ` general ' -- i have hear you you catechism too often alexandria continue to be the residence of the family until the young man be eighteen year of age when it be necessary for he to make choice of a profession and follow the bent of he temperament he choose the army application be make for he appointment from virginium as a cadet at west point he obtain the appointment and in 1825 at the age of eighteen enter the military academy he progress in he study be steady and it be say that during he stay at west point he be never reprimand nor mark with a demerit he graduate in July 1829 second in he class and be assign to duty with the rank of lieutenant in the corps of engineer -lrb- illustration : re lee as a young officer new york d apololay & co -rrb- he be describe by those who see he at this time as a young man of great personal beauty and this be probably not a exaggeration as he remain to the last distinguished for the elegance and dignity of he person he have not yet lose what the care of command afterward banish -- he gayety and _ abandon _ -- and be note it be say for the sweetness of he smile and the cordiality of he manners the person who give the writer these detail add he be a perfect gentleman three year after graduate at west point -- in the year 1832 -- he marry mary custi daughter of mr george washington parke custi of arlington the adopted son of general washington and by this marriage he come into possession of the estate of arlington and the white house -- point afterward well know in the war the life of lee up to the beginning of the great conflict of 1861 - '65 be of moderate interest only and we shall not dwell at length upon it he be employ on the coast defence in new york and virginium and in 1835 in run the boundary line between the state of ohio and michigan in September 1836 he be promote to the rank of first lieutenant in July 1838 to a captaincy in 1844 he become a member of the board of visitor to the military academy in 1845 he be a member of the board of engineer and in 1846 when the mexican war break out be assign to duty as chief engineer of the central army of mexico in which capacity he serve to the end of the war up to the date of the mexican war captain lee have attract no public attention but have impress the military authority include general winfield scott with a favorable opinion of he ability as a topographical engineer for this department of military science he exhibit endowment of the first class -- what other faculty of the soldier he possess it remain for event to show this opportunity be now give he in the mexican war and the efficient character of he service may be see in scott 's autobiography where captain lee of the engineer be mention in every report and everywhere with commendation from the beginning of operation the young officer seem to have be summon to the council of war and general scott particularly mention that hold at vera cruz -- so serious a affair that a death-bed discussion could hardly have be more solemn the passage in which the lieutenant-general mention lee be too numerous and not of sufficient interest to quote but two entry will exhibit the general tenor of this honorable mention after cerro gordo scott write in he official report of the battle : i be compel to make special mention of captain re lee engineer this officer greatly distinguish himself at the siege of vera cruz be again indefatigable during these operation in reconnoissance as daring as laborious and of the utmost value after chapultepec he write : captain lee so constantly distinguish also bear important order for I -lrb- September 13th -rrb- until he faint from a wound and the loss of two night ' sleep at the battery we may add here the statement of the hon reverdy johnson that he have hear general scott more than once say that he success in mexico be largely due to the skill valor and undaunted energy of robert e lee for these service lee receive steady promotion for meritorious conduct at cerro gordo he be make brevet major for the same at contrera and cherubusco brevet lieutenant-colonel and after chapultepec he receive the additional brevet of colonel -- distinction fairly earn by energy and courage when the war end lee return to he former duty in the engineer corps of the usa and be place in charge of the work then in process of construction at fort carroll near baltimore he assignment to the duty of thus superintend the military defence of hampton road new york bay and the approach to baltimore in succession would seem to indicate that he ability as engineer be highly esteem of he possession of such ability there can be no doubt the young officer be not only thoroughly train in this high department of military science but have for he duty unmistakable natural endowment this fact be clearly indicate on many occasion in the confederate struggle -- he eye for position never fail he it be certain that have lee never command troops in the field he would have leave behind he the reputation of a excellent engineer in 1855 he be call for the first time to command man for he duty hitherto have be those of military engineer astronomer or staff-officer the act of congress direct that two new cavalry regiment should be raise excite a ardent desire in the officer of the army to receive appointment in they and lee be transfer from he place of engineer to the post of lieutenant-colonel in the second cavalry one of the regiment in question the extraordinary number of name of officer in this regiment who afterward become famous be worthy of notice the colonel be albert sydney johnston the lieutenant-colonel re lee the senior major william j hardee the junior major george h thoma the senior captain earl yan dorn the next ranking captain kirby smith the lieutenant hood field cosby major fitzhugh lee johnson palmer and stoneman all of whom become general officer afterward on the southern side with the exception of thoma and the three last name who become prominent general in the federal army it be rare that such a constellation of famous name be find in the list of officer of a single regiment the explanation be nevertheless simple position in the new regiment be eagerly covet by the best soldier of the army and in appoint the officer those of conspicuous ability only be select the second regiment of cavalry thus become the _ corps d'élite _ of the united state army and after albert sydney johnston robert e lee be the ranking officer lee proceed with he regiment to texa remain there for several year on frontier duty and do not reappear again until 1859 such be the early career in the army of the soldier soon to become famous on a greater theater -- that of a thoroughly-trained hard-working and conscientious officer with the single exception of he brief record in the mexican war he life have be pass in official duty unconnected with active military operation he be undoubtedly what be call a rise man but he have have no opportunity to display the greatest faculty of the soldier the time be come now when he be to be test and the measure of he faculty take in one of the greatest war which darken the page of history a single incident of public importance mark the life of lee between 1855 and 1861 this be what be know to the world as the john brown raid -- a incident of the year 1859 and prelude the approach storm this occurrence be too well know to require a minute account in these page and we shall accordingly pass over it briefly indicate simply the part bear in the affair by lee he be in washington at the time -- the fall of 1859 -- on a visit to he family then reside at arlington near the city when intelligence come that a party of desperado have attack and capture harper 's ferry with the avowed intent of arm and incite to insurrection the slave of the neighborhood and entire state lee be immediately thereupon direct by president buchanan to proceed to the point of danger and arrest the rioter he do so promptly find upon he arrival that brown and he confederate have shut themselves up in a engine-house of the town with a number of they prisoner brown be summon to surrender to be deliver over to the authority for civil trial -- he refuse and lee then proceed to assault with a force of marine the stronghold to which brown have retreat the door be drive in brown firing upon the assailant and kill or wound two but he and he man be cut down and capture they be turn over to the virginium authority and lee have perform the duty assign he return to washington and soon afterward to texa he remain there command the department until the early spring of 1861 he be then recall to washington at the moment when the conflict between the north and the south be about to commence vi lee and scott lee find the country burning as with fever and the air hot with contend passion the animosity long smoulder between the two section be about to burst into the flame of civil war all man be take side the war of discussion on the floor of congress be about to yield to the clash of bayonet and the roar of cannon on the battle-field any enumeration of the cause which lead to this unhappy state of affair would be worse than useless in a volume like the present even less desirable would be a discussion of the respective blame to be attach to each of the great opponent in inaugurate the bitter and long-continued struggle such a discussion would lead to nothing and would probably leave every reader of the same opinion as before it would also be the repetition of a worn-out and wearisome story these event be know of all man for the political history of the united state from 1820 when the slavery agitation begin on the question of the missourus restriction to 1861 when it end in civil convulsion have be discuss rediscuss and discuss again in every journal great and small in the whole country the person who be not familiar therefore with the main point at issue must be ignorant beyond the power of any writer to enlighten he we need only say that the election of abraham lincoln the nominee of the republican party have determine the gulf state to leave the union south carolina accordingly secede on the 20th of December 1860 and by the 1st of February 1861 she have be follow by mississippus florida alabama georgium louisiana and texa the struggle thus approach military movement begin at many point like those distant flash of lightning and vague muttering which herald the tempest early in February jefferson davi of mississippus be elect president of the confederate state at montgomery on the 13th of April fort sumter surrender to general beauregard and on the next day April 14 1861 president lincoln issue he proclamation declare the gulf state in rebellion and call upon the state which have not secede for seventy-five thousand man to enforce the federal authority tip to this time the older state of virginium have persistently resist secession she refusal to array herself against the general government have be base upon a unconquerable repugnance it seem for the dissolution of that union which she have so long loved from real attachment to the flag which she have do so much to make honorable and from a natural indisposition to rush headlong into a conflict whose whole fury would burst upon and desolate she own soil the proclamation of president lincoln however decide she course the convention have obdurately refuse week after week to pass the ordinance of secession now the naked question be whether virginium should fight with or against she sister of the gulf state she be direct to furnish she quota of the seventy-five thousand troops call for by president lincoln and must decide at once on the 17th of April 1861 accordingly a ordinance of secession pass the virginia convention and that commonwealth cast she fortune for weal or woe with the southern confederacy such be a brief and rapid summary of the important public event which have precede or immediately follow lee 's return to washington in march 1861 a grave and to he a very solemn question demand instant decision which side should he espouse -- the side of the united state or that of the south to choose either cause he acute pain the attachment of the soldier to he flag be greater than the civilian can realize and lee have before he the brightest military prospects the brief record which we have present of he military career in mexico convey a very inadequate idea of the position which he have secure in the army he be regard by the authority at washington and by the country at large as the ablest and most promising of all the rise class of army officer upon general winfield scott commander-in-chief of the federal army he have make a impression which be the most striking proof of he great merit general scott be enthusiastic in he expression of admiration for the young virginian and with the death of that general which he great age render a probable event at any moment lee be sure to become a candidate for the highest promotion in the service to this he great ability give he a title at the earliest possible moment and other consideration operate to advance he fortune he be concede by all to be a person of the highest moral character be the descendant of a influential and distinguished family which have render important service to the country in the revolution he father have be the friend of washington and have achieve the first glory of arm and the ample estate derive from he wife give he that worldly prestige which have a direct influence upon the fortune of a individual colonel lee could thus look forward without the imputation of presumption to position of the highest responsibility and honor under the government with the death of scott and other aged officer of the army the place of commander-in-chief would fall to the most deserving of the younger generation and of this generation there be no one so able and prominent as lee -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : general scott state he purpose to recommend lee as he successor in the chief command of the army -- _ hon reverdy johnson _ -rrb- the personal relation of lee with general scott constitute another powerful temptation to decide he against go over to the southern side we have refer to the great admiration which the old soldier feel for the young officer he be say to have exclaim on one occasion : it would be better for every officer in the army include myself to die than robert lee there seem no doubt of the fact that scott look to lee as he ultimate successor in the supreme command for which he character and military ability peculiarly fit he warm personal regard give additional strength to he feeling in lee 's favor and the consciousness of this regard on the part of he superior make it still more difficult for lee to come to a decision vii lee resign it be know that general scott use every argument to persuade lee not to resign to retain he in the service he have be appoint on he arrival at washington a full colonel and in 1860 he name have be send in with other by scott as a proper person to fill the vacancy cause by the death of brigadier-general jessup to these tempting intimation that rapid promotion would attend he adherence to the united state flag scott add personal appeal which come from he must have be almost irresistible for god 's sake do not resign lee the lieutenant-general be say to have exclaim and in the protracted interview which take place between the two officer every possible argument be urge by the elder to decide lee to remain firm the attempt be in vain lee 's attachment to the flag he have so long fight under and he personal affection for general scott be great but he attachment to he native state be still more powerful by birth a virginian he declare that he owe he first duty to she and he own people if she summon he he must obey the summons as long as she remain in the union he might remain in the united state army when she secede from the union and take part with the gulf state he must follow she fortune and do he part in defend she the struggle have be bitter but brief my husband have weep tear of blood mr lee write to a friend over this terrible war but he must as a man and a virginian share the destiny of he state which have solemnly pronounced for independence the secession of virginium by a vote of the convention assemble at richmond decide lee in he course he no longer hesitate to general scott 's urgent appeal not to send in he resignation he reply : i be compel to i can not consult my own feeling in this matter he accordingly write to general scott from arlington on the 20th of April enclose he resignation the letter be in the follow word : general : since my interview with you on the 18th instant i have feel that i ought not longer to retain my commission in the army i therefore tender my resignation which i request you will recommend for acceptance it would have be present at once but for the struggle it have cost I to separate myself from a service to which i have devote all the best year of my life and all the ability i possess during the whole of that time -- more than a quarter of a century -- i have experience nothing but kindness from my superior and the most cordial friendship from my comrade to no one general have i be as much indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration and it have always be my ardent desire to merit you approbation i shall carry to the grave the most grateful recollection of you kind consideration and you name and fame will always be dear to I save in defense of my native state i never desire again to draw my sword be please to accept my most earnest wish for the continuance of you happiness and prosperity and believe I most truly yours re lee lieutenant-general winfield scott _ commanding united state army _ in this letter full of dignity and grave courtesy lee vainly attempt to hide the acute pain he feel at parting from he friend and abandon the old service another letter write on the same day express the same sentiment of painful regret : arlington virginium _ April 201861 _ my dear sister : i be grieve at my inability to see you i have be wait for a more convenient season which have bring to many before I deep and lasting regret now we be in a state of war which will yield to nothing the whole south be in a state of revolution into which virginium after a long struggle have be draw and _ though i recognize no necessity for this state of thing _ and would have forborne and plead to the end for redress of grievance real or suppose yet in my own person i have to meet the question _ whether i should take part against my native state _ with all my devotion to the union and the feeling of loyalty and duty of a american citizen i have not be able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relative my child my home i have therefore resigned my commission in the army and save in defense of my native state with the sincere hope that my poor service may never be need i hope i may never be call on to draw my sword i know you will blame I but you must think as kindly of I as you can and believe that i have endeavor to do what i think right to show you the feeling and struggle it have cost I i send a copy of my letter to general scott which accompany my letter of resignation i have no time for more may god guard and protect you and yours and shower upon you every blessing be the prayer of you devoted brother re lee the expression use in this letter -- though i recognize no necessity for this state of thing -- convey very clearly the political sentiment of the writer he do not regard the election of a republican president even by a strictly sectional vote as sufficient ground for a dissolution of the union it may be add here that such we believe be the opinion of a large number of southern officer at that time accustomed to look to the flag as that which they be call upon to defend against all comer they be loath to admit the force of the reasoning which justified secession and call upon they to abandon it they final action seem to have be take from the same consideration which control the course of lee they state call they and they obey in resign he commission and go over to the south lee sacrifice he private fortune in addition to all he hope of future promotion in the united state army he beautiful home arlington situate upon the height opposite washington must be abandon forever and fall into the hand of the enemy this old mansion be a model of peaceful loveliness and attraction all around here say a writer describe the place arlington height present a lovely picture of rural beauty the ` general lee house ' as some term it stand on a grassy lot surround with a grove of stately tree and underwood except in front where be a verdant sloping ground for a few rod when it descend into a valley spread away in beautiful and broad expanse to the lovely potomac this part of the splendid estate be apparently a highly-cultivated meadow the grass wave in the gentle breeze like the undulating bosom of old atlantic to the south north and west the grounds be beautifully diversify into hill and valley and richly store with oak willow and maple though the oak be the principal wood the view from the height be a charming picture washington georgetown and the intermediate potomac be all before you in the foreground in this old mansion crowning the grassy hill the young officer have pass the happiest moment of he life all around he be spot associate with he hour of purest enjoyment each object in the house -- the old furniture and very table-sets -- recall the memory of washington and be dear to he here be many piece of the martha washington china portion of the porcelain set present to mr

of he bookcase old portrait antique furniture and other memorial of the lee family from stratford -- let the reader imagine the old mansion store with these priceless relic and he will understand with what anguish lee must have contemplate what come duly to pass the destruction by rude hand of object so dear to he that he must have foresee the fate of he home be certain to take side with virginium be to give up arlington to its fate there be no proof however that this sacrifice of he personal fortune have any effect upon he if he could decide to change he flag and dissolve every tie which bind he to the old service he could sacrifice all else without much regret no one will be find to say that the hope of rank or emolument in the south influence he the character and whole career of the man contradict the idea he ground of action may be sum up in a single sentence he go with he state because he believe it be he duty to do so and because to ascertain what be he duty and perform it be the cardinal maxim of he life viii he reception at richmond no sooner have intelligence of lee 's resignation of he commission in the united state army reach richmond than governor letcher appoint he major-general of the military force of virginium the appointment be confirm by the convention rather by acclamation than formal vote and on the 23d of April lee who have meanwhile leave washington and repair to richmond be honor by a formal presentation to the convention the address of president janney be eloquent and deserve to be preserved lee stand in the middle aisle and the president rise say : major-general lee : in the name of the people of we native state here represent i bid you a cordial and heart-felt welcome to this hall in which we may almost yet hear the echo of the voice of the statesman the soldier and sage of by-gone day who have bear you name and whose blood now flow in you vein we meet in the month of February last charge with the solemn duty of protect the rights the honor and the interest of the people of this commonwealth we differ for a time as to the best means of accomplish that object but there never be at any moment a shade of difference among we as to the great object itself and now virginia have take she position as far as the power of this convention extend we stand animated by one impulse govern by one desire and one determination and that be that she shall be defend and that no spot of she soil shall be polluted by the foot of a invader when the necessity become apparent of have a leader for we force all heart and all eye by the impulse of a instinct which be a surer guide than reason itself turn to the old county of westmoreland we know how prolific she have be in other day of hero and statesman we know she have give birth to the father of he country to richard henry lee to monroe and last though not least to you own gallant father and we know well by you deed that she productive power be not yet exhaust sir we watch with the most profound and intense interest the triumphal march of the army lead by general scott to which you be attach from vera cruz to the capital of mexico we read of the sanguinary conflict and the blood-stained field in all of which victory perch upon we own banner we know of the unfading lustre that be shed upon the american arm by that campaign and we know also what you modesty have always disclaim that no small share of the glory of those achievement be due to you valor and you military genius sir one of the proudest recollection of my life will be the honor that i yesterday have of submit to this body confirmation of the nomination make by the governor of this state of you as commander-in-chief of the military and naval force of this commonwealth i rise to put the question and when i ask if this body would advise and consent to that appointment there rush from the heart to the tongue of all the member a affirmative response which tell with a emphasis that could leave no doubt of the feeling whence it emanate i put the negative of the question for form 's sake but there be a unbroken silence sir we have by this unanimous vote express we conviction that you be at this day among the living citizen of virginium ` first in war ' we pray to god most fervently that you may so conduct the operation commit to you charge that it may soon be say of you that you be ` first in peace ' and when that time come you will have earn the still prouder distinction of be ` first in the heart of you countryman ' the president conclude by say that virginium on that day intrust she spotless sword to lee 's keep and lee respond as follow : mr president and gentleman of the convention : profoundly impressed with the solemnity of the occasion for which i must say i be not prepared i accept the position assign I by you partiality i would have much prefer have you choice fall upon a abler man trust in almighty god a approve conscience and the aid of my fellow-citizen i devote myself to the service of my native state in whose behalf alone will i ever again draw my sword such be the modest and dignified expression of lee in accept the great trust the reply be brief and simple but these be very great merit on such a occasion no portion of the address contain a phrase or word denunciatory of the federal government or of the motive of the opponent of virginium and this moderation and absence of all rancor characterize the utterance of lee both oral and write throughout the war he speak doubtless as he feel and utter no expression of heated animosity because he cherish no such sentiment he heart be bleed still from the cruel trial it have undergo in abruptly tear away from the old service to embark upon civil war with the emotion of the present occasion excite by the great ovation in he honor no bitterness mingle -- or at least if there be such bitterness in he heart he do not permit it to rise to he lip he accept the trust confide to he in term of dignity and moderation worthy of washington exchange grave salutation with the member of the convention and then retire from the hall where he have solemnly consecrate he life to he native commonwealth proceed at once to energetic work to get the state in a posture of defense the sentiment of the country in reference to lee be even warmer than that of the convention for week report have be rife that he have determine to adhere to the federal government in the approach struggle such a event it be feel by all would be a public calamity to virginium and the general joy may be imagine when it be know that lee have resign and come to fight with he own people he assume command therefore of all the virginia force in the midst of universal public rejoicing and the fact give strength and consistency to the general determination to resist the federal government to the last ix lee in 1861 at this time -- April 1861 -- general lee be fifty-four year of age and may be say to have be in the ripe vigor of every faculty physically and intellectually he be at he best and in the bloom of manhood he figure be erect and he bear himself with the brief somewhat stiff air of command derive from he military education and service in the army this air of the professional soldier which characterize generally the graduate of west point be replace afterward by a grave dignity the result of high command and great responsibility in April 1861 however he be rather the ordinary army officer in bearing than the commander-in-chief he have always be remarkable for he manly beauty both of face and figure and the care of great command have not yet whiten he hair there be not a gray hair in he head and he mustache be dark and heavy the rest of he face be clean-shaven and he cheek have that fresh ruddy hue which indicate high physical health this be not at that time or afterward the result of high living of all the prominent personage of he epoch lee be perhaps the most temperate he rarely drink even so much as a single glass of wine and it be a matter of general notoriety in the army afterward that he care not what he eat the ruddy appearance which characterize he from first to last be the result of the most perfectly-developed physical health which no species of indulgence have ever impaired he use no tobacco then or afterward in any shape -- that seductive weed which have be call the soldier 's comfort -- and seem indeed superior to all those small vice which assail man of he profession grave silent with a military composure of bearing which amount at time as we have say to stiffness he resemble a machine in the shape of a man at least this be the impression which he produce upon those who see he in public at this time the writer 's design here be to indicate the personal appearance and bearing of general lee on the threshold of the war it may be say by way of sum up all that he be a full-blooded west-pointer in appearance the _ militaire _ as distinguish from the civilian and no doubt impressed those who hold official interview with he as a personage of marked reserve the truth and frankness of the man under all circumstance and he great warm heart full of honesty and unassuming simplicity become know only in the progress of the war how simple and true and honest he be will appear from a letter to he son gw custi lee write some time before : you must study he write to be frank with the world frankness be the child of honesty and courage say just what you mean to do on every occasion and take it for grant you mean to do right if a friend ask a favor you should grant it if it be reasonable if not tell he plainly why you can not : you will wrong he and wrong yourself by equivocation of any kind never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one the man who require you to do so be dearly purchase at a sacrifice deal kindly but firmly with all you classmate you will find it the policy which wear best above all do not appear to other what you be not if you have any fault to find with any one tell he not other of what you complain there be no more dangerous experiment than that of undertake to be one thing before a man 's face and another behind he back we should live act and say nothing to the injury of any one it be not only best as a matter of principle but it be the path to peace and honor in regard to duty let I in conclusion of this hasty letter inform you that nearly a hundred year ago there be a day of remarkable gloom and darkness -- still know as ` the dark day ' -- a day when the light of the sun be slowly extinguish as if by a eclipse the legislature of connecticut be in session and as its member see the unexpected and unaccountable darkness come on they share in the general awe and terror it be suppose by many that the last day -- the day of judgment -- have come some one in the consternation of the hour move a adjournment then there arise a old puritan legislator davenport of stamford and say that if the last day have come he desire to be find at he place do he duty and therefore move that candle be bring in so that the house could proceed with its duty there be quietness in that man 's mind the quietness of heavenly wisdom and inflexible willingness to obey present duty duty then be the sublimest word in we language do you duty in all thing like the old puritan you can not do more you should never wish to do less never let I and you mother wear one gray hair for any lack of duty on you part the maxim of this letter indicate the noble and conscientious character of the man who write it frankness be the child of honesty and courage say just what you mean to do on every occasion never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one duty be the sublimest word in we language do you duty in all thing you can not do more that he live up to these great maxim amid all the troubled scene and hot passion of a stormy epoch be lee 's greatest glory he fame as a soldier great as it be yield to the true glory of have place duty before he eye always as the supreme object of life he resign he commission from a sense of duty to he native state make this same duty he sole aim in every portion of he subsequent career and when all have fail and the cause he have fight for be overthrow it be the consciousness of have perform conscientiously and to he utmost he whole duty which take the sting from defeat and give he that noble calmness which the whole world saw and admire human virtue should be equal to human calamity be he August word when all be lose and man 's mind be sink under the accumulate agony of defeat and despair those word could only have be utter by a man who make duty the paramount object of living -- the performance of it the true glory and crown of virtuous manhood it may be object by some critic that he mistake he duty in espouse the southern cause doubtless many person will urge that objection and declare that the word here write be senseless panegyric but that will not affect the truth or detract from lee 's great character he perform at least what in he inmost soul _ he _ consider he duty and from the beginning of he career when all be so bright to its termination when all be so dark it will be find that he control sentiment be first last and all the time this performance of duty the old puritan whose example he admire so much be not more calm and resolute when the last day of the cause he fight for come -- in the spring of 1865 -- it be plain to all who see the man standing unmoved in the midst of the general disaster that he sole desire be to be find at he place and do he duty from this species of digression upon the moral constituent of the individual we pass to the record of that career which make the great fame of the soldier the war have already begin when lee take command of the provisional force of virginium and the collision in various portion of the gulf state between the federal and state authority be follow by overt act in virginium which all feel would be the real battle-ground of the war the north enter upon the struggle with very great ardor and enthusiasm the call for volunteer to enforce obedience to the federal authority be tumultuously respond to throughout the entire north and troops be hurry forward to washington which soon become a enormous camp the war begin in virginium with the evacuation and attempt destruction of the work at harper 's ferry by the federal officer in command there this be on the 19th of April and on the next day reinforcement be throw into fortress monroe and the navy-yard at norfolk with the shipping set on fire and abandon lee thus find the commonwealth in a state of war and all he energy be immediately concentrate upon the work of place she in a condition of defense he establish he headquarters in the custom-house at richmond orderly be see come and go bustle reign throughout the building and by night as well as by day general lee labor incessantly to organize the means of resistance from the first moment all have feel that virginium from she geographical position adjoining the federal frontier and face the federal capital would become the arena of the earliest longest and most determine struggle she large territory and moral influence as the oldest of the southern state also make she the chief object of the federal hostility it be feel that if virginium be occupy and she people reduce under the federal authority again the southern cause would be deprive of a large amount of its prestige and strength the authority of the gulf state accordingly hurry forward to richmond all available troops and from all part of virginium the volunteer regiment which have spring up like magic be in like manner forward by railway to the capital every train bring addition to this great mass of raw war material large camp rise around richmond chief among which be that name camp lee and the work of drilling and moulding this crude material for the great work before it be ardently proceed with under the supervision of lee a executive board or military council have be form consist of governor letcher and other prominent official but these gentleman have the good sense to intrust the main work of organize a army to lee as yet the great question at richmond be to place virginium in a state of defense -- to prepare that commonwealth for the hour of trial by enrol she own people it will be remember that lee hold no commission from the confederate state he be major-general of the provisional army of virginium and to place this provisional army in a condition to take the field be the first duty before he it be difficult not from want of ardor in the population but from the want of the commonest material necessary in time of war there be few arm and but small supplies of ammunition while the federal government enter upon the war with the amplest resource the south find herself almost entirely destitute of the munitions essential to she protection all be to be organize and put at once into operation -- the quartermaster commissary ordnance and other department transportation supplies of ration arm ammunition all be to be collect immediately the material exist or could be supply as the sequel clearly show but as yet there be almost nothing and it be chiefly to the work of organize these department first of all that general lee and the military council address themselves with the utmost energy the result be that the state find herself very soon in a condition to offer a determine resistance the troops at the various camp of instruction be successively send to the field other take they place and the work of drill the raw material into soldier go on supplies be collect transportation find workshop for the construction of arm and ammunition spring up small-arms cannon cartridge fix and other ammunition be produce in quantity and in a time which now seem wholly inadequate for such a result the commonwealth of virginium be ready to take the field against the federal government x the war begin early in may virginia become formally a member of the southern confederacy and the troops which she have raise a portion of the confederate state army when richmond become the capital soon afterward and the southern congress assemble five brigadier-general be appoint general cooper albert s johnston lee je johnston and beauregard large force have be meanwhile raise throughout the south virginia become the center of all eye as the scene of the main struggle and early in June occur at bethel in lower virginium the first prominent affair in which general butler with about four thousand man be repulse and force to retire the affair at bethel which be of small importance be follow by movement in northern and western virginia -- the battle at rich mountain and carrick 's ford johnston 's movement in the valley and the advance of the main federal army on the force under beauregard which result in the first battle of manassa in these event general lee bear no part and we need not speak of they further than to present a summary of the result the federal design have be to penetrate virginium in three column one be to advance from the northwest under general mcclellan a second under general patterson be to take possession of the valley and a third under general mcdowell be to drive beauregard back from manassa on richmond only one of these column -- that of mcclellan -- succeed in its undertaking johnston hold patterson in check in the valley until the advance upon manassa then by a flank march the confederate general hasten to the assistance of beauregard the battle of manassa follow on Sunday the 21st of July after a unsuccessful attempt to force the confederate right general mcdowell assail they leave make for that purpose a long _ détour _ -- and at first carry all before he reënforcements be hurry forward however and the confederate fight with the energy of man defend they own soil the obstinate stand make by evan bee bartow jackson and they brave associate turn the fortune of the day and when reënforcements subsequently reach the field under general kirby smith and general early the federal troops retreat in great disorder toward washington xi lee 's advance into western virginium general lee nowhere appear as we have see in these first great movement and conflict he be without any specific command and remain at richmond engage in place that city in a state of defense the work which he construct proved subsequently of great importance to the city and a northern officer write of lee : while the fortification of richmond stand he name will evoke admiration the art of war be unacquainted with any defense so admirable lee 's first appearance in the war as commander of troops in the field take place in the fall of 1861 when he be send to operate against the force under general rosecran in the fastness of western virginium this indecisive and unimportant movement have be the subject of various comment the official report be burn in the conflagration at richmond or capture and the elaborate plan draw up by lee of he intended movement against general reynold at cheat mountain have in the same manner disappear under these circumstance and as the present writer have no personal knowledge of the subject it seem best to simply quote the brief statement which follow it be derive from a officer of high rank and character whose statement be only second in value to that of general lee himself : after general garnett 's death general lee be send by the president to ascertain what could be do in the trans-alleghany region and to endeavor to harmonize we movement etc in that part of the state he be not order to take command of the troops nor do he do so during the whole time he be there soon after he arrival he come to the decide conclusion that _ that _ be not the line from which to make a offensive movement the country although not hostile be not friendly supplies could not be obtain the enemy have possession of the baltimore and ohio railroad from which and the ohio river as a base he could operate with great advantage against we and we only chance be to drive he from the railroad take possession and use it ourselves we have not the means of do this and consequently could only try to hold as much country as possible and occupy as large a force of the enemy as could be keep in front of we the movement against cheat mountain which fail be undertake with a view of cause the enemy to contract he line and enable we to unite the troops under general jackson -lrb- of georgium -rrb- and loring after the failure of this movement on we part general rosecran feel secure strengthen he line in that part of the country and go with a part of he force to the kanawha drive we force across the gauley general lee then go to that line of operation to endeavor to unite the troops under general floyd and wise and stop the movement under rosecran general lore with a part of he force from valley mountain join the force at sewell mountain rosecran 's movement be stop and the season for operation in that country be over general lee be order to richmond and soon afterward send to south carolina to meet the movement of the enemy from port royal etc he remain in south carolina until shortly before the commencement of the campaign before richmond in 1862 the month spend by general lee in superintend the coast defence of south carolina and georgia present nothing of interest and we shall therefore pass to the spring of 1862 when he return to richmond he service as engineer have be highly appreciate by the people of the south and a writer of the period say : the time will yet come when he superior ability will be vindicate both to he own renown and the glory of he country the time be now at hand when these ability if the individual possess they be to have a opportunity to display themselves xii lee 's last interview with bishop meade a touching incident of lee 's life belong to this time -- the early spring of 1862 bishop meade the venerable head of the episcopal church in virginia lay at the point of death in the city of richmond when general lee be inform of the fact he exhibit lively emotion for the good bishop as we have say in the commencement of this narrative have teach he he catechism when he be a boy in alexandrium on the day before the bishop 's death general lee call in the morning to see he but such be the state of prostration under which the sick man labor that only a few of he most intimate friend be permit to have access to he chamber in the evening general lee call again and he name be announce to bishop meade as soon as he hear it he say faintly for he breathing have become much oppressed and he speak with great difficulty : i must see he if only for a few moment general lee be accordingly introduce and approach the die man with evidence of great emotion in he countenance take the thin hand in he own he say : how do you feel bishop almost go reply bishop meade in a voice so weak that it be almost inaudible but i want to see you once more he pause for a instant breathing heavily and look at lee with deep feeling god bless you god bless you robert he falter out and fit you for you high and responsible duty i can not call you ` general ' -- i must call you ` robert ' i have hear you you catechism too often general lee press the feeble hand and tear roll down he cheek yes bishop -- very often he say in reply to the last word utter by the bishop a brief conversation follow bishop meade make inquiry in reference to mr lee who be he own relative and other member of the family he also say the highly-respectable clergyman who furnish these particulars put some pertinent question to general lee about the state of public affair and of the army show the most lively interest in the success of we cause it now become necessary to terminate a interview which in the feeble condition of the aged man could not be prolong much exhaust and labor under deep emotion bishop meade shake the general by the hand and say : heaven bless you heaven bless you and give you wisdom for you important and arduous duty these be the last word utter during the interview general lee press the die man 's hand release it stand for several minute by the bedside motionless and in perfect silence and then go out of the room on the next morning bishop meade expire -lrb- illustration : environs of richmond -rrb- part ii _ in front of richmond _ i plan of the federal campaign the pathetic interview which we have just describe take place in the month of march 1862 by the latter part of that month general mcclellan in command of a army of more than one hundred thousand man land on the peninsula between the jame and york river and after stubbornly-contested engagement with the force of general johnston advance up the peninsula -- the confederate slowly retire in the latter part of may a portion of the federal force have cross the chickahominy and confront general johnston defend richmond such be the serious condition of affair in the spring of 1862 the federal sword have nearly pierce the heart of virginium and as the course of event be about to place lee in charge of she destiny a brief notice be indispensable of the design of the adversary against whom he be to contend on the great arena of the state while the south have be lull to sleep as it be by the battle of manassa the north greatly enrage at the disaster have prepare to prosecute the war still more vigorously the military resource of the south have be plainly underestimate it be now obvious that the north have to fight with a dangerous adversary and that the people of the south be entirely in earnest many journal of the north have ridicule the idea of war and one of they have speak of the great uprising of the southern state from the potomac to the gulf of mexico as a mere local commotion which a force of fifty thousand man would be able to put down without difficulty a column of twenty-five thousand man it be say would be sufficient to carry all before it in virginium and capture richmond and the comment on this statement have be the battle of manassa where a force of more than fifty thousand have be defeat and drive back to washington it be thus apparent that the war be to be a serious struggle in which the north would be compel to exert all she energy the people respond to the call upon they with enthusiasm all the roving and adventurous element of northern society flock to the federal standard and in a short time a large force have once more assemble at washington the work now be to drill equip and put it in efficient condition for take the field this be undertake with great energy the congress coöperating with the executive in every manner the city of washington resound with the wheel of artillery and the tramp of cavalry the workshop be busy night and day to supply arm and ammunition and the best officer devote themselves without rest to the work of drilling and discipline the mass by the spring of 1862 a force of about two hundred thousand man be ready to take the field in virginium general scott be not to command in the come campaign he have retire in the latter part of the year 1861 and he place have be fill by a young officer of rise reputation -- general george b mcclellan who have achieve the success of rich mountain and carrick 's ford in western virginium general mcclellan be not yet forty but have impress the authority with a high opinion of he ability a soldier by profession and enjoy the distinction of have serve with great credit in the mexican war he have be send as unite state military commissioner to the crimea and on he return have write a book of marked ability on the military organization of the power of europe when the struggle between the north and south approach he be say -- with what truth we know not -- to have hesitate before determine upon he course but it be probable that the only question with he be whether he should fight for the north or remain neutral in he politics he be a democrat and the war on the south be say to have shock he state-rights view but whatever he sentiment have be he accept command and fight a successful campaign in western virginium from that moment he name become famous he be say to have achieve two victory in one day and he receive from the newspaper the flattering name of the young napoleon the result of this successful campaign slight in importance as it be procure for general mcclellan the high post of commander-in-chief of the army of the united state operation in every portion of the south be to be direct by he and he be especially intrust with the important work of organize the new levy at washington this he perform with very great ability under he vigorous hand the raw material soon take shape he give he personal attention to every department and the result as we have say in the early spring of 1862 be a army of more than two hundred thousand man for operation in virginium alone the great point now to be determine be the best line of operation against richmond president lincoln be strongly in favor of a advance by way of manassa and the orange and alexandrium railroad which he think would insure the safety of the federal capital this be always throughout the whole war a control consideration with he and regard in the light of subsequent event this solicitude seem to have be well found more than once afterward general lee -- to use he own expression -- thought of swap queen that be to say advance upon washington without regard to the capture of richmond and president lincoln with that excellent good sense which he generally exhibit feel that the loss of washington would prove almost fatal to the federal cause -- such be the origin of the president 's preference for the manassa line general mcclellan do not share it he assent it seem at first but soon resolve to adopt another plan -- a advance either from urbanna on the rappahannock or from west point on the york against he view and determination the president and authority struggle in vain mcclellan treat they argument and appeal with a want of ceremony amounting at time nearly to contempt he adhere to he own plan resolutely and in the end the president give way in rueful protest against the continue inactivity of general mcclellan president lincoln have exclaim if general mcclellan do not want to use the army i would like to borrow it and if something be not soon do the bottom will be out of the whole affair at last general mcclellan carry he point and a advance against richmond from the peninsula be decide upon in order to assist this movement general fremont be to march through northwestern virginium and general bank up the valley and have thus arrange they program the federal authority begin to move forward to the great work to transport a army of more than one hundred thousand man by water to the peninsula be a heavy undertaking but the ample resource of the government enable they to do so without difficulty general mcclellan who have now be remove from he post of commander-in-chief of the army of the united state and assign to the command only of the army to operate against richmond land he force on the peninsula and after several action of a obstinate description advance toward the chickahominy general johnston the confederate commander deliberately retire johnston take up a position behind this stream and toward the end of may mcclellan cross a portion of he force and confront he ii johnston be wound the army thus threaten the city which have become the capital of the confederacy be large and excellently equip it number in all accord to general mcclellan 's report one hundred and fifty-six thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight man of whom one hundred and fifteen thousand one hundred and two be effective troops -- that be to say present and ready for duty as fighting-man in the field result of such magnitude ' be expect from this great army that all the resource of the federal government have be tax to bring it to the highest possible state of efficiency the artillery be numerous and of the most approved description small-arm of the best pattern and workmanship be profusely supply the ammunition be of the finest quality and almost inexhaustible in quantity and the ration for the subsistence of the troops which be equally excellent and abundant be bring up in a unfailing stream from the white house in general mcclellan 's rear over the york river railroad which run straight to he army such be the admirable condition of the large force under command of general mcclellan it would be difficult to imagine a army better prepare for active operation and the position which it hold have be well select the left of the army be protect by the wellnigh impassable morass of the white-oak swamp and all the approach from the direction of richmond be obstruct by the natural difficulty of the ground which have be render still more forbid by a abatti of fell tree and earthwork of the best description unless the right of mcclellan on the northern bank of the chickahominy be turn by the confederate he communication with he base at the white house and the safety of he army be assure and even the apparently improbable contingency of such a assault on he right have be provide for other body of federal troops have advance into virginium to coöperate with the main force on the peninsula general mcdowell the able soldier who have nearly defeat the confederate at manassa be at fredericksburg with a force of about forty thousand man which be to advance southward without loss of time and unite with general mcclellan 's right this would completely insure the communication of he army from interruption and it be no doubt expect that general fremont and bank would coöperate in the movement also fremont be to advance from northwestern virginium drive before he the small confederate force under jackson in the valley and general bank then at winchester be to cross the blue ridge mountain and post he force along the manassa railroad guard the approach to washington when mcdowell advance from fredericksburg to the aid of general mcclellan thus richmond would be half encircle by federal army general mcclellan if permit by the confederate to carry out he plan of operation would soon be in command of about two hundred thousand man and with this force it be anticipate he would certainly be able to capture richmond such be the federal program of the war in virginium it promise great result and ought it would seem to have succeed the confederate force in virginium do not number in all one hundred thousand man and it be now apparent that without the able strategy of johnston lee and jackson general mcclellan would have be in possession of richmond before the summer prompt action be thus necessary on the part of the sagacious soldier command the army at richmond and direct operation throughout the theater of action in virginium the officer in question be general joseph e johnston a virginian by birth who have first hold general patterson in check in the shenandoah valley and then hasten to the assistance of general beauregard at manassa where in right of he superior rank he take command before the enemy 's design to advance up the peninsula have be develop johnston have make a masterly retreat from manassa reappear with he force of about forty thousand man on the peninsula he have obstinately oppose mcclellan and only retire when he be compel by number to do so with the resolution however of fight a decisive battle on the chickahominy in face figure and character general johnston be thoroughly the soldier above the medium height with a erect figure in a close-fitting uniform button to the chin with a ruddy face decorate with close-cut gray side-whisker mustache and tuft on the chin reserve in manner brief of speech without impulse of any description it seem general johnston 's appearance and bearing be military to stiffness and he be popularly compare to a gamecock ready for battle at any moment as a soldier he reputation be deservedly high to unshrink personal courage he add a far-reaching capacity for the conduct of great operation throughout he career he enjoy a profound public appreciation of he ability as a commander and be universally respect as a gentleman and a patriot general johnston survey the whole field in virginium and penetrate it would seem the design of the enemy have hasten to direct general jackson command in the valley to begin offensive operation and by threaten the federal force there -- with washington in perspective -- relieve the heavy pressure upon the main arena jackson carry out these instruction with the vigor which mark all he operation in march he advance down the valley in the direction of winchester and come upon a considerable force of the enemy at kernstown make a vigorous assault upon they a heavy engagement ensue and though jackson be defeat and compel to retreat a very large federal force be retain in the valley to protect that important region a more decisive diversion soon follow jackson advance in may upon general bank then at strasburg drive he from that point to and across the potomac and such be the apprehension feel at washington that president lincoln order general mcdowell then at fredericksburg with about forty thousand man to send twenty thousand across the mountain to strasburg in order to pursue or cut off jackson thus the whole federal program in virginium be throw into confusion general bank after the fight at kernstown be keep in the valley after jackson 's second attack upon he when general bank be drive across the potomac and washington threaten general mcdowell be direct to send half he army to operate against jackson thus general mcclellan wait at richmond for mcdowell to join he do not move with a portion of he army on one side of the stream and the remainder on the other side he remain inactive hesitate and unwilling as any good soldier would have be to commence the decisive assault he indecision be bring to a end by general johnston discover that the force in he front near seven pine on the southern bank of the chickahominy be only a portion of the federal army general johnston determine to attack it this resolution be not in consequence of the freshet in the chickahominy as have be suppose prompt johnston to attack while the federal army be cut in two as it be he resolution he state have already be take and be with or without reference to the rain that of a good soldier general johnston strike at general mcclellan on the last day of may just at the moment it appear when the federal commander design commence he last advance upon the city the battle which take place be one of the most desperate and bloody of the war both side fight with obstinate courage and neither gain a decisive advantage on the confederate right near seven pine the federal line be break and force back but on the leave at fair oak station the confederate in turn be repulse night fall upon a field where neither side could claim the victory the most that could be claim by the southerner be that mcclellan have receive a severe check and they sustain a great misfortune in the wound receive by general johnston he be strike by a fragment of shell while superintend the attack at fair oak and the nature of he wound render it impossible for he to retain command of the army he therefore retire from the command and repair to richmond where he remain for a long time a invalid wholly unable to continue in service in the field this untoward event render it necessary to find a new commander for the army without loss of time general lee have return some time before from the south and to he all eye be turn he have have no opportunity to display he ability upon a conspicuous theater -- the sole command he have be intrust with that in trans-alleghany virginium could scarcely be call a real command -- and he owe he elevation now to the place vacate by general johnston rather to he service perform in the old army of the united state than to any thing he have effect in the war of the confederacy the confidence of the virginia people in he great ability have never waver and there be no reason to suppose that the confederate authority be backward in concede he merit as a soldier whatever may have be the consideration lead to he appointment he be assign on the 3d day of June to the command of the army and thus the virginian assemble to defend the capital of they state find themselves under the command of the most illustrious of they own countryman iii lee assign to the command -- he family at the white house lee have up to this time effect as we have show almost nothing in the progress of the war intrust with no command and employ only in organize the force or superintend the construction of defence he have fail to achieve any of those success in the field which constitute the glory of the soldier he might possess the great ability which he friend and admirer claim for he but he be yet to show the world at large that he do really possess they the decisive moment have now arrive which be to test he he be place in command of the largest and most important army in the confederacy and to he be intrust the defense of the capital not only of virginium but of the south if richmond be to fall the confederate congress executive and head of department would all be fugitive the evacuation of virginium might or might not follow but in the very commencement of the conflict the enemy would achieve a immense advantage recognition by the european power would be hopeless in such a event and the wander and fugitive government of the confederacy would excite only contempt such be the circumstance under which general lee assume command of the army of northern virginium as it be soon afterward style the date of he assignment to duty be June 3 1862 -- three day after general johnston have retire in consequence of he wound thirty day afterward the great campaign around richmond have be decide and to the narrative of what follow the appointment of lee we shall at once proceed after give a few word to another subject connect with he family when general lee leave washington to repair to richmond he remove the lady of he family from arlington to the white house on the pamunkey near the spot where that river unite with the mattapony to form the york river this estate like the arlington property have come into possession of general lee through he wife and as arlington be expose to the enemy the lady have take refuge here with the hope that they would be safe from intrusion or danger the result be unfortunate the white house be a favorable base for the federal army and intelligence one day reach mr lee and she family that the enemy be approach the lady therefore hasten from the place to a point of greater safety and before she departure mr lee be say to have affix to the door a paper contain the follow word : northern soldier who profess to reverence washington forbear to desecrate the home of he first married life the property of he wife now own by she descendant a grand-daughter of mr washington when the federal force take possession of the place a northern officer it be say write beneath this : a northern officer have protect you property in sight of the enemy and at the request of you overseer the resolute spirit of mr lee be indicate by a incident which follow she take refuge with she daughter in a friend 's house near richmond and when a federal officer be send to search the house hand to he a paper address to the general in command in which she write : sir : i have patiently and humbly submit to the search of my house by man under you command who be satisfied that there be nothing here which they want all the plate and other valuable have long since be remove to richmond and be now beyond the reach of any northern marauder who may wish for they possession wife of robert lee general csa the lady finally repair for safety to the city of richmond and the white house be burn either before or when general mcclellan retreat the place be not without historic interest as the scene of washington 's first interview with martha custi who afterward become he wife he be marry either at st peter 's church near by or in the house which originally stand on the site of the one now destroy by the federal force its historic association thus fail to protect the white house and like arlington it fall a sacrifice to the pitiless hand of war from this species of digression we come back to the narrative of public event and the history of the great series of battle which be to make the bank of the chickahominy historic ground on take command lee have assiduously address himself to the task of increase the efficiency of the army : ride incessantly to and fro he have inspect with he own eye the condition of the troops officer of the commissary quartermaster and ordnance department be hold to a strict accountability and in a short time the army be in a high state of efficiency what be the amount of the confederate force under command of lee it may be ask the present writer be unable to state this number with any thing like exactness the official record if in existence be not accessible and the matter must be leave to conjecture it be tolerably certain however that even after the arrival of jackson the army number less than seventy-five thousand officer of high rank and character state the whole force to have be sixty or seventy thousand only it will thus be see that the federal army be larger than the confederate but this be comparatively a unimportant fact the event be decide rather by generalship than the number of the combatant iv lee resolve to attack general lee assume command of the army on the 3d of June a week afterward jackson finish the great campaign of the valley by defeat general fremont and shield at port republic such have be the important service perform by the famous stonewall jackson who be to become the right arm of lee in the greater campaign of the future retreat after the defeat of general bank and pass through strasburg just as fremont from the west and the twenty thousand man of general mcdowell from the east rush to intercept he jackson have sullenly fall back up the valley with all he capture store and prisoner and at cross key and port republic have achieve a complete victory over he two adversary fremont be check by ewell who then hasten across to take part in the attack on shield the result be a federal defeat and retreat down the valley jackson be free to move in any direction and he army could unite with that at richmond for a decisive attack upon general mcclellan the attack in question have speedily be resolve on by lee any further advance of the federal army would bring it up to the very earthwork in the suburb of the city and unless the confederate authority propose to undergo a siege it be necessary to check the further advance of the enemy by a general attack how to attack to the best advantage be now the question the position of general mcclellan 's army have be briefly state advance up the peninsula he have reach and pass the chickahominy and be in sight of richmond to this stream the natural line of defense of the city on the north and east numerous road diverge from the capital include the york river railroad of which the federal commander make such excellent use and general mcclellan have throw he left wing across the stream advance to a point on the railroad four or five mile from the city here he have erect heavy defence to protect that wing until the right wing cross in turn the tangled thicket of the white-oak swamp on he left flank be a natural defense but he have add to these obstacle as we have state by fell tree and guard every approach by redoubt in these heavy artillery keep watch against a approach enemy and any attempt to attack from that quarter seem certain to result in repulse in front toward seven pine the chance of success be equally doubtful the excellent work of the federal commander bristle with artillery and be heavily man it seem thus absolutely necessary to discover some other point of assault and as the federal right beyond the chickahominy be the only point leave it be determine to attack if possible in that quarter a important question be first however to be decide the character of the defence if any on general mcclellan 's right in the direction of old church and cold harbor a reconnoissance in force be necessary to acquire this information and general lee accordingly direct general stuart command the cavalry of the army to proceed with a portion of he command to the vicinity of old church in the federal rear and gain all the information possible of they position and defence v stuart 's ride around mcclellan general jame eb stuart who now make he first prominent appearance upon the theater of the war be a virginian by birth and not yet thirty year of age resign he commission of lieutenant in the united state cavalry at the beginning of the war he have join johnston in the valley and impressed that officer with a high opinion of he ability as a cavalry officer proceed thence to manassa where he charge and break a company of zouave infantry protect the rear of the army when johnston retire to the rappahannock and bear a active part in the conflict on the peninsula in person he be of medium height he frame be broad and powerful he wear a heavy brown beard flow upon he breast a huge mustache of the same color the end curl upward and the blue eye flash beneath a piled-up forehead have at time the dazzling brilliancy attribute to the eye of the eagle fond of movement adventure bright color and all the pomp and pageantry of war stuart have enter on the struggle with ardor and enjoy it as the huntsman enjoy the chase young ardent ambitious as brave as steel ready with jest or laughter with he banjo-player follow he go into the hottest battle hum a song this young virginian be in truth a original character and impressed powerfully all who approach he one who know he well write : every thing striking brilliant and picturesque seem to center in he the war seem to be to stuart a splendid and exciting game in which he blood course joyously and he immensely strong physical organization find a arena for the display of all its faculty the affluent life of the man crave those peril and hardship which flush the pulse and make the heart beat fast he swing himself into the saddle at the sound of the bugle as the hunter spring on horseback and at such moment he cheek glow and he huge mustache curl with enjoyment the romance and poetry of the hard trade of arm seem first to be inaugurate when this joyous cavalier with he float plume and splendid laughter appear upon the great arena of the war in virginium precise people shake they head and call he frivolous undervalue he great ability those best capable of judge he be of a different opinion johnston write to he from the west : how can i eat or sleep in peace without _ you _ upon the outpost jackson say when he fall at chancellorsville : go back to general stuart and tell he to act upon he own judgment and do what he think best i have implicit confidence in he lee say when he be kill at yellow tavern : i can scarcely think of he without weep and the brave general sedgwick of the united state army say : stuart be the best cavalry officer ever _ foal _ in north america in the summer of 1862 when we present he to the reader stuart have as yet achieve little fame in he profession but he be burn to distinguish himself he respond ardently therefore to the order of lee and be soon ready with a pick force of about fifteen hundred cavalry under some of he best officer among they be colonel william hf lee and fitz-hugh lee -- the first a son of general lee a graduate of west point and a officer of distinction afterward the second a son of smith lee brother of the general and famous subsequently in the most brilliant scene of the war as the gay and gallant general fitz lee of the cavalry with he pick force officer by the two lees and other excellent lieutenant stuart set out on he adventurous expedition to old church he effect more than he anticipate and perform a daring feat of arm in addition drive the outpost from hanover court-house he charge and break a force of federal cavalry near old church push on to the york river railroad which he cross burning or capture all federal store meet with include enormous wagon-camp and then find the way back bar against he and the federal army on the alert he continue he march with rapidity pass entirely around general mcclellan 's army and build a bridge over the chickahominy safely reëntered the confederate line just as a large force make its appearance in he rear the temporary bridge be destroy however and stuart hasten to report to he superior he information be important general mcclellan 's right and rear be unprotected by work of any strength if the confederate general desire to attack in that quarter there be nothing to prevent the result of stuart 's famous ride around mcclellan as the people call it determine general lee to make the attack on the north bank of the stream if he have not already so decide it be necessary now to bring jackson 's force from the valley without delay and almost equally important to mask the movement from general mcclellan to this end a very simple _ ruse _ be adopt on the 11th of June whiting 's division be embark on the car of the danville railroad at richmond and move across the river to a point near belle isle where at that moment a considerable number of federal prisoner be about to be release and send down jame river here the train load with confederate troops remain for some time and _ the secret _ be discover by the release prisoner general lee be reënforcing jackson in order that the latter might march on washington such be the report carry to general mcclellan and it seem to have really deceive he -lrb- footnote : i have no doubt jackson have be reënforced from here -- _ general mcclellan to president lincoln June 20th _ -rrb- whiting 's division reach lynchburg and be thence move by railway to charlottesville -- jackson march and countermarch with a elaborate pretence of advance down the valley -- at last one morning the astute confederate who keep he own counsel have disappear he be march rapidly to join lee on the chickahominy not even he own soldier know what direction they be take they be forbid by general order to inquire even the name of the town they pass through direct to reply i do not know to every question and it be say that when jackson demand the name and regiment of a soldier rob a cherry-tree he could extract from the man no reply but i do not know jackson advance with rapidity and on the 25th of June be near ashland here he leave he force and ride on rapidly to richmond pass unrecognized through the street after night he go on to general lee 's headquarters at a house on the nine-mile road lead from the new bridge road toward fair oak station and here take place the first interview since the commencement of the war between lee and jackson what each thought of the other will be show in the course of this narrative we shall proceed now with the history of the great series of battle for which jackson 's appearance be the signal part iii _ on the chickahominy _ i the two army the chickahominy whose bank be now to be the scene of a bitter and determine conflict between the great adversary be a sluggish and wind stream which rise above richmond describe a curve around it and empty its water into the jame far below the city its bank be swampy and thickly clothe with forest or underwood from the nature of these bank which scarcely rise in many place above the level of the water the least freshet produce a overflow and the stream generally narrow and insignificant become a sort of lake cover the low grounds to the basis of the wooded bluff extend upon each side numerous bridge cross the stream from bottom 's bridge below the york river railroad to meadow bridge north of the city of these the mechanicsville bridge about four mile from the city and the new bridge about nine mile be point of the greatest importance general mcclellan 's position have be repeatedly refer to he have cross a portion of he army east of richmond and advance to within four or five mile of the city the remainder meanwhile lay on the north bank of the stream and sweep round in a sort of crescent to the vicinity of mechanicsville where it have be anticipate general mcdowell would unite with it thereby cover its right flank and protect the communication with the federal base at the white house that this disposition of the federal troops be faulty in face of adversary like johnston and lee there could be no doubt but general mcclellan be the victim it seem of the shift and vacillate policy of the authority at washington with the arrival of the forty thousand man under mcdowell he position would have be a safe one general mcdowell do not arrive and this unprotected right flank -- leave unprotected from the fact that mcdowell 's presence be count on -- become the point of the confederate attack the amount of blame if any justly attributable to general mcclellan first for he inactivity and then for he defeat by lee can not be refer to here save in a few brief sentence a sort of feud seem to have arise between himself and general halleck the commander-in-chief station at washington and general halleck then and afterward appear to have regard mcclellan as a soldier without decision or broad generalship and yet mcclellan do not seem to have merit the censure he receive he call persistently for reinforcement remain inactive meanwhile because he estimate the confederate army before he at two hundred thousand man and be unwilling to assail this force under command of soldier like johnston and lee until he own force seem adequate to the undertaking another consideration be the confederate position in front of the powerful earthwork of the city these work would double the confederate strength in case of battle in front of they and believe himself already outnumber the federal commander be naturally loath to deliver battle until reënforced the faulty disposition of he army divide by a stream cross by few bridge have be account for in like manner -- he so dispose the troops expect reënforcements but jackson 's energy delay these washington be in danger it be suppose and general mcdowell do not come it thus happen that general mcclellan await attack instead of make it and that he army be so post as to expose he to the greatest peril a last point be to be note in vindication of this able soldier finding at the very last moment that he could expect no further assistance from the president or general halleck he resolve promptly to withdraw he expose right wing and change he base of operation to jame river where at least he communication would be safe this it seem have be determine upon just before the confederate attack or if he have not then decide general mcclellan soon determine upon that plan to pass now to the confederate side where all be ready for the great movement general lee 's army lay in front of richmond exactly correspond with the front of general mcclellan the division of magruder and huger support by those of longstreet and dh hill be opposite mcclellan 's leave on the williamsburg and york river road directly east of the city from magruder 's left extend the division of general ap hill reach thence up the river toward mechanicsville and a brigade under general branch lay on hill 's leave near the point where the brook turnpike cross the chickahominy north of richmond the approach from the east northeast and north be thus carefully guard as the confederate hold the interior line the whole force could be rapidly concentrate and be thoroughly in hand both for offensive or defensive movement the army thus hold in lee 's grasp and about to assail its great federal adversary be compose of the best portion of the southern population the rank and file be largely make up of man of education and high social position and this result from the character of the struggle the war be a war of invasion on the part of the north and the ardent and high-spirited youth of the entire south throw themselves into it with enthusiasm the heir of ancient family and great wealth serve as private personal pride love of country indignation at the thought that a hostile section have send a army to reduce they to submission combine to draw into the confederate rank the flower of the southern youth and all the best fighting material deficient in discipline and hard to manage this force be yet of the most efficient character it could be count on for hard work and especially for offensive operation and the officer place over it share its character among these general ap hill a virginian by birth be soon to be conspicuous as commander of the light division and representative of the spirit and dash and enthusiasm of the army under forty year of age with a slender figure a heavily-bearded face dark eye a compose and unassuming bearing characterize when off duty by a quiet cordiality he be personally popular with all who approach he and greatly beloved both as man and commander he chief merit as a soldier be he dash and impetus in the charge a braver heart never beat in human breast throughout the war he retain the respect and admiration of the army and the country and a strange fact in relation to this eminent soldier be that he name be utter by both jackson and lee as they expire associate with he in the battle of the chickahominy and to the end be the able and resolute longstreet -- a officer of low and powerful stature with a heavy brown beard reach to he breast a manner mark by unalterable composure and a countenance whose expression of phlegmatic tranquillity never vary in the hottest hour of battle longstreet be as famous for he bull-dog obstinacy as hill for he dash and enthusiasm general lee style he he old war-horse and depend upon he as will be see in some of the most critical operation of the war of the young and ardent virginian general magruder the brave and resolute north-carolinian dh hill and other officer who subsequently acquire great reputation in the army we have no space at present to speak all be to coöperate in the assault on general mcclellan and do they part on the night of the 25th of June all be ready for the important movement and the troops rest on they arm ready for the coming battle ii lee 's plan of assault general lee have be hitherto regard as a soldier of too great caution but he plan for the assault on general mcclellan indicate the possession of a nerve approach audacity fully comprehend he enemy 's strength and position and aware that a large portion of the federal army have cross the chickahominy and be directly in he front he have resolve to pass to the north bank of the stream with the bulk of he force leave only about twenty-five thousand man to protect the city and deliver battle where defeat would prove ruinous this plan indicate nothing less than audacity as we have already say but like the audacity of the flank movement at chancellorsville afterward and the daring march in disregard of general hooker to pennsylvanium in 1864 it be found on profound military insight and indicate the quality of a great soldier lee 's design be to attack the federal right wing with a part of he force while jackson advance still farther to the left come in on they communication with the white house and assail they on they right and rear meanwhile richmond be to be protect by general magruder with he twenty-five thousand man on the south bank if mcclellan fall back down the peninsula this force be to cross and unite with the rest thus the federal army would be drive from all its position and the fate of the whole campaign against richmond would be decide lee 's general order direct the movement of the troops be here give it possess interest as a clear and detailed statement of he intended operation and it will be see that what be resolve on by the commander in he tent he able subordinate translate detail by detail with unimportant modification into action under he eye in the field : headquarters army of northern virginia _ June _ 24 1862 general order no 75 i general jackson 's command will proceed to-morrow from ashland toward the slash church and encamp at some convenient point

four division keep in communication with each other and move in _ echelon _ on separate road if practicable the left division in advance with skirmisher and sharp-shooter extend in they front will sweep down the chickahominy and endeavor to drive the enemy from he position above new bridge general jackson bear well to he left turn beaver dam creek and take the direction toward cold harbor they

herein direct by command of general lee : rh chilton _ aa general _ this order speak for itself and indicate lee 's plan of battle in all its detail further comment be unnecessary and we proceed to narrate the event which follow in do so we shall strive to present a clear and intelligible account of what occur rather than to indulge in the warlike splendor of style which characterize the army correspondent of the journal during the war such a treatment of the subject be leave to other who write under the influence of partisan afflatus rather than with the judicious moderation of the historian nor be battle themselves the subject of greatest interest to the thoughtful student the combination devise by great commander be of more interest than the actual struggle we have therefore dwell at greater length upon the plan of general lee and mcclellan than we shall dwell upon the actual fighting of they army iii the battle of the chickahominy on the morning of the 26th of June 1862 all be ready for the great encounter of arm between the confederate and the federal force on the chickahominy general jackson have be delay on he march from the mountain and have not yet arrive but it be know that he be near and would soon make he appearance and in the afternoon general lee accordingly direct that the movement should commence at the word general ap hill move from he camp to meadow bridge north of richmond cross the chickahominy there and move rapidly on mechanicsville where a small federal force behind intrenchment guard the head of the bridge this force be not a serious obstacle and hill soon disposed of it he attack the federal work storm they after a brief struggle and drive the force which have occupy they back toward beaver dam creek below the mechanicsville bridge be thus clear and in compliance with he order from lee general longstreet hasten to throw he division across hill have meanwhile press forward on the track of the retreat enemy and a mile or two below find himself in front of a much more serious obstruction than that encounter at the bridge namely the formidable position hold by the enemy on beaver dam creek the ground here be of a peculiar character and admirably adapt for a defensive position against a enemy advance from above on the opposite side of a narrow valley through which run beaver dam creek rise a bold almost precipitous bluff and the road which the confederate be compel to take bend abruptly to the right when near the stream thus expose the flank of the assault party to a fire from the bluff as hill 's column push forward to attack this position it be meet by a determine fire of artillery and small-arm from the crest beyond the stream where a large force of rifleman in pit be post with infantry support before this artillery-fire rake he flank and do heavy execution hill be compel to fall back it be impossible to cross the stream in face of the fusillade and cannon the attack end after dark with the withdrawal of the confederate but at dawn hill resume the struggle attempt to cross at another point lower down the stream this attempt be in progress when the federal troops be see rapidly fall back from they strong position and intelligence soon come that this be in consequence of the arrival of jackson who have pass around the federal right flank above and force they to retire toward the main body of the federal army below no time be now lose the memorable 27th of June have dawn clear and cloudless and the brilliant sunshine give promise of a day on which no interference of the element would check the bloody work to be perform hill advance steadily on the track of the retire federal force who have leave evidence of they precipitate retreat all along the road and about noon come in front of the very powerful position of the main body of the enemy near cold harbor general mcclellan have draw up he force on a ridge along the southern bank of powhite creek a small water-course which flow from the northeast empty below new bridge into the chickahominy he left nearest the chickahominy be protect by a deep ravine in front which he have fill with sharp-shooter and he right rest upon elevated ground near the locality know as maghee 's house in front the whole line of battle which describe a curve backward to cover the bridge in rear be protect by difficult approach the ground be either swampy or cover with tangled undergrowth or both the ridge hold by the federal force have be hastily fortify by breastwork of fell tree and earth behind which the long line of infantry support by numerous artillery await the attack the amount of the federal force have be variously state the impression of the confederate differ from the subsequent statement of federal writer the principal part of the federal army say general lee in he report be now on the north side of the chickahominy the force have be place by northern writer at only thirty or at most thirty-five thousand if this be the whole number of troops engage from first to last in the battle the fact be highly creditable to the federal arm as the struggle be long doubtful no doubt the exact truth will some day be put upon record and justice will be do to both the adversary the federal force be command by the brave and able general fitz-john porter with general morell command he right general syke he left and general mccall form a second line slocum 's division and the brigade of general french and meagher afterward reënforced porter who now prepare with great coolness for the confederate attack the moment have come ap hill press forward rapidly with longstreet 's division on the right reach cold harbor in front of the federal center about noon hill immediately attack and a engagement of the most obstinate character ensue general lee accompany by general longstreet have ride from he headquarters on the nine-mile road to the scene of action and now witness in person the fighting of the troops who charge under he eye close in in a nearly hand-to-hand conflict with the enemy this be no doubt the first occasion on which a considerable portion of the man have see he -- certainly in battle -- and that air of supreme calmness which always characterize he in action must have make a deep impression upon they he be clad simply and wear scarcely any badge of rank a feel hat droop low over the broad forehead and the eye beneath be calm and unclouded add a voice of measure calmness the air of immovable composure which mark the erect military figure evidently at home in the saddle and the reader will have a correct conception of general lee 's personal appearance in the first of the great battle of he career hill attack with that dash and obstinacy which from this time forward characterize he but succeed in make no impression on the federal line in every assault he be repulse with heavy loss the federal artillery which be handle with skill and coolness do great execution upon he column as it rush forward and the infantry behind they work stand firm in spite of the most determine effort to drive they from the ridge three of hill 's regiment reach the crest and fight hand to hand over the breastwork but they be speedily repulse and drive from the crest and after two hour ' hard fighting hill find that he have lose heavily and effect nothing it be now past two o'clock in the afternoon and general lee listen with anxiety for the sound of gun from the left which would herald the approach of general jackson nothing be hear from that quarter however and affair be grow critical the confederate attack have be repulse -- the federal position seem impregnable -- and it become apparent say general lee that the enemy be gradually gain ground under these circumstance general mcclellan might adopt either one of the two course both alike dangerous to the confederate he might cross a heavy force to the assistance of general porter thus enable that officer to assume the offensive or finding lee thus check he might advance on magruder crush the small force under he and seize on richmond which would be at he mercy it be thus necessary to act without delay while await the appearance of jackson general lee accordingly direct general longstreet who have take position to the right of cold harbor to make a feint against the federal left and thus relieve the pressure on hill longstreet proceed with promptness to obey the order advance in face of a heavy fire and with a cross-fire of artillery rake he right from over the chickahominy and make the feint which have be order by general lee it effect nothing and to attain the desire result it be find necessary to turn the feint into a real attack this longstreet proceed to do first disperse with a single volley a force of cavalry which have the temerity to charge he infantry as he advance and attack the powerful position before he the roar of gun succeed by loud cheer be hear on the left of lee 's line jackson have arrive and throw he troops into action without delay he then ride forward to cold harbor where general lee await he and the two soldier shake hand in the midst of tumultuous cheer from the troops who have receive intelligence that jackson 's corps have join they the contrast between the two man be extremely striking we have present a brief sketch of lee 's personal appearance upon the occasion -- of the grave commander-in-chief with he erect and graceful seat in the saddle he impose dignity of demeanor and he calm and measure tone as deliberate as though he be in a drawing-room jackson be a very different personage he be clothe in a dingy old coat wear a discolor cadet-cap tilted almost upon he nose and ride a rawboned horse with short stirrup which raise he knee in the most ungraceful manner neither in he face nor figure be there the least indication of the great faculty of the man and a more awkward-looking personage it would be impossible to imagine in he hand he hold a lemon which he suck from time to time and he demeanor be abstracted and absent as jackson approach lee ride toward he and greet he with a cordial pressure of the hand ah general say lee i be very glad to see you i hope to be with you before jackson make a twitch movement of he head and reply in a few word rather jerk from the lip than deliberately utter lee have pause and now listen attentively to the long roll of musketry from the wood where hill and longstreet be engage then to the still more incessant and angry roar from the direction of jackson 's own troops who have close in upon the federal force that fire be very heavy say lee do you think you man can stand it jackson listen for a moment with he head bent toward one shoulder as be customary with he for he be deaf he say in one ear and could not hear out of the other and reply briefly : they can stand almost any thing they can stand that he then after receive general lee 's instruction immediately salute and return to he corps -- lee remain still at cold harbor which be opposite the federal center -lrb- illustration : lee and jackson at cold harbor -rrb- the arrival of jackson change in a moment the aspect of affair in every part of the field whitney 's division of he command take position on longstreet 's leave the command of general dh hill on the extreme right of the whole line and ewell 's division with part of jackson 's old division support ap hill no sooner have these disposition be make than general lee order a attack along the whole line it be now five or six o'clock and the sun be sink from that moment until night come the battle rage with a fury unsurpassed in any subsequent engagement of the war the texan troops under general hood especially distinguish themselves these follow by they comrade charge the federal left on the bluff and in spite of a desperate resistance carry the position the enemy be drive say general lee from the ravine to the first line of breastwork over which one impetuous column dash up to the intrenchment on the crest here the federal artillery be capture they line drive from the hill and in other part of the field a similar success follow the attack as night fall they line give way in all part and the remnant of general porter 's command retreat to the bridge over the chickahominy the first important passage of arm between general mcclellan and general lee -- and it may be add the really decisive one -- have terminate in a great success on the side of the confederate iv the retreat the battle of cold harbor -- or as general lee style it in he report the battle of the chickahominy -- be the decisive struggle between the great adversary and determine the fate of general mcclellan 's campaign against richmond this view be not hold by writer on the northern side who represent the battle in question as only the first of a series of engagement all of pretty nearly equal importance and mere incident attend general mcclellan 's change of base to the shore of the jame river such a theory seem unfounded if the battle at cold harbor have result in a federal victory general mcclellan would have advance straight on richmond and the capture of the city would inevitably have follow but at cold harbor he sustain a decisive defeat he whole campaign be reverse and come to naught from the event occur between noon and nightfall on the 27th of June the result of that obstinate encounter be not a federal success lead to the fall of richmond but a federal defeat which lead to the retreat to the jame river and the failure of the whole campaign against the confederate capital it be concede that general mcclellan really intend to change he base but after the battle of cold harbor every thing have change he no longer have under he a high-spirited army move to take up a stronger position but a weary and dispirited multitude of human being hurry along to gain the shelter of the gunboat on the jame river with the enemy pursue closely and worry they at every step to the condition of the federal army one of they own officer testify and he expression be so strong as wellnigh to move the susceptibility of a opponent we be order to retreat say general hooker and it be like the retreat of a whip army we retreat like a parcel of sheep everybody on the road at the same time and a few shot from the rebel would have panic-stricken the whole command -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : report of the committee on the conduct of the war part i p 580 -rrb- such be the condition of that great army which have fight so bravely stand firm so long against the headlong assault of the flower of the southern troops it be the battle at cold harbor which have produce this state of thing thereby really decide the result of the campaign to attribute to that action therefore no more importance than attach to the engagement on the retreat to jame river seem in opposition to the truth of history we shall present only a general narrative of the famous retreat which reflect the highest credit upon general mcclellan and will remain he greatest glory he at least be too good a soldier not to understand that the battle of the 27th be a decisive one he determine to retreat without risk another action to the bank of the jame river where the federal gunboat would render a second attack from the confederate a hazardous undertaking and on the evening of the 27th of June as he say in he official report assemble the corps commander at he headquarters and inform they of he plan its reason and he choice of route and method of execution order be then issue to general keye to move with he corps across the white-oak swamp bridge and take up a position with he artillery on the opposite side cover the passage of the rest of the troops the train and supplies at savage station on the york river railroad be direct to be withdraw and the corps commander be order to move with such provision munitions and sick as they could transport on the direct road to harrison 's landing these order be promptly carry out before dawn on the 29th the federal army take up the line of march and the great retrograde movement be successfully begin a immense obstacle to its success lay in the character of the country through which it be necessary to pass white oak swamp be a extensive morass similar to that skirt the bank of the chickahominy and the passage through it be over narrow wind and difficult road which furnish the worst possible pathway for wagon artillery or even troops it be necessary however to use these highway or none and general mcclellan resolutely enter upon he critical movement general lee be yet in doubt as to he opponent 's design and the fact be highly creditable to general mcclellan a portion of the federal army still remain on the left bank of the chickahominy and it might be the intention of mcclellan to push forward reënforcements from the peninsula fight a second battle for the protection of he great mass of supplies at the white house or cross he whole army to the left bank of the chickahominy by the lower bridge retreat down the peninsula by the same road follow in advance all that general lee could do under these circumstance be to remain near cold harbor with he main body send a force toward the york river road on the eastern bank of the chickahominy to check any federal attempt to cross there and await further development it be not until the morning of the 29th that general mcclellan 's design become apparent it be then ascertain that he have commence move toward jame river with he entire army and lee issue prompt order for the pursuit while a portion of the confederate army follow closely upon the enemy 's rear other body be direct to move by the williamsburg and charle city road and intercept he or assail he flank if these movement be promptly make and no unnecessary delay take place it be expect that the federal army would be bring to bay in the white-oak swamp and a final victory be achieve by the confederate these complicated movement be soon in full progress and at various point on the line of retreat fierce fight ensue general magruder advance to savage station a important depot of federal store on the york river railroad encounter on the 29th the powerful federal rear-guard which fight obstinately until night when it retire next day general longstreet and ap hill have push down the long bridge road and on the next day -lrb- June 30th -rrb- come on the retreat column which be vigorously engage from the character of the ground little however be effect the enemy fight with obstinate courage and repulse every assault the battle rage until after nightfall when the federal army continue to retreat these action be the most important and in both the confederate have fail to effect any important result even jackson who have be delay by the destruction of the chickahominy bridge in cross to the south bank from the vicinity of cold harbor and have follow in rear of the rest of the army find himself check by general mcclellan 's admirable disposition for the protection of he rear jackson make every effort to strike a decisive blow at the federal rear in the white-oak swamp but he find a bridge in he front destroy the enemy hold the opposite side in strong force and when he endeavor to force a passage the determine fire from they artillery render it impossible for he to do so general mcclellan have thus foiled the generalship of lee and the hard fighting of stonewall jackson he excellent military judgement have defeat every attempt make to crush he on the 1st of July he have successfully pass the terrible swamp in spite of all he enemy and he army be draw up on the wellnigh impregnable height of malvern hill a last struggle take place at malvern hill and the confederate assault fail at all point owe to the wooded nature of the ground and the absence of accurate information in regard to it the attack be make under very great difficulty and effect nothing the federal troops resist courageously and inflict heavy loss upon the assail force which advance to the muzzle of the federal cannon but do not carry the height and at nightfall the battle cease the confederate have suffer a severe repulse on the next morning general mcclellan have disappear toward harrison 's landing to which he conduct he army safely without further molestation and the long and bitter struggle be over v richmond in danger -- lee 's view we have present a sufficiently full narrative of the great battle of the chickahominy to enable the reader to form he own opinion of the event and the capacity of the two leader who direct they full justice have be seek to be do to the eminent military ability of general mcclellan and the writer be not conscious that he have do more than justice to general lee lee have not escape criticism and be blame by many person for not put a end to the federal army on the retreat through white-oak swamp to this criticism it may be say in reply that put a end to nearly or quite one hundred thousand man be a difficult undertaking and that in one instance at least the failure of one of he subordinate in arrive promptly reverse he plan at the most critical moment of the struggle general lee himself however state the main cause of failure : under ordinary circumstance he say the federal army should have be destroy its escape be due to the cause already state prominent among they be the want of timely and correct information this fact attribute chiefly to the character of the country enable general mcclellan skilfully to conceal he retreat and to add much to the obstruction with which nature have beset the way of we pursue column but regret that more be not accomplish give way to gratitude to the sovereign ruler of the universe for the result achieve the reader will form he own opinion whether lee be or be not to blame for this want of accurate information which would seem however to be justly attributable to the war department at richmond rather than to a officer who have be assign to command only three or four week before other criticism of lee refer to he main plan of operation and the danger to which he expose richmond by leave only twenty-five thousand man in front of it when he begin he movement against general mcclellan 's right wing beyond the chickahominy general magruder who command this force of twenty-five thousand man leave to guard the capital express afterward in he official report he view of the danger to which the city have be expose he write : from the time at which the enemy withdraw he force to this side of the chickahominy and destroy the bridge to the moment of he evacuation that be from Friday night until Saturday morning i consider the situation of we army as extremely critical and perilous the larger portion of it be on the opposite side of the chickahominy the bridge have be all destroy but one be rebuild -- the new bridge -- which be command fully by the enemy 's gun from goulding 's and there be but twenty-five thousand man between he army of one hundred thousand and richmond have mcclellan mass he whole force in column and advance it against any point of we line of battle as be do at austerlitz under similar circumstance by the greatest captain of any age though the head of he column would have suffer greatly its momentum would have insure he success and the occupation of we work about richmond and consequently the city might have be he reward he failure to do so be the best evidence that we wise commander fully understand the character of he opponent to this portion of general magruder 's report general lee append the follow remark in forwarding it : general magruder be under a misapprehension as to the separation of troops operate on the north side of the chickahominy from those under himself and general huger on the south side he refer to this subject on page 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 of he report the troops on the two side of the river be only separate until we succeed in occupy the position near what be know as new bridge which occur before twelve o'clock m on Friday June 27th and before the attack on the enemy at gaine 's mill from the time we reach the position refer to i regard communication between the two wing of we army as reëstablished the bridge refer to and another about three-quarter of a mile above be order to be repair before noon on Friday and the new bridge be sufficiently rebuild to be pass by artillery on Friday night and the one above it be use for the passage of wagon ambulance and troops early on Saturday morning besides this all other bridge above new bridge and all the ford above that point be open to we to this general magruder subsequently respond as follow : new bridge be finish on Friday evening the 27th instead of Saturday 28th of June i write from memory in reference to the time of its be finish it be report to I that the bridge three-quarter of a mile above be attempt to be cross by troops -lrb- i think ransom 's brigade -rrb- on Saturday morning from the south to the north side but that find the bridge or the approach to it difficult they come down and cross at new bridge on the same morning my statement in regard to these bridge be not intend as a criticism on general lee 's plan but to show the position of the troops with a view to the proper understanding of my report and to prove that the enemy might have reasonably entertain a design after concentrate he troops to march on richmond we shall not detain the reader by enter upon a full discussion of the interesting question here raise general lee as he observation on general magruder 's report show do not regard richmond as expose to serious danger and be confident of he ability to recross the chickahominy and go to its succor in the event of a attack on the city by general mcclellan have this prompt recrossing of the stream here even be impracticable it may still be a question whether general lee do not in he movement against the federal right wing with the bulk of he army follow the dictate of sound generalship in war something must be risk and occasion arise which render it necessary to disregard general maxim it be one of the first principle of military science that a commander should always keep open he line of retreat but the moment may come when he best policy be to burn the bridge behind he of lee 's movement against general mcclellan 's right it may be say that it be base on the broadest good sense and the best generalship the situation of affair render a attack in some quarter essential to the safety of the capital which be about to be hem in on all side to attack the left of general mcclellan promise small result it have be try and have fail he right alone remain it be possible certainly that he would mass he army and crush magruder march into richmond but it be not probable that he would make the attempt the federal commander be know to be a soldier dispose to caution rather than audacity the small amount of force under general magruder be a secret which he could not be expect to know that general lee take these fact into consideration as general magruder intimate may or may not have be the fact and the whole discussion may be fairly sum up perhaps by say that success vindicate the course adopt success after all be the test of merit say the brave albert sydney johnston and talleyrand compress much sound reasoning in the pithy maxim nothing succeed like success on the 2d of July the campaign be over and general mcclellan must have feel in spite of he hopeful general order to the troops and dispatch to he government that the great struggle for richmond have virtually end a week before he have occupy a position within a few mile of the city with a numerous army in the highest spirit and of thorough efficiency now he lay on the bank of jame river thirty mile away from the capital and he army be wear out by the tremendous ordeal it have pass through and completely discourage we have not dwell upon the horror of the retreat and the state of the army which northern writer paint at the time in the gloomiest color for the moment it be no longer the splendid war-engine it have be and be again afterward nothing could be do with it and general mcclellan know the fact without fresh troops a renew advance upon richmond be a mere dream no further attack be make by general lee who remain for some day inactive in the hot forest of charle city he reason for refrain from a new assault on general mcclellan be sum up in one or two sentence of he report : the federal commander he say immediately begin to fortify he position which be one of great natural strength flank on each side by a creek and the approach to he front command by the heavy gun of he shipping in addition to those mount in he intrenchment it be deem inexpedient to attack he and in view of the condition of we troops who have be march and fight almost incessantly for seven day under the most try circumstance it be determine to withdraw in order to afford they the repose of which they stand so much in need on the 8th of July general lee accordingly direct he march back toward richmond and the troops go into camp and rest vi lee and mcclellan -- they identity of opinion general lee have thus at the outset of he career as commander of the confederate army save the capital by a blow at the enemy as sudden as it be resistless the class of person who be never satisfied and delight in fault-finding under all circumstance declare that a great general would have crush the enemy on they retreat these certainly be in a minority the people at large greet lee as the author of a great deliverance work out for they and on he return to richmond he be receive with every mark of gratitude and honor he accept this public ovation with the moderation and dignity which characterize he demeanor afterward under all circumstance either of victory or defeat it be almost impossible to discover in he bearing at this time as on other great occasion any evidence whatever of elation success like disaster seem to find he calm collect and as nearly unimpressible as be possible for a human be the character of the man lead he to look upon success or failure with this supreme composure which nothing seem able to shake but in July 1862 he probably understand that the confederate state be still as far as ever from have achieve the object of the war general mcclellan have be defeat in battle but the great resource of the united state government would enable it promptly to put other and larger army in the field even the defeat army be still numerous and dangerous for it consist accord to mcclellan 's report of nearly or quite ninety thousand man and the wise brain of its commander have devise a plan of future operation which promise far greater result than the advance on richmond from the chickahominy we shall touch in pass on this interesting subject but shall first ask the reader 's attention to a communication address by general mcclellan at this time to president lincoln it be one of those papers which belong to history and should be place upon record it not only throw the clearest light on the character and view of general lee 's great adversary but express with admirable lucidity the sentiment of a large portion of the federal people at the time the president have invite a statement of general mcclellan 's view on the conduct of the war and on July 7th in the very midst of the scene of disaster at harrison 's landing mcclellan write these statesmanlike word : this rebellion have assume the character of a war as such it should be regard and it should be conduct upon the highest principle know to christian civilization it should not be a war look to the subjugation of the people of any state in any event it should not be at all a war upon population but against armed force and political organization neither confiscation of property political execution territorial organization of state nor forcible abolition of slavery should be contemplate for a moment in prosecute the war all private property and unarmed person should be strictly protect subject only to the necessity of military operation all private property take for military use should be pay or receipt for pillage and waste should be treat as high crime all unnecessary trespass sternly prohibit and offensive demeanor by the military toward citizen promptly rebuke military arrest should not be tolerate except in place where active hostility exist and oath not require by enactment constitutionally make should be neither demand nor receive military government should be confine to the preservation of public order and the protection of political right military power should not be allow to interfere with the relation of servitude either by support or impair the authority of the master except for repress disorder as in other case slave contraband under the act of congress seek military protection should receive it the right of the government to appropriate permanently to its own service claim to slave-labor should be assert and the right of the owner to compensation therefor should be recognize this principle might be extend upon grounds of military necessity and security to all the slave of a particular state thus work manumission in such state and in missourus perhaps in western virginia also and possibly even in maryland the expediency of such a measure be only a question of time a system of policy thus constitutional and pervade by the influence of christianity and freedom would receive the support of almost all truly loyal man would deeply impress the rebel mass and all foreign nation and it might be humbly hope that it would commend itself to the favor of the almighty unless the principle govern the future conduct of we struggle shall be make known and approve the effort to obtain requisite force will be almost hopeless a declaration of radical view especially upon slavery will rapidly disintegrate we present army the policy of the government must be support by concentration of military power the national force should not be disperse in expedition post of occupation and numerous army but should be mainly collect into mass and bring to bear upon the army of the confederate state those army thoroughly defeat the political structure which they support would soon cease to exist in carry out any system of policy which you may form you will require a commander-in-chief of the army -- one who possess you confidence understand you view and who be competent to execute you order by direct the military force of the nation to the accomplishment of the object by you propose i do not ask that place for myself i be willing to serve you in such position as you may assign I and i will do so as faithfully as ever subordinate serve superior i may be on the brink of eternity and as i hope forgiveness from my maker i have write this letter with sincerity toward you and from love for my country this noble and earnest exposition of he opinion upon the proper mode of conduct the war will reflect honor upon general mcclellan when he military achievement be forget it discuss the situation of affair both from the political and military point of view in a spirit of the broadest statesmanship and with the acumen of a great soldier that it have no effect be the clearest indication upon which the war be thenceforward to be conduct the removal of general mcclellan as hold view oppose to the party in power be say to have result from this communication it certainly place he in open antagonism to general halleck the federal secretary of war and as this antagonism have a direct effect upon even connect with the subject of we memoir we shall briefly relate now it be now display defeat on the chickahominy and see little to encourage a advance on the left bank of the jame upon richmond general mcclellan propose to cross that river and operate against the capital and its communication near petersburg the proof of mcclellan 's desire to undertake this movement which afterward prove so successful under general grant be find in a memorandum by general halleck himself of what take place on a visit pay by he to mcclellan at harrison 's landing on July 25 1862 i state to he say general halleck that the object of my visit be to ascertain from he he view and wish in regard to future operation he say that he propose to cross the jame river at that point attack petersburg and cut off the enemy 's communication by that route south make no further demonstration for the present against richmond i state to he very frankly my view in regard to the manner and impracticability of the plan and nothing further it seem be say of this highly impracticable plan of operation it become practicable afterward under general grant mcclellan be not permit to essay it in July 1862 from the fact that it have be resolve to relieve he from command or from general halleck 's inability to perceive its good sense general lee 's view upon this subject coincide completely with those of general mcclellan he express at this time to those in he confidence the opinion that richmond could be assail to greater advantage from the south as a movement of the enemy in that direction would menace she communication with the gulf state and event subsequently prove the soundness of this view attack from all other quarter fail include a repetition by general grant of mcclellan 's attempt from the side of the chickahominy when general grant carry out he predecessor 's plan of assail the city from the direction of petersburg he succeed in put a end to the war part iv _ the war advance northward _ i lee 's protest general lee remain in front of richmond watch general mcclellan but intelligence soon reach he from the upper rappahannock that another army be advance in that quarter and have already occupy the county of culpepper with the obvious intention of capture gordonsville the point of junction of the orange and alexandrium and virginium central railroad and advance thence upon richmond the great defeat on the chickahominy have only inspire the federal authority with new energy three hundred thousand new troops be call for large bounty be hold out as a inducement to enlistment negro-slave in region occupy by the united state army be direct to be enrol as troops and military commander be authorize to seize upon whatever be necessary or convenient for they command without compensation to the owner this indicate the policy upon which it be now intend to conduct the war and the army occupy culpepper proceed to carry out the new policy in every particular this force consist of the troops which have serve under general bank mcdowell and fremont -- a necleus -- and reënforcements from the army of mcclellan together with the troops under general burnside be hasten to unite with the newly-formed army it be style the army of virginium and be place under command of major-general john pope who have hitherto serve in the west general pope have procure the command it be say by impress the authority with a high opinion of he energy and activity in these quality general mcclellan be suppose to be deficient and the new commander come from a region where the war be conduct on a different plan it be say would be able to infuse new life into the languid movement in virginium general pope have take special pain to allay the fear of the federal authority for the safety of washington he intend to lie off on the flank of lee 's army he say and render it impossible for the rebel to advance upon the capital while he occupy that threatening position when ask if with a army like general mcclellan 's he would find any difficulty in march through the south to new orlean general pope reply without hesitation i should suppose not this confident view of thing seem to have procure general pope he appointment and it will soon be see that he proceed to conduct military operation upon principle very different from those announce by general mcclellan war as carry on by general pope be to be war _ à l'outrance _ general mcclellan have write : the war should not be at all a war upon population but against armed force all private property take for military use should be pay for pillage and waste should be treat as high crime all unnecessary trespass sternly prohibit and offensive demeanor by the military toward citizen promptly rebuke the new commander intend to act upon a very different principle and to show that he possess more activity and resolution than he predecessor general pope 's assumption of the command be signalize by much pomp and animated general order he arrive in a train deck out with streamer and issue a order in which he say to the troops : i desire you to dismiss from you mind certain phrase which i be sorry to find much in vogue among you i hear constantly of take strong position and hold they _ of line of retreat and basis of supplies _ let we discard such idea the strongest position which a soldier should desire to occupy be the one from which he can most easily advance upon the enemy let we study the probable line of retreat of we opponent _ and leave we own to take care of itself let we look before and not behind disaster and shame look in the rear _ the result as will be see furnish a grotesque commentary upon that portion of general pope 's order which we have italicize in a address to the army he add further : i have come to you from the west where we have always see the back of we enemy -- from a army whose business it have be to seek the adversary and beat he when find -- where policy have be attack and not defense i presume i have be call here to pursue the same system such be the tenor of general pope 's order on assume command -- order which be either intend seriously as a announcement of he real intention or as a blind to persuade the confederate that he force be large unfortunately for the region in which he now come to operate general pope do not confine himself to these flourish of rhetoric he proceed to inaugurate a military policy in vivid contrast to general mcclellan 's he expatriation order direct that all male citizen disloyal to the united state should be immediately arrest the oath of allegiance to the united state government should be proffer they and if they furnish sufficient security for its observance they should be set free again if they refuse the oath they should be send beyond the federal line and if afterward find within he line they should be treat as spy and shoot they property to be seize and apply to the public use all communication with person live within the southern line be forbid such communication should subject the individual guilty of it to be treat as _ a spy _ lastly general pope 's subordinate be direct to arrest prominent citizen and hold they as hostage for the good behavior of the population if he soldier be bushwhack -- that be to say attack on they forage expedition -- the prominent citizen thus hold as hostage be to _ suffer death _ it be obvious that war carry on upon such principle be rapine general pope venture however upon the new program and a foreign periodical comment upon the result declare that this commander have prosecute hostility against the south in a way that cast mankind two century back toward barbarism we shall not pause to view the great outrage commit by the federal troops in culpepper they have receive thus much comment rather to introduce the follow communication to the federal authority from general lee than to record what be know now to the old world as well as the new profoundly outraged and indignant at these cruel and oppressive act general lee by direction of the confederate authority address on the 2d of August the follow note to general halleck : headquarters army of the c \/ near richmond va _ August _ 2 1862 _ to the general command the we army washington _ : general : in obedience to the order of he excellency the president of the confederate state i have the honor to make you the follow communication : on the 22d of July last a cartel for a general exchange of prisoner be sign by major-general john a dix on behalf of the united state and by major-general dh hill on the part of this government by the term of that cartel it be stipulate that all prisoner of war hereafter take shall be discharge on parole until exchange scarcely have the cartel be sign when the military authority of the united state commence a practice change the character of the war from such as become civilized nation into a campaign of indiscriminate robbery and murder a general order issue by the secretary of war of the united state in the city of washington on the very day that the cartel be sign in virginium direct the military commander of the united state to take the property of we people for the convenience and use of the army without compensation a general order issue by major-general pope on the 23d of July last the day after the date of the cartel direct the murder of we peaceful citizen as spy if find quietly till they farm in he rear even outside of he line and one of he brigadier-general steinwehr have seize innocent and peaceful inhabitant to be hold as hostage to the end that they may be murder in cold blood if any of he soldier be kill by some unknown person whom he designate as bushwhacker some of the military authority seem to suppose that they end will be better attain by a savage war in which no quarter be to be give and no age or sex be to be spare than by such hostility as be alone recognize to be lawful in modern time we find ourselves drive by we enemy by steady progress toward a practice which we abhor and which we be vainly struggle to avoid under these circumstance this government have issue the accompany general order which i be direct by the president to transmit to you recognize major-general pope and he commission officer to be in the position which they have choose for themselves -- that of robber and murderer and not that of public enemy entitle if capture to be treat as prisoner of war the president also instruct I to inform you that we renounce we right of retaliation on the innocent and will continue to treat the private soldier of general pope 's army as prisoner of war but if after notice to you government that they confine repressive measure to the punishment of commission officer who be willing to participate in these crime the savage practice threaten in the order allude to be persist in we shall reluctantly be force to the last resort of accept the war on the term choose by we enemy until the voice of a outraged humanity shall compel a respect for the recognize usage of war while the president consider that the fact refer to would justify a refusal on we part to execute the cartel by which we have agree to liberate a excess of prisoner of war in we hand a sacred regard for plighted faith which shrink from the semblance of break a promise preclude a resort to such a extremity nor be it he desire to extend to any other force of the united state the punishment merit by general pope and such commission officer as choose to participate in the execution of he infamous order i have the honor to be very respectfully you obedient servant re lee _ general commanding _ this communication require no comment it have the desire effect although general halleck return it as couch in language too insulting to be receive on the 15th of August the united state war department so far disapprove of general pope 's order as to direct that no officer or soldier might without proper authority leave he color or rank to take private property or to enter a private house for the purpose under penalty of death ii lee 's maneuver general pope have promptly advance and he army lay in culpepper the right reach toward the blue ridge and the left extend nearly to the rapidan the campaign now become a contest of brain between lee and the federal authority they obvious aim be to leave he in doubt whether a new advance be intend under mcclellan from jame river or the real movement be to be against richmond from the north under these circumstance general lee remain with the bulk of he army in front of richmond but on the 13th of July send jackson with two division in the direction of gordonsville the game of wit have thus begin and general lee move cautiously look in both direction toward jame river and the upper rappahannock as yet the real design of the enemy be undeveloped the movement of general pope might or might not be a real advance but general mcclellan remain inactive and on the 27th of July ap hill 's division be send up to reënforce jackson -- while at the same time general dh hill command a force on the south bank of the jame river be direct to make demonstration against mcclellan 's communication by open fire on he transport the moment approach now when the game between the two adversary be to be decide on the 2d of August jackson assume the offensive by attack the enemy at orange court-house and on the 5th general mcclellan make a prompt demonstration to prevent lee from send he further reinforcement a large federal force advance to malvern hill and be draw up there in line of battle with every indication on the part of general mcclellan of a intention to advance anew upon richmond lee promptly go to meet he and a slight engagement ensue on curl 's neck but on the next morning the federal army have disappear and the whole movement be see to have be a feint this state of indecision continue until nearly the middle of August a incident then occur which clearly indicate the enemy 's intention general burnside be know to have reach hampton road from the southern coast with a considerable force and the direction which he flotilla now take would show the design of the federal authority if a new advance be intend from the jame the flotilla would ascend that river if general pope 's army be look to for the real movement general burnside would go in that direction the secret be discover by the afterward celebrated colonel john s mosby then a private and just return by way of fortress monroe from prison in washington he ascertain when he disembark that burnside 's flotilla be about to move toward the rappahannock and aware of the importance of the information hasten to communicate it to general lee he be admit at the headquarters of the latter near richmond to a private interview and when general lee have finish he conversation with the plain-looking individual then almost unknown he be in possession of the information necessary to determine he plan the rappahannock and not the jame be see to be the theater of the come campaign and general lee 's whole attention be now direct to that quarter jackson have already strike a important blow there coöperating vigorously as be habitual with he in the general plan of action general mcclellan have endeavor by a feint to hold lee at richmond by a battle now jackson hasten the retreat of the army under mcclellan from jame river with he three division jackson cross the rapidan and on the 9th of August attack the advance force of general pope at cedar mountain the struggle be obstinate and at one time jackson 's left be drive back but the action terminate at nightfall in the retreat of the federal force and the confederate commander remain in possession of the field he be too weak however to hold he position against the main body of the federal army which be know to be approach he accordingly recross the rapidan to the vicinity of gordonsville and here he be soon afterward join by general lee with the great bulk of the confederate army such be the event which succeed the battle of the chickahominy transfer hostility to a new theater and inaugurate the great campaign of the summer and autumn of 1862 in northern virginia and maryland iii lee advance from the rapidan general lee it will thus be see have proceed in he military maneuver with the utmost caution determine to give he adversary no advantage and remain in front of the capital until it be free from all danger but for the daring assault upon general mcclellan on the chickahominy he critic would no doubt have charge he with weakness and indecision now but under any circumstance it be certain that he would have proceed in the same manner conduct operation in the method which he judgment approve at length the necessity of caution have disappear general burnside have go to reënforce general pope and a portion of mcclellan 's army be believe to have follow it therefore seem say general lee that active operation on the jame be no longer contemplate and he wisely conclude that the most effectual way to relieve richmond from any danger of attack from that quarter would be to reënforce general jackson and advance upon general pope in comment upon these word a able writer of the north exclaim : veracious prophecy show that _ insight _ which be one of the highest mark of generalship the movement indeed be the right proceeding as the event show and good generalship may be define to be the power of see what be the proper course and the decision of character which lead to its adoption general lee exhibit throughout he career this mingled good judgment and daring and he cautious inactivity be now succeed by one of those offensive movement which if we may judge he by he subsequent career seem to be the natural bent of he character with the bulk of he army he march in the direction of general pope the rest be speedily order to follow and active operation begin for drive the newly-formed federal army of virginium back toward washington we have present lee 's order for the attack on general mcclellan and here quote he order of march for the advance against general pope together with a note address to stuart command he cavalry for that officer 's guidance headquarters army northern virginium _ August _ 19 1862 special order no 185 i general longstreet 's command constitute the right wing of the army will cross the rapidan at raccoon ford and move in the direction of culpepper court-house general jackson 's command constitute the left wing will cross at summerville ford and move in the same direction keep on the left of general longstreet general anderson 's division will cross at summerville ford follow the route of general jackson and act in reserve the battalion of light artillery under colonel sd lee will take the same route the cavalry under general stuart will cross at morton 's ford pursue the route by stevensburg to rappahannock station destroy the railroad bridge cut the enemy 's communication telegraph line and operating toward culpepper court-house will take position on general longstreet 's right ii the commander of each wing will designate the reserve for they command medical and ammunition wagon will alone follow the troops across the rapidan the baggage and supply train will be park under they respective officer in secure position on the south side so as not to embarrass the different road iii cook ration for three day will be carry in the haversack of the man and provision must be make for forage the animal straggle from the rank be strictly prohibit and commander will make arrangement to secure and punish the offender iv the movement herein direct will commence to-morrow 20th instant at dawn of day by command of general re lee : ap mason _ aa g _ headquarters crenshaw 's farm -rcb- _ August _ 19 1862 -rcb- _ general jeb stuart command cavalry _ : general : i desire you to rest you man to-day refresh you horse prepare ration and every thing for the march to-morrow get what information you can of ford road and position of the enemy so that you march can be make understandingly and with vigor i send to you captain mason a experienced bridge-builder etc whom i think will be able to aid you in the destruction of the bridge etc when that be accomplish or when in train of execution as circumstance permit i wish you to operate back toward culpepper court-house create such confusion and consternation as you can without unnecessarily expose you man till you feel longstreet 's right take position there on he right and hold yourself in reserve and act as circumstance may require i wish to know during the day how you proceed in you preparation they will require the personal attention of all you officer the last report from the signal-station yesterday evening be that the enemy be break up he principal encampment and move in direction of culpepper court-house very respectfully etc re lee _ general _ these order indicate general lee 's design -- to reach the left flank of the enemy prevent he retreat by destroy the bridge on the rappahannock and bring he to battle in the neighborhood of culpepper court-house the plan fail in consequence of a delay of two day which take place in its execution -- a delay attribute at that time we know not with what justice to the unnecessarily deliberate movement of the corps command by general longstreet this delay enable the enemy to gain information of the intended movement and when general lee advance on the 20th of August instead of on the 18th as he have at first determine to do it be find that general pope have break up he camp and be in rapid retreat lee follow and reach the rappahannock only to find that the federal army have pass that stream general pope who have promise to conduct none but offensive operation and never look to the rear have thus hasten to interpose the water of the rappahannock between himself and he adversary and when general lee approach he find every cross of the river heavily defend by the federal infantry and artillery in face of this large force occupy a commanding position on the height general lee make no effort to cross he determine he say not to attempt the passage of the river at that point with the army but to seek a more favorable place to cross higher up the river and thus gain the enemy 's right this maneuver be intrust to jackson whose corps form the confederate left wing jackson advance promptly to the warrenton spring ford which have be select as the point of cross drive away a force of the enemy post at the place and immediately begin to pass the river with he troops the movement be however interrupt by a severe rain-storm which swell the water of the rappahannock and render a further prosecution of it impracticable general lee be thus compel to give up that plan and order jackson to withdraw the force which have cross this be do and general lee be now call upon to adopt some other method of attack or to remain inactive in face of the enemy but to remain inactive be impossible the army must either advance or retire information which have just reach the confederate general render one of these two proceedings indispensable the information refer to have be obtain by general stuart the activity and energy of this officer especially in gain intelligence now prove as they prove often afterward of the utmost importance to lee stuart have be direct by general lee to make a attack with a cavalry force on the orange and alexandrium railroad in the enemy 's rear he have promptly carry out he order by strike the federal communication at catlett 's station have destroy there all that he find and tear up the railroad but better than all have capture a box contain official papers belong to general pope these papers which stuart hasten -- march day and night through storm and flood -- to convey to general lee present the clearest evidence of the enemy 's movement and design troops be hasten from every direction to reënforce general pope the entire force on jame river especially be to be bring rapidly north of the rappahannock and any delay in the operation of the confederate would thus expose they to attack from the federal force concentrate from all quarter in they front -lrb- illustration : map -- upper rappahannock -rrb- iv jackson flank general pope it be thus necessary to act with decision and general lee resolve upon a movement apparently of the most reckless character this be to separate he army into two part and while one remain confront the enemy on the rappahannock send the other by a long circuit to fall on the federal rear near manassa this plan of action be oppose to the first rule of the military art that a general should never divide he force in the face of a enemy that lee venture to do so on this occasion can only be explain on one hypothesis that he do not highly esteem the military ability of he opponent these flank attack undoubtedly however possess a great attraction for he as they do for jackson and in prefer such movement lee be probably actuate both by the character of the troops on both side and by the nature of the country the man of both army be comparatively raw levy highly susceptible to the influence of surprise and the appearance of a enemy on they flank or in they rear be calculate to throw they into disorder the wooded character of the theater of war generally render such movement practicable and all that be requisite be a certain amount of daring in the commander who be call upon to decide upon they this daring lee repeatedly exhibit and the uniform success of the movement indicate he sound generalship to command the force which be now to go on the perilous errand of striking general pope 's rear general lee select jackson who have exhibit such promptness and decision in the campaign of the valley of virginium rapidity of movement be necessary above all thing and if any one could be rely upon for that it be the now famous stonewall jackson to he the operation be accordingly intrust and he corps be at once put in motion cross the rappahannock at a almost forget ford high up and out of view of the federal right jackson push forward day and night toward manassa reach thoroughfare gap in the bull run mountain west of that place pass through and completely destroy the great mass of supplies in the federal depot at manassa the whole movement have be make with such rapidity and general stuart command the cavalry have so thoroughly guard the flank of the advance column from observation that manassa be a mass of smoking ruin almost before general pope be aware of the real danger intelligence soon reach he however of the magnitude of the blow aim by lee and hastily break up he camp on the rappahannock he hurry to attack the force assail he communication the first part of general lee 's plan have thus fully succeed general pope who have occupy every ford of the rappahannock so as to render the passage difficult if not impossible have disappear suddenly to go and attack the enemy in he rear general lee promptly move in he turn with the great corps under longstreet and push toward manassa over nearly the same road follow by jackson -lrb- illustration : tj jackson -rrb- v lee follow the contest of generalship have now fully begin and the brain of general lee be match against the brain of general pope it be no part of the design of the writer of this volume to exalt unduly the reputation of lee and detract from the credit due he adversary justice have be seek to be do to general mcclellan the same measure of justice will be deal out to he successor on the federal side nor be it calculate to elevate the fame of lee to show that he opponent be incapable and inefficient of general pope however it must be say that he suffer himself to be outgenerall in every particular and the pithy comment of general lee that he do not appear to be aware of he situation sum up the whole subject it be beyond we purpose to enter upon any thing resemble a detailed narrative of the confused and complicated movement of the various corps of the army under general pope these have be the subject of the severest criticism by he own follower we shall simply notice the naked event jackson reach manassa on the night of August 26th take it and on the next day destroy the great depot general pope be hasten to protect it but be delay by ewell at bristoe and a force send up from washington under the brave general taylor be drive off with loss then have achieve he aim jackson fall back toward sudley if the reader will look at the map he will now understand the exact condition of affair jackson have burn the federal depot of supplies and retire before the great force hasten to rescue they he have with he about twenty thousand man and general pope 's force be probably triple that number thus the point be to hold general pope at arm 's - length until the arrival of lee and to accomplish this great end jackson fall back beyond groveton there he form line of battle and wait it be obvious that under these circumstance the true policy of general pope be to obstruct thoroughfare gap the only road by which lee could approach promptly and then crush jackson on the night of the 27th general mcdowell be accordingly send thither with forty thousand man but general pope order he on the next morning to manassa where he hope to bag the whole crowd he say -- that be to say the force under jackson this be the fatal mistake make by general pope thoroughfare gap be comparatively undefended while general pope be march to attack jackson who have disappear it be the next thing to a certainty that general lee would attack _ he _ all party be thus move to and fro but the confederate enjoy the very great advantage over general pope of know precisely how affair stand and of have determine upon they own plan of operation jackson with he back to the mountain be wait for lee lee be approach rapidly to unite the two half of he army general pope meanwhile be march and countermarch apparently ignorant of the whereabouts of jackson -lrb- 1 -rrb- general lee in personal command of longstreet 's corps reach the western end of thoroughfare gap about sunset on the 28th and the sound of artillery from the direction of groveton indicate that jackson and general pope have come in collision jackson have himself bring on this engagement by attack the flank of one of general pope 's various column as it march across he front over the warrenton road and this be the origin of the sound waft to general lee 's ear as he come in sight of thoroughfare it be certainly calculate to excite he nerve if they be capable of be excite jackson be evidently engage and the disproportion between he force and those of general pope render such a engagement extremely critical lee accordingly press forward reach the gap and the advance force suddenly halt : the gap be defend the federal force post here at the eastern opening of the gap be small and wholly inadequate for the purpose but this be as yet unknown to general lee he anxiety under these circumstance must have be great jackson might be crush before he arrival he ride up to the summit of the commanding hill which rise just west of the gap and dismount direct he field-glass toward the shaggy defile in front -lrb- footnote 1 : not know at the time where be the enemy -- _ general porter _ -rrb- and undecided what course to pursue -lrb- illustration : lee reconnoitring at throughfare gap -rrb- the writer of these page chance to be near the confederate commander at this moment and be vividly impress by the air of unmoved calmness which mark he countenance and demeanor nothing in the expression of he face and no hurry movement indicate excitement or anxiety here as on many other occasion lee impress the writer as a individual gifted with the most surprising faculty of remain cool and unaffected in the midst of circumstance calculate to arouse the most phlegmatic after reconnoitr for some moment without move he close he glass slowly as though he be bury in reflection and deliberate at he leisure and walk back slowly to he horse mount and ride down the hill the attack be not delay and flanking column be send to cross north of the gap and assail the enemy 's rear but the assault in front be successful the small force of the enemy at the eastern opening of the gap retire and by nine o'clock at night general longstreet 's corps be pass through all the next morning -lrb- August 29th -rrb- longstreet 's troops be come into position on the right of jackson under the personal supervision of lee by noon the line of battle be form -lrb- 1 -rrb- lee 's army be once more united general pope have not be able to crush less than one-half that army for twenty-four hour nearly in he clutch and it do not seem probable that he would meet with greater success now that the whole be concentrated and hold in the firm hand of lee -lrb- footnote 1 : the hour of longstreet 's arrival have be strangely a subject of discussion the truth be state in the report of lee longstreet jone and other officer but general pope be ignorant of longstreet 's presence _ at five in the evening _ and general porter he subordinate be dismiss from the army for not at that hour attack jackson 's right declare by general pope to be undefended longstreet be in line of battle by noon -rrb- vi the second battle of manassa lee 's order of battle for the come action be peculiar it resemble a open v with the opening toward the enemy -- jackson 's corps form the left wing and extend from near sudley to a point in rear of the small village of groveton longstreet 's corps form the right wing and reach from jackson 's right to and beyond the warrenton road which run to stonebridge the field of battle be nearly identical with that of July 21 1861 the only difference be that the confederate occupy the ground formerly hold by the federal troops and that the latter attack as johnston and beauregard have attack from the direction of manassa and the tableland around the well-known henry house the southern order of battle seem to have contemplate a movement on one or both of general pope 's flank while he attack in front a assault on either wing would expose he to danger from the other and it will be see that the fate of the battle be decide by this judicious arrangement of the confederate commander the action begin a little after noon when the federal right consist of the troops of general bank sigel and other advance and make a vigorous attack on jackson 's leave under ap hill a obstinate conflict ensue the opposing line fight almost bayonet to bayonet deliver they volley into each other at the distance of ten pace at the first charge a interval between two of hill 's brigade be penetrate by the enemy and that wing of jackson 's corps be in great danger of be drive back this disaster be however prevent by the prompt stand make by two or three regiment the enemy be check and a prompt counter-charge drive the federal assaulting column back into the wood the attempt to break jackson 's line at this point be not however abandon the federal troops return again and again to the encounter and general hill report six separate and distinct assault make upon he they be all repulse in which important assistance be render by general early that brave officer attack with vigor and aid by the fire of the confederate artillery from the elevated ground in jackson 's rear drive the enemy before he with such slaughter that one of they regiment be say to have carry back but three man this assault of the enemy have be of so determine a character that general lee in order to relieve he left have direct hood and evan near he center to advance and attack the left of the assault column hood be about to do so when he find a heavy force advance to charge he own line a warm engagement follow which result in the repulse of the enemy and hood follow they a considerable distance inflict heavy loss it be now nearly nine o'clock at night and the darkness render further operation impossible the troops which have drive the enemy be recall from they advanced position the southern line be reform on the same ground occupy at the commencement of the action and general lee prepare for the more decisive struggle of the next day morning come -lrb- August 30th -rrb- but all the forenoon pass without a resumption of the battle each of the adversary seem to await some movement on the part of the other and the federal commander make heavy feint against both the confederate right and leave with the view of discover some weak point or of induce lee to lay himself open to attack these movement have however no effect lee remain obstinately in he strong position rightly estimate the advantage it give he and no doubt take into consideration the want of supplies general pope must labor under a deficiency which render a prompt assault on he part indispensable the army thus remain in face of each other without serious effort upon either side until nearly or quite the hour of three in the afternoon general pope then resume the assault on lee 's leave under jackson with he best troops the charge be furious and a bloody struggle ensue but jackson succeed in repulse the force it fall back in disorder but be succeed by a second and a third line which rush forward at the double-quick in a desperate attempt to break the southern line these new attack be meet with greater obstinacy than at first and just as the opponent have close in a heavy fire be direct against the federal column by colonel sd lee command the artillery at lee 's center this fire which be of the most rapid and destructive character strike the enemy in front and flank at once and seem to sweep back the charge brigade as they come the fire of the cannon be then redoubled and jackson 's line advance with cheer before this charge the federal line break and jackson press forward allow they no respite general lee then throw forward longstreet who know what be expect of he be already move the enemy be press thus in front and on they flank as lee have no doubt intend in form he peculiar line the corps of jackson and longstreet close in like two iron arm the federal force be drive from position to position the glare of they cannon more and more distant indicate that they have abandon further contest and at ten at night the darkness put a end to the battle and pursuit general pope be retreat with he defeat force toward washington on the next day lee dispatch jackson to turn centreville and cut off the retreat of general pope the result be a severe engagement near germantown which be put a end to by a violent storm general pope now reënforced by the command of general sumner and franklin have be enable to hold he ground until night when on the next day -lrb- September 2d -rrb- the confederate advance to fairfax court-house it be find that the entire federal army be in rapid retreat upon washington such have be the fate of general pope part v _ lee invade maryland _ i he design the defeat of general pope open the way for movement not contemplate probably by general lee when he march from richmond to check the advance in culpepper he object at that time be doubtless simply to arrest the forward movement of the new force threatening gordonsville now however the position of the piece on the great chess-board of war have suddenly change and it be obviously lee 's policy to extract all the advantage possible from the new condition of thing he accordingly determine to advance into maryland -- the fortification in front of washington and the interposition of the potomac a broad stream easily defend render a movement in that direction unpromise on the 3d of September therefore and without wait to rest he army which be greatly fatigue with the nearly continuous march and fight since it have leave the rapidan general lee move toward leesburg cross he force near that place and to the music of the band play the popular air maryland my maryland advance to frederick city which he occupy on the 7th of September lee 's object in invade maryland have be the subject of much discussion one party hold the view that he sole aim be to surround and capture a force of nine or ten thousand federal troops station at harper 's ferry and another party maintain that he propose a invasion of pennsylvanium as far as the susquehanna intend to fight a decisive battle there and advance thereafter upon philadelphium baltimore or washington the course pursue by a army commander be largely shape by the progress of event it can only be say that general lee doubtless leave the future to decide he ultimate movement meanwhile he have a distinct and clearly-defined aim which he state in plain word he object be to draw the federal force out of virginium first the movement culminate in the victory over the enemy at manassa have produce the effect of paralyze they in every quarter on the coast of north carolina in western virginium and in the shenandoah valley have be hear the echo of the great event in middle and northern virginium general burnside 's force have be bring up from the south leave affair at a stand-still in that direction and contemporaneously with the retreat of general pope the federal force at washington and beyond have fall back to the potomac this leave the way open and lee 's farther advance it be obvious would now completely clear virginium of she invader the situation of affair and the expect result be clearly state by general lee : the war be thus transfer he say from the interior to the frontier and the supplies of rich and productive district make accessible to we army to prolong a state of affair in every way desirable and not to permit the season for active operation to pass without endeavor to inflict other injury upon the enemy the best course appear to be the transfer of the army into maryland the state of thing in maryland be another important consideration that great commonwealth be know to be sectionally divide in its sentiment toward the federal government the eastern portion adhering generally to the side of the south and the western portion generally to the federal side but even as high up as frederick it be hope that the southern cause would find adherent and volunteer to march under the confederate banner if this portion of the population have only the opportunity to choose they part unterrified by federal bayonet it be suppose they would decide for the south in any event the movement would be important the condition of affair in maryland general lee say encourage the belief that the presence of we army however inferior to that of the enemy would induce the washington government to retain all its available force to provide for contingency which its course toward the people of that state give it reason to apprehend and to cross the potomac might afford we a opportunity to aid the citizen of maryland in any effort they might be dispose to make to recover they liberty it may be say in sum up on this point that lee expect volunteer to enroll themselves under he standard tempt to do so by the hope of throw off the yoke of the federal government and the army certainly share this expectation the identity of sentiment generally between the people of the state of maryland and virginium and they strong social tie in the past render this anticipation reasonable and the feeling of the country at the result afterward be extremely bitter such be the first design of lee he ultimate aim seem as clear by advance into maryland and threatening baltimore and washington he know that he would force the enemy to withdraw all they troops from the south bank of the potomac where they menace the confederate communication with richmond when this be accomplish as it clearly would be he design be to cross the maryland extension of the blue ridge call there the south mountain advance by way of hagerstown into the cumberland valley and by thus force the enemy to follow he draw they to a distance from they base of supplies while he own communication would remain open by way of the shenandoah valley this be essentially the same plan pursue in the campaign of 1863 which terminate in the battle of gettysburg general lee 's movement now indicate similar intention he doubtless wish in the first place to compel the enemy to pursue he -- then to lead they as far as be prudent -- and then if circumstance be favorable bring they to decisive battle success in which promise to open for he the gate of washington or baltimore and end the war it will now be see how the delay cause by the movement of jackson against harper 's ferry and the discovery by general mcclellan of the entire arrangement devise by lee for that purpose cause the failure of this whole ulterior design -lrb- illustration : map -- map of the maryland campaign -rrb- ii lee in maryland the southern army be concentrate in the neighborhood of frederick city by the 7th of September and on the next day general lee issue a address to the people of maryland we have not burden the present narrative with lee 's army order and other official papers but the great force and dignity of this address render it desirable to present it in full : headquarters army of northern virginium -rcb- near fredericktown _ September _ 8 1862 -rcb- _ to the people of maryland _ : it be right that you should know the purpose that have bring the army under my command within the limit of you state so far as that purpose concern yourselve the people of the confederate state have long watch with the deepest sympathy the wrong and outrage that have be inflict upon the citizen of a commonwealth ally to the state of the south by the strongest social political and commercial tie they have see with profound indignation they sister state deprive of every right and reduce to the condition of a conquer province under the pretence of support the constitution but in violation of its most valuable provision you citizen have be arrest and imprison upon no charge and contrary to all form of law the faithful and manly protest against this outrage make by the venerable and illustrious marylander -- to whom in better day no citizen appeal for right in vain -- be treat with scorn and contempt the government of you chief city have be usurp by armed stranger you legislature have be dissolve by the unlawful arrest of its member freedom of the press and of speech have be suppress word have be declare offence by a arbitrary desire of the federal executive and citizen order to be try by military commission for what they may dare to speak believe that the people of maryland possess a spirit too lofty to submit to such a government the people of the south have long wish to aid you in throw off this foreign yoke to enable you again to enjoy the inalienable rights of freeman and restore independence and sovereignty to you state in obedience to this wish we army have come among you and be prepare to assist you with the power of its arm in regain the rights of which you have be despoil this citizen of maryland be we mission so far as you be concerned no constraint upon you free will be intend -- no intimidation will be allow within the limit of this army at least marylander shall once more enjoy they ancient freedom of thought and speech we know no enemy among you and will protect all of every opinion it be for you to decide you destiny freely and without constraint this army will respect you choice whatever it may be and while the southern people will rejoice to welcome you to you natural position among they they will only welcome you when you come of you own free will re lee _ general commanding _ this address full of grave dignity and highly characteristic of the confederate commander be in vivid contrast with the harsh order of general pope in culpepper the accent of friendship and persuasion be substitute for the rod of iron there would be no coercive measure no arrest with the alternative present of a oath to support the south or instant banishment no intimidation would be permit in the line of the southern army at least marylander should enjoy freedom of thought and speech and every man should decide he destiny freely and without constraint this address couch in term of such dignity have little effect upon the people either they sentiment in favor of the union be too strong or they find nothing in the condition of affair to encourage they southern feeling a large federal force be know to be advance lee 's army in tatters and almost without supplies present a very uninviting appearance to recruit and few join he standard the population in general remain hostile or neutral the condition of the army be indeed forlorn it be wear down by march and fight the man have scarcely shoe upon they foot and above the tattered figure flaunt they rag in the sunshine be see gaunt and begrimed face in which could be read little of the romance of war the army be in no condition to undertake a invasion lack much of the material of war feeble in transportation poorly provide with clothing and thousand of they destitute of shoe be lee 's description of he troops such be the condition of the better portion of the force on the opposite side of the potomac scatter along the hill could be see a weary ragged hungry and confused multitude who have drag along in rear of the rest unable to keep up and whose miserable appearance say little for the prospects of the army to which they belong from these and other cause result the general apathy of the marylander and lee soon discover that he must look solely to he own man for success in he future movement he face that conviction courageously and without utter a word of comment or indulge in any species of crimination against the people of maryland resolutely commence he movement look to the capture of harper 's ferry and the invasion of pennsylvanium -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the reader will perceive that the intent to _ invade _ pennsylvanium be repeatedly attribute in these page to general lee he own expression be by _ threatening _ pennsylvanium to induce the enemy etc that he design invasion aid by the recruit anticipate in maryland seem unquestionable since even after discover the lukewarmness of the people there by the fact that few join he standard he still advance to hagerstown but a step from the pennsylvanium line these fact have induce the present writer to attribute the design of actual invasion to lee with entire confidence and all the circumstance seem to he to support that hypothesis -rrb- the promise of he address have be keep no one have be force to follow the southern flag and now when the people turn they back upon it close the door of the house in the face of the southern troops they remain unmolested lee have thus give a practical proof of the sincerity of he character he have promise nothing which he have not perform and in maryland as afterward in pennsylvanium in 1863 he remain firm against the temptation to adopt the harsh course generally pursue by the commander of invade army he seem to have proceed on the principle that good faith be as essential in public affair as in private and to have resolve that in any event whether of victory or disaster he enemy should not have it in they power to say that he break he plighted word or act in a manner unbecome a christian gentleman prompt action be now necessary the remnant of general pope 's army greatly scatter and disorganize by the severe battle of manassa have be rapidly reform and bring into order again and to this force be add a large number of new troops hurry forward from the northern state to washington this new army be not to be command by general pope who have be weigh and find want in ability to contend with lee the force be intrust to general mcclellan in spite of he unpopularity with the federal authority and the urgent manner in which he have be call upon to take the head of affair and protect the federal capital be the most eloquent of all commentary upon the position which he hold in the eye of the country and the army it be feel indeed by all that the federal ship be roll in the storm and a experienced pilot be necessary for she guidance general mcclellan be accordingly direct after general pope 's defeat to take command of every thing and see to the safety of washington and finding himself at length at the head of a army of about one hundred thousand man he proceed after the manner of a good soldier to protect the federal capital by advance into upper maryland in pursuit of lee iii movement of the two army general lee be already move to the accomplishment of he design the capture of harper 's ferry and a advance into the cumberland valley he plan to attain the first-mentioned object be simple and promise to be successful jackson be to march around by way of williamsport and martinsburg and thus approach from the south a force be meanwhile to seize upon and occupy the maryland height a lofty spot of the mountain across the potomac north of the ferry in like manner another body of troops be to cross the potomac east of the blue ridge and occupy the loudon height look down upon harper 's ferry from the east by this arrangement the retreat of the enemy would be completely cut off in every direction harper 's ferry must be capture and have effect that result the whole confederate force detach for the purpose be to follow the main body of this army in the direction of hagerstown to take part in the propose invasion of pennsylvanium this excellent plan fail as will be see from no fault of the great soldier who devise it but in consequence of unforeseen obstacle and especially of one of those singular incident which occasionally reverse the best-laid scheme and abruptly turn aside the current of history jackson and the commander coöperating with he move on September 10th general lee then with he main body cross the south mountain take the direction of hagerstown meanwhile general mcclellan have advance cautiously and slowly withhold by incessant dispatch from washington warn he not to move in such a manner as to expose that city to danger such danger exist only in the imagination of the authority as the army in advance extend its front from the potomac to the baltimore and ohio railroad general mcclellan nevertheless move with very great precaution feel he way step by step like a man in the dark when on reach frederick city which the confederate have just evacuate good fortune suddenly come to he assistance this good fortune be the discovery of a copy of general lee 's order of march for the army in which he whole plan be reveal general mcclellan have therein the unmistakable evidence of he opponent 's intention and from that moment he advance be as rapid as before it have be deliberate the result of this fortunate discovery be speedily see general lee while move steadily toward hagerstown be suddenly compel to turn he attention to the mountain-pass in he rear it have not be the intention of lee to oppose the passage of the enemy through the south mountain as he desire to draw general mcclellan as far as possible from he base but the delay in the fall of harper 's ferry now make this necessary it be essential to defend the mountain-defile in order to insure the safety of the confederate troops at harper 's ferry and lee accordingly direct general dh hill to oppose the passage of the enemy at boonsboro gap and longstreet be send from hagerstown to support he a obstinate struggle now ensue for the possession of the main south mountain gap near boonsboro and the roar of jackson 's artillery from harper 's ferry must have prompt the assailant to determine effort to force the passage the battle continue until night -lrb- September 14th -rrb- and result in heavy loss on both side the brave general reno of the united state army among other lose he life darkness put a end to the action the federal force not have succeed in pass the gap but learn that a column of the enemy have cross below and threaten he with a attack in flank general lee determine to retire in the direction of sharpsburg where jackson and the force coöperating with he could join the main body of the army this movement be effect without difficulty and lee notice the skill and efficiency of general fitz lee in cover the rear with he cavalry the federal army fail to press forward as rapidly as it be now obvious it should have do the head of the column do not appear west of the mountain until eight o'clock in the morning -lrb- September 15th -rrb- and nearly at the same moment -lrb- the attack begin at dawn in about two hour the garrison surrender say general lee -rrb- harper 's ferry yield to jackson fast-riding courier bring the welcome intelligence of jackson 's success to general lee as the latter be approach sharpsburg and official information speedily come that the result have be the capture of more than eleven thousand man thirteen thousand small-arm and seventy-three cannon it be probably this large number of man and amount of military store fall into the hand of the confederate which afterward induce the opinion that lee 's sole design in invade maryland have be the reduction of harper 's ferry general mcclellan have thus fail in spite of every effort which he have make to relieve harper 's ferry -lrb- 1 -rrb- and no other course remain now but to follow lee and bring he to battle the federal army accordingly move on the track of its adversary and on the afternoon of the same day -lrb- September 15th -rrb- find itself in sight of lee 's force draw up on the western side of antietam creek near the village of sharpsburg -lrb- footnote 1 : all along the march he have fire signal-gun to inform the officer in command at harper 's ferry of he approach -rrb- at last the great opponent be in face of each other and a battle it be obvious could not long be delay iv the prelude to sharpsburg general lee have once more sustain a serious check from the skill and soldiership of the officer who have conduct the successful retreat of the federal army from the chickahominy to jame river the defeat and dispersion of the army of general pope on the last day of August seem to have open pennsylvanium to the confederate on the 15th of September a fortnight afterward general mcclellan at the head of a new army raise in large measure by the magic of he name have pursue the victorious confederate check he further advance and force he to abandon he design of invasion bring he to bay a hundred mile from the capital this be generalship it would seem in the true acceptation of the term and mcclellan harass and hamper by the authority who look but coldly upon he could say with coriolanus alone i do it lee be thus compel to give up he movement in the direction of pennsylvanium and concentrate he army to receive the assault of general mcclellan jackson march with he customary promptness join he with a portion of the detach force on the next day -lrb- September 16th -rrb- and almost immediately those thunder which prelude the great struggle of history begin general lee have draw up he army on the high ground west of the antietam a narrow and wind stream which flow through field dot with homestead and clump of fruit and forest tree to the potomac longstreet 's corps be post on the right of the road from sharpsburg to boonsboro he right flank guard by the water of the stream which here bend westward on the left of the boonsboro road dh hill 's command be station two brigade under general hood be draw up on hill 's left and when jackson arrive lee direct he to post he command on the left of hood he right rest on the hagerstown road and he left extend backward obliquely toward the potomac here make a large bend where stuart with he cavalry and horse-artillery occupy the ground to the river 's bank this arrangement of he troops be extremely judicious as the sequel prove it be probable that general mcclellan would direct he main attack against the confederate leave with the view of turn that flank and hemming in the southern army or drive it into the river by retire jackson 's left lee provide for this contingency and it will be see that the design attribute by he to he adversary be that determine upon general mcclellan occupy the ground on the eastern bank of the antietam he have evidently mass he force opposite the confederate left but a heavy order of battle stand opposite the center and right of lee where bridge cross the stream the respective number of the adversary can be state with accuracy we force at the battle of antietam say general mcclellan when before the committee of investigation afterward be total in action eighty-seven thousand one hundred and sixty-four general lee say in he report : this great battle be fight by less than forty thousand man on we side colonel walter h taylor a gentleman of the highest character and formerly adjutant-general of the army make the confederate number somewhat less in a memorandum before the writer he say : we strength at sharpsburg i think this be correct : jackson _ -lrb- include ap hill _ -rrb- 10000 longstreet 12000 dh hill and walker 7000 ______ effective infantry 29000 cavalry and artillery 8000 ______ total of all arm 37000 this disproportion be very great amounting as it do to more than two for one but this be unavoidable the southern army have be wear out by they long march and fight portion of the command be scatter all over the road of northern virginium wearily drag they half-clothed limb and shoeless foot toward winchester whither they be direct to repair this be the explanation of the fact that in spite of the ardent desire of the whole army to participate in the great movement northward lee have in line of battle at sharpsburg less than forty thousand man general mcclellan make a demonstration against he adversary on the evening of the 16th before the day of the main struggle he throw he right command by general hooker across the antietam at a point out of range of fire from the confederate and make a vigorous attack on jackson 's two division lie near the hagerstown road run northward and thus parallel with lee 's line of battle a brief engagement take place in the vicinity of the dunker church in a fringe of wood west of the road but it be too late to effect any thing of importance night fall and the engagement cease general hooker retain he position on the west side of the stream the oppose line then remain at rest wait for the morning which all now saw would witness the commencement of the more serious conflict v the battle of sharpsburg the battle of sharpsburg or antietam for it be know by both name begin at early dawn on the 17th of September general mcclellan have obviously determine to direct he main assault against the confederate leave a movement which general lee have foresee and provide for -lrb- 1 -rrb- and at dawn commence a rapid fire of artillery upon that portion of the confederate line under cover of this fire general hooker then advance he infantry and make a headlong assault upon jackson 's line with the obvious view of crush that wing of lee 's army or drive it back on sharpsburg and the river the federal force make this attack or advance promptly to support it consist of the corps of general hooker mansfield and sumner and number accord to general sumner forty thousand man of whom eighteen thousand belong to general hooker 's corps -lrb- footnote 1 : in anticipation of a movement to turn the line of antietam hood 's two brigade have be transfer from the right to the left etc -- _ lee _ -rrb- jackson 's whole force be four thousand man of the truth of this statement of the respective force proof be here give : i have always believe say general sumner afterward before the war committee that instead of send these troops into that action in driblet have general mcclellan authorize I to march _ there forty thousand man _ on the left flank of the enemy etc hooker form he corps of _ eighteen thousand _ man etc say mr swinton the able and candid northern historian of the war jackson 's force be show by the confederate official report he corps consist of ewell 's division and jackson 's old division general jone command the latter report : the division at the beginning of the fight number not over one thousand six hundred man early commanding ewell 's division -lrb- 1 -rrb- report the three brigade to number : lawton 's 1150 haye 's 550 walker 's 700 2400 old division as above 1600 jackson 's corps 4000 -lrb- footnote 1 : after general lawton be disabled -rrb- this be the entire force carry by general jackson into the fight and these four thousand man as the reader will perceive bear the brunt of the first great assault of general mcclellan just as the light broaden in the east above the crest of mountain rise in rear of the federal line general hooker make he assault he aim be plainly to drive the force in he front across the hagerstown road and back on the potomac and in this he seem about to succeed jackson have place in front ewell 's division of twenty-four hundred man this force receive general hooker 's charge and a furious struggle follow in which the division be nearly destroy a glance at the casualty will show this they be remarkable general lawton division commander be wound and carry from the field colonel dougla brigade commander be kill colonel walker also command brigade be disabled lawton 's brigade lose five hundred and fifty-four kill and wound out of eleven hundred and fifty and five out of six regimental commander haye 's brigade lose three hundred and twenty-three out of five hundred and fifty and all the regimental commander walker 's brigade lose two hundred and twenty-eight out of less than seven hundred and three out of four regimental commander and of the staff-officer of the division scarcely one remain in a hour after dawn this heavy slaughter have be effect in ewell 's division and the detailed statement which we have give will best show the stubborn resistance offer by the southern troops still they be unable to hold they ground and fall back at last in disorder before general hooker who press forward to seize the hagerstown road and crush the whole confederate leave he be meet however by jackson 's old division of sixteen hundred man who have be hold in reserve and general lee hasten to the point threaten hood 's two small brigade one of which general hood state number but eight hundred and sixty-four man with this force jackson now meet the advance column of general hooker deliver a heavy fire from the wood upon the federal force in face of this fire they hesitate and hood make a vigorous charge general stuart opening at the same time a cross-fire on the enemy with he horse-artillery the combined fire increase they disorganization and it now turn into disorder jackson seize the moment as always throw forward he whole line and the enemy be first check and then drive back in confusion the confederate pursue and cheer the first struggle have thus result in favor of the confederate -- with about six thousand they have repulse eighteen thousand -- and it be obvious to general mcclellan that without reinforcement he right could not hold its ground he accordingly just at sunrise send general mansfield 's corps to the aid of general hooker and at nine o'clock general sumner 's corps be add make in all forty thousand man the appearance of affair at this moment be discourage to the federal commander he heavy assault column have be force back with great slaughter general hooker have be wound and bear from the field general mansfield while form he line have be mortally wound and now at nine o'clock when the corps of general sumner arrive the prospect be depress of the condition of the federal force general sumner 's own statement convey a very distinct conception : on go upon the field say general sumner before the war committee i find that general hooker 's corps have be disperse and route i pass he some distance in the rear where he have be carry wounded but i see nothing of he corps at all as i be advance with my command on the field i send one of my staff-officer to find where they be and general rickett the only officer we could find state that he could not raise three hundred man of the corps general mansfield 's corps also have be check and now begin to waver and break such have be the result of the great federal assault and it be highly creditable to the confederate arm with a comparatively insignificant force jackson have receive the attack of the entire federal right wing and have not only repulse but nearly break to piece the large force in he front the arrival of general sumner however completely change the face of affair and as he fresh troops advance those which have be so roughly handle by jackson have a opportunity to reform this be rapidly effect and have marshal he troops general sumner a officer of great dash and courage make a vigorous charge from this moment the battle begin to rage with new fury general lee have send to the leave the brigade of colquitt ripley and mcra and with these the troops of hood and he own shattered division jackson present a stubborn front but he loss be heavy general starke of the old division be kill the brigade regimental and company officer fall almost without a exception and the brigade dwindle to mere handful under the great pressure jackson be at length force back one of general sumner 's division drive the right of the confederate beyond the hagerstown road and at this moment the long struggle seem end the great wrestle in which the adversary have so long stagger to and fro advance and retreat in turn seem at last virtually decide in favor of the federal arm this be undoubtedly the turning-point of the battle of sharpsburg and general lee have witness the conflict upon he leave with great anxiety it be impossible however to send thither more troops than he have already send as will be see in a moment both he center and right be extremely weak ap hill and general mclaw have not arrive from harper 's ferry thus the left have be reënforced to the full extent of lee 's ability and now that portion of he line seem about to be crushed fortunately however general mclaw who have be delay longer than be expect by general lee at last arrive and be hurry to the leave it be ten o'clock and in that one hour the fighting of a entire day seem to have be concentrated jackson be hold he ground with difficulty when the division of mclaw and walker be send to he as soon as they reach the field they be throw into action and general lee have the satisfaction of witness a new order of thing the advance -- it might rather be call the onward rush -- of the federal line be check jackson 's weary man take fresh heart that great commander promptly assume the offensive and advance he whole line drive the enemy before he until he reoccupy the ground from which general sumner have force he to retire from the ground thus occupy the federal force be unable to dislodge he and the great struggle of the leave at sharpsburg be over it have begin at dawn and be decide by ten or eleven o'clock and the troops on both side have fight as resolutely as in any other action of the war the event have be decide by the pertinacity of the southern troops and by the prompt movement of reënforcements by general lee from he right and center post near he center he have survey at one glance the whole field of action the design of general mcclellan to direct he main assault upon the confederate left be promptly penetrate and the rapid concentration of the southern force in that quarter have by defeat this movement decide the result of the battle attack on the confederate center and right follow that upon the leave in the center a great disaster be at one time imminent owe to a mistake of order the brave general rhode have draw back he brigade post there -- this be see by the enemy -- and a sudden rush be make by they with the view of pierce lee 's center the promptness and courage of a few officer and a small body of troops defeat this attempt general dh hill rally a few hundred man and open fire with a single gun and colonel cooke face the enemy with he regiment stand boldly in line say general lee without a cartridge the stand make by this small force save the army from serious disaster the federal line retire but a last assault be soon begin this time against the confederate right it continue in a somewhat desultory manner until four in the evening when have mass a heavy column under general burnside opposite the bridge in front of lee 's right wing general mcclellan force the bridge and carry the crest beyond the moment be critical as the confederate force at this point be less than three thousand man but fortunately reënforcements arrive consist of ap hill 's force from harper 's ferry these attack the enemy drive he from the hill across the antietam again and so threatening do the situation at that moment appear to general mcclellan that he be say to have send general burnside the message : hold you ground if you can not then the bridge to the last man always the bridge if the bridge be lose all be lose the urgency of this order sufficiently indicate that the federal commander be not without solicitude for the safety of he own left wing ignorant doubtless of the extremely small force which have thus repulse general burnside in all four thousand five hundred man he fear that general lee would cross the bridge assail he left and that the hard-fought day might end in disaster to he own army that general lee contemplate this movement in spite of the disproportion of number be intimate in he official report it be nearly dark he say and the federal artillery be mass to defend the bridge with general porter 's corps consist of fresh troops behind it under these circumstance he add it be deem injudicious to push we advantage further in the face of fresh troops of the enemy much exceed we own the idea of a advance against the federal left be accordingly abandon and a movement of jackson 's command which lee direct with the view of turn the federal right be discontinue from the same consideration night have come both side be wear out neither of the two great adversary care to risk another struggle and the bitterly-contested battle of sharpsburg be over the two army remain face each other throughout the follow day during the night of this day lee cross with he army back into virginium he state he reason for this : as we could not look for a material increase of strength he say and the enemy 's force could be largely and rapidly augment it be not think prudent to wait until he should be ready again to offer battle general mcclellan do not seem to have be able to renew the struggle at that time the next morning he say refer to the day succeed the battle i find that we loss have be so great and there be so much disorganization in some of the command that i do not consider it proper to renew the attack that day this decision of general mcclellan 's subject he subsequently to very harsh criticism from the federal authority the theory have obtain at washington that he have have it in he power by renew the battle to cut lee to piece of the probability of such a result the reader will form he own judgment the ground for such a conclusion seem slight the loss and disorganization be it would seem even greater on the federal than on the confederate side and lee would have probably be better able to sustain a attack than general mcclellan to make it it will be see that general meade afterward under circumstance more favorable still decline to attack lee at williamsport if one of the two commander be greatly censure the other must be also and the world will be always apt to conclude that they know what could be effect better than the civilian but general mcclellan do make a attempt to crush lee such as the authority at washington desire and its result may possibly throw light on the point in discussion on the night of the 19th lee have cross the potomac on the night of the 18th general mcclellan send a considerable force across the river near shepherdstown which drive off the confederate artillery there and at daylight form line of battle on the south bank protect by they cannon north of the river of the brief but bloody engagement which follow -- a incident of the war little dwelt upon in the history -- general ap hill who be send by lee to repulse the enemy give a animated account the federal artillery to the number of seventy piece he say line the opposite height and they infantry be strongly post on the crest of the virginium hill when he advance with he division he be meet by the most tremendous fire of artillery he ever see but the man continue to move on without waver and the attack result in the complete rout of the enemy who be drive pell-mell into the river the current of which be blue with float body general hill chronicle this incident in term of unwonted eloquence and declare that by the account of the enemy themselves they lose three thousand man kill and drown from one brigade which appear to be a exaggeration he own loss be in kill and wound two hundred and sixty-one this repulse be decisive and general mcclellan make no further attempt to pursue the adversary who stand at bay on the soil of virginium be still more formidable than he have be on the soil of maryland as we have intimate on a precede page the result of this attempt to pursue would seem to relieve general mcclellan from the criticism of the washington authority if he be repulse with heavy slaughter in he attempt to strike at lee on the morning of September 20th it be not probable that a assault on he adversary on September 18th would have have different result no further cross at that time be undertake by the federal commander he army be move toward harper 's ferry a important base for further operation and lee 's army go into camp along the bank of the opequan vi lee and mcclellan -- they merit in the maryland campaign general lee and he adversary have display conspicuous merit in the campaign thus terminate and we shall pause for a moment to glance back upon this great passage at arm to give precedence to general mcclellan he have assemble a army after the defeat at manassa with a promptness for which only he own great personal popularity can adequately account have advance to check lee and have fully succeed in do so and have thus not only protect the fertile territory of pennsylvanium from invasion but have strike a death-blow for the time to any design general lee might have have to advance on the federal capital if the situation of affair at that moment be attentively consider the extreme importance of these result will not fail to appear it may perhaps be say with justice that general mcclellan have save the federal cause from decisive defeat there be no army to protect washington but the body of troops under he command these be largely raw levy which defeat would have break to piece and thus the way would have be open for lee 's march upon washington or toward philadelphium -- a movement whose probable result would have be a treaty of peace and the independence of the southern confederacy all these hope be reverse by mcclellan 's rapid march and prompt attack in the hour of a single autumn day on the bank of the antietam the triumphant advance of the confederate be check and defeat and if the further fact be consider that the adversary thus checkmate be lee the military ability of general mcclellan must be concede it be the fashion it would appear in some quarter to deny he this quality history will decide the merit of lee be equally conspicuous and he partial failure in the campaign be due to circumstance over which he have no control he plan as be always the case with he be deep-laid and every contingency have be provide for he be disappoint in he aim by three cause which he could not foresee one be the great diminution of he force owe to the rapidity of he march and the incessant fighting another the failure in obtain recruit in maryland and a third the discovery by general mcclellan of the lose dispatch as it be call which reveal lee 's whole plan to he adversary in consequence of the finding of the order of march mcclellan advance with such rapidity that the laggard of the southern army on the hill north of leesburg have no opportunity of join the main body the gap in the rank of the army thus make be not fill up by maryland recruit lee fall back and he adversary follow no longer fearful of advance too quickly jackson have no time after reduce harper 's ferry to rejoin lee at hagerstown thus concentration of he troops and a battle somewhere near sharpsburg be render a necessity with general lee in this tissue of adverse event the discovery of the order of march by general mcclellan occupy a very prominent place this incident resemble what the french call a fatality who be to blame for the circumstance still remain a mystery but it may be say with entire certainty that the brave officer upon whom it be charge be entirely guiltless of all fault in the matter -lrb- footnote : the officer here refer to be general dh hill general mcclellan say in he testimony afterward before the congressional committee : when at frederick we find the original order issue to dh hill etc the inference be thus a natural one that general hill be to blame but that officer have prove clearly that he have nothing to do with the affair he receive but one copy of the order which be hand to he by general jackson in person and know its great importance he place it in he pocket-book and still retain it in he possession this fact be conclusive since general hill could not have lose what he continue to hold in he hand this mystery will be clear up at some time probably at present but one thing be certain that general hill be in no manner to blame the present writer desire to make this statement as explicit as possible as in other account of these transaction he be lead by general mcclellan 's language to attribute blame to general hill where he deserve none -rrb- whatever may have be the secret history of the lose dispatch however it certainly fall into general mcclellan 's hand and largely direct the subsequent movement of the oppose army from what be here write it will be see that lee be not justly chargeable with the result of the maryland campaign he have provide for every thing as far as lay in he power have he not be disappoint in event to be fairly anticipate it seem he force would have receive large accession he rear would have close up and the advance into pennsylvanium would have take place instead of this he be force to retire and fight a pitched battle at sharpsburg and this action certainly exhibit on lee 's part military ability of the highest order the force oppose to he have be at least double that of he own army and the federal troops have fight with a gallantry unsurpassed in any other engagement of the war that they assault on lee fail be due to the fight quality of he troops and he own generalship he army have be manoeuvre with a rapidity and precision which must have excite even the admiration of the distinguished soldier oppose to he he have promptly concentrated he force opposite every threaten point in turn and if he have not be able to carry out the axiom of napoleon that a commander should always be superior to the enemy at the point of contact he have at least do all that be possible to effect that end and have so far succeed as to have repulse if not route he adversary this be the main feature to be notice in lee 's handling of he troops at sharpsburg a unwary or inactive commander would have there suffer decisive defeat for the confederate left wing number throughout the early part of the battle scarcely more than four thousand man while the column direct against it amount first to eighteen thousand and in all to forty thousand man to meet the impact of this heavy mass not only desperate fighting but rapid and skilful manoeuvring be necessary the record we have present will enable the reader to form he own opinion whether lee be equal to this emergency involve the fate of he army military critic examine this great battle with fair and candid eye will not fail we think to discern the truth that the southern army of less than forty thousand man repulse more than eighty thousand in the battle of sharpsburg be due to the hard fighting of the smaller force and the skill with which its commander manoeuvre it vii lee and he man general lee and he army pass the brilliant day of autumn in the beautiful valley of the shenandoah this region be famous for its salubrity and the beauty of its scenery the mountain wind be pure and invigorating and the forest which in the season of autumn assume all the color of the rainbow inspire the mind with the most agreeable sensation the region in fact be know as the garden of virginium and the benign influence of they surroundings be soon see on the face of the troops a northern writer who see they at sharpsburg describe they as ragged hungry and in all way miserable but they forlorn condition as to clothing and supplies of every description make no perceptible difference in they demeanor now in they camp along the bank of the picturesque little stream call the opequan which rise south of winchester wander through beautiful field and forest to empty into the potomac the troops laugh jest sing rude camp-ballad and exhibit a joyous indifference to they privation and hardship which say much for they courage and endurance those who carefully consider the appearance and demeanor of the man at that time see that much could be effect with such tough material and have another opportunity to witness under circumstance calculate to test it the careless indifference to the past as well as the future peculiar alike to soldier and child these man who have pass through a campaign of hard march and nearly incessant battle seem to have forget all they trouble and suffering the immense strain upon they energy have leave they apparently as fresh and efficient as when the campaign begin there be no want of rebound rather a excessive elasticity and readiness to undertake new movement they have plainly acquire confidence in themselves rightly regard the event of the battle of sharpsburg where they be so largely outnumber as highly honorable to they and they have acquire still greater confidence in the officer who command they we shall hereafter speak more particularly of the sentiment of the troops toward general lee at this period of he connection with the army the great event of the war continually modify the relation between he and he man as they come to know he better and better he steadily rise in they admiration and regard at this time -- the autumn of 1862 -- it may be say that the troops have already begin to love they leader and have bestow upon he as a army commander they implicit confidence without this confidence on the part of he man a general can effect little with it he may accomplish almost any thing the common soldier be a child and feel that the direct authority be above he that he should look upon that authority with respect and confidence be the first necessity of effect military organization lee have already inspire the troops with this sentiment and it be mainly the secret of he often astounding success afterward the man universally feel that they commander be equal to any and every emergency such a repute can not be usurped troops measure they leader with instinctive acumen and a very astonishing accuracy they form they opinion for themselves on the merit of the question and lee have already impress the army with a profound admiration for he soldiership from this to the sentiment of personal affection the transition be easy and the kindness consideration and simplicity of the man make all love he throughout the campaign lee have not be hear to utter one harsh word a patient forbearance and kindness have be constantly exhibit in all he dealings with officer and man he be always in front indifferent plainly to personal danger and the man look now with admire eye and a feeling of ever-increasing affection on the erect soldierly figure in the plain uniform with scarce any indication of rank and the calm face with its expression of grave dignity and composure which remain unchanged equally on the march and in battle it may be say that when he assume command of the army before richmond the troops have take he on trust now they have come to love he and when he appear the camp buzz the man run to the road call out to each other : there go ma ' robert or old uncle robert and cheer follow he as he ride by the country generally seem to share the opinion of the army there be exhibit even at this early period of the war by the people at large a very great admiration and affection for general lee while in the shenandoah valley where jackson be beloved almost beyond expression lee have evidence of the position which he occupy in the eye of the people which must have be extremely gratifying to he gray-haired man come to he camp and utter prayer for he health and happiness as the great leader of the south aged lady greet he with falter expression full of deep feeling and pathetic earnestness and wherever he go young girl and child receive he with they brightest smile the August fame of the great soldier who have now pass away no doubt render these memory of personal interview with he dear to many even the most trifling incident be cherish and keep fresh by repetition and the writer of these page recall at the moment one of these trifle which may possibly interest some reader there stand and still stand a ancient and hospitable homestead on the south bank of the opequan the heart of whose inmate one and all be ardently with the south in she struggle soon after sharpsburg general lee one day visit the old manor-house crowning the grassy hill and overshadow by great oak general jackson longstreet and stuart accompany he and the reception which he meet with though we can not describe it be such as would have satisfy the most exacting the child come to he and hold out they small hand the lady divide they attention between he and the beloved hero of the valley jackson and the lady of the manor could only express she sense of the great honor of receive such company by declare with a smile that the dinner resemble the famous _ breakfast at tillietudlem _ in scott 's old mortality general lee highly enjoy this and seem disposed to laugh when the curious fact be point out to he that he have seat himself at table in a chair with a open-winged _ unite state eagle _ delineate upon its back the result of this visit it appear afterward be a sentiment of great regard and affection for the general personally by all at the old country-house old and young be charm by he grave sweetness and mild courtesy and doubtless he inspire the same sentiment in other place he headquarters be at this time in a field some mile from winchester a englishman who visit he there describe the general and he surroundings with accuracy and from the account print in _ blackwood 's magazine _ we quote the following sentence : in visit the headquarters of the confederate general but particularly those of general lee any one accustom to see european army in the field can not fail to be strike with the great absence of all the ` pomp and circumstance of war ' in and around they encampment lee 's headquarters consist of about seven or eight pole-tent pitch with they back to a stake fence upon a piece of ground so rocky that it be unpleasant to ride over it its only recommendation be a little stream of good water which flow close by the general 's tent in front of the tent be some three four-wheeled wagon draw up without any regularity and a number of horse roam loose about the field the servant who be of course slave and the mount soldier call ` courier ' who always accompany each general of division in the field be unprovided with tent and sleep in or under the wagon wagon tent and some of the horse be marked ` we ' show that part of that huge debt in the north have go to furnish even the confederate general with camp equipment no guard or sentry be to be see in the vicinity no crowd of aides-de-camp loitering about make themselves agreeable to visitor and endeavor to save they general from receive those who have no particular business a large farm-house stand close by which in any other army would have be the general 's residence _ pro tem _ but as no liberty be allow to be take with personal property in lee 's army he be particular in set a good example himself he staff be crowd together two or three in a tent none be allow to carry more baggage than a small box each and he own kit be but very little larger every one who approach he do so with marked respect although there be none of that bow and flourish of forage cap which occur in the presence of european general and while all honor he and place implicit faith in he courage and ability those with whom he be most intimate feel for he the affection of son to a father old general scott be correct in say that when lee join the southern cause it be worth as much as the accession of twenty thousand man to the ` rebel ' since then every injury that it be possible to inflict the northerner have heap upon he notwithstanding all these personal loss however when speaking of the yankee he neither evince any bitterness of feeling nor give utterance to a single violent expression but allude to many of he former friend and companion among they in the kindest term he speak as a man proud of the victory win by he country and confident of ultimate success under the blessing of the almighty whom he glorify for past success and whose aid he invoke for all future operation the writer add that the troops regard he in the light of infallible love and have a fix and unshakable faith in all he do -- a calm confidence of victory when serve under he the peculiarly interesting part of this foreign testimony however be that in which the writer speak of general lee 's religious sentiment of he gratitude for past mercy and prayer for the assistance of the almighty in the hour of conflict still to come this point we shall return to endeavor to give it that prominence which it deserve at present we shall leave the subject of general lee in he private and personal character and proceed to narrate the last campaign of the year 1862 viii lee pass the blue ridge from the central frontier of he headquarters near winchester the key of the lower valley general lee be able to watch at once the line of the potomac in he front beyond which lay general mcclellan 's army and the gap of the blue ridge on he right through which it be possible for the enemy by a rapid movement to advance and attack he flank and rear if lee have at any time the design of recross into maryland he abandon it general mcclellan attribute that design to he i have since be confirm in the belief he write that if i have cross the potomac below harper 's ferry in the early part of October general lee would have recross into maryland of lee 's ability to thus reënter maryland there can be no doubt he army be rest provision and in high spirit the straggler have rejoin they command and it be certain that the order for a new advance would have be hail by the mercurial troops with enthusiasm no such order be however issue and soon the approach of winter render the movement impossible more than a month thus pass the two army remain in face of each other no engagement of any importance occur during this period of inactivity but once or twice the federal commander send heavy reconnoitring force across the potomac and stuart now mount to the zenith of he reputation as a cavalry-officer repeat he famous ride around mcclellan on the chickahominy the object of general lee in direct this movement of the cavalry be the ordinary one on such occasion of obtain information and inflict injury upon the enemy stuart respond with ardor to the order he have conceive a warm affection for general lee mingle with a respect for he military genius nearly unbounded and at this time as always afterward receive the order of he commander for active operation with enthusiasm with about eighteen hundred trooper and four piece of horse-artillery stuart cross the potomac above williamsport march rapidly to chambersburg in pennsylvanium where he destroy the machine-shop and other building contain a large number of arm and military store and continue he way thence toward frederick city with the bold design of completely pass around the federal army and recross the river east of the blue ridge in this he succeed thanks to he skill and audacity in spite of every effort of the enemy to cut off and destroy he reach white 's ford on the potomac north of leesburg he dispose he horse-artillery so as to cover this movement cut he way through the federal cavalry dispute he passage and recross into virginium with a large number of capture horse and without lose a man this expedition excited astonishment and a prominent officer of the federal army declare that he would not have believe that horse-flesh could stand it as the distance pass over in about forty-eight hour during which considerable delay have occur at chambersburg be nearly or quite one hundred mile general mcclellan complain that he order have not be obey and say that after these order he do not think it possible for stuart to recross and believe the destruction or capture of he entire force perfectly certain soon afterward the federal commander attempt reconnoissance in he turn a considerable force of infantry support by artillery cross the potomac and advance to the vicinity of the little village of leetown but on the same evening fall back rapidly doubtless fearful that lee would interpose a force between they and the river and cut off they retreat this be follow by a movement of the federal cavalry which cross at the same spot and advance up the road lead toward martinsburg these be meet and subsequently drive back by colonel whf lee son of the general a third and more important attempt to reconnoitre take place toward the end of October general mcclellan then cross a considerable body of troops both at shepherdstown and harper 's ferry the column advance to kearneysville and charlestown respectively and near the former village a brief engagement take place without result general mcclellan who have come in person as far as charlestown then return with he troops across the potomac and further hostility for the moment cease these reconnoissance be the prelude however of a important movement which the federal authority have be long urge general mcclellan to make although the battle of sharpsburg have be indecisive in one acceptation of the term in another it have be entirely decisive a draw battle of the clearest sort it yet decide the future movement of the oppose army general lee have invade maryland with the design of advance into pennsylvanium -- the result of sharpsburg be that he fall back into virginia general mcclellan have march from washington with no object but a offensive-defensive campaign to afford the capital protection he be now enable to undertake anew the invasion of virginium to the success of such a movement the federal commander seem rightly to have consider a full and complete equipment of he troops absolutely essential he be direct at once after sharpsburg to advance upon lee he reply that it be impossible neither he man nor he horse have shoe or ration new order come -- general halleck appear to regard the difficulty urge by general mcclellan as imaginary new protest follow and then new protest and new order again until finally a peremptory dispatch come this dispatch be cross the potomac and give battle to the enemy or drive he south a order bear the impress of the terse good sense and rough directness of the federal president this order it be necessary in the end to obey and general mcclellan have decide in favor of a movement across the potomac east instead of west of the mountain proceed in the last day of October to cross he army he plan be excellent and be here set forth in he own word : the plan of campaign i adopt during this advance he say be to move the army well in hand parallel to the blue ridge take warrenton as the point of direction for the main army seize each pass on the blue ridge by detachment as we approach it and guard they after we have pass as long as they would enable the enemy to trouble we communication with the potomac we depend upon harper 's ferry and berlin for supplies until the manassa gap railway be reach when that occur the pass in we rear be to be abandon and the army mass ready for action or movement in any direction it be my intention if upon reach ashby 's or any other pass the enemy be in force between it and the potomac in the valley of the shenandoah to move into the valley and endeavor to gain they rear from this statement of general mcclellan it will be see that he plan be judicious and display a thorough knowledge of the country in which he be about to operate the conformation of the region be peculiar the valley of the shenandoah in which lee 's army lay wait be separate from piedmont virginium through which general mcclellan be about to advance by the wooded rampart of the blue ridge mountain passable only at certain point these _ gap _ as they be call in virginium be the natural doorway to the valley and as long as general mcclellan hold they as he propose to do by strong detachment he would be able both to protect he own communication with the potomac and if he think fit to do so enter the valley and assail the confederate rear that he ever seriously contemplate the latter design be however extremely doubtful it be not credible that he would have undertake to cut off lee 's whole army and if he design a movement of that description against any portion of the southern army which might be detach the opportunity be certainly present to he by lee when jackson be leave as will be see at millwood no sooner have general mcclellan commence cross the potomac east of the mountain than general lee break up he camp along the opequan and move to check this new and formidable advance into the heart of virginium it be not know however whether the whole of the federal force have cross east of the blue ridge and to guard against a possible movement on he rear from the direction of harper 's ferry as well as on he flank through the gap of the mountain lee send jackson 's corps to take position on the road from charlestown to berryville where he could oppose a advance of the enemy from either direction the rest of the army then move guardedly but rapidly across the mountain into culpepper under these circumstance general mcclellan have a excellent opportunity to strike a heavy blow at jackson who seem to invite that movement by cross soon afterward in accordance with direction from lee one of he division to the east side of the mountain on the federal rear that general mcclellan do not strike be not creditable to he as a commander the confederate army be certainly divide in a very tempting manner longstreet be in culpepper on the 3d of November the day after general mcclellan 's rear-guard have pass the potomac and nothing would seem to have be easier than to cut the confederate force by interpose between they by seize the blue ridge gap and thus shut up all the avenue of exit from the valley general mcclellan would have have it in he power it would seem to crush jackson or if that wily commander escape longstreet in culpepper be expose to attack general mcclellan do not embrace this opportunity of a decisive blow and lee seem to have calculate upon the caution of he adversary jackson 's presence in the valley only embarrassed mcclellan as lee no doubt intend it should no attempt be make to strike at he on the contrary the federal army continue steadily to concentrate upon warrenton where on the 7th of November general mcclellan be abruptly relieve of the command he be in he tent at rectortown at the moment when the dispatch be hand to he -- bring by a officer from washington through a heavy snow-storm then fall general ambrose e burnside be in the tent mcclellan read the dispatch calmly and hand it indifferently to he visitor say well burnside you be to command the army such be the abrupt termination of the military career of a commander who fill a large space in the history of the war in virginium the design of this volume be not such as to justify a extended notice of he or a detailed examination of he ability as a soldier that he possess military endowment of a very high order be concede by most person but he critic add that he be dangerously prone to caution and inactivity such be the criticism of he enemy at washington and throughout the north and he pronounced political opinion have gain he a large number it may however be permit one who can have no reason to unduly commend he to say that the retreat to jame river and the arrest of lee in he march of invasion toward pennsylvanium seem to indicate the possession of something more than inactivity and of that species of caution which achieve success it will probably however be claim by few even among the personal friend of this general that he be a soldier of the first ability -- one competent to oppose lee as to the personal quality of general mcclellan there seem to be no difference of opinion he be a gentleman of high breeding and detest all oppression of the weak and non-combatants somewhat prone to _ hauteur _ in presence of the importunity of the executive and other civilian unskilled in military affair he be patient mild and cordial with he man these quality with other which he possess seem to have render he peculiarly acceptable to the private soldier and it be certain that he be beyond comparison the most popular of all the general who one after another command the army of the potomac ix lee concentrate at fredericksburg in return from the valley general lee have exhibit that combination of boldness and caution which indicate in a commander the possession of excellent generalship one of two course be necessary : either to make a rapid march with he entire army in order to interpose himself between general mcclellan and what seem to be he objective point gordonsville or to so maneuver he force as to retard and embarrass he adversary of these lee choose the latter course expose himself to what seem very great danger jackson be leave in the valley and longstreet send to culpepper under these circumstance general mcclellan might have cut off one of the two detach body but lee seem to have read the character of he adversary accurately and to have feel that a movement of such boldness would not probably be undertake by he provision have nevertheless be make for this possible contingency jackson be direct by lee in case of a attack by general mcclellan to retire by way of strasburg up the valley and so rejoin the main body that this movement would become necessary however be not as we have say contemplate it be not suppose by lee that he adversary would adopt the bold plan of cross the blue ridge to assail jackson thus to leave that commander in the valley instead of be a military blunder be a stroke of generalship a source of embarrassment to general mcclellan and a standing threat against the federal communication calculate to clog the movement of they army that lee aim at this be obvious from he order to jackson to cross a division to the eastern side of the blue ridge in general mcclellan 's rear when this be do the federal commander abandon if he have ever resolve upon the design of striking in between the confederate detachment as be claim by he admirer to have be he determination give up all idea of move into the valley and endeavor to gain they rear and from that moment direct he whole attention to the concentration of he army near warrenton with the obvious view of establish a new base and operating southward on the line of the orange and alexandrium railroad lee 's object in these maneuver besides the general one of embarrassing he adversary seem to have be to gain time and thus to render impossible from the lateness of the season a federal advance upon richmond have general mcclellan remain in command it be probable that this object would have be attain and the battle of fredericksburg would not have take place the two army would have lain opposite each other in culpepper and fauquier respectively with the upper rappahannock between they throughout the winter and the confederate force weary and worn by the long march and hard combat of 1862 would have have the opportunity to rest and recover they energy for the come spring the change of commander defeat these view if they be entertain by general lee on assume command general burnside conceive the project in spite of the near approach of winter of cross the rappahannock at fredericksburg and march on richmond this he now proceed to attempt by steadily move from warrenton toward the lower rappahannock and the result as will be see be a federal disaster to wind up this year of battle we have speak with some particularity of the character and military ability of general mcclellan the first able commander of the federal force in virginium of general burnside who appear but once and for a brief space only on that great theater it will be necessary to say only a few word a modest and honorable soldier cherish for general mcclellan a cordial friendship he be unwilling to supersede that commander both from personal regard and distrust of he own ability he have not seek the position which have rather be thrust upon he he be surprised and shocked he say at he assignment to the command he do not want it it have be offer to he twice before and he do not feel that he could take it he have tell they that he be not competent to command such a army as this he have say the same over and over again to the president and the secretary of war he be however direct to assume command accept the responsibility and proceed to carry out the unexpected plan of advance upon richmond by way of fredericksburg to cover this movement general burnside make a heavy feint as though design to cross into culpepper this do not seem to have deceive lee who on the 17th of November know that he adversary be move no sooner have the fact be discover that general burnside be make for fredericksburg than the confederate commander by a corresponding movement pass the rapidan and hasten in the same direction as early as the 17th two division of infantry with cavalry and artillery be in motion on the morning of the 19th longstreet 's corps be send in the same direction and when on November 20th general burnside arrive with he army the federal force draw up on the hill north of fredericksburg see on the highland south of the city the red flag and gray line of they old adversary as general jackson have be promptly direct to join the main body and be already move to do so lee would soon be able to oppose general burnside with he whole force such be the movement of the oppose army which bring they face to face at fredericksburg lee have act promptly and it would seem with good judgment but the question have be ask why he do not repeat against general burnside the strategic movement which have embarrassed general mcclellan and arrest the march upon fredericksburg by threaten with the detachment under jackson the federal rear the reason for not adopt this course will be perceive by a glance at the map general burnside be take up a new base -- aquium creek on the potomac -- and from the character of the country it be wholly impossible for lee to prevent he from do so he have only to fall back before jackson or any force move against he flank or rear the potomac be at hand and it be not in the power of lee to further annoy he the latter accordingly abandon all thought of repeat he old maneuver move longstreet and the other troops in culpepper toward fredericksburg and direct jackson to join he there thus concentrate he force directly in the federal front with the view of fight a pitched battle army against army this detailed account of lee 's movement may appear tedious to some reader but it be rather in grand tactic than in fight battle that he display he highest ability as a soldier he uniformly adopt the broadest and most judicious plan to bring on battle and personally direct as far as be possible every detail of he movement when the hour come it may be say of he that he feel he have do he best -- the actual fighting be leave largely in the hand of he corps commander the feint and slight encounter precede the battle of fredericksburg be not of much interest or importance general burnside send a force to port royal about twenty-five mile below the city but lee promptly detach a portion of he army to meet it if it attempt to cross and that project be abandon no attempt be make by general burnside to cross above and it become obvious that he must pass the river in face of lee or not at all such be the condition of affair at fredericksburg in the first day of December x the battle of fredericksburg to a correct understanding of the interesting battle of fredericksburg a brief description of the ground be essential the city lie on the south bank of the rappahannock which here make a considerable bend nearly southward and along the northern bank opposite extend a range of hill which command the city and the level ground around it south of the river the land be low but from the depth of the channel form a line of bluff afford good shelter to troops after cross to assail a force beyond the only good position for such a force standing on the defensive be a range of hill hem in the level ground this range begin near the western suburb of the city where it be call marye 's hill and sweep round to the southward gradually recede from the stream until at hamilton 's cross on the richmond and potomac railroad a mile or more from the river it suddenly subside into the plain this plain extend to the right and be bound by the deep and difficult channel of massaponnax creek as marye 's hill be the natural position for the left of a army post to defend fredericksburg the crest above hamilton 's cross be the natural position for the right of such a line care be take to cover the extreme right with artillery to obstruct the passage of the ground between the crest and the massaponnax -lrb- illustration : map -- battle of fredericksburg -rrb- behind the hill on the north side general burnside 's army be post have the railroad to aquium creek for the transportation of they supplies on the range of hill which we have describe south of the city general lee be station the same railroad connect he with richmond longstreet 's corps compose he left wing and extend from marye 's hill to about the middle of the range of hill there jackson 's line begin form the right wing and extend to the termination of the range at hamilton 's cross on jackson 's right to guard the plain reach to the massaponnax stuart be post with cavalry and artillery the number of the adversary at fredericksburg can be state with accuracy upon one side but not upon the other general lee 's force may be say to have be in round number about fifty thousand of all arm it could scarcely have exceed that unless he receive heavy reënforcements after sharpsburg and the present writer have never hear or read that he receive reënforcements of any description the number fifty thousand thus seem to have be the full amount of the army that of general burnside 's force seem to have be considerably larger the federal army consist of the first second third fifth sixth ninth and eleventh corps the latter a corps of reserve and large if these have be recruit to the full number report by general mcclellan at sharpsburg and the additional troops -lrb- fifth and eleventh corps -rrb- be estimate the federal army must have exceed one hundred thousand man this estimate be bear out by federal authority general franklin say a northern writer have now with he about one-half the whole army and general meade say that franklin 's force amount to from fifty-five thousand to sixty thousand man which would seem to indicate that the whole army number from one hundred and ten thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand man a strong position be obviously essential to render it possible for the southern army of about fifty thousand man to successfully oppose the advance of this force of above one hundred thousand lee have find this position and construct earthwork for artillery with the view of receive the attack of the enemy after they cross he be unable to obstruct this cross in any material degree and he state clearly the grounds of this inability the plain of fredericksburg he say be so completely command by the stafford height that no effectual opposition could be make to the construction of bridge or the passage of the river without expose we troops to the destructive fire of the numerous battery of the enemy we position be therefore select with a view to resist the enemy 's advance after cross and the river be guard only by a force sufficient to impede he movement until the army could be concentrate the brief description we have present of the character of the ground around fredericksburg and the position of the adversary will sufficiently indicate the condition under which the battle be fight both army seem to have be in excellent spirit that of general burnside have make a successful march during which they have scarcely see a enemy and now look forward probably to certain if not easy victory general lee 's army in like manner have undergo recently no peculiar hardship in march or fight and to whatever cause the fact may be attribute be in a condition of the highest efficiency the man seem to be confident of the result of the come conflict and in they bivouac on the line of battle in the wood fringe the ridge which they occupy laugh jest cheer on the slightest provocation and instead of shrink from look forward with eagerness to the moment when general burnside would advance to attack they this buoyant and elastic spirit in the southern troops be observable on the eve of nearly every battle of the war whether it be due to the peculiar characteristic of the race or to other cause we shall not pause here to inquire but the fact be plain to the most casual observation and be never more striking than just before fredericksburg unless just precede the battle of gettysburg nothing of any importance occur from the 20th of November when general burnside 's army be concentrate on the height north of fredericksburg until the 11th of December when the federal army begin cross the rappahannock to deliver battle lee 's reason for not attempt to resist the passage of the river have be give above the plain on which it would have be necessary to draw up he army in order to do so be too much expose to the numerous artillery of the enemy on the northern bank lee resolve therefore not to oppose the cross of the federal troops but to await they assault on the commanding ground west and south of the city on the morning of December 11th before dawn the dull boom of lee 's signal-gun indicate that the enemy be move and the southern troops form line of battle to meet the come attack general burnside have make arrangement to cross the river on pontoon bridge one opposite the city and another a mile or two lower down the stream general franklin command the two corps of the left grand division succeed without trouble in lay the lower bridge as the ground do not permit lee to offer material obstruction and this large portion of the army be now ready to cross the passage of the stream at fredericksburg be more difficult although determine not to make a serious effort to prevent the enemy from cross general lee have place two regiment of barksdale 's mississippian along the bank of the river in the city to act as sharp-shooter and impede the construction of the pontoon bridge with the view doubtless of thus give time to marshal he troops the success of this device be considerable the workman busily engage in lay the federal pontoon be so much interrupt by the fire of the confederate marksman -- who direct they aim through the heavy fog by the noise make in put together the boat -- that after lose a number of man the federal commander discontinue he attempt it be renew again and again without success as before when provoke apparently by the presence of this hornet 's nest which reverse all he plan general burnside about ten o'clock open a furious fire of artillery upon the city the extent of this bombardment will be understand from the statement that one hundred and forty-seven piece of artillery be employ which fire seven thousand three hundred and fifty round of ammunition in one instance pierce a single small house with fifty round-shot a eye-witness of this scene say : the enemy have plant more than a hundred piece of artillery on the hill to the northern and eastern side of the town and from a early hour in the forenoon sweep the street with round-shot shell and case-shot firing frequently a hundred gun a minute the quick puff of smoke touch in the center with tongue of flame run incessantly along the line of they battery on the slope and as the smoke slowly drift away the bellow roar come up in one continuous roll the town be soon fire and a dense cloud of smoke envelop its roof and steeple the white church-spire still rise serenely aloft defy shot or shell though a portion of one of they be tear off the smoke be succeed by lurid flame and the crimson mass bring to mind the picture of moscow burn the same writer say : man woman and child be drive from the town and hundred of lady and child be see wander homeless and without shelter over the frozen highway in thin clothing know not where to find a place of refuge -lrb- illustration : fredericksburg -rrb- general lee watch this painful spectacle from a redoubt to the right of the telegraph road not far from he center where a shoulder jut out from the ridge and now call lee 's hill afford he a clear view of the city the destruction of the place and the suffering of the inhabitant arouse in he a deep melancholy mingled with exasperation and he comment on the scene be probably as bitter as any speech which he utter during the whole war standing wrap in he cape with only a few officer near he look fixedly at the flame rise from the city and after remain for a long time silent say in he grave deep voice : these people delight to destroy the weak and those who can make no defense it just suit they general burnside continue the bombardment for some hour the mississippian still hold the river-bank and prevent the lay of the pontoon which be again begin and again discontinue at about four in the afternoon however a force be send across in barge and by nightfall the city be evacuate by lee and general burnside proceed rapidly to lay he pontoon bridge upon which he army then begin to pass over the cross continue throughout the next day not materially obstruct by the fire of lee 's artillery as a dense fog render the aim of the cannoneer unreliable by nightfall -lrb- of the 12th -rrb- the federal army be over with the exception of general hooker 's center grand division which be hold in reserve on the north bank general burnside then proceed to form he line of battle it stretch from the western suburb of fredericksburg down the river along what be call the river road for a distance of about four mile and consist of the right grand division under general sumner at the city and the left grand division under general franklin lower down and opposite lee 's right general franklin 's grand division number accord to general meade from fifty-five to sixty thousand man the number of general sumner and hooker be not know to the present writer but be say by federal authority as we have state to have amount together to about the same at daybreak on the morning of December 13th a muffle sound issue from the dense fog cover the low ground indicate that the federal line be prepare to advance to enable the reader to understand general burnside 's plan of attack it be necessary that brief extract should be present from he order on the occasion and from he subsequent testimony before the committee on the conduct of the war despite the length of time since he arrival at fredericksburg -- a period of more than three week -- the federal commander have it appear be unable to obtain full and accurate information of the character of the ground occupy by lee and thus move very much in the dark he seem to have form he plan of attack in consequence of information from a color man he word be : the enemy have cut a road along in the rear of the line of height where we make we attack i obtain from a color man at the other side of the town information in regard to this new road which prove to be correct i want to obtain possession of that new road and that be my reason for make a attack on the extreme leave it be difficult for those familiar with the ground refer to to understand how this new road a mere country bridle-path as it be extend along in the rear of lee 's right wing could have be regard as a topographical feature of any importance the road which remain unchanged and may be see by any one to-day be insignificant in a military point of view and in attach such importance to seize it the federal commander commit a grave error what seem to have be really judicious in he plan be the turn movement determine on against lee 's right along the old richmond road run from the direction of the river past the end of the ridge occupy by the confederate and so southward to break through at this point be the only hope of success and general burnside have accordingly resolve he declare upon a rapid movement down the old richmond road with franklin 's large command unfortunately however this wise design be complicate with another most unwise to send forward _ a division _ first to seize the crest of the ridge near the point where it sink into the plain on this crest be post the veteran of jackson command in person by that skilful soldier three line of infantry support by artillery be ready to receive the federal attack and to force back this stubborn obstacle general burnside send a division the proof be find in he order to general franklin at about six o'clock on the morning of the battle : send out a division at least to seize if possible the height near captain hamilton 's which be the ground whereon jackson 's right rest a attack on the formidable position know as marye 's hill on lee 's left west of fredericksburg be also direct to be make by the same small force the order to general sumner be to form a column of _ a division _ for the purpose of push in the direction of the telegraph and plank road for the purpose of seize the height in the rear of the town or accord to another version up the plank road to its intersection with the telegraph road where they will divide with the object of seize the height on both side of those road the point of intersection here refer to be the locality of what have be call that sombre fatal terrible stone wall just under marye 's hill where the most fearful slaughter of the federal force take place marye 's hill be a strong position and its importance be well understand by lee longstreet 's infantry be in heavy line of battle behind it and the crest bristle with artillery there be still less hope here of effect any thing with a division than on the confederate right hold by jackson general burnside seem however to have regard success as probable he add in he order : hold these height with the height near captain hamilton 's will i hope compel the enemy to evacuate the whole ridge between these point in he testimony afterward he say that in the event of failure in these assault on lee 's flank he propose to make a direct attack on they front and drive they out of they work these extract from general burnside 's order and testimony clearly indicate he plan which be to assail both lee 's right and leave and in the event of failure direct a heavy blow at he center that the whole plan completely fail be mainly due it would seem to the inconsiderable number of the assault column we return now to the narrative of the battle which these comment have interrupt general lee be ready to receive the federal attack and at a early hour of the morning ride from he headquarters in rear of he center along he line of battle toward the right where he probably expect the main assault of the enemy to take place he be clothe in he plain well-worn gray uniform with feel hat cavalry-boot and short cape without sword and almost without any indication of he rank in these outward detail he differ much from general jackson and stuart who ride with he the latter as be usual with he wear a fully-decorated uniform sash black plume sabre and handsome gauntlet general jackson also on this day chance to have exchange he dingy old coat and sun-scorched cadet-cap for a new coat -lrb- 1 -rrb- cover with dazzling button and a cap brilliant with a broad band of gold lace in which -lrb- for he -rrb- extraordinary disguise he man scarcely know he -lrb- footnote 1 : this coat be a present from stuart -rrb- as lee and he companion pass along in front of the line of battle the troops cheer they it be evident that the army be in excellent spirit and ready for the hard work which the day would bring lee proceed down the old richmond or stage road -- that mention in general burnside 's order as the one over which he large flanking column be to move -- and ride on with stuart until he be near the river road run toward fredericksburg parallel to the federal line of battle here he stop and endeavor to make out through the dense fog cover the plain whether the federal force be move a stifled hum issue from the mist but nothing could be see it seem however that the enemy 's skirmisher -- probably conceal in the ditch along the river road -- have sharper eye as bullet begin to whistle around the two general and soon a number of black speck be see move forward general lee remain for some time longer in spite of the exposure converse with great calmness and gravity with stuart who be all ardor he then ride back slowly pass along he line of battle greet wherever he be see with cheer and take he position on the eminence in he center near the telegraph road the same commanding point from which he have witness the bombardment of fredericksburg the battle do not commence until ten o'clock owe to the dense fog through which the light of the sun could scarcely pierce at that hour the mist lift and roll away and the confederate post on the ridge see a heavy column of infantry advance to attack they right near the hamilton house this force be meade 's division support by gibbon 's with a third in reserve general franklin have put in action as many troops as he order -lrb- a division at least -rrb- permit general meade be arrest for some time by a minute but most annoying obstacle stuart have place a single piece of artillery under major john pelham near the point where the old richmond and river road meet -- that be directly on the flank of the advance column -- and this gun now open a rapid and determine fire upon general meade major pelham -- almost a boy in year -- continue to hold he expose position with great gallantry although the enemy open fire upon he with several battery kill a number of he gunner general lee witness this duel from the hill on which he have take he stand and be say to have exclaim it be glorious to see such courage in one so young -lrb- footnote : general lee 's opinion of major pelham appear from he report in which he style the young officer the gallant pelham and say : four battery immediately turn upon he but he sustain they heavy fire with the unflinching courage that ever distinguish he pelham fall at kelly 's ford in march 1863 -rrb- pelham continue the cannonade for about two hour only retire when he receive a peremptory order from jackson to do so and it would seem that this one gun cause a considerable delay in the attack meade advance across the plain but have not proceed far say mr swinton before he be compel to stop and silence a battery that stuart have post on the port royal road have brush away this annoying obstacle general meade with a force which he state to have amount to ten thousand man advance rapidly to attack the hill upon which the confederate await he he be suffer to approach within a few hundred yard when jackson 's artillery under colonel walker post near the end of the ridge open a sudden and furious fire which throw the federal line into temporary confusion the troops soon rally however and advance again to the attack which fall on jackson 's front line under ap hill the struggle which now ensue be fierce and bloody but a gap have be leave between the brigade of archer and lane the enemy pierce the opening turn the left of one brigade and the right of the other press on attack gregg 's brigade of hill 's reserve throw it into confusion and seem about to carry the crest gregg 's brigade be quickly rally however by its brave commander who soon afterward fall mortally wound the further progress of the enemy be check and jackson 's second line rapidly advance the enemy be meet and force back step by step until they be drive down the slope again here they be attack by the brigade of hoke and atkinson and drive beyond the railroad the confederate cheer and follow they into the plain the repulse have be complete and the slope and ground in front of it be strew with federal dead they have return as rapidly as they have charge pursue by shot and shell and general lee witness the spectacle from he hill murmur in he grave and measure voice : it be well this be so terrible we should grow too fond of it the assault on the confederate right have thus end in disaster but almost immediately another attack take place whose result be more bloody and terrible still as general meade fall back pursue by the man of jackson the sudden roar of artillery from the confederate left indicate that a heavy conflict have begin in that quarter the federal troops be charge marye 's hill which be to prove the cemetery hill of fredericksburg this frightful charge -- for no other adjective can describe it -- be make by general french 's division support by general hancock the federal troops rush forward over the broken ground in the suburb of the city and as soon as the mass become dense enough -lrb- 1 -rrb- be receive with a concentrated artillery fire from the hill in front of they this fire be so destructive that it make gap that could be see at the distance of a mile the charge division have advance in column of brigade and the front be nearly destroy the troops continue to move forward however and have nearly reach the base of the hill when the brigade of cobb and cooke post behind a stone wall run parallel with the telegraph road meet they with a sudden fire of musketry which drive they back in terrible disorder nearly half the force be kill or lay disabled on the field and upon the survivor now in full retreat be direct a concentrated artillery-fire from the hill -lrb- footnote 1 : longstreet -rrb- in face of this discharge of cannon general hancock 's force support french now gallantly advance in its turn the charge last about fifteen minute and in that time general hancock lose more than two thousand of the five thousand man of he command the repulse be still more bloody and decisive than the first the second column fall back in disorder leave the ground cover with they dead general burnside have hitherto remain at the phillip house a mile or more from the rappahannock he now mount he horse and ride down to the river dismount walk up and down in great agitation and exclaim look at marye 's hill : that crest must be carry to-night -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the authority for this incident be mr william swinton who be present -rrb- in spite of the murderous result of the first charge the federal commander determine on a third general hooker 's reserve be order to make it and although that officer protest against it general burnside be immovable and repeat he order general hooker sullenly obey and open with artillery upon the stone wall at the foot of the hill in order to make a breach in it this fire continue until nearly sunset when humphrey 's division be form for the charge the man be order to throw aside they knapsack and not to load they gun for there be no time there to load and fire say general hooker the word be give about sunset and the division charge headlong over the ground already cover with dead a few word will convey the result of four thousand man who charge seventeen hundred and sixty be leave dead or wound on the field the rest retreat pursue by the fire of the battery and infantry and night fall on the battle-field this charge be the real termination of the bloody battle of fredericksburg but on the confederate right jackson have plan and begin to execute a decisive advance on the force in he front this he design to undertake precisely at sunset and he intention be to depend on the bayonet he military judgment or instinct have satisfy he that the _ morale _ of the federal army be destroy the advance be discontinue however in consequence of the lateness of the hour and the sudden artillery-fire which salute he as he begin to move a striking feature of this intended advance be the fact that jackson have place he artillery _ in front _ of he line of battle intend to attack in that manner as darkness settle down the last gun of stuart who have defend the confederate right flank with about thirty piece of artillery be hear far in advance and apparently advance still the federal line have fall back wellnigh to the bank of the river and there seem little room to doubt that the _ morale _ of the man be seriously impaired from what i know of we want of success upon the right say general franklin when interrogate on this point and the demoralize condition of the troops upon the right and center as represent to I by they commander i confess i believe the order to recross be a very proper one general burnside refuse to give the order and nearly overwhelmed apparently by the fatal result of the attack determine to form the ninth corps in column of regiment and lead it in person against marye 's hill on the next morning such a design in a soldier of ability indicate desperation to charge marye 's hill with a corps in column of regiment be to devote the force to destruction it be nearly certain that the whole command would be tear to piece by the southern artillery but general burnside seem to have regard the possession of the hill as worth any amount of blood and in face of the urgent appeal of he officer give order for the movement at the last moment however he yield to the entreaty of general sumner and abandon he bloody design still it seem that the federal commander be unable to come to the mortifying resolution of recross the rappahannock the battle be fight on the 13th of December and until the night of the 15th general burnside continue to face lee on the south bank of the river -- he band play he flag fly and nothing indicate a intention of retire to that resolve he have however come and on the night of the 15th in the midst of storm and darkness the federal army recross to the north bank of the rappahannock xi final movement of 1862 the battle of fredericksburg be another defeat of the federal program of invasion as decisive and in one sense as disastrous as the second battle of manassa general burnside have not lose as many man as general pope and have not retreat in confusion pursue by a victorious enemy but brief as the conflict have be -- two or three hour sum up all the real fighting -- its desperate character and the evident hopelessness of any attempt to storm lee 's position profoundly discourage and demoralize the northern troops we have quote the statement of general franklin command the whole left wing that from the demoralize condition of the troops upon the right and center as represent to he by they commander he believe the order to recross be a very proper one nor be there any ground to suppose that the feeling of the left wing be greatly better that wing of the army have not suffer as heavily as the right which have recoil with such frightful slaughter from marye 's hill but the repulse of general meade in they own front have be equally decisive and the non-success of the right must have react on the left discourage that also northern writer in a position to ascertain the condition of the troops fully bear out this view : that the _ morale _ of the army of the potomac become seriously impaired after the disaster at fredericksburg say mr swinton the able and candid historian of the campaign be only too manifest indeed it would be impossible to imagine a graver or gloomier a more sombre or unmusical body of man than the army of the potomac a month after the battle and as the day go by despondency discontent and all evil inspiration with they natural consequent desertion seem to increase rather than to diminish until for the first time the army of the potomac could be say to be really demoralize general sumner notice that a spirit of croak have become diffused throughout the force for a army to display that tendency clearly indicate that the troops have lose the most important element of victory -- confidence in themselves and they leader and for this sentiment there be valid reason column wholly inadequate in number have be advance against the formidable confederate position position so strong and well defend that it be doubtful if thrice the force could have make any impression upon they and the result be such as might have be expect the man lose confidence in the military capacity of they commander and in they own power after the double repulse at marye 's hill and in front of jackson the troops look at the ground strew with dead and wound be in no condition to go forward hopefully to another struggle which promise to be equally bloody the southern army be naturally in a condition strongly in contrast with that of they adversary they have repulse the determine assault of the federal column with comparative ease on both flank jackson 's first line although pierced and drive back soon rally and check the enemy until the second line come up when general meade be drive back the third line not have move from its position along the road near the hamilton house on the left longstreet have repulse the federal charge with he artillery and two small brigade the loss of the confederate in both these encounter be much less than that of they adversary -lrb- 1 -rrb- a natural result of the circumstance and thus instead of share the depression of they opponent the southern troops be elate and look forward to a renewal of the battle with confidence in themselves and in they leader -lrb- footnote 1 : we loss during the operation since the movement of the enemy begin amount to about eighteen hundred kill and wound -- _ lee 's report _ federal authority state the northern loss at a little over twelve thousand the larger part no doubt in the attack on marye 's hill -rrb- it be not necessary to offer much comment upon the manner in which general burnside have attack he be say by he critic not to have at the time design the turn movement against general lee 's right upon which point the present writer be unable to decide that movement would seem to have present the sole and only chance of success for the federal arm as the successful advance of general franklin 's fifty-five or sixty thousand man up the old richmond road would have compel lee to retire he whole right wing to protect it from a assault in flank and reverse what disposition he would have make under these circumstance must be leave to conjecture but it be certain that the blow would have prove a serious one call for the display of all he military ability in the event however that this be the main great aim of general burnside he method of carry out he design insure it would seem its failure ten thousand man only be to clear the way for the flanking movement in order to effect which object it be necessary to crush jackson so that it may be say that the success of the plan involve the repulse of one-half lee 's army with ten thousand man the assault on marye 's hill be a equally fatal military mistake that the position could not be storm be prove by the result of the actual attempt it be doubtful if in any battle ever fight by any troops man display greater gallantry they rush headlong not only once but thrice into the focus of a frightful front and cross fire of artillery and small-arm lose nearly half they number in a few minute the ground be litter with they dead and yet the foremost have only be able to approach within sixty yard of the terrible stone wall in advance of the hill there they fall throw up they hand to indicate that they see at last that the attempt to carry the hill be hopeless these comment seem justify by the circumstance and be make with no intention of cast obloquy upon the commander who display little ability give evidence of unfaltering courage he have urge he inability to handle so large a army but the authority have force the command upon he he have accept it and do he best and like a brave soldier determine to lead the final charge in person die if necessary at the head of he man general lee have not escape criticism any more than general burnside the southern people be naturally dissatisfy with the result -- the safe retreat of the federal army -- and ask why they have not be attack and capture or destroy the london _ time _ at that period and a military critic recently in the same journal declare that lee have it in he power to crush general burnside horse foot and dragoon and from he failure to do so argue he want of great generalship a full discussion of the question be leave by the present writer to those better skilled than himself in military science it be proper however to insert here general lee 's own explanation of he action : the attack on the 13th he say have be so easily repulse and by so small a part of we army that it be not suppose the enemy would limit he effort to one attempt which in view of the magnitude of he preparation and the extent of he force seem to be comparatively insignificant believe therefore that he would attack we it be not deem expedient to lose the advantage of we position and expose the troops to the fire of he inaccessible battery beyond the river by advance against he but we be necessarily ignorant of the extent to which he have suffer and only become aware of it when on the morning of the 16th it be discover that he have avail himself of the darkness of night and the prevalence of a violent storm of wind and rain to recross the river this statement be no doubt frame by general lee to meet the criticism which the result of the battle occasion in converse with general stuart on the subject he add that he feel too great responsibility for the preservation of he troops to unnecessarily hazard they no one know he say how _ brittle _ a army be the word may appear strange apply to the army of northern virginium which have certainly vindicate its claim under many arduous trial to the virtue of toughness and endurance but lee 's meaning be plain and he view seem to have be found on good sense the enemy have in all probably two hundred piece of artillery a large portion of which be post on the high ground north of the river have lee descend from he ridge and advance into the plain to attack this large number of gun would have greet he with a rapid and destructive fire which must have inflict upon he a loss as nearly heavy as he have inflict upon general burnside at marye 's hill from such a result he naturally shrink it have be see that the federal troops brave as they be have be demoralize by such a fire and lee be unwilling to expose he own troops to similar slaughter there be little question it seem that a advance of the description mention would have result in a conclusive victory and the probable surrender of the whole or a large portion of the federal army whether the probability of such a result be sufficient to compensate for the certain slaughter the reader will decide for himself general lee do not think so and do not order the advance he prefer await in he strong position the second assault which general burnside would probably make and while he thus wait the enemy secretly recross the river render a attack upon they by lee impossible general burnside make a second movement to cross the rappahannock -- this time at bank 's ford above fredericksburg -- in the inclement month of January but as he might have anticipate the condition of the road be such that it be impossible to advance he artillery with the horse drag the piece sink into the almost bottomless mud where they stick fast -- even the foot-soldier find it difficult to march through the quagmire -- and the whole movement be speedily abandon when general burnside issue the order for this injudicious advance two of he general officer meet and one ask : what do you think of it it do not seem to have the _ ring _ be the reply no -- the bell be break the other add this incident which be give on the authority of a northern writer probably convey a correct idea of the feeling of both the officer and man of general burnside 's army the disastrous day of fredericksburg have seriously injure the troops the army of the potomac the writer add be sadly fracture and its tone have no longer the clear inspiring ring of victory xii the year of battle the stormy year 1862 have terminate thus in a great confederate success in its arduous campaign follow each other in rapid succession general lee have direct the movement of the main great army and the result of the year 's fighting be to gain he that high military reputation which he subsequent movement only consolidated and increase a rapid glance at the event of the year in they general outline will indicate the merit due the southern commander the federal plan of invasion in the spring have be extremely formidable virginium be to be pierce by no less than four army -- from the northwest the shenandoah valley the potomac and the peninsula -- the whole force to converge upon richmond the heart of the rebellion of these the army of general mcclellan be the largest and most threatening it advance with little opposition until it reach the chickahominy cross and lay in sight of richmond the great force of one hundred and fifty thousand man be about to make the decisive assault when lee attack it and the battle which ensue drive the federal army to a point thirty mile from the city with such loss as to render hopeless any further attempt to assail the capital such be the first act of the drama the rest speedily follow a new army be raise promptly by the federal authority and a formidable advance be make against richmond again this time from the direction of alexandrium lee be watch general mcclellan when intelligence of the new movement reach he remain with a portion of he troops near richmond he send jackson to the rapidan the battle of cedar mountain result in the repulse of general pope 's vanguard and discover at last that the real danger lay in the direction of culpepper lee move thither drive back general pope flank he and in the severe battle of manassa route he army which be force to retire upon washington two army have thus be drive from the soil of virginium and the confederate commander have move into maryland in order to draw the enemy thither and if practicable transfer the war to the heart of pennsylvanium unforeseen circumstance have defeat the latter of these object the concentration on sharpsburg be render necessary a obstinately-fought battle ensue there and not defeat but force to abandon further movement toward pennsylvanium lee have retire into virginium where he remain face he adversary this be the first failure of lee up to that point in the campaign of the year and a attentive consideration of the circumstance will show that the result be not fairly attributable to any error which he have commit event beyond he control have shape he action and direct all he movement and it will remain a question whether the extrication of he small force from its difficult position do not better prove lee 's generalship than the victory at manassa the subsequent operation of the oppose army indicate clearly that the southern force be still in excellent fighting condition and the movement of lee during the advance of general mcclellan toward warrenton be highly honorable to he military ability with a force much smaller than that of he adversary he greatly embarrassed and impede the federal advance confront they on the upper rappahannock completely check they forward movement in that direction and when they move rapidly to fredericksburg cross the rapidan promptly reappear in they front on the range of hill opposite that city the battle which follow compensate for the failure of the maryland campaign and the draw battle of sharpsburg general burnside have attack and sustain decisive defeat the stormy year so fill with great event and arduous encounter have thus wind up with a pitched battle in which the enemy suffer a bloody repulse and the best commentary on the decisive character of this last struggle of the year be the fault find with general lee for not destroy he adversary in less than six month lee have thus fight four great pitched battle -- all victory to he arm with the exception of sharpsburg which be neither a victory nor a defeat the result be thus highly encourage to the south and have the army of northern virginium have its rank fill up as the rank of the northern army be the event of the year 1862 would have lay the foundation of assure success a inquiry into the cause of failure in this particular be not necessary to the subject of the volume before the reader it be only necessary to state the fact that the army of northern virginia defend what all concede to be the territory on which the decisive struggle must take place be never sufficiently numerous to follow up the victory achieve by it at the battle of the chickahominy the army number at most about seventy-five thousand at the second manassa about fifty thousand at sharpsburg less than forty thousand and at fredericksburg about fifty thousand in the following year it will be see that these latter number be at first but little exceed and as the month pass on that they dwindle more and more until in April 1865 the whole force in line of battle at petersburg be scarcely more than thirty thousand man such have be the number of the troops under command of lee in 1862 the reader have be inform of the number of the federal force oppose to he this be one hundred and fifty thousand on the chickahominy of whom one hundred and fifteen thousand be effective about one hundred thousand it would seem under general pope at the second battle of manassa eighty-seven thousand actually engage at the battle of sharpsburg and at fredericksburg from one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty thousand these number be state on the authority of federal officer or historian and lee 's force on the authority of he own report or of gentleman of high character in a situation to speak with accuracy of the truth of the statement the writer of these page can have no doubt and if the fight power of the northern and southern troops be estimate as equal the fair conclusion must be arrive at that lee surpass he adversary in generalship the result at least of the year 's fighting have be extremely encourage to the south and after the battle of fredericksburg no attempt be make to prosecute hostility during the remainder of the year the scheme of cross above fredericksburg prove a _ fiasco _ beginning and end in a day thereafter all movement cease and the two army await the return of spring for further operation xiii lee in December 1862 before pass to the great campaign of the spring and summer of 1863 we propose to say a few word of general lee in he private and personal character and to attempt to indicate the position which he occupy at this time in the eye of the army and the country unknown save by reputation when he assume command of the force in June 1862 he have now by the winter of the same year become one of the best-known personage in the south neither the troops nor the people have perhaps penetrate the full character of lee and they seem to have attribute to he more reserve and less warmth and impulse than he possess but it be impossible for a human be occupy so prominent a station before the general eye to hide in any material degree he main great characteristic and these have conciliate for lee a exalted and wellnigh universal public regard he be feel by all to be a individual of great dignity sincerity and earnestness in the performance of duty destitute plainly of that vulgar ambition which seek personal aggrandizement rather than the general good and dedicate as plainly heart and soul to the cause for which he fight he have win even from those who have denounce he for the suppose hesitation in he course in April 1861 and have afterward criticise he military operation the repute of a truly great man as well as of a commander of the first ability it be feel by all class that the dignity of the southern cause be adequately represent in the person and character of the commander of she most important army while other as brave and patriotic no doubt but of different temperament have permit themselves to become violent and embittered in they private and public utterance in reference to the north lee have remain calm moderate and dignified under every provocation he report be without rhodomontade or exaggeration and he tone uniformly modest compose and uninflate after he most decisive success he pulse have remain calm he have write of those success with the air of one who see no especial merit in any thing which he have perform and so marked be this tone of moderation and dignity that in read he official report to-day it seem wellnigh impossible that they could have be write in the hot atmosphere of a war which arouse the bitterest passion of the human soul upon this point of lee 's personal and official dignity it be unnecessary to dwell further as the quality have long since be concede by every one acquaint with the character of the individual in the old world and the new it be the trait perhaps the most prominent to the observer look back now upon the individual and it be doubtless this August moderation dignity and apparent exemption from natural infirmity which produce the impression upon many person that lee be cold and unimpressible we shall speak in future at greater length of he real character than be necessary in this place but it may here be say that the fancy that he be cold and unimpressible be a very great error no man have stronger or warmer feeling or regard the invasion of the south with greater indignation than himself the sole difference be that he have he feeling under greater control and permit no temptation to overcome he sense of that August dignity and composure become in the chief leader of a great people struggle for independent government the sentiment of the southern people toward lee may be sum up in the statement that they regard he in he personal and private character with a admiration which be become unbounded and repose in he as commander of the army the most implicit confidence these expression be strong but they do not convey more than the truth and this confidence be never withdraw from he it remain as strong in he hour of disaster as in he noontide of success a few soured or desponding people might lose heart indulge in croak and denounce under they breath the commander of the army as responsible for failure when it occur but these faintheart people be in a small minority and have little encouragement in they muttered criticism the southern people from virginium to the utmost limit of the gulf state resolutely persist in regard lee as one of the greatest soldier of history and retain they confidence in he unimpaired to the end the army have set the example of this implicit reliance upon lee as the chief leader and military head of the confederacy the brave fighting-man have not take he reputation on trust but have see he win it fairly on some of the hardest-contested field of history the heavy blow at general mcclellan on the chickahominy have first show the troops that they be under command of a thorough soldier the rout of pope at manassa have follow in the ensue month at sharpsburg with less than forty thousand man lee have repulse the attack of nearly ninety thousand and at fredericksburg general burnside 's great force have be drive back with inconsiderable loss to the southern army these success in the eye of the troops be the proof of true leadership and it do not detract from lee 's popularity that on all occasion he have carefully refrain from unnecessary exposure of the troops especially at fredericksburg where a ambitious commander would have spare no amount of bloodshed to complete he glory by a great victory such be lee 's repute as army commander in the eye of man accustom to close scrutiny of they leader he be regard as a thorough soldier at once brave wise cool resolute and devoted heart and soul to the cause personally the commander-in-chief be also by this time extremely popular he do not mingle with the troops to any great extent nor often relax the air of dignity somewhat tinged with reserve which be natural with he this reserve however never amount to stiffness or official coolness on the contrary lee be markedly free from the chill demeanor of the martinet and have become greatly endear to the man by the unmistakable evidence which he have give they of he honesty sincerity and kindly feel for they it can not indeed be say that he sustain the same relation toward the troops as general jackson for the latter illustrious soldier the man have a species of familiar affection the result in a great degree of the informal and often eccentric demeanor of the individual there be little or nothing in jackson to indicate that he be a officer hold important command he be without reserve and exhibit none of that formal courtesy which characterize lee he manners on the contrary be quite informal familiar and conciliate in return a familiar regard we repeat the word _ familiar _ as convey precisely the idea intend to be express it indicate the difference between these two great soldier in they outward appearance lee retain about he upon all occasion more or less of the commander-in-chief pass before the troops on a excellent and well-groomed horse he figure erect and graceful in the saddle for he be one of the best rider in the army he demeanor grave and thoughtful he whole bearing that of a man intrust with great responsibility and the general care of the whole army jackson 's personal appearance and air be very different he dress be generally dingy : a fade cadet-cap tilted over he eye cause he to raise he chin into the air he stirrup be apt to be too short and he knee be thus elevated ungracefully and he would amble along on he rawboned horse with a singularly absent-minded expression of countenance raise from time to time he right hand and slapping he knee this brief outline of the two commander will serve to show the difference between they personally and it must be add that jackson 's eccentric bearing be the source in some degree of he popularity the man admire he immensely for he great military ability and he odd way procure for he that familiar liking to which we have allude it be not intend however in these observation to convey the idea that general lee be regard as a stiff and unapproachable personage of whom the private soldier stand in awe such a statement would not express the truth lee be perfectly approachable and no instance be upon record or ever come to the knowledge of the present writer in which he repel the approach of he man or receive the humblest of they with any thing but kindness he be naturally simple and kind with great gentleness and patience and it will not be credible to any who know the man that he ever make any difference in he treatment of those who approach he from a consideration of they rank in the army he theory express upon many occasion be that the private soldier -- man who fight without the stimulus of rank emolument or individual renown -- be the most meritorious class of the army and that they deserve and should receive the utmost respect and consideration this statement however be doubtless unnecessary man of lee 's pride and dignity never make a difference in they treatment of man because one be humble and the other of high rank of such human being it may be say that _ noblesse oblige _ the man of the army have thus find they commander all that they could wish and he increase personal popularity be show by the greater frequency with which they now speak of he as marse robert old uncle robert and by other familiar title this tendency in troops be always a indication of personal regard these nickname have be already shower upon jackson and general lee be have he turn the troops regard he now more as they fellow-soldier than formerly have find that he dignity be not coldness and that he would under no temptation indulge he personal convenience or fare better than themselves it be say -- we know not with what truth -- that the habit of northern general in the war be to look assiduously to they individual comfort in select they quarter and to take pleasure in surround themselves with glitter staff-officer body-guard and other indication of they rank and the consideration which they expect in these particulars lee differ extremely from he opponent and there be no evidence whatever at he headquarters that he be the commander-in-chief or even a officer of high rank he uniformly live in a tent in spite of the urgent invitation of citizen to use they house for he headquarters and this refusal be the result both of a indisposition to expose these gentleman to annoyance from the enemy when he himself retire and of a rooted objection to fare better than he troops they have tent only often indeed be without even that much covering and it be repugnant to lee 's feeling to sleep under a good roof when the troops be so much expose he headquarters tent at this time -lrb- December 1862 -rrb- as before and afterward be what be call a house-tent not differ in any particular from those use by the private soldier of the army in winter-quarter it be pitch in a opening in the wood near the narrow road lead to hamilton 's cross with the tent of the officer of the staff group near and with the exception of a orderly who always wait to summon courier to carry dispatch there be nothing in the shape of a body-guard visible or any indication that the unpretending group of tent be the army headquarters within no article of luxury be to be see a few plain and indispensable object be all which the tent contain the covering of the commander-in-chief be a ordinary army blanket and he fare be plainer perhaps than that of the majority of he officer and man this be the result of a utter indifference in lee to personal convenience or indulgence citizen frequently send he delicacy box fill with turkey ham wine cordial and other thing peculiarly tempting to one lead the hard life of the soldier but these be almost uniformly send to the sick in some neighboring hospital lee 's principle in so act seem to have be to set the good example to he officer of not fare better than they man but he be undoubtedly indifferent naturally to luxury of all description in he habit and feeling he be not the self-indulgent man of peace but the thorough soldier willing to live hard to sleep upon the ground and to disregard all sensual indulgence in he other habit he be equally abstinent he care nothing for wine whiskey or any stimulant and never use tobacco in any form he rarely relax he energy in any thing calculate to amuse he but when not ride along he line or among the camp to see in person that the troops be properly care for generally pass he time in close attention to official duty connect with the well-being of the army or in correspondence with the authority at richmond when he relax from this continuous toil it be to indulge in some quiet and simple diversion social converse with lady in house at which he chance to stop caress bestow upon child with whom he be a great favorite and frequently in informal conversation with he officer at hayfield and moss neck two hospitable house below fredericksburg he at this time often stop and spend some time in the society of the lady and child there one of the latter a little curly-headed girl would come up to he always to receive she accustomed kiss and one day confide to he as a personal friend she desire to kiss general jackson who blush like a girl when lee with a quiet laugh tell he of the child 's wish on another occasion when he small friend come to receive he caress he say laughing that she would show more taste in select a younger gentleman than himself and point to a youthful officer in a corner of the room add there be the handsome major pelham which cause that modest young soldier to blush with confusion the bearing of general lee in these hour of relaxation be quite charming and make he warm friend he own pleasure and gratification be plain and gratified other who in the simple and kindly gentleman in the plain gray uniform find it difficult to recognize the commander-in-chief of the southern army these moment of relaxation be however only occasional all the rest be toil and the routine of hard work and grave assiduity go on month after month and year after year with little interruption with the exception which we have note all pleasure and distraction seem of little interest to lee and to the present writer at least he seem on all occasion to bear the most striking resemblance to the traditional idea of washington high principle and devotion to duty be plainly this human being 's spring of action and he go through the hard and continuous labor incident to army command with a grave and systematic attention wholly indifferent it seem to almost every species of diversion and relaxation this attempt to show how lee appear at that time to he solder have extend to undue length and we shall be compel to defer a full notice of the most interesting and beautiful trait of he character this be he humble and profound piety the world have by no mean do he justice upon this subject no one doubt during the war that general lee be a sincere christian in conviction and he exemplary moral character and life be beyond criticism beyond this it be doubtful if any save he intimate associate understand the depth of he feeling on the greatest of all subject jackson 's strong religious fervor be know and often allude to but it be doubtful if lee be regard as a person of equally fervent conviction and feeling and yet the fact be certain that faith in god 's providence and reliance upon the almighty be the foundation of all he action and the secret of he supreme composure under all trial he be naturally of such reserve that it be not singular that the extent of this sentiment be not understand even then however good man who frequently visit he and converse with he upon religious subject come away with they heart burn within they when the rev j william jone with another clergyman go in 1863 to consult he in reference to the better observance of the sabbath in the army he eye brighten and he whole countenance glow with pleasure and as in he simple feeling word he express he delight we forget the great warrior and only remember that we be commune with a humble earnest christian when he be inform that the chaplain pray for he tear start to he eye and he reply : i sincerely thank you for that and i can only say that i be a poor sinner trust in christ alone and that i need all the prayer you can offer for I on the day after this interview he issue a earnest general order enjoin the observance of the sabbath by officer and man urge they to attend public worship in they camp and forbid the performance on Sunday of all official duty save those necessary to the subsistence or safety of the army he always attend public worship if it be in he power to do so and often the earnestness of the preacher would make he eye kindle and he face glow he frequently attend the meeting of he chaplain take a warm interest in the proceedings and uniformly exhibit declare one who could speak from personal knowledge a ardent desire for the promotion of religion in the army he do not fail on many occasion to show he man that he be a sincere christian when general meade come over to mine run and the southern army march to meet he lee be ride along he line of battle in the wood when he come upon a party of soldier hold a prayer-meeting on the eve of battle such a spectacle be not unusual in the army then and afterward -- the rough fighter be often man of profound piety -- and on this occasion the sight before he seem to have excite deep emotion in lee he stop dismount -- the staff-officer accompany he do the same -- and lee uncover he head and stand in a attitude of profound respect and attention while the earnest prayer proceed in the midst of the thunder of artillery and the explosion of the enemy 's shell -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : these detail be give on the authority of the rev j william jone of lexington va -rrb- -lrb- illustration : lee at the soldier ' prayer meeting -rrb- other incident indicate the simple and earnest piety of lee will be present in the course of this narrative the fame of the soldier have in some degree throw into the background the less-imposing trait of personal piety in the individual no delineation of lee however would be complete without a full statement of he religious principle and feeling as the commander-in-chief of the army of northern virginium he win that August renown which encircle he name with a halo of military glory both in america and europe he battle and victory be know to all man it be not know to all that the illustrious soldier whose fortune it be to overthrow one after another the best soldier of the federal army be a simple humble and devoted christian whose eye fill with tear when he be inform that he chaplain pray for he and who say i be a poor sinner trust in christ alone and need all the prayer you can offer for I part vi chancellorsville and gettysburg i advance of general hooker lee remain throughout the winter at he headquarters in the wood south of fredericksburg watch the northern army which continue to occupy the country north of the city with the potomac river as they base of supplies with the come of spring it be obviously the intention of the federal authority to again essay the cross of the rappahannock at some point either above or below fredericksburg and as the movement above be less difficult and promise more decisive result it be see by general lee that this would probably be the quarter from which he might expect a attack general stuart a soldier of sound judgment say during the winter the next battle will take place at chancellorsville and the position of lee 's troops seem to indicate that this be also he own opinion he right remain still opposite fredericksburg bar the direct approach to richmond but he left extend up the rappahannock beyond chancellorsville and all the ford be vigilantly guard to prevent a sudden flank movement by the enemy in that direction as will be see the anticipation of lee be to be fully realize the heavy blow aim at he in the first day of spring be to come from the quarter in which he have expect it the federal army be now under command of general joseph hooker a officer of dash energy excellent administrative capacity and northern writer add extremely prone to self-assertion general hooker have harshly criticise the military operation both of general mcclellan on the chickahominy and of general burnside at fredericksburg and so strong a impression have these stricture make upon the mind of the authority that they come to the determination of intrust the command of the army to the officer who make they doubtless conclude that he own success would prove greater than that of he predecessor this opinion seem bear out by the first proceedings of general hooker he set to work energetically to reorganize and increase the efficiency of the army do away with general burnside 's defective grand division arrangement consolidate the cavalry into a effective corps enforce strict discipline among officer and man alike and at the beginning of spring have bring he army to a high state of efficiency he confident tone inspire the man the depression result from the great disaster at fredericksburg be succeed by a spirit of buoyant hope and the army be once more that great war-engine ready for any undertaking which it have be under mcclellan it number accord to one federal statement one hundred and fifty-nine thousand three hundred man but accord to another which appear more reliable one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and artillery and twelve thousand cavalry in all one hundred and thirty-two thousand troops the army of general lee be considerably smaller two division of longstreet 's corps have be send to suffolk south of jame river to obtain supplies in that region and this force be not present at the battle of chancellorsville the actual number under lee 's command will appear from the follow statement of colonel walter h taylor assistant adjutant-general of the army : we strength at chancellorsville : anderson and mclaw 13000 jackson -lrb- hill rode and trimble -rrb- 21000 early -lrb- fredericksburg -rrb- 6000 _______ 40000 cavalry and artillery 7000 _______ total of all arm 47000 as the federal infantry number one hundred and twenty thousand accord to the smallest estimate of federal authority and lee 's infantry forty thousand the northern force be precisely three time as large as the southern -lrb- illustration : map -- battle of chancellorsville -rrb- general hooker have already prove himself a excellent administrative officer and he plan of campaign against lee seem to show that he also possess generalship of a high order he have determine to pass the rappahannock above fredericksburg turn lee 's flank and thus force he to deliver battle under this disadvantage or retire upon richmond the safe passage of the stream be the first great object and general hooker 's disposition to effect this be highly judicious a force of about twenty thousand man be to pass the rappahannock at fredericksburg and thus produce upon lee the impression that the federal army be about to renew the attempt in which they have fail under general burnside while general lee 's attention be engage by the force thus threaten he right the main body of the northern army be to cross the rappahannock and rapidan above chancellorsville and sweep down rapidly upon the confederate left flank take up a strong position between chancellorsville and fredericksburg the column which have cross at the latter point to engage the attention of the confederate commander be then to recross to the northern bank move rapidly to the upper ford which the advance of the main body would by that time have uncover and a second time cross to the southern bank unite with the rest thus the whole federal army would be concentrate on the southern bank of the rappahannock and general lee would be compel to leave he camp on the hill of the massaponnax and fight upon ground dictate by he adversary if he do not thus accept battle but one other course be leave he must fall back in the direction of richmond to prevent he adversary from attack he rear and capture or destroy he army in order to insure the success of this promising plan of attack a strong column of well-mounted cavalry be to cross in advance of the army and strike for the railroad in lee 's rear connect he with richmond and the southwest thus flank or cut off and with all he communication destroy it seem probable that general lee would suffer decisive defeat and that the federal army would march in triumph to the capture of the confederate capital this plan be certainly excellent and seem sure to succeed it be however open to some criticism as the event show general hooker be detach in the beginning of the movement he whole cavalry force for a distant operation and divide he army by the _ ruse _ at fredericksburg in face of a adversary not likely to permit that great error to escape he while advance thus apparently to the certain destruction of lee general hooker be leave a vulnerable point in he own armor lee would probably discover that point and aim to pierce he opponent there at most general hooker be wrap in huge fold the sword of lee not remember that there be danger to the _ cordon _ as well as to the weapon such be the plan which general hooker have devise to bring back that success of the federal arm in the spring of 1863 which have attend they in the early spring of 1862 at this latter period a heavy cloud rest upon the confederate cause donaldson and roanoke island fort macon and the city of new orlean have then fall at elkhorn kernstown newbern and other place the federal force have achieve important success these have be follow however by the southern victory on the chickahominy at manassa and at fredericksburg near this last-named spot now where the year have wind up with so mortify a federal failure general hooker hope to reverse event and recover the federal glory of the precede spring operation begin as early as the middle of march when general averill with about three thousand cavalry cross the rappahannock at kelly 's ford above its junction with the rapidan and make a determine attack upon nearly eight hundred horseman there under general fitz lee with the view of pass through culpepper cross the rapidan and cut lee 's communication in the direction of gordonsville the obstinate stand of general fitz lee 's small force however defeat this object and general averill be force to retreat beyond the rappahannock again with considerable loss and abandon he expedition in this engagement fall major john pelham who have be style in lee 's first report of the battle of fredericksburg the gallant pelham and whose brave stand on the port royal road have draw from lee the exclamation it be glorious to see such courage in one so young pelham be in spite of he youth a artillerist of the first order of excellence and he loss be a serious one in spite of he inferior rank after this action every thing remain quiet until toward the end of April -- general lee continue to hold the same position with he right at fredericksburg he left at the ford near chancellorsville and he cavalry under stuart guard the bank of the rappahannock in culpepper on the 27th of April general hooker begin he forward movement by advance three corps of he army -- the fifth eleventh and twelfth -- to the bank of the river near kelly 's ford and on the next day this force be join by three additional corps -- the first third and sixth -- and the whole on Wednesday -lrb- the 29th -rrb- cross the river without difficulty that this movement be a surprise to lee as have be suppose by some person be a mistake stuart be a extremely vigilant picket-officer and both he and general lee be in the habit of send accomplished scout to watch any movement in the federal camp as soon as these movement -- which in a large army can not be conceal -- take place information be always promptly bring and it be not possible that general hooker could move three large army corps toward the rappahannock as he do on April 27th without early knowledge on the part of he adversary of so important a circumstance as the federal infantry thus advance the large cavalry force begin also to move through culpepper toward the central railroad in lee 's rear this column be command by general stoneman formerly a subordinate officer in lee 's old cavalry regiment in the united state army and as general stoneman 's operation be entirely separate from those of the infantry and not of much importance we shall here dismiss they in a few word he proceed rapidly across culpepper harass in he march by a small body of horse under general william hf lee reach the central railroad at trevillian 's below gordonsville and tear up a portion of it pass on to jame river ravage the country and attempt the destruction of the columbium aqueduct but do not succeed in so do when hear probably of the unforeseen result at chancellorsville he hasten back to the rapidan pursue and harass as in he advance and cross regain the federal line beyond the rappahannock to return to the movement of the main federal force under the personal command of general hooker this advanced rapidly across the angle between the two river with no obstruction but that offer by the cavalry under stuart and on Thursday April 30th have cross the rapidan at germanna and ely 's ford and be steadily concentrate around chancellorsville at the same time the second corps under general couch be prepare to cross at united state ford a few mile distant and general sedgwick command the detach force at fredericksburg have cross and threaten lee in obedience to order now begin pass back to the northern bank again in order to march up and join the main body thus all thing seem in train to succeed on the side of the federal army general hooker be over with about one hundred thousand man -- twenty thousand additional troops would soon join he lee 's army seem scatter and not in hand to oppose he and there be some ground for the ebullition of joy attribute to general hooker as he see he great force mass steadily in the vicinity of chancellorsville to those around he he exclaim : the rebel army be now the legitimate property of the army of the potomac they may as well pack up they haversack and make for richmond and i shall be after they in a congratulatory order to he troops he declare that they occupy now a position so strong that the enemy must either ingloriously fly or come out from behind he defence and give we battle on we own ground where certain destruction await he such be the joyful anticipation of general hooker who seem to have regard the campaign as virtually end by the successful passage of the river he expression and he general order would seem to indicate a irrepressible joy but it be doubtful if the skilful soldier under he share this somewhat juvenile enthusiasm the gray cavalier at fredericksburg be not report to be retire as be expect on the contrary the southern troops seem to be move forward with the design of accept battle lee have determine promptly upon that course as soon as stuart send he information of the enemy 's movement chancellorsville be at once see to be the point for which general hooker be aim and lee 's disposition be make for confront he there and fight a pitched battle the brigade of posey and mahone of anderson 's division have be in front of bank 's and ely 's ford and this force of about eight thousand man be promptly order to fall back on chancellorsville at the same time wright 's brigade be send up to reënforce this column but the enemy continue to advance in great force general anderson command the whole fall back from chancellorsville to tabernacle church on the road to fredericksburg where he be join on the next day by jackson whom lee have send forward to he assistance the _ ruse _ at fredericksburg have not long deceive the confederate commander general sedgwick with three corps in all about twenty-two thousand man have cross just below fredericksburg on the 29th and lee have promptly direct general jackson to oppose he there line of battle be accordingly form in the enemy 's front beyond hamilton 's cross but as neither on that day nor the next any further advance be make by general sedgwick the whole movement be see to be a feint to cover the real operation above lee accordingly turn he attention in the direction of chancellorsville jackson as we have relate be send up to reënforce general anderson and lee follow with the rest of the army with the exception of about six thousand man under general early whom he leave to defend the cross at fredericksburg such be the position of the opposing force on the 1st day of may each commander have display excellent generalship in the preliminary movement precede the actual fighting at last however the oppose line be face each other and the real struggle be about to begin ii the wilderness the wilderness as the region around chancellorsville be call be so strange a country and the character of the ground have so important a bearing upon the result of the great battle fight there that a brief description of the locality will be here present the region be a nearly unbroken expanse of dense thicket pierce only by narrow and wind road over which the traveller ride mile after mile without see a single human habitation it would seem indeed that the whole barren and melancholy tract have be give up to the owl the whippoorwill and the moccasin its original tenant the plaintive cry of the night-bird alone break the gloomy silence of the desolate region and the shadowy thicket stretch in every direction produce a depressing effect upon the feeling chancellorsville be in the center of this singular territory on the main road or rather road run from orange court-house to fredericksburg from which latter place it be distant about ten mile in spite of its impose name chancellorsville be simply a large country-house originally inhabit by a private family but afterward use as a roadside inn a little to the westward the old turnpike and orange plank-road unite as they approach the spot where they again divide to unite a second time a few mile to the east where they form the main highway to fredericksburg from the north come in road from united state and ely 's ford germanna ford be northwest from the south run the brock road in the direction of the rapidan pass a mile or two west of the place the whole country the road the chance house the silence the unending thicket in this dreary wilderness produce a sombre effect a writer familiar with it say : there all be wild desolate and lugubrious thicket undergrowth and jungle stretch for mile impenetrable and untouched narrow road wind on forever between melancholy mass of stunt and gnarl oak little sunlight shine there the face of nature be dreary and sad it be so before the battle it be not more cheerful to-day when as you ride along you see fragment of shell rot knapsack rusty gun-barrel bleached bone and grin skull into this jungle continue the same writer general hooker penetrate it be the wolf in he den ready to tear any one who approach a battle there seem impossible neither side could see its antagonist artillery could not move cavalry could not operate the very infantry have to flatten they body to glide between the stunt tree that a army of one hundred and twenty thousand man should have choose that spot to fight forty thousand and not only choose it but make it a hundred time more impenetrable by fell tree erect breastwork dispose artillery _ en masse _ to sweep every road and bridle-path which lead to chancellorsville -- this fact seem incredible it be no part of the original plan of the federal commander to permit himself to be coop up in this difficult and embarrassing region where it be impossible to maneuver he large army the selection of the wilderness around chancellorsville as the ground of battle be dictate by lee general hooker it seem endeavor to avoid be thus shut up in the thicket and hamper in he movement find that the confederate force retire from in front of ely 's and united state ford have on reach chancellorsville continue to fall back in the direction of fredericksburg he follow they steadily pass through the wilderness and emerge into the open country beyond rapidly begin form line of battle on ground highly favorable to the manoeuvring of he large force in action a glance at the map will indicate the importance of this movement and the great advantage secure by it the left of general hooker 's line nearest the river be at least five mile in advance of chancellorsville and command bank 's ford thereby shorten fully one-half the distance of general sedgwick 's march from fredericksburg by enable he to use the ford in question as a place of cross to the south bank and unite he column with the main body the center and right of the federal army have in like manner emerge from the thicket of the wilderness and occupied clear ground sufficiently elevate to afford they great advantage this be in the forenoon of the 1st of may when there be no force in general hooker 's front except the eight thousand man of anderson at tabernacle church jackson have march at midnight from the massaponnax hill with a general order from lee to attack and repulse the enemy but have not yet arrive there be thus no serious obstacle in the path of the federal commander who have it in he power it would seem to mass he entire army on the commanding ground which he vanguard already occupy lee be aware of the importance of the position and have he not be delay by the feint of general sedgwick would himself have seize upon it as it be general hooker seem to have win the prize in the race and lee would apparently be force to assail he on he strong ground or retire in the direction of richmond the movement of the enemy have however be so rapid that lee 's disposition seem to have be make before they be fully develop and accurately know to he he have send forward jackson and now proceed to follow in person leave only a force of about six thousand man under early to defend the cross at fredericksburg the promptness of these movement of the confederate commander be notice by northern writer lee with instant perception of the situation say a able historian now seize the mass of he force and with the grasp of a titan swing they into position as a giant might fling a mighty stone from a sling -lrb- footnote : mr swinton in campaign of the army of the potomac whether the force under lee could be justly describe as mighty however the reader will form he own opinion -rrb- such be the relative position of the two army on the 1st of may : general hooker 's force well in advance of chancellorsville and rapidly form line of battle on a ridge in open country general lee 's stretch along the whole distance from fredericksburg to tabernacle church and certainly not in any condition to deliver or accept battle the federal commander seem to have clearly outgenerall he adversary and humanly speak the movement of the two army up to this time seem to point to a decisive federal success general hooker 's own act reverse all this brilliant promise at the very moment when he army be steadily concentrate on the favorable ground in advance of chancellorsville the federal commander for some reason which have never be divulge send a peremptory order that the entire force should fall back into the wilderness this order reverse every thing be say to have be receive with mingled amazement and incredulity by he officer two of whom send he word that from the great advantage of the position it should be hold at all hazard general hooker 's reply be return at once the army accordingly fall back to chancellorsville this movement undoubtedly lose general hooker all the advantage which up to that moment he have secure what he motive for the order in question be it be impossible for the present writer to understand unless the approach of lee powerfully affect he imagination and he suppose the thicket around chancellorsville to be the best ground to receive that assault which the bold advance of he opponent appear to foretell whatever he motive general hooker withdraw he line from the open country fall back to the vicinity of chancellorsville and begin to erect elaborate defence behind which to receive lee 's attack in this backward movement he be follow and harass by the force of jackson the command of anderson be in front jackson 's maxim be to always press a enemy when he be retire and no sooner have the federal force begin to move than he make a prompt attack he continue to follow they up toward chancellorsville until nightfall when the fight cease the confederate advance have be push to alrich 's house within about two mile of chancellorsville here the outer line of the federal work be find and jackson pause he be unwilling at so late a hour to attempt a assault upon they with he small force and direct further movement to cease await the arrival of the commander-in-chief lee arrive and a consultation be hold the question now be the best manner with a force of about thirty-five thousand to drive the federal army of about one hundred thousand beyond the rappahannock iii lee 's determination on this night of the 1st of may the situation of affair be strange indeed general hooker have cross the rappahannock with a force of one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and have without obstruction secure a position so strong he declare that lee must either ingloriously fly or fight a battle in which certain destruction await he so absolutely convinced indeed be the federal commander of the result of the come encounter that he have jubilantly describe the southern army as the legitimate property of the army of the potomac which in the event of the retreat of the confederate would be after they there seem just grounds for this declaration whatever question may have arise of the good taste display by general hooker in make it the force oppose to he be in all about forty-seven thousand man but as cavalry take small part in pitched battle lee 's fight force be only about forty thousand to drive back forty thousand with one hundred and twenty thousand would not apparently prove difficult and it be no doubt this conviction which have occasion the joyous exclamation of general hooker but he own act and the nerve of he adversary have defeat every thing instead of retreat with he small force upon richmond lee have advance to accept or deliver battle this bold movement which general hooker do not seem to have anticipate paralyzed he energy he have not only cross the two river without loss but have take up a strong position where he could maneuver he army perfectly when in consequence of lee 's approach with the evident intent of fight he have cease to advance hesitated and end by retire this be a fair summary of event up to the night of the 1st of may general hooker have advance boldly he be now fall back he have foretell that he adversary would ingloriously fly and that adversary be press he closely the army of the potomac he have declare would soon be after the army of northern virginium but from the appearance of thing at the moment the army of northern virginium seem after the army of the potomac we use general hooker 's own phrase -- they be expressive if not dignified they be indeed suit to the subject which contain no little of the grotesque that anticipation and expression so confident should have be meet with a commentary of event so damaging be sufficient have the occasion not be so tragic to cause laughter in the gravest of human being lee 's intent be now unmistakable instead of fall back from the rappahannock to some line of defense nearer richmond where the force under longstreet at suffolk might have rejoin he with other reënforcements he have plainly resolve with the forty or fifty thousand man of he command to meet general hooker in open battle and leave the event to providence a design so bold would seem to indicate in lee a quality which at that time he be not think to possess -- the willingness to risk decisive defeat by military movement depend for they success upon good fortune alone such seem now the only _ deus ex machina _ that could extricate the southern army from disaster and a crush defeat at that time would have have terrible result there be no other force save the small body under longstreet and a few local troops to protect richmond have lee be disabled and afterward press by general hooker it be impossible to see that any thing but the fall of the confederate capital could have be the result from these speculation and comment we pass to the narrative of actual event general hooker have abandon the strong position in advance of chancellorsville and retire to the fastness around that place to receive the southern attack he further proceedings indicate that he anticipate a assault from lee the federal troops have no sooner regain the thicket from which they have advance in the morning than they be order to erect elaborate work for the protection of infantry and artillery this be promptly begin and by the next morning heavy defence have spring up as if by magic tree have be fell and the trunk interweave so as to present a formidable obstacle to the southern attack in front of these work the forest have be level and the fall trunk be leave lie where they fall form thus a _ abati _ sufficient to seriously delay a assault force which would thus be at every step of the necessarily slow advance under fire on the road pierce the thicket in the direction of the confederate cannon be post to rake the approach to the federal position have thus make he preparation to receive lee 's attack general hooker await that attack no doubt confident of he ability to repulse it he line resemble in some degree the two side of a oblong square -- the longer side extend east and west in front that be to say south of chancellorsville and the shorter side north and south nearly east of the place he right in the direction of wilderness tavern be comparatively undefended as it be not expect that lee would venture upon a movement against that remote point this line it would appear be form with a view to the possible necessity of fall back toward the rappahannock a commander determine to risk everything would it seem have front lee boldly with a line run north and south east of chancellorsville general hooker 's main front be nearly east and west whatever may have be he object in so establish it on the night of the 1st of may as we have say lee and jackson hold a consultation to determine the best method of attack the federal force on the next day all the information which they have be able to obtain of the federal position east and south of chancellorsville indicate that the defence in both these quarter be such as to render a assault injudicious jackson have find he advance obstruct by strong work near alrich 's house on the road run eastward from the enemy 's camp and general stuart and general wright who have move to the left and advance upon the enemy 's front near the point call the furnace have discover the existence of powerful defence in that quarter also they have be meet by a fierce and sudden artillery-fire from federal epaulement and here as to the east of chancellorsville the enemy have evidently fortify they position under these circumstance it be necessary to discover if possible some more favorable opening for a attack there remain but one other -- general hooker 's right west of chancellorsville but to divide the army as would be necessary in order to attack in that quarter seem a undertaking too hazardous to be think of to execute such a plan of assault with any thing like a hope of success general lee would be compel to detach considerably more than half of he entire force this would leave in general hooker 's front a body of troops too inconsiderable to make any resistance if he advance he line and thus the movement promise to result in the certain destruction of one portion of the army to be follow by a triumphant march of the federal force upon richmond in the council of war between lee and jackson on the night of the 1st of may these consideration be duly weigh and the whole situation discuss in the end the hazardous movement against general hooker 's right beyond chancellorsville be determine upon this be first suggest it be say by jackson -- other have attribute the suggestion to lee the point be not material the plan be adopt and lee determine to detach a column of about twenty-one thousand man under jackson to make the attack on the next day he plan be to await the arrival of jackson at the point select for attack meanwhile engage the enemy 's attention by demonstration in they front when jackson 's gun give the signal that he be engage the force in front of the enemy be to advance and participate in the assault and thus strike in front and flank at once general hooker it be hope would be defeat and drive back across the rappahannock there be another possible result the defeat of lee and jackson by general hooker but the desperate character of the situation render it necessary to disregard this risk by midnight this plan have be determine upon and at dawn jackson begin to move jackson 's attack and fall on the morning of the 2d of may general lee be early in the saddle and ride to the front where he remain in personal command of the force face the enemy 's main line of battle throughout the day this force consist of the division of anderson and mclaw and amount to thirteen thousand man that leave at fredericksburg as we have say under general early number six thousand man and the twenty-one thousand which jackson have take with he to strike at the enemy 's right make up the full body of troops under lee that be to say a little over forty thousand artilleryman include the cavalry numbering four or five thousand be like the absent federal cavalry not actually engage in accordance with the plan agree upon between lee and jackson the force leave in the enemy 's front proceed to engage they attention and desultory fighting continue throughout the day general lee meanwhile await the sound of jackson 's gun west of chancellorsville and must have experience great anxiety at this try moment although with he accustomed self-control he display little or none we shall now leave this comparatively interesting portion of the field and invite the attention of the reader to the movement of general jackson who be about to strike he last great blow and lose he own life in the moment of victory jackson set out at early dawn have under he three division command by rhode and trimble in all about twenty-one thousand man and direct he march over the old mine road toward the furnace about a mile or so from and in front of the enemy 's main line stuart move with he cavalry on the flank of the column with the view of mask it from observation and it reach and pass the furnace where a regiment with artillery be leave to guard the road lead thence to chancellorsville and repel any attack which might be make upon the rear of the column just as the rear-guard pass on the anticipated attack take place and the regiment thus leave the twenty-third georgium be suddenly surround and the whole force capture the confederate artillery however open promptly upon the assail force drive it back toward chancellorsville and jackson proceed on he march without further interruption he have thus be see but it seem that the whole movement be regard by general hooker as a retreat of the confederate southward a bend in the road at this point toward the south lead to that supposition we know the enemy be fly general hooker write on the afternoon of this day to general sedgwick try to save he train two of sickle 's division be among they soon after leave the furnace however jackson follow the same wood-road turn westward and march rapidly between the wall of thicket strike into the brock road which run in a direction nearly northwest toward germanna and ely 's ford this would enable he to reach without discovery the orange plank-road or old turnpike west of chancellorsville as the wood through which the narrow highway run completely bar he from observation unless federal spy be lurk in the covert or they scouting-party of cavalry come in sight of the column it would move as secure from discovery as though it be a hundred mile distant from the enemy and against the latter danger of cavalry-scouts stuart 's presence with he horseman provide the movement be thus make without alarming the enemy and the head of jackson 's column reach the orange plank-road near which point general fitz lee invite jackson to ride up to a slight elevation from which the defence of the enemy be visible jackson do so and a glance show he that he be not yet sufficiently upon the enemy 's flank he accordingly turn to a aide and say point to the orange plank-road : tell my column to cross that road the column do so continue to advance toward the rapidan until it reach the old turnpike run from the old wilderness tavern toward chancellorsville at this point jackson find himself full on the right flank of general hooker and halt he troops proceed promptly to form line of battle for the attack it be now past four in the afternoon and the decline sun warn the confederate to lose no time the character of the ground be however such as to dismay any but the most resolute and it seem impossible to execute the intended movement with any thing like rapidity in such a jungle on both side of the old turnpike rise a wall of thicket through which it be impossible to move a regular line of battle all the rule of war must be reverse in face of this obstacle and the assault on general hooker 's work seem destine to be make in column of infantry company and with the artillery move in column of piece despite these serious obstacle jackson hasten to form such order of battle as be possible and with rode 's division in front follow by colston -lrb- trimble -rrb- and hill advance steadily down the old turnpike toward chancellorsville he have determine not only to strike the enemy 's right flank but to execute if possible a still more important movement this be to extend he line steadily to the left swing round he left wing and so interpose himself between general hooker and the rapidan this design of unsurpassed boldness continue to burn in jackson 's brain until he fall and almost he last word be a allusion to it the federal line of work which the confederate thus advance to assault extend across the old turnpike near the house of melzus chancellor and behind be a second line which be cover by the federal artillery in the earthwork near chancellorsville the eleventh corps under general howard be that destine to receive jackson 's assault this be make at a few minute past five in the evening and prove decisive the federal troops be surprise at they supper and be wholly unprepared they have scarcely time to run to they musket which be stack -lrb- 1 -rrb- near at hand when rode burst upon they storm they work over which the troops march almost unresisted and in a few minute the entire corps hold the federal right be in hopeless disorder rode press on follow by the division in he rear and the affair become rather a hunt than a battle the confederate pursue with yell killing or capture all with whom they could come up the federal artillery rush off at a gallop striking against tree-trunk and overturn and the army of general hooker seem about to be hopelessly route this be the account give by northern writer who represent the effect of jackson 's sudden attack as indescribable it have a serious effect as will be subsequently show on the _ morale _ both of general hooker and he army while oppose the heavy demonstration of general lee 's force on they left and in front this storm have burst upon they from a quarter in which no one expect it they be thus catch between two fire and ignorant as they be of the small number of the confederate must have regard the army as seriously imperil -lrb- footnote 1 : they arm be stack and the man be away from they and scatter about for the purpose of cook they supper -- _ general hooker _ -rrb- jackson continue to pursue the enemy on the road to chancellorsville intent now upon make he blow decisive by swing round he left and cut off the federal army from the rappahannock it be impossible however to execute so important a movement until he troops be well in hand and the two division which have make the attack have become mix up in a very confused manner they be accordingly direct to halt and general ap hill whose division have not be engage be send for and order to advance to the front thus afford the disorder division a opportunity to reform they broken line soon after dispatch this order jackson ride out in front of he line on the chancellorsville road in order to reconnoitre in person and ascertain if possible the position and movement of the enemy then within a few hundred yard of he it be now between nine and ten o'clock at night the fighting have temporarily cease and the moon half-seen through misty cloud light up the dreary thicket in which no sound be hear but the incessant and melancholy cry of the whippoorwill jackson have ride forward about a hundred yard in advance of he line on the turnpike accompany by a few officer and have check he horse to listen for any sound come from the direction of chancellorsville when suddenly a volley be fire by he own infantry on the right of the road apparently direct at he and he companion under the impression that they be a federal reconnoitring-party several of the party fall from they horse and wheeling to the left jackson gallop into the wood to escape a renewal of the fire the result be melancholy he pass directly in front of he man who have be warn to guard against a attack of cavalry in they excited state so near the enemy and surround by darkness jackson be suppose to be a federal cavalryman the man accordingly fire upon he at not more than twenty pace and wound he in three place -- twice in the left arm and once in the right hand at the instant when he be strike he be hold he bridle with he left hand and have he right hand raise either to protect he face from bough or in the strange gesture habitual to he in battle as the bullet pass through he arm he drop the bridle of he horse from he left hand but seize it again with the bleeding finger of he right hand when the animal wheeling suddenly dart toward chancellorsville in do so he pass beneath the limb of a pine-tree which strike the wounded man in the face tear off he cap and throw he back on he horse nearly dismount he he succeed however in retain he seat and regain the road where he be receive in the arm of captain wilbourn one of he staff-officer and lay at the foot of a tree the fire have suddenly cease and all be again still only captain wilbourn and a courier be with jackson but a shadowy figure on horseback be see in the edge of the wood near silent and motionless when captain wilbourn call to this person and direct he to ride back and see what troops have thus fire upon they the silent figure disappear and do not return who this could have be be long a mystery but it appear from a recent statement of general revere of the federal army that it be himself he have advance to the front to reconnoitre have come on the group at the foot of the tree and receive the order above mention have think it prudent not to reveal he real character he accordingly ride into the wood and regain he own line a few word will terminate we account of this melancholy event in the history of the war -- the fall of jackson he be support to the rear by he officer and during this painful progress give he last order general pender recognize he and state that he fear he could not hold he position jackson 's eye flash and he reply with animation you must hold you ground general pender you must hold you ground sir he be now so weak as to be unable to walk even lean on the shoulder of he officer he be accordingly place on a litter and bear toward the rear before the litter have go far a furious artillery-fire sweep the road from the direction of chancellorsville and the bearer lower it to the earth and lay down beside it the fire relax they again move but one of the bearer stumble over a root and let the litter fall jackson groan and as the moonlight fall upon he face it be see to be so pale that he appear to be about to die when ask if he be much hurt he open he eye however and say no my friend do not trouble yourself about I he be then bear to the rear place in a ambulance and carry to the hospital at the old wilderness tavern where he remain until he be take to guinea 's station where he die such be the fate of lee 's great lieutenant -- the man whom he speak of as he right arm -- whose death strike a chill to the heart of the southern people from which they never recover v the battle of chancellorsville general lee be not inform of the misfortune which have befall he great lieutenant until toward daybreak on the next morning this fact be doubtless attributable to the difficult character of the country the interposition of the federal army between the two confederate wing which render a long détour necessary in reach lee and the general confusion and dismay attend jackson 's fall it would be difficult indeed to form a exaggerated estimate of the condition of jackson 's corps at this time the troops have be throw into what seem inextricable disorder in consequence of the darkness and the headlong advance of the second -lrb- calston 's -rrb- division upon the heel of rhode which have result in a complete intermingling of the two command and to make matter worse general ap hill the second in command have be wound and disabled nearly at the same moment with jackson by the artillery-fire of the enemy this transfer the command of military right to the brave and skilful general rhode the ranking officer after hill but rhode be only a brigadier-general and have for that reason never come into personal contact with the whole corps who know little of he and be not aware of jackson 's plan and distrust under these circumstance he ability to conduct to a successful issue so vitally important a operation as that intrust to this great wing of the southern army stuart who have go with he cavalry toward ely 's ford to make a demonstration on the federal rear be therefore send for and ride as rapidly as possible to the scene of action and the command be formally relinquish to he by general rhode jackson send stuart word from wilderness tavern to act upon he own judgment and do what he think best as he have implicit confidence in he but in consequence of the darkness and confusion it be impossible for stuart to promptly reform the line and thus all thing remain entangled and confuse it be essential however to inform general lee of the state of affair and jackson 's chief-of-staff colonel pendleton request captain wilbourn who have witness all the detail of the painful scene in the wood to go to general lee and acquaint he with what have take place and receive he order from a m statement of this meritorious officer we take these brief detail of the interview : lee be find lie asleep in a little clump of pine near he front cover with a oil-cloth to protect he from the dew of the night and surround by the officer of he staff also asleep it be not yet daybreak and the darkness prevent the messenger from distinguish the commander-in-chief from the rest he accordingly call for major taylor lee 's adjutant-general and that officer promptly awake when he be inform of what have take place as the conversation continue the sound awake general lee who ask who be there major taylor inform he and rise upon he elbow lee point to he blanket and say : sit down here by I captain and tell I all about the fight last evening he listen without comment during the recital but when it be finish say with great feeling : ah captain any victory be dearly buy which deprive we of the service of general jackson even for a short time from this reply it be evident that he do not regard the wound receive by jackson as of a serious character -- as be natural from the fact that they be only flesh-wound in the arm and hand -- and believe that the only result would be a temporary absence of he lieutenant from command as captain wilbourn continue to speak of the incident lee add with greater emotion than at first : ah do not talk about it thank god it be no worse he then remain silent but see captain wilbourn rise as if to go he request he to remain as he wish to talk with he some more and proceed to ask a number of question in reference to the position of the troops who be in command etc when inform that rhode be in temporary command but that stuart have be send for he exclaim : rhode be a gallant courageous and energetic officer and ask where jackson and stuart could be find call for paper and pencil to write to they captain wilbourn add that from what he have hear jackson say he think he intend to get possession if possible of the road to united state ford in the federal rear and so cut they off from the river that night or early in the morning at these word lee rise quickly and say with animation these people must be press to-day it would seem that at this moment a messenger -- probably captain hotchkiss jackson 's skilful engineer -- arrive from wilderness tavern bring a note from the wounded general lee read it with much feeling and dictate the following reply : general : i have just receive you note inform I that you be wound i can not express my regret at the occurrence could i have direct event i should have choose for the good of the country to have be disabled in you stead i congratulate you upon the victory which be due to you skill and energy re lee _ general _ this be dispatch with a second note to stuart direct he to assume command and press the enemy at dawn lee then mount he horse and just as the day begin to break formed line of battle opposite the enemy 's front he line extend on the right to the plank-road run from chancellorsville in the direction of fredericksburg this force under the personal command of lee amount as we have say originally to about thirteen thousand man and as they loss have not be very severe in the demonstration make against the enemy on the precede day they be in good condition the obvious course now be to place the troops in a position which would enable they in the event of stuart 's success in drive the federal right to unite the left of lee 's line with the right of stuart and so press the federal army back on chancellorsville and the river we shall now return to the left wing of the army which in spite of the absence of the commanding general be the column of attack which be look to for the most important result in response to the summons of the precede night stuart have come back from the direction of ely 's ford at a swift gallop burning with ardor at the thought of lead jackson 's great corps into battle the military ambition of this distinguished commander of lee 's horse be great and he have often chafe at the jest direct at the cavalry arm and at himself as only a cavalry-officer he have now present to he a opportunity of show that he be a trained soldier competent by he nerve and military ability to lead any arm of the service and greet the occasion with delight the man of jackson have be accustom to see that commander pass slowly along they line on a horse as sedate-looking as himself a slow-moving figure with little of the poetry of war in he appearance they now find themselves command by a youthful and daring cavalier on a spirited animal with float plume silken sash and a sabre which gleam in the moonlight as its owner gallop to and fro cheer the man and marshal they for the come assault as he lead the line afterward with joyous vivacity he sabre draw he plume float proudly one of the man compare he to henry of navarre at the battle of ivry but stuart 's spirit of wild gayety destroy the romantic dignity of the scene he lead the man of jackson against general hooker 's breastwork bristle with cannon singing old joe hooker will you come out of the wilderness this sketch will convey a correct idea of the officer who have now grasp the bâton fall from the hand of the great marshal of lee it be probable that the advance of the infantry under such a commander would partake of the rush and rapidity of a cavalry-charge and the sequel justified this view at early dawn the southern line begin to move either in consequence of order from lee or follow he own conception stuart reverse the movement of jackson who have aim to swing round he left and cut off the enemy he seem to have determine to extend he right with the view of unite with the left of anderson 's division under lee and enclose the enemy in the angle near chancellorsville lee have move at the same moment on they front advance steadily over all obstacle and a northern writer who witness the combined attack speak of it in enthusiastic term : from the large brick house which give the name to this vicinity say the writer speaking of chancellorsville the enemy could be see sweeping slowly but confidently determinedly and surely through the clearing which extend in front nothing could excite more admiration for the quality of the veteran soldier than the manner in which the enemy sweep out as they move steadily onward the force which be oppose to they we say it reluctantly and for the first time that the enemy have show the finest quality and we acknowledge on this occasion they superiority in the open field to we own man they deliver they fire with precision and be apparently inflexible and immovable under the storm of bullet and shell which they be constantly receive come to a piece of timber which be occupy by a division of we own man half the number be detail to clear the wood it seem certain that here they would be repulse but they march right through the wood drive we own soldier out who deliver they fire and fall back halt again fire and fall back as before seem to concede to the enemy as a matter of course the superiority which they evidently feel themselves we own man fight well there be no lack of courage but a evident feeling that they be destine to be beat and the only thing for they to do be to fire and retreat this description of the steady advance of the southern line apply rather to the first portion of the attack which compel the front line of the federal army to retire to the stronger ground in rear when this be reach and the troops of lee see before they the last citadel the steady advance become a rush the division of anderson and mclaw on the right make a determine charge upon the great force under general hancock slocum and other in that quarter and stuart close in on the federal right steadily extend he line to join on to anderson the spectacle here be superb as the troops rush on stuart shout charge and remember jackson and this watchword seem to drive the line forward with stuart lead they and singing in he joyous voice old joe hooker will you come out of the wilderness -- for courage poetry and seeming frivolity be strangely mingle in this great soldier -- the troops go headlong at the federal work and in a few moment the real struggle of the battle of chancellorsville have begin from this instant when the line respectively command in person by lee and by stuart close in with the enemy there be little manoeuvring of any description it be a open attempt of lee by hard fight to crush in the enemy 's front and force they back upon the river in this arduous struggle it be due to stuart to say that he generalship largely decide the event and the high commendation which he afterward receive from general lee justify the statement as he line go to the attack he quick military eye discern a elevated point on he right from which it appear a artillery-fire woulden filade the federal line about thirty piece of cannon be at once hasten to this point and a destructive fire open on the line of general slocum which throw he troops into great confusion so serious be this fire that general slocum send word to general hooker that he front be be sweep away by it to which the sullen response be i can not make soldier or ammunition general hooker be indeed it seem at this moment in no mood to take a hopeful view of affair the heavy assault of jackson appear to have as much demoralize the federal commander as he troops during the night he have erect a semicircular line of work in the form of a redan in he rear toward the river behind which new work he no doubt contemplated fall back he now await the result of the southern attack lean against a pillar of the porch at the chancellorsville house when a cannon-ball strike the pillar throw it down and so stunning the general as to prevent he from retain the command which be delegate to general couch -lrb- illustration : chancellorsville -rrb- the fate of the day have now be decide the right wing of the southern army under lee have gradually extend its leave to meet the extension of stuart 's right and this junction of the two wing have be effect lee take personal command of all and advance he whole front in a decisive assault before this the federal front give way and the disorder troops be huddle back -- now only a confused and disorganized mass -- upon chancellorsville the southern troops pursue with yell leap over the earthwork and drive all before they a scene of singular horror ensue the chancellorsville house which have be set on fire by shell be see to spout flame from every window and the adjoining wood have in like manner catch fire and be hear roar over the dead and wound of both side alike the thicket have become the scene of the cruellest of all agony for the unfortunate unable to extricate themselves the whole spectacle in the vicinity of the chancellorsville house now in lee 's possession be frightful fire smoke blood confuse yell and die groan mingle to form the dark picture lee have ride to the front of he line follow up the enemy and as he pass before the troops they greet he with one prolonged unbroken cheer in which those wound and lie upon the ground unite in that cheer speak the fierce joy of man whom the hard combat have turn into blood-hound arouse all the ferocious instinct of the human soul lee sit on he horse motionless near the chancellorsville house he face and figure light up by the glare of the burning wood and give he first attention even at this exciting moment to the unfortunate of both side wound and in danger of be burn to death while issue he order on this subject a note be bring to he from jackson congratulating he upon he victory after read it with evidence of much emotion he turn to the officer who have bring it and say : say to general jackson that the victory be he and that the congratulation be due to he the federal army have fall back in disorder by this time toward they second line it be about ten o'clock in the morning and chancellorsville be in lee 's possession flank movement of general sedgwick lee hasten to bring the southern troops into order again and succeed in promptly reform he line of battle he front extend unbroken along the old turnpike face the river he design be to press general hooker and reap those rich reward of victory to which the hard fighting of the man have entitle they of the demoralize condition of the federal force there can be no doubt and the obvious course now be to follow up they retreat and endeavor to drive they in disorder beyond the rappahannock the order to advance upon the enemy be about to be give when a messenger from fredericksburg arrive at full gallop and communicate intelligence which arrest the order just as it be on lee 's lip a considerable force of the enemy be advance up the turnpike from fredericksburg to fall upon he right flank and upon he rear in case he move beyond chancellorsville the column be that of general sedgwick this officer it will be remember have be detach to make a heavy demonstration at fredericksburg and be still at that point with he troops draw up on the southern bank three mile below the city on Saturday night while jackson be fight on that morning general hooker have send for reynold 's corps but even in the absence of this force general sedgwick retain under he about twenty-two thousand man and this column be now order to storm the height at fredericksburg march up the turnpike and attack lee in flank general sedgwick receive the order at eleven o'clock on Saturday night about the time when jackson be carry wounded to the rear he immediately make he preparation to obey and at daylight move up from below the city to storm the ridge at marye 's and march straight upon chancellorsville in the first assault he fail suffer considerable loss from the fire of the southern troops under general barksdale command the line at that point but subsequently form a assault column for a straight rush at the hill he go forward with impetuosity drive the southern advanced line from behind the stone wall which general sumner and hooker have fail in reach and about eleven in the morning storm marye 's hill and kill capture or disperse the entire southern force there the confederate fight hand to hand over they gun with the enemy for the possession of the crest but they number be inadequate the entire survive force fall back over the telegraph road southward and general sedgwick promptly advance up the turnpike lead from fredericksburg to chancellorsville to assail general lee it be the intelligence of this threatening movement which now reach lee and induce he to defer further attack at the moment upon general hooker he determine promptly to send a force against general sedgwick and this resolution seem to have be base upon sound military judgment there be little to be fear now from general hooker large as the force still be under that officer he be paralyze for the time and would not probably venture upon any attempt to regain possession of chancellorsville with general sedgwick it be different he column be comparatively fresh be flush with victory and number even after he loss of one thousand more than twenty thousand man compare with the entire federal army this force be merely a detachment it be true but it be a detachment numbering as many man probably as the effective of lee 's entire army at chancellorsville he have carry into that fight about thirty-four thousand man he loss have be heavy and the command be much shake to have advance under these circumstance upon general hooker without regard to general sedgwick 's twenty thousand troops inspire by recent victory would have result probably in disaster these comment may detract from that praise of audacity accord to lee in make this movement it seem rather to have be the dictate of common-sense to have advance upon general hooker would have be the audacity it be thus necessary to defer the final blow at the main federal army in he front and general lee promptly detach a force of about five brigade to meet general sedgwick which with early 's command now in rear of the federal column would it be suppose suffice this body move speedily down the turnpike to check the enemy and encounter the head of he column about half-way near salem church general wilcox who have be send by lee to watch bank 's ford have already move to bar the federal advance when the brigade send by lee join he the whole force form line of battle : a brisk action ensue continue from about four in the afternoon until nightfall when the fighting cease and general sedgwick make no further attempt to advance on that day these event take place as we have say on Sunday afternoon the day of the federal defeat at chancellorsville on Monday morning -lrb- may 4th -rrb- the theater of action on the southern bank of the rappahannock present a very remarkable complication general early have be drive from the ridge at fredericksburg but no sooner have general sedgwick march toward chancellorsville than early return and seize upon marye 's height again he be thus in general sedgwick 's rear and ready to prevent he from recross the rappahannock at fredericksburg sedgwick meanwhile be move to assail lee 's flank and rear and lee be ready to attack general hooker in front such be the singular entanglement of the northern and southern force on Monday morning after the battle of chancellorsville what the result be to be the hour of that day be now to decide lee resolve first if possible to crush general sedgwick when it be he design to return and make a decisive assault upon general hooker in accordance with this plan he on Monday morning go in personal command of three brigade of anderson 's division reach the vicinity of salem church and proceed to form line of battle with the whole force there owe to unforeseen delay the attack be not begin until late in the afternoon when the whole line advance upon general sedgwick lee 's aim be to cut he off from the river in this he fail the stubborn resistance of the federal force enable they to hold they ground until night at that time however they seem to waver and lose heart whether from receive intelligence of general hooker 's mishap or from other cause be not know they be now press by the southern troops and finally give way general sedgwick retreat rapidly but in good order to bank 's ford where a pontoon have be fortunately lay and this enable he to cross he man the passage be effect under cover of darkness the southern cannon firing upon the retreat column and with this end the movement of general sedgwick on Tuesday morning lee return with he man toward chancellorsville and during the whole day be busily engage in preparation for a decisive attack upon general hooker on the next morning when however the southern sharp-shooter feel they way at daylight toward the federal position it be find that the work be entirely desert general hooker have recross the river spread pine-bough on the pontoon bridge to muffle the sound of he artillery-wheel so the great advance end vii lee 's generalship and personal demeanor during the campaign the movement of the two army in the chancellorsville campaign as it be generally style have be so fully describe in the foregoing page that little comment upon they be here necessary the main feature which attract attention in survey the whole series of operation be the boldness amounting to apparent recklessness of lee and first the excellent generalship and then the extraordinary tissue of military error of general hooker up to the 1st of may when he emerge from the chancellorsville thicket every thing have succeed with the federal commander and deserve to succeed he have successfully bring over he great force which he himself describe as the finest army on the planet and occupy strong ground east of chancellorsville on the road to fredericksburg general sedgwick be absent at the latter place with a strong detachment of the army but the main body cover bank 's ford but twelve mile from the city and by the afternoon of this day the whole army might have be concentrated then the fate of lee would seem to have be decide he have not only a very small army but that army be scatter and liable to be cut off in detail general sedgwick menace he right at fredericksburg -- general hooker be in front of he leave near chancellorsville -- and to crush one of these wing before the other could come to its assistance seem a work of no very great difficulty general hooker appear however to have distrust he ability to effect this result and finding that general lee be advance with he main body to attack he retire from he strong position in the open country to the dense thicket around chancellorsville that this be a grave military error there can be no doubt as by this retrograde movement general hooker not only discourage he troops who have be elate by he confident and inspiring general order but lose the great advantage of the open country where he large force could be successfully manoeuvre lee take instant advantage of this fault in he adversary and boldly press the force retire into the wilderness where on the night of the 1st of may general hooker be shut up with he army this unforeseen result present the adversary now in a entirely new light the federal army which have be promise by its commander a speedy march upon richmond in pursuit of lee have instead of advance make a backward movement and lee who it have be suppose would retreat be now follow and offer they battle the daring resolution of lee to divide he army and attack the federal right follow it would seem unjust to general hooker greatly to blame he for the success of that blow which could not have be reasonably anticipate in determine upon this one of the most extraordinary movement of the war general lee proceed in defiance of military rule and be only justified in he course by the desperate character of the situation of affair it be impossible to make any impression upon general hooker 's front or leave owe to the elaborate defence in both quarter it be therefore necessary either to retire or attack in a different direction as a retreat however upon richmond would have surrender to the enemy a large and fertile tract of country it be desirable if possible to avoid that alternative and the attack on the federal right follow the result of this be truly extraordinary the force route and drive back in disorder by general jackson be but a single corps and that corps it be say not a legitimate part of the old army of the potomac but the disorder seem to have communicate itself to the whole army and to have especially discourage general hooker in describe the scene in question we refrain from dwelling upon the full extent of the confusion into which the federal force be throw : some sentence take from northern account may lead to a better understanding of the result after jackson 's assault a northern historian say : the open plain around chancellorsville present such a spectacle as a simoom sweep over the desert might make through the dusk of nightfall a rush whirlwind of man and artillery and wagon sweep down the road past headquarters and on toward the ford of the rappahannock and it be in vain that the staff oppose they person and draw sabre to the panic-stricken fugitive another writer a eye-witness say the spectacle present be that of solid column of infantry retreat at double-quick a dense mass of being fly hundred of cavalry-horse leave riderless at the first discharge from the rebel dash frantically about in all direction score of battery fly from the field battery-wagon ambulance horse man cannon caisson all jumbled and tumble together in one inextricable mass -- the stampede universal the disgrace general after all however it be but one corps of the federal army which have be thus throw into disorder and general hooker have no valid grounds for distrust he ability to defeat lee in a more decisive action there be many reason for come to the conclusion that he do from that moment distrust he power he have courageously hasten to the assail point order the man to throw themselves into the breach and receive jackson 's troops on the bayonet but after this display of soldierly resolution general hooker appear to have lose some of that nerve which should never desert a soldier and on the same night send engineer to trace out a new line of defence in he rear to which it seem he already contemplate the probability of be force to retire why he come to take this depressed view of the situation of affair it be difficult to say one of general sedgwick 's corps reach he on this night and he force at chancellorsville still amount to between ninety and one hundred thousand man about thrice that of lee no decisive trial of strength have yet take place between the two army and yet the larger force be construct defence in rear to protect they from the smaller -- a circumstance not tend it would seem to greatly encourage the troops whose commander be thus provide for a safe retreat the subsequent order to general sedgwick to march up from fredericksburg and assail lee 's right be judicious and really save the army from a great disaster lee be about to follow up the discourage force of general hooker as they fall back toward the river and as the southern army be flush with victory the surrender of the great body might have ensue this possible result be prevent by the flank movement of general sedgwick and some gratitude for assistance so important from he able lieutenant would have seem natural and graceful in general hooker this view of the subject do not seem however to have be take by the federal commander he subsequently charge the defeat of chancellorsville upon general sedgwick who he declare have fail in a prompt compliance with he order -lrb- 1 -rrb- the fact do not bear out this charge as the reader have see general sedgwick receive the order toward midnight on Saturday and at eleven o'clock on Sunday morning have pass over that stubborn stone wall which in the battle of the precede December general hooker 's column have not even be able to reach have storm marye 's hill which general hooker have describe in vindication of he own failure to carry the position as masonry a fortification and a mountain of rock and have march thereafter so promptly as to force lee in he own defense to arrest the second advance upon the federal main body and divert a considerable force to meet the attack on he flank -lrb- footnote 1 : general hooker in report of the committee on the conduct of the war part i page 130 this great collection be a valuable repository of historic detail and contain the explanation of many interesting question -rrb- after the repulse of general sedgwick and he retreat across the rappahannock general hooker seem to have be completely discourage and hasten to put the river between himself and lee he loss in the battle of Saturday and Sunday have amount to seventeen thousand one hundred and ninety-seven kill and wound and miss fourteen piece of artillery and twenty thousand stand of arm the confederate loss be ten thousand two hundred and eighty-one contrary to the ordinary course of thing the assail force have lose a less number of man than that assail the foregoing reflection which necessarily involve a criticism of general hooker arise naturally from a review of the event of the campaign and seem justified by the circumstance there can be no inducement for the present writer to underrate the military ability of the federal commander as that want of ability rather detract from than add to the merit of general lee in defeat he it may be say indeed that without these error and shortcoming of general hooker lee humanly speak must have be either defeat or force to retire upon richmond after give full weight however to all the advantage derive from the extraordinary federal oversight and mistake general lee 's merit in this campaign be greater perhaps than in any other during he entire career have he leave behind he no other record than this it alone would have be sufficient to have confer upon he the first glory of arm and hand he name down to posterity as that of one of the greatest soldier of history it be difficult to discover a single error commit by he in the whole series of movement from the moment when general sedgwick cross at fredericksburg to the time of general hooker 's retreat beyond the rappahannock it may appear that there be unnecessary delay in permit Tuesday to pass without a final advance upon general hooker in he second line of intrenchment but no doubt many circumstance induce lee to defer this attack -- the fatigue of he troops consequent upon the fighting of the four precede day Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday the necessity of reform he battalion for the final blow and the anticipation that general hooker who still have at he command a force of more than one hundred thousand man would not so promptly relinquish he campaign and retire with the exception of this error if it be such lee have make no single false step in the whole of he movement the campaign be round perfect and complete -- such as a student of the art of war might pore over and analyze as a instance of the greatest principle of military science clothe in act the most striking feature of lee 's movement be they rapidity and audacity it have be the fashion with some person to speak of lee as slow and cautious in he operation and this criticism have not be completely silence even in the winter of 1862 when he failure to crush general burnside afford he detractor another opportunity of repeat the old charge after the chancellorsville campaign these fault-finder be silence -- no one could be find to listen to they the whole southern movement completely contradict they theory at the first intelligence of the advance of general hooker 's main body across the upper rappahannock lee ride rapidly in that direction and order he troops at the ford of the river to fall back to chancellorsville he then return and find that general sedgwick have cross at fredericksburg hold a prompt consultation with jackson when it be decide at once to concentrate the main body of the army in front of general hooker 's column at the word jackson move lee follow on the 1st of may the enemy be press back upon chancellorsville on the 2d he right be crushed and he army throw into confusion on the 3d he be drive from chancellorsville and but for the flank movement of general sedgwick which lee be not in sufficient force to prevent general hooker would upon that same day Sunday have in all probability suffer a decisive defeat in the course of four day lee have thus advance and check and then attack and repulse with heavy slaughter a army thrice as large as he own on the last day of April he have be nearly envelop by a host of about one hundred and twenty thousand man on the 3d day of may they main body be in disorderly retreat and at daylight on the morning of the 6th there be not a federal soldier with the exception of the prisoner take on the southern bank of the rappahannock during all these critical scene when the fate of the confederate capital and possibly of the southern cause hang suspend in the balance general lee preserve as thousand of person can testify the most admirable serenity and composure without that jubilant confidence display by general hooker in he address to the troops and the exclamation to he officer lee be equally free from gloom or any species of depression he spirit seem to rise under the pressure upon he and at time he be almost gay when one of general jackson 's aide hasten into he tent near fredericksburg and with great animation inform he that the enemy be cross the river in heavy force in he front he seem to be amuse by that circumstance and say smile : well i _ hear _ firing and i be begin to think it be time some of you lazy young fellow be come to tell I what it be all about say to general jackson that he know just as well what to do with the enemy as i do the commander-in-chief who could find time at such a moment to indulge in _ badinage _ must have possess excellent nerve and this composure mingle with a certain buoyant hopefulness as of one sure of the event remain with lee throughout the whole great wrestle with general hooker he retain to the end he simple and quiet manner divest of every thing like excitement in the consultation with jackson on the night of the 1st of may when the crisis be so critical he demeanor indicate no anxiety and when as we have say the news come of jackson 's wound he say simply sit down here by I captain and tell I all about the fight last evening -- add ah captain any victory be dearly buy which deprive we of the service of general jackson even for a short time do not talk about it -- thank god it be no worse the turn of expression here be those of a person who permit nothing to disturb he serenity and indulge he gentler and tenderer feeling even in the hot atmosphere of a great conflict the picture present be surely a interesting and beautiful one the human being who utter the good-natured criticism at the expense of the lazy young fellow and who greet the news of jackson 's misfortune with a sigh as tender as that of a woman be the soldier who have seize the mass of he force with the grasp of a titan and swing they into position as a giant might fling a mighty stone to general hooker 's threat to crush he he have respond by crush general hooker nearly surround by the huge cordon of the federal army he have cut the cordon and emerge in safety general hooker with he one hundred thousand man have retreat to the north bank of the rappahannock and on the south bank lee with he thirty thousand remain erect threatening and triumphant we have not present in these page the order of lee on various occasion as these papers be for the most part of a official character and not of great interest to the general reader we shall however occasionally present these document and here lay before the reader the order of both general hooker and general lee after the battle of chancellorsville give precedence to the former the order of the federal commander be as follow : headquarters army of the potomac _ may _ 61863 the major-general commanding tender to this army he congratulation on its achievement of the last seven day if it have not accomplish all that be expect the reason be well know to the army it be sufficient to say they be of a character not to be foresee or prevent by human sagacity or resource in withdraw from the south bank of the rappahannock before deliver a general battle to we adversary the army have give renew evidence in its confidence in itself and its fidelity to the principle it represent by fight at a disadvantage we would have be recreant to we trust to ourselves to we cause and to we country profoundly loyal and conscious of its strength the army of the potomac will give or decline battle whenever its interest or honor may command it by the celerity and secrecy of we movement we advance and passage of the river be undisputed and on we withdrawal not a rebel dare to follow we the event of the last week may well cause the heart of every officer and soldier of the army to swell with pride we have add new laurel to we former renown we have make long march cross river surprise the enemy in he intrenchment and whenever we have fight we have inflict heavier blow than those we have receive we have take from the enemy five thousand prisoner and fifteen color capture seven piece of artillery and place _ hors de combat _ eighteen thousand of we foe 's choose troops we have destroy he depot fill with vast amount of store damage he communication capture prisoner within the fortification of he capital and fill he country with fear and consternation we have no other regret than that cause by the loss of we brave companion and in this we be console by the conviction that they have fall in the holiest cause ever submit to the arbitration of battle by command of major-general hooker : s william _ assistant adjutant-general _ general lee 's order be as follow : headquarters army of northern virginium _ may _ 71863 with heart-felt gratification the general commanding express to the army he sense of the heroic conduct display by officer and man during the arduous operation in which they have just be engage under try vicissitude of heat and storm you attack the enemy strongly intrench in the depths of a tangled wilderness and again on the hill of fredericksburg fifteen mile distant and by the valor that have triumph on so many field force he once more to seek safety beyond the rappahannock while this glorious victory entitle you to the praise and gratitude of the nation we be especially call upon to return we grateful thanks to the only giver of victory for the signal deliverance he have work it be therefore earnestly recommend that the troops unite on Sunday next in ascribe unto the lord of host the glory due unto he name let we not forget in we rejoice the brave soldier who have fall in defense of they country and while we mourn they loss let we resolve to emulate they noble example the army and the country alike lament the absence for a time of one to whose bravery energy and skill they be so much indebted for success the follow letter from the president of the confederate state be communicate to the army as a expression of he appreciation of they success : i have receive you dispatch and reverently unite with you in give praise to god for the success with which he have crown we arm in the name of the people i offer my cordial thanks and the troops under you command for this addition to the unprecedented series of great victory which we army have achieve the universal rejoice produce by this happy result will be mingle with a general regret for the good and the brave who be number among the kill and the wound re lee _ general _ viii personal relation of lee and jackson the most important incident of the great battle of chancellorsville be the fall of jackson the service of this illustrious soldier have now become almost indispensable to general lee who speak of he as he right arm and the commander-in-chief have so long be accustom to lean upon the strong shoulder of he lieutenant that now when this support be withdraw he seem to have feel the loss of it profoundly in the war indeed there have arise no soldier who so powerfully draw the public eye as jackson in the opinion of many person he be a greater and abler commander than lee himself and although such a opinion will not be find to stand after a full review of the character and career of the two leader there be sufficient ground for it to induce many fair and intelligent person to adopt it jackson have be almost uniformly successful he have conduct to a triumphant issue the arduous campaign of the valley where he be oppose in nearly every battle by a force much larger than he own and these victory in a quarter so important and at a moment so critical have come bear on the wind of the mountain to electrify and inspire the heart of the people of richmond and the entire confederacy jackson 's rapid march and assault on general mcclellan 's right on the chickahominy have follow he then advance northward defeat the vanguard of the enemy at cedar mountain lead the great column of lee against the rear of general pope destroy manassa hold he ground until lee arrive and bear a important part in the battle which ensue thence he have pass to maryland fall upon harper 's ferry and capture it return to fight with lee at sharpsburg and in that battle have bear the brunt of the enemy 's main assault with a unbroken front that the result be a draw battle and not a southern defeat be due to lee 's generalship and jackson 's fight the retrograde movement to the lowland follow and jackson be leave in the valley to embarrass mcclellan 's advance in this he perfectly succeed and then suddenly reappear at fredericksburg where he receive and repulse one of the two great assault of the enemy the battle of chancellorsville follow and lee 's statement of the part bear in this hard combat by jackson have be give the result be due he say not to he own generalship but to the skill and energy of he lieutenant whose congratulation he refuse to receive declare that the victory be jackson 's here have at last end the long series of nearly unbroken victory jackson have become the _ alter ego _ of lee and it be not difficult to understand the sense of loss feel by the commander-in-chief in addition to this natural sentiment be deep regret at the death of one personally dear to he and to whom he be himself a object of almost reverent love the personal relation of lee and jackson have from first to last remain the same -- not the slightest cloud have ever arise to disturb the perfect union in each of admiration and affection for the other it have never occur to these two great soldier to ask what they relative position be in the public eye -- which be most speak of and commend or admire human nature be weak at best and the fame of jackson mount to its dazzling zenith might have disturb a less magnanimous soul than lee 's there be not however the slightest reason to believe that lee ever give the subject a think entirely free from that vulgar species of ambition which look with cold eye upon the success of other as offensive to its own _ amour-propre _ lee never seem to have institute any comparison between himself and jackson -- greet praise of he famous lieutenant with sincere pleasure -- and be the first upon every occasion not only to express the fullest sense of jackson 's assistance and the warmest admiration of he genius as a soldier but to attribute to he as after the battle of chancellorsville _ all _ the merit of every description it be not possible to contemplate this August affection and admiration of the two soldier for each other without regard it as a greater glory to they than all they success in arm lee 's opinion of jackson and personal sentiment toward he have be set forth in the above sentence the sentiment of jackson for lee be as strong or stronger he regard he with mingled love and admiration to excite such feeling in a man like jackson it be necessary that lee should be not only a soldier of the first order of genius but also a good and pious man it be in these light that jackson regard he commander and from first to last he confidence in and admiration for he never waver he have defend lee from the criticism of unskilled or ignorant person from the time when he assume command of the army in the summer of 1862 at that time some one speak of lee in jackson 's presence as slow the criticism arouse the indignation of the silent soldier and he exclaim : general lee be _ not _ ` slow ' no one know the weight upon he heart -- he great responsibility he be commander-in-chief and he know that if a army be lose it can not be replace no there may be some person whose good opinion of I may make they attach some weight to my view and if you ever hear that say of general lee i beg you will contradict it in my name i have know general lee for five-and-twenty year he be cautious he ought to be but he be _ not _ ` slow ' lee be a phenomenon he be the only man whom i would follow blindfold the abrupt and energetic expression of jackson on this occasion indicate he profound sense of the injustice do lee by these criticism and it would be difficult to imagine a stronger statement than that here make by he it will be concede that he himself be competent to estimate soldiership and in jackson 's eye lee be a phenomenon -- the only man whom he would follow blindfold the subsequent career of lee seem to have strengthen and intensify this extreme admiration what lee advise or do be always in jackson 's eye the very best that could be suggest or perform he yield he own opinion upon every occasion with perfect readiness and cheerfulness to those of lee as to the master-mind loved he revere he look up to he and never seem to have find fault with he but upon one occasion -- when he receive lee 's note of congratulation after chancellorsville he then say : general lee be very kind but he should give the glory to god this affection and admiration be fully return by general lee who consult jackson upon every occasion and confide in he as he personal friend there be seldom any question between they of superior and subordinate -- never except when the exigency require that the decision should be make by lee as commander-in-chief jackson 's supreme genius indeed make this course natural and no further praise be due lee in this particular save that of modesty and good sense but these quality be commendable and not universal he commit the greatest undertaking to jackson with the utmost confidence certain that he would do all that could be do and some word of he quote above express this entire confidence say to general jackson he reply to the young staff-officer at fredericksburg that he know just as well what to do with the enemy as i do lee 's personal affection be strikingly display after the battle of chancellorsville when jackson lay painfully but no one suppose mortally wound first at wilderness tavern and then at ginney 's prevent from visit the wounded man by the responsibility of command now all the greater from jackson 's absence and not regard he hurt as serious as indeed it do not appear to be until toward the last lee send he continual message contain good wish and inquiry after he health the tone of these message be very familiar and affectionate and leave no doubt of the character of the relation between the two man give he my affectionate regard he say to one officer and tell he to make haste and get well and come back to I as soon as he can he have lose he left arm but i have lose my right when the wound of the great soldier take a bad turn and it begin to be whisper about that the hurt might prove fatal lee be strongly move and say with deep feeling : surely general jackson must recover god will not take he from we now that we need he so much surely he will be spare to we in answer to the many prayer which be offer for he he pause after utter these word labor evidently under very deep and painful emotion after remain silent for some moment he add : when you return i trust you will find he better when a suitable occasion offer give he my love and tell he that i wrestle in prayer for he last night as i never pray i believe for myself the tone of these message be as we have say that of familiar affection as from one value friend to another the expression give he my love be a virginianism which be use only when two person be closely and firmly bind by long association and friendship such have be the case with lee and jackson and in the annals of the war there be no other instance of a friendship so close affectionate and unalloyed jackson die on the 10th of may and the unexpected intelligence shocked lee profoundly he mourn the death of the illustrious soldier with a sorrow too deep almost to find relief in tear and issue a general order to the troops which be in the follow word : with deep grief the commanding general announce to the army the death of lieutenant-general tj jackson who expire on the 10th inst at quarter-past three pm the daring skill and energy of this great and good soldier by the decree of a all-wise providence be now lose to we but while we mourn he death we feel that he spirit still live and will inspire the whole army with he indomitable courage and unshaken confidence in god as we hope and strength let he name be a watchword to he corps who have follow he to victory on so many field let he officer and soldier emulate he invincible determination to do every thing in defense of we beloved country re lee _ general _ it be probable that the composition of this order cost general lee one of the severest pang he ever experience ix circumstance lead to the invasion of pennsylvanium the defeat of general hooker at chancellorsville be the turning-point of the war and for the first time there be apparently a possibility of induce the federal government to relinquish its opposition to the establishment of a separate authority in the south the idea of the formation of a southern confederacy distinct from the old union have up to this time be repudiate by the authority at washington as a thing utterly out of the question but the defeat of the federal arm in the two great battle of the rappahannock have cause the most determine opponent of separation to doubt whether the south could be coerce to return to the union and what be equally or more important the proclamation of president lincoln declare the slave of the south free and place the united state virtually under martial law arouse a violent clamor from the great democratic party of the north who loudly assert that all constitutional liberty be disappear this combination of non-success in military affair and usurpation by the government embolden the advocate of peace to speak out plainly and utter they protest against the continuance of the struggle which they declare have only result in the prostration of all the liberty of the country journal and periodical violently denunciatory of the course pursue by the government all at once make they appearance in new york and elsewhere a peace convention be call to meet in philadelphium mr vallandigham nominee of the democratic party for governor of ohio eloquently denounce the whole policy of endeavor to subjugate the sovereign state of the south and judge curti of boston formerly associate judge of the supreme court of the united state publish a pamphlet in which the federal president be stigmatize as a usurper and tyrant i do not see write judge curti that it depend upon the executive decree whether a servile war shall be invoke to help twenty million of the white race to assert the rightful authority of the constitution and law of they country over those who refuse to obey they but i do see that this proclamation -lrb- emancipate the southern slave -rrb- assert the power of the executive to make such a decree i do not perceive how it be that my neighbor and myself reside remote from army and they operation and where all the law of the land may be enforce by constitutional means should be subject to the possibility of arrest and imprisonment and trial before a military commission and punishment at its discretion for offence unknown to the law -- a possibility to be convert into a fact at the mere will of the president or of some subordinate officer clothe by he with this power but i do perceive that this executive power be assert it must be obvious to the meanest capacity that if the president of the united state have a _ imply _ constitutional right as commander-in-chief of the army and navy in time of war to disregard any one positive prohibition of the constitution or to exercise any one power not delegate to the united state by the constitution because in he judgment he may thereby ` best subdue the enemy ' he have the same right for the same reason to disregard each and every provision of the constitution and to exercise all power _ needful in he opinion _ to enable he ` best to subdue the enemy ' the time have certainly come when the people of the united state _ must _ understand and _ must _ apply those great rule of civil liberty which have be arrive at by the self-devoted effort of thought and action of they ancestor during seven hundred year of struggle against arbitrary power so far have reach the thunder of lee 's gun at chancellorsville they roar seem to have awaken throughout the entire north the great party hitherto lull to slumber by the plea of military necessity or paralyze by the very extent of the executive usurpation which they see but have not have heart to oppose on all side the advocate of peace on the basis of separation be hear raise they importunate voice and in the north the heart of the people begin to thrill with the anticipation of a speedy termination of the bloody and exhausting struggle the occasion be embrace by mr stephen vice-president of the confederate state to propose negotiation this able gentleman write from georgium on the 12th of June to president davi offer to go to washington and sound the authority there on the subject of peace he believe that the moment be propitious and wish to act before further military movement be undertake -- especially before any further project of invasion by lee -- which would tend he think to silence the peace party at the north and again arouse the war spirit the letter of mr stephen be write on the 12th of June and president davi respond by telegraph a few day afterward request mr stephen to come to richmond he reach that city on the 22d or 23d of June but by that time lee 's vanguard be enter maryland and gettysburg speedily follow which terminate all hope of peace the plan of move the southern army northward with the view of invade the federal territory seem to have be the result of many circumstance the country be elate with the two great victory of fredericksburg and chancellorsville and the people be clamorous for active operation against a enemy who seem powerless to stand the pressure of southern steel the army which have be largely augment by the return of absentee to its rank new levy and the recall of longstreet 's two division from suffolk share the general enthusiasm and thus a very heavy pressure be bring to bear upon the authority and on general lee in favor of a forward movement which it be suppose would terminate in a signal victory and a treaty of peace lee yield to this view of thing rather than urge it he be not oppose to a offensive policy and seem indeed to have share the opinion of jackson that the scipio africanus policy be the best for the south he theory from the beginning of the war have be that the true policy of the south be to keep the enemy as far as possible from the interior fighting on the frontier or on federal soil if possible that of the south would there thus be protect from the ravages of the enemy and the further advantage would accrue that the confederate capital richmond would at all time be safe from danger this be a important consideration as event subsequently show as long as the enemy be hold at arm 's - length north of the rappahannock richmond with she net-work of railroad connect with every part of the south be safe and the government undisturbed in they capital remain a power in the eye of the world but with a enemy envelop the city and threaten she line of communication the tenure of the place by the government be uncertain when general grant finally thus envelop the city and lay hold upon the railroad lee 's army be defeat and the government become fugitive which alone would have strike a mortal blow to its prestige and authority it be to arrive at these result which he sagacity discern that lee always advocate such movement as would throw back the enemy and drive he if possible from the soil of virginium another important consideration be the question of supplies these be at all time deficient in the confederate army and it be obviously the best policy to protect as much territory from which supplies might be draw as possible more than ever before these supplies be now need and when general lee send in may or June a requisition for ration to richmond the commissary-general be say to have endorse upon the paper if general lee wish ration let he seek they in pennsylvanium the consideration here state be the main inducement for that great movement northward which follow the battle of chancellorsville the army and country be enthusiastic the government rather follow than lead and throughout the month of may lee be busily engage in organize and equip he force for the decisive advance experience have now dictate many alteration and improvement in the army it be divide into three _ corps d'armée _ each consist of three division and command by a officer with the rank of lieutenant-general longstreet remain at the head of he former corps ewell succeed jackson in command of jackson 's old corps and ap hill be assign to a third corps make up of portion of the two other the infantry be thus rearrange in a manner to increase greatly its efficiency and the artillery arm be entirely reorganize the old system of assign one or more battery or battalion to each division or corps be do away with and the artillery of the army be make a distinct command and place under general wn pendleton a brave and energetic officer who be thenceforward lee 's chief of artillery the last arm the cavalry be also increase in efficiency and on the last day of may general lee have the satisfaction of find himself in command of a well-equipped and admirably-officered army of sixty-eight thousand three hundred and fifty-two bayonet and nearly ten thousand cavalry and artillery -- in all about eighty thousand man never before have the southern army have present for duty as fight man so large a number except just before the battle on the chickahominy there be however this great difference between the army then and at this time : in those first month of 1862 it be make up largely of raw troops who have never hear the discharge of a musket in they life : while now in may 1863 the bulk of the army consist of lee 's veteran man who have follow he through the fire of manassa sharpsburg fredericksburg and chancellorsville and could be count on to effect any thing not absolutely beyond human power general longstreet converse after the war with a gentleman of the north declare as much the army at that time he say be in a condition to undertake _ any thing _ x lee 's plan and object the great game of chess be now about to commence and take a illustration from that game general lee be report to have say that he believe he would swap queen that be advance and attempt to capture the city of washington leave general hooker at liberty if he choose so to do to seize in turn upon richmond what the result of so singular a maneuver would have be it be impossible to say it would certainly have prove one of the strangest incident of a war fruitful in varied and shift event such a plan of operation however if ever seriously contemplate by lee be speedily abandon he nowhere make mention of any such design in he publish report and he probably speak of it only in jest he real aim in the great movement now about to commence be state with brevity and reserve -- then absolutely necessary -- but also with sufficient clearness in he official report the position of the enemy opposite fredericksburg be he say such as to render a attack upon he injudicious it be therefore desirable to maneuver he out of it -- force he to return toward maryland -- and thus free the country of he force a further result be expect from this movement the lower shenandoah valley be occupy by the enemy under general milroy who with he headquarters at winchester harass the whole region which he rule with a rod of iron with the withdrawal of the federal army under general hooker and before the advance of the confederate general milroy would also disappear and the fertile field of the valley be relieve the whole force of the enemy would thus say lee be compel to leave virginia and possibly to draw to its support troops design to operate against other part of the country he add : in this way it be suppose that the enemy 's plan of campaign for the summer would be break up and part of the season of active operation be consume in the formation of new combination and the preparation that they would require in addition to these advantage it be hope that other valuable result might be attain by military success that be to say by a battle which lee intend to fight when circumstance be favorable that he expect to fight not merely to maneuver the enemy from virginium be apparent from another sentence of the report it be think he say that the corresponding movement on the part of the enemy to which those contemplate by we would probably give rise might _ offer a fair opportunity to strike a blow at the army therein command by general hooker _ the word therein refer to the region north of the potomac in the phrase other valuable result which might be attain by military success the reference be plainly to the termination of the contest by a treaty of peace base upon the independence of the south these sentence take from the only publication ever make by lee on the subject of the gettysburg campaign express guardedly but distinctly he design he aim to draw general hooker north of the potomac clear the valley induce the enemy to send troops in other quarter to the assistance of the main federal army and when the moment come attack general hooker defeat he if possible and thus end the war that a decisive defeat of the federal force at that time in maryland or pennsylvanium would have virtually put a end to the contest there seem good reason to believe follow the southern victory of fredericksburg and chancellorsville a third bloody disaster would in all human probability have break the resolution of the federal authority with lee thunder at the gate of washington or philadelphium and with the peace party encourage to loud and importunate protest it be not probable that the war would have continue intelligent person in the north be say to have so declare since the war and the declaration seem base upon good sense before pass from this necessary preface to the narrative of event it be proper to add that in the contemplated battle with general hooker when he have draw he north of the potomac lee do not intend to assume a _ tactical offensive _ but to force the federal commander if possible to make the attack -lrb- footnote : it have not be intend to fight a general battle at such a distance from we base unless attack by the enemy -- _ lee 's report _ -rrb- from this resolution he be afterward induce by circumstance to depart and the result be know what be above write will convey to the reader a clear conception of lee 's view and intention in undertake he last great offensive campaign and we now proceed to the narrative of the movement of the two army and the battle of gettysburg xi the cavalry-fight at fleetwood lee begin he movement northward on the 3d day of June just one month after the battle of chancellorsville from this moment to the time when he army be concentrate in the vicinity of gettysburg he operation be rapid and energetic but with a cautious regard to the movement of the enemy pursue he design of manoeuvre the federal army out of virginium without come to action lee first send forward one division of longstreet 's corps in the direction of culpepper another then follow and on the 4th and 5th of June ewell 's entire corps be send in the same direction -- ap hill remain behind on the south bank of the rappahannock near fredericksburg to watch the enemy there and bar the road to richmond these movement become speedily know to general hooker whose army lay north of the river near that point and on the 5th he lay a pontoon just below fredericksburg and cross about a corps to the south bank opposite hill this threatening demonstration however be not suffer by lee to arrest he own movement see that the presence of the enemy there be intend for the purpose of observation rather than attack and only aim to check he operation he continue the withdrawal of he troops by way of culpepper in the direction of the shenandoah valley a brilliant pageant succeed by a dramatic and stir incident be now to prelude the march of lee into the enemy 's territory on the 8th of June the day of the arrival of lee 's head of column in culpepper a review of stuart 's cavalry take place in a field east of the court-house the review be a picturesque affair general lee be present sit he horse motionless on a little knoll -- the erect figure half conceal by the short cavalry-cape fall from he shoulder and the grave face overshadow by the broad gray hat -- while above he from a lofty pole wave the fold of a large confederate flag the long column of about eight thousand cavalry be first draw up in line and afterward pass in front of lee at a gallop -- stuart and he staff-officer lead the charge with sabre at tierce point a species of military display highly attractive to the gallant and joyous young commander the man then charge in mimic battle the gun of the stuart horse-artillery which be post upon a adjoining hill and as the column of cavalry approach the artillerist receive they with a thunderous discharge of blank ammunition which roll like the roar of actual battle among the surround hill this sham-fight be keep up for some time and no doubt puzzle the enemy on the opposite shore of the rappahannock on the next morning -- either in consequence of a design form before the review or to ascertain what this discharge of artillery mean -- two division of federal cavalry support by two brigade of pick infantry be send across the river at kelly 's and beverley 's ford east of the court-house to beat up the quarter of stuart and find what be go on in the southern camp the most extensive cavalry-fight probably of the whole war follow one of stuart 's brigade near beverley 's ford be nearly surprised and resolutely attack at daylight by buford 's division which succeed in force back the brigade a short distance toward the high range call fleetwood hill in the rear from this eminence where he headquarters be establish stuart go to the front at a swift gallop open a determine fire of artillery and sharp-shooter upon the advance enemy and send hampton 's division to attack they on they leave meanwhile however the enemy be execute a rapid and dangerous movement against stuart 's rear general gregg command the second federal cavalry division cross at kelly 's ford below pass the force leave in that quarter and come in directly on stuart 's rear behind fleetwood hill in the midst of the hard fight in front stuart be call now to defend he rear he hasten to do so by fall back and meet the enemy now charge the hill the attack be repulse and the enemy 's artillery charge in turn by the southerner this be capture and recapture two or three time but at last remain in the hand of stuart general gregg now swing round he right and prepare to advance along the eastern slope of the hill stuart have however post he artillery there and as the federal line begin to move arrest it with a sudden and destructive fire of shell at the same time a portion of hampton 's division under the brave georgian general pmb young be order to charge the enemy the assault be promptly make with the sabre unaided by carbine or pistol fire and young cut down or route the force in front of he which disperse in disorder toward the river the dangerous assault on the rear of fleetwood hill be thus repulse and the advance of the enemy on the leave near the river meet with the same ill success general whf lee son of the commanding general gallantly charge they in that quarter and drive they back to the rappahannock receive a severe wound which long confine he to he bed hampton have follow the retreat enemy on the right under the fire of stuart 's gun from fleetwood hill and by nightfall the whole force have recross the rappahannock leave several hundred dead and wound upon the field -lrb- footnote : the southern loss be also considerable colonel william be kill general lee and butler severely wound -- the latter lose he foot -- and general stuart 's staff have be peculiarly unfortunate of the small group of officer captain farley be kill captain white wound and lieutenant goldsborough capture the federal force sustain a great loss in the death of the gallant colonel davi of the eighth new-york cavalry and other officer -rrb- this reconnoissance in force -- the federal number probably amount to fifteen thousand -- have no other result than the discovery of the fact that lee have infantry in culpepper finding that the event of the fight be critical general lee have move a body of infantry in the direction of the field of action and the gleam of the bayonet be see by the enemy the infantry be not however engage on either side unless the federal infantry participate in the initial skirmish near beverley 's ford and general lee 's number and position be not discover we have dwell with some detail upon this cavalry combat which be a animated affair the hand-to-hand encounter of nearly twenty thousand horseman throughout a whole day general stuart be censure at the time for allow himself to be surprised and a ball at culpepper court-house at which some of he officer be present several day before be point to as the origin of this surprise the charge be wholly unjust stuart not have attend the ball nor be there any truth in the further statement that he headquarters be capture in consequence of he negligence he tent on fleetwood hill be all send to the rear soon after daylight nothing whatever be find there but a section of the horse-artillery who fight the charge cavalry with sabre and sponge-staff over the gun that fleetwood hill be at one time in the hand of the enemy be due not to stuart 's negligence but to the number and excellent soldiership of general gregg who make the flank and rear attack while stuart be breast that in front these detach statement which may seem unduly minute be make in justice to a brave soldier who can no longer defend himself xii the march to gettysburg this attempt of the enemy to penetrate he design have not induce general lee to interrupt the movement of he infantry toward the shenandoah valley the federal corps send across the rappahannock at fredericksburg still remain face general hill and two day after the fleetwood fight general hooker move up the river with he main body advance the third corps to a point near beverley 's ford but these movement be disregard by lee on the same day ewell 's corps move rapidly toward chester gap pass through that defile in the mountain push on by way of front royal and reach winchester on the evening of the 13th have in three day march seventy mile the position of the southern army now expose it to very serious danger and at first sight seem to indicate a deficiency of soldiership in the general command it in face of a enemy whose force be at least equal to he own -lrb- footnote : general hooker state he effective at this time to have be diminish to eighty thousand infantry -rrb- lee have extend he line until it stretch over a distance of about one hundred mile when ewell come in sight of winchester hill be still opposite fredericksburg and longstreet half-way between the two in culpepper between the middle and rear corps be interpose the rapidan river and between the middle and advanced corps the blue ridge mountain general hooker 's army be on the north bank of the rappahannock well in hand and comparatively mass and the situation of lee 's army seem excellent for the success of a sudden blow at it it seem that the propriety of attack the southern army while thus _ in transitu _ suggest itself both to general hooker and to president lincoln but they differ as to the point and object of the attack in anticipation of lee 's movement general hooker have write to the president probably suggest a counter-movement across the rappahannock somewhere near fredericksburg to threaten richmond and thus check lee 's advance this however president lincoln refuse to sanction in case you find lee come to the north of the rappahannock president lincoln write to general hooker i would by no means cross to the south of it i would not take any risk of be entangled upon the river _ like a ox jump half over a fence and liable to be tear by dog front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or kick the other _ five day afterward the president write : i think lee 's army and not richmond be you true objective point if he come toward the upper potomac fight he when opportunity offer if he stay where he be _ fret he and fret he _ when intelligence now reach washington that the head of lee 's column be approach the upper potomac while the rear be south of the rappahannock the president write to general hooker : _ if the head of lee 's army be at martinsburg and the tail of it on the plank road _ between fredericksburg and chancellorsville the _ animal must be very slim somewhere -- could you not break he _ general hooker do not seem to be able to determine upon a decisive course of action in spite of the tempting opening present to he by lee it would seem that nothing could have be plainer than the good policy of a attack upon hill at fredericksburg which would certainly have check lee 's movement by recall longstreet from culpepper and ewell from the valley but this bold operation do not appear to commend itself to the federal authority instead of reënforcing the corps send across at fredericksburg and attack hill general hooker withdraw the corps on the 13th to the north bank of the river get he force together and begin to fall back toward manassa and even remain in ignorance it seem of all connect with he adversary 's movement even as late as the 17th of June he chief-of-staff general butterfield write to one of he officer try and hunt up somebody from pennsylvanium who know something and have a cool enough head to judge what be the actual state of affair there with regard to the enemy _ my impression be that lee 's movement on the upper potomac be a cover for a cavalry-raid on the south side of the river we can not go boggle around until we know what we be go after _ such be the first result of lee 's daring movement to transfer military operation to the region north of the potomac a northern historian have discern in he plan of campaign a amount of boldness which seem to imply a great contempt for he opponent this be perhaps a somewhat exaggerated statement of the case without boldness a commander be but half a soldier and it may be declare that a certain amount of that quality be absolutely essential to successful military operation but the question be do lee expose himself by these movement of he army to probable disaster if he adversary -- equal to the occasion -- strike at he flank a failure of the campaign of invasion would probably have result from such a attack either upon hill at fredericksburg or upon longstreet in culpepper inasmuch as ewell 's column in that event must have fall back but a _ defeat _ of the combined force of hill and longstreet who be within support distance of each other be not a event which general hooker could count upon with any degree of certainty the two corps number nearly fifty thousand man -- that be to say two-third of the southern army general hooker 's whole force be but about eighty thousand and it be not probable that the eighty thousand would be able to rout the fifty thousand when at chancellorsville less than this last number of southerner have defeat one hundred and twenty thousand there seem little reason to doubt that general lee take this view of the subject and rely on hill and longstreet to unite and repulse any attack upon they while ewell 's great raiding column drive forward into the heart of the enemy 's territory that the movement be bold there can certainly be no question that it be a reckless and hazardous operation depend for its success in lee 's eye solely on the suppose inefficiency of general hooker do not appear these comment delay the narrative but the subject be fruitful in suggestion it may be pardon a southern writer if he linger over this last great offensive movement of the southern army the last it be also one of the greatest and most brilliant the war therefore be to enter upon its second stage in which the south be to simply maintain the defensive but lee be terminate the first stage of the contest by one of those great campaign which project event and personage in bold relief from the broad canvas and illumine the page of history event be now in rapid progress ewell 's column -- the sharp head of the southern spear -- reach winchester on the 13th of June and rode who have be detach at front royal to drive the enemy from berryville reach the last-named village on the same day when the force there retreat to winchester on the next morning early 's division attack the force of milroy at winchester storm and capture they star fort on a hill near the place and so complete be the rout of the enemy that they commander general milroy have scarcely time to escape with a handful of he man in the direction of the potomac for this disaster the unfortunate officer be harshly criticise by general hooker who write to he government in my opinion milroy 's man will fight better _ under a soldier _ after thus clear the country around winchester ewell advance rapidly on martinsburg where he take a number of prisoner and some artillery the capture in two day have be more than four thousand prisoner and twenty-nine cannon with four hundred horse and a large amount of store ewell continue then to advance and enter maryland send a portion of he cavalry under general imboden westward to destroy the baltimore and ohio railroad and another body under general jenkin in advance toward chambersburg meanwhile the rest of the army be move to join he hill finding that the enemy have disappear from he front near fredericksburg hasten to march from that vicinity and be send forward by lee on the track of ewell passing in rear of longstreet who have remain in culpepper the latter be now direct by lee to move along the eastern side of the blue ridge and by occupy ashby 's and snicker 's gap protect the flank of the column in the valley from attack -- a work in which stuart 's cavalry throw out toward the enemy assist such be the posture of affair when general hooker 's chief-of-staff become so much puzzle and describe the federal army as boggle around and not know what they be go after lee 's whole movement it appear be regard as a feint to cover a cavalry-raid on the south side of the river -- a strange conclusion it would seem in reference to a movement of such magnitude it now become absolutely necessary that lee 's design should be unmask if possible and to effect this object stuart 's cavalry force cover the southern flank east of the blue ridge must be drive back this be undertake in a deliberate manner three corps of cavalry with a division of infantry and a full supply of artillery be send forward from the vicinity of manassa to drive stuart in on all the road lead to the mountain a fierce struggle follow in which stuart who know the importance of he position fight the great force oppose to he from every hill and knoll but he be force back steadily in spite of a determine resistance and at upperville a hand-to-hand sabre-fight wound up the movement in which the federal cavalry be check when stuart fall back toward pari crown the mountain-side with he cannon and await a final attack this be not however make night approach the federal force fall back toward manassa and on the next morning stuart follow they on the same road over which he have so rapidly retreat beyond middleburg lee pay little attention to these operation on he flank east of the mountain but proceed steadily in personal command of he infantry in the direction of the cumberland valley ewell be move rapidly toward harrisburg with order to take that place if he deem he force adequate -lrb- 1 -rrb- general jenkin command cavalry precede the advance of he infantry he have thus pierce the enemy 's territory and it be necessary promptly to support he hill and longstreet be accordingly direct to pass the potomac at shepherdstown and williamsport the column unite at hagerstown and on the 27th of June enter chambersburg -lrb- footnote 1 : this statement of lee 's order be derive by the writer from lieutenant-general ewell -rrb- general hooker have follow cross the potomac opposite leesburg at about the moment when lee 's rear be pass from maryland into pennsylvanium the direction of the federal march be toward frederick from which point general hooker could move in either one of two direction -- either across the mountain toward boonsboro which would throw he upon lee 's communication or northward to westminster or gettysburg which would lead to a open collision with the invade army in a pitched battle at this juncture of affair just as the federal army be concentrate near frederick general hooker at he own request be relieve from command the occasion of this unexpected event seem to have be a difference of opinion between himself and general halleck the federal general-in-chief on the question whether the fortification at harper 's ferry should or should not be abandon the point at issue would appear to have be unimportant but ill feeling seem to have arise : general hooker resent the action of the authority and request to be relieve he request be comply with and he place be fill by major-general george g meade -lrb- illustration : map -- sketch of the country around gettysburg -rrb- general meade a officer of excellent soldiership and enjoy the repute of modesty and dignity assume command of the federal army and proceed rapidly in pursuit of lee the design of move directly across the south mountain on lee 's communication if ever entertain by he be abandon the outcry from pennsylvanium draw he perforce ewell with one division have penetrate to carlisle and early with another division be at york everywhere the horse cattle and supplies of the country have be seize upon for the use of the troops and general meade be loudly call upon to go to the assistance of the people thus expose to the terrible rebel he movement be rapid assume command on June 28th he begin to move on the 29th and on the 30th be approach the town of gettysburg -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the movement of the federal commander be probably hasten by the capture about this time at hagerstown of a dispatch from president davi to general lee lee it seem have suggest that general beauregard should be send to make a demonstration in the direction of culpepper and by thus appear to threaten washington embarrass the movement of the northern army to this suggestion the president be say to have reply that he have no troops to make such a movement and general meade have thus the proof before he that washington be in no danger the confederacy be thus truly unfortunate again as in September 1862 when a similar incident come to the relief of general mcclellan -rrb- xiii lee in pennsylvanium lee in personal command of the corps of hill and longstreet have meanwhile move on steadily in the direction of the susquehanna and reach chambersburg on the 27th of June make preparation to advance upon harrisburg at chambersburg he issue a order to the troops which should find a place in every biography of this great soldier the course pursue by many of the federal commander in virginium have be merciless and atrocious beyond word general pope have ravage the county north of the rappahannock especially the county of culpepper in a manner which reduce that smile region wellnigh to a waste general milroy with he headquarters at winchester have so cruelly oppress the people of the surrounding country as to make they execrate the very mention of he name and the excess commit by the troops of these officer with the knowledge and permission of they commander have be such say a foreign writer as to cast mankind two century back toward barbarism now the table be turn and the world look for a sudden and merciless retaliation on the part of the southerner lee be in pennsylvanium at the head of a army thirst to revenge the accumulate wrong against they helpless family at a word from he the fertile territory of the north would be make to feel the iron pressure of military rule proceeding on the theory that retaliation be a just principle to adopt toward a enemy fire slaughter and outrage would have burst upon pennsylvanium and the black flag which have be virtually raise by general pope and milroy would have flaunt now in the air at the head of the southern army instead of permit this disgraceful oppression of non-combatant lee issue at chambersburg the follow general order to he troops : headquarters army of northern virginium chambersburg pa _ June _ 27 1863 the commanding general have observe with much satisfaction the conduct of the troops on the march and confidently anticipate result commensurate with the high spirit they have manifest no troops could have display greater fortitude or better perform the arduous march of the past ten day they conduct in other respects have with few exception be in keep with they character as soldier and entitle they to approbation and praise there have however be instance of forgetfulness on the part of some that they have in keep the yet unsullied reputation of the army and that the duty exact of we by civilization and christianity be not less obligatory in the country of the enemy than in we own the commanding general consider that no greater disgrace could befall the army and through it we whole people than the perpetration of the barbarous outrage on the innocent and defenceless and the wanton destruction of private property that have mark the course of the enemy in we own country such proceedings not only disgrace the perpetrator and all connect with they but be subversive of the discipline and efficiency of the army and destructive of the end of we present movement it must be remember that we make war only upon armed man and that we can not take vengeance for the wrong we people have suffer without lower ourselves in the eye of all whose abhorrence have be excite by the atrocity of we enemy without offend against he to whom vengeance belongeth without whose favor and support we effort must all prove in vain the commanding general therefore earnestly exhort the troops to abstain with most scrupulous care from unnecessary or wanton injury to private property and he enjoin upon all officer to arrest and bring to summary punishment all who shall in any way offend against the order on this subject re lee _ general _ the noble maxim and truly christian spirit of this paper will remain the undying glory of lee under what have be surely a bitter provocation he retain the calmness and forbearance of a great soul say to he army : the duty exact of we by civilization and christianity be not less obligatory in the country of the enemy than in we own no greater disgrace could befall the army and through it we whole people than the perpetration of outrage upon the innocent and defenceless we make war only upon armed man and can not take vengeance for the wrong we people have suffer without offend against he to whom vengeance belongeth without whose favor and support we effort must all prove in vain such be the utterance of lee resemble those we might attribute to the ideal christian warrior and indeed it be such a spirit that lay under the plain uniform of the great virginian what he order be enforce and no one be disturb in he person or property of this statement many proof could be give a pennsylvanium farmer say to a northern correspondent in reference to the southern troops : i must say they act like gentleman and they cause aside i would rather have forty thousand rebel quarter on my premise than one thousand union troops from the journal of colonel freemantle a english officer accompany the southern army we take these sentence : in pass through greencastle we find all the house and window shut up the native in they Sunday clothes stand at they door regard the troops in a very unfriendly manner i see no straggling into the house nor be any of the inhabitant disturb or annoy by the soldier sentry be place at the door of many of the best house to prevent any officer or soldier from get in on any pretence i enter chambersburg at 6 pm sentry be place at the door of all the principal house and the town be clear of all but the military pass through or on duty no officer or soldier under the rank of a general be allow in chambersburg without a special order from general lee which he be very chary of give and i hear of officer of rank be refuse this pass i go into chambersburg again and witness the singularly good behavior of the troops toward the citizen i hear soldier say to one another that they do not like be in a town in which they be very naturally detest to any one who have see as i have the ravages of the northern troops in southern town this forbearance seem most commendable and surprising a northern correspondent say of the course pursue by general jenkin in command of ewell 's cavalry : by way of give the devil he due it must be say that although there be over sixty acre of wheat and eighty acre of corn and oats in the same field he protect it most carefully and picket he horse so that it could not be injure no fence be wantonly destroy poultry be not disturb nor do he compliment we blood cattle so much as to test the quality of they steak and roast of the feeling of the troops these few word from the letter of a officer write to one of he family will convey a idea : i feel when i first come here that i would like to revenge myself upon these people for the devastation they have bring upon we own beautiful home -- that home where we could have live so happily and that we love so much from which they vandalism have drive you and my helpless little one but though i have such severe wrong and grievance to redress and such great cause for revenge yet when i get among these people i could not find it in my heart to molest they such be the treatment of the people of pennsylvanium by the southern troops in obedience to the order of the commander-in-chief lee in person set the example a southern journal make the sarcastic statement that he become irate at the rob of cherry-tree and if he see the _ top rail _ of a fence lie upon the ground as he ride by would dismount and replace it with he own hand xiv concentration at gettysburg this be the position of the great adversary in the last day of June lee be at chambersburg in the cumberland valley about to follow ewell who be approach harrisburg early have capture york and the federal army be concentrate rapidly on the flank of the southern army toward gettysburg lee have order the movement of early upon york with the object of divert the attention of the federal commander from he own rear in the cumberland valley the exact movement and position of general meade be unknown to he and this arise in large measure from the absence of stuart 's cavalry this unfortunate incident have give rise to much comment and stuart have be harshly criticise for a alleged disobedience of lee 's plain order the question be a embarrassing one lee 's statement be as follow : general stuart be leave to guard the pass of the mountain -lrb- ashby 's and other gap in the blue ridge in virginium -rrb- and observe the movement of the enemy whom he be instruct to harass and impede as much as possible should he attempt to cross the potomac _ in that event general stuart be direct to move into maryland cross the potomac east or west of the blue ridge as in he judgment should be best and take position on the right of we column as it advance _ this order be certainly plain up to a certain point stuart be to harass and embarrass the movement of the enemy in case they attempt to cross to the north bank of the potomac when they do cross he also be to pass the river either east or west of the blue ridge as in he judgment should seem best so far the order be unmistakable the river be to be cross at such point as stuart should select either on the lower water or in the valley lee add however that this movement should be make in such a manner as to enable stuart to take position on the right of we column as it advance -- the meaning appear to be that the cavalry should move _ between _ the two army in order to guard the southern flank as it advance into the cumberland valley circumstance arise however which render it difficult for stuart to move on the line thus indicate with sufficient promptness to render he service valuable the enemy cross at leesburg while the southern cavalry be near middleburg and from the jaded condition of he horse stuart fear that he would be unable in case he cross above to place he column between the two army then rapidly advance he accordingly take the bold resolution of pass the potomac _ below _ leesburg design to shape he course due northward toward harrisburg the objective point of the southern army this he do -- cross at seneca fall -- but on the march he be delay by many incident near rockville he stop to capture a large train of federal wagon at westminster and hanovertown he be temporarily arrest by combat with the federal cavalry and ignorant as he be of the concentration of lee 's troops upon gettysburg he advance rapidly toward carlisle where in the midst of a attack on that place he be recall by lee such be the circumstance lead to and the incident attend this movement the reader must form he own opinion of the amount of blame to be justly attach to stuart he always declare and assert in he report of these occurrence that he have act in exact obedience to he order but on the contrary as appear from general lee 's report those order be mean to prescribe a different movement he have march in one sense on the right of the southern column as it advance but in another sense he have not do so victory at gettysburg would have silence all criticism of this difference of construction but unfortunately the event be different and the stricture direct at stuart be natural the absence of the cavalry unquestionably embarrassed lee greatly but in he report he be moderate and guard as usual in he expression the absence of cavalry he say render it impossible to obtain accurate information of general meade 's movement and the march toward gettysburg be conduct more slowly than it would have be have the movement of the federal army be know -lrb- illustration : map -- battle of gettysburg -rrb- to return now to the movement of lee 's infantry after the arrival of the main body at chambersburg lee be about to continue he advance in the direction of harrisburg when on the night of the 29th he scout bring he intelligence that the federal army be rapidly advance and the head of the column be near the south mountain a glance at the map will indicate the importance of this intelligence general meade would be able without difficulty in case the southern army continue its march northward to cross the south-mountain range and place himself directly in lee 's rear in the cumberland valley then the southern force would be completely intercept -- general meade would be master of the situation -- and lee must retreat east of the mountain or cut he way through the federal army a battle be thus clearly about to be force upon the southern commander and it only remain for he to so maneuver he army as to secure a position in which he could receive the enemy 's attack with advantage lee accordingly put he column in motion across the mountain toward gettysburg and send courier to ewell and early to return from harrisburg and york toward the same point make he preparation to take position and fight on the morning of the 1st day of July this be then the condition of affair general meade be advance with rapidity upon the town of gettysburg and lee be cross the south mountain opposite chambersburg to meet he when the head of the two column come together in the vicinity of gettysburg the thunder of battle begin xv the first day 's fight at gettysburg the sanguinary struggle which now ensue between the army of northern virginium and the army of the potomac continue for three day and the character of these battle together with they decisive result have communicate to the event a extraordinary interest every fact have thus be preserve and the incident of the great combat down to the most minute detail have be place upon record the subject be indeed almost embarrass by the amount of information collect and publish and the chief difficulty for a writer at this late day be to select from the mass such salient event as indicate clearly the character of the conflict this difficulty the present writer have it in he power to evade in great measure by confine himself mainly to the design and operation of general lee these be plain and simple he have be force to relinquish he march toward the susquehanna by the dangerous position of general meade so near he line of retreat this render a battle unavoidable and lee be now move to accept battle design if possible to secure such a position as would give he the advantage in the contest before he succeed in effect this object battle be force upon he -- not by general meade but by simple stress of circumstance the federal commander have form the same intention as that of he adversary -- to accept and not deliver battle -- and do not propose to fight near gettysburg he be rather look backward to a strong position in the direction of westminster when suddenly the head of he column become engage near gettysburg and this determine every thing a few word be necessary to convey to the reader some idea of the character of the ground gettysburg be a town nestle down in a valley with so many road centre in the place that if a circle be draw around it to represent the circumference of a wheel the road would resemble the spoke a short distance south of the town be a ridge of considerable height which run north and south bend eastward in the vicinity of gettysburg and describe a curve resemble a hook from a graveyard on this high ground it be call cemetery hill or ridge opposite this ridge look westward be a second and lower range call seminary ridge this extend also north and south pass west of gettysburg still west of seminary ridge be other still lower range between which flow a small stream call willoughby run and beyond these distant about ten mile rise the blue height of the south mountain across the south mountain by way of the village of cashtown lee on the morning of the 1st of July be move steadily toward gettysburg when hill hold the front suddenly encounter the head of the enemy 's column in the vicinity of willoughby run this consist of general buford 's cavalry division which have push on in advance of general reynold 's infantry corps the foremost infantry of the federal army and now almost before it be aware of hill 's presence become engage with he general buford post he horse-artillery to meet hill 's attack but it soon become obvious that the federal cavalry could not stand before the southern infantry fire and general reynold at about ten in the morning hasten forward reach the field a engagement immediately take place between the foremost infantry division of hill and reynold a brigade of hill 's from mississippus drive back a federal brigade seize upon its artillery but in return archer 's brigade be nearly surround and several hundred of the man capture almost immediately after this incident the federal force sustain a serious loss general reynold -- one of the most trust and energetic lieutenant of general meade -- be mortally wound while dispose he man for action and bear from the field the federal troops continue however to fight with gallantry some of the man be hear exclaim we have come to stay in reference to which one of they officer afterward say and a very large portion of they never leave that ground -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : general doubleday : report of committee on the conduct of the war part i p 307 -rrb- battle be now join in earnest between the two head of column and on each side reënforcements be send forward to take part in this unexpected encounter neither general lee nor general meade have expect or desire it both have aim in manoeuvre they force to select ground suitable for receive instead of make a attack and now a blind chance seem about to bring on a battle upon ground unknown to both commander when the sound of the engagement be first hear by lee he be in the rear of he troops at the headquarters which hill have just vacate near cashtown under the south mountain the firing be naturally suppose by he to indicate a accidental collision with some body of the enemy 's cavalry and when intelligence reach he that hill be engage with the federal infantry the announcement occasion he the greatest astonishment general meade 's presence so near he be a circumstance completely unknown to lee and certainly be not desire by he but a small portion of he force be up longstreet have not yet pass the mountain and the force of general ewell although that officer have promptly fall back in obedience to he order from the susquehanna be not yet in a position to take part in the engagement under these circumstance if the whole of general meade 's army have reach gettysburg directly in lee 's front the advantage in the approach action must be largely in favor of the federal army and a battle might result in a decisive confederate defeat no choice however be now leave general lee the head of he advance column have come into collision with the enemy and it be impossible to retire without a battle lee accordingly order hill 's corps to be close up and reënforcements to be send forward rapidly to the point of action he then mount he horse and ride in the direction of the firing guide by the sound and the smoke which rise above the tranquil landscape it be a beautiful day and a beautiful season of the year the field be green with grass or golden with ripening grain over which pass a gentle breeze raise wave upon the brilliant surface the landscape be break here and there by wood in the west rise the blue range of the south mountain the sun be shine through showery cloud and in the east the sky be span by a rainbow this peaceful scene be now disturb by the thundering of artillery and the rattle of musketry the sky be darken here and there by cloud of smoke rise from barn or dwelling-houses set on fire by shell and beneath rise red tongue of flame roaring in response to the gun each side have now send forward reinforcement to support the vanguard and a obstinate struggle ensue the proportion of the fight gradually increase until the action become a regular battle hill although suffer from indisposition which the pallor of he face indicate meet the federal attack with he habitual resolution he be hard press however when fortunately one of general ewell 's division under rode débouched from the carlisle road run northward from gettysburg and come to he assistance ewell have just begin to move from carlisle toward harrisburg -- he second division under early being at york -- when a dispatch from lee reach he direct he to return and proceed to gettysburg or cashtown as he circumstance might direct he promptly obey encamp within about eight mile of gettysburg on the evening of the 30th and be now move toward cashtown where johnson 's division of he corps then be when hill send he word that he need he assistance rode be promptly send forward to the field of action early be order to hurry back and rodes soon reach the battle-field where he form he line on high ground opposite the federal right the appearance of this important reënforcement relieved hill and cause the enemy to extend he right to face rode the federal line thus resemble a crescent the left half fronting hill toward the northwest and the right half-fronting rode toward the north -- the town of gettysburg be in rear of the curve a obstinate attack be make by the enemy and by rode at nearly the same moment the loss on both side be heavy but rode succeed in shake the federal right when early make he appearance from the direction of york this compel the federal force to still farther extend its right to meet the new attack the movement greatly weaken they rode charge they center with impetuosity early come in on they right with gordon 's brigade in front and under this combined attack the federal troops give way and retreat in great disorder to and through gettysburg leave the ground cover with they dead and wound to the number of about five thousand and the same number of prisoner in the hand of the confederate the first collision of the two army have thus result in a clear southern victory and it be to be regret that this important success be not follow up by the seizure of the cemetery range south of the town which it be in the power of the southern force at that time to do to whom the blame -- if blame there be -- of this failure be justly chargeable the writer of these page be unable to state all that he have be able to ascertain with certainty be the following : as soon as the federal force give way general lee ride forward and at about four o'clock in the afternoon be post on a elevated point of seminary ridge from which he could see the broken line of the enemy rapidly retreat up the slope of cemetery range in he front the propriety of pursuit with a view to seize this strong position be obvious and general lee send a officer of he staff with a message to general ewell to the effect that he could see the enemy fly that they be disorganize and that it be only necessary to push on vigorously and the cemetery height be ours -lrb- footnote : the officer who carry the order be we authority for this statement -rrb- just about the moment it would seem when this order be dispatch -- about half-past four -- general hill who have join lee on the ridge receive a message from general ewell request he -lrb- hill -rrb- to press the enemy in front while he perform the same operation on he right this statement be take from the journal of colonel freemantle who be present and note the hour he add : the pressure be accordingly apply in a mild degree but the enemy be too strongly post and it be too late in the evening for a regular attack general ewell a officer of great courage and energy be say to have await the arrival of he third division -lrb- johnson 's -rrb- before make a decisive assault upon the arrival of johnson about sunset general ewell prepare to advance and seize upon the eastern terminus of the cemetery range which command the subsequent federal position at this moment general lee send he word to proceed with he troops to the -lrb- confederate -rrb- right in case he could do nothing where he be he proceed to general lee 's tent thereupon to confer with he and the result be that it be agree to first assault the hill on the right it be now however after midnight and the attack be direct by lee to be defer until the next morning it be certainly unfortunate that the advance be not then make but lee in he report attribute no blame to any one the attack he say be not press that afternoon _ the enemy 's force be unknown and it be consider advisable to await the arrival of the rest of we troops _ the failure to press the enemy immediately after they retreat with the view of drive they from and occupy cemetery height be susceptible of a explanation which seem to retrieve the southern commander and he subordinate from serious criticism the federal force have be drive from the ground north and west of gettysburg but it be see now that the troops thus defeat constitute only a small portion of general meade 's army and lee have no means of ascertain with any degree of certainty that the main body be not near at hand the fact be not improbable and it be not know that cemetery hill be not then in they possession the wooded character of the ground render it difficult for general lee even from he elevated position on seminary ridge to discover whether the height opposite be or be not hold by a strong force infantry be visible there and in the plain in front the cavalry of general buford be draw up as though ready to accept battle it be not until after the battle that it be know that the height might have be seize upon -- general hancock who have succeed reynold have to defend they but a single brigade this fact be not know to lee the sun be now decline and the advance upon cemetery hill be defer until the next day when on the next morning between daybreak and sunrise general lee accompany by hill longstreet and hood ascend to the same point on seminary ridge and reconnoitr the opposite height through he field-glass they be see to be occupy by heavy line of infantry and numerous artillery the moment have pass the rampart in he front bristle with bayonet and cannon general hancock in command of the federal advance have hasten back at nightfall to general meade who be still some distance in rear and report the position to be a excellent one for receive the southern attack upon this information general meade have at once act by one o'clock in the morning he headquarters be establish upon the ridge and when lee on seminary hill opposite be reconnoitr the height the great bulk of the federal army be in position to receive he assault the adversary be thus face to face and a battle could not well be avoid lee and he troops be in high spirit and confident of victory but every advantage of position be see to be on the side of the enemy xvi the two army in position the morning of the 2d of July have arrive and the two army be in presence of each other and ready for battle the question be which of the great adversary would make the attack general meade be as averse to assume the offensive as he opponent lee 's statement on this subject have be give but be here repeat : it have not be intend to fight a general battle he write at such a distance from we base _ unless attack by the enemy _ general meade say before the war committee afterward it be my desire to fight a defensive rather than a offensive battle and he add the obvious explanation that he be satisfied he chance of success be greater in a defensive battle than a offensive one there be this great advantage however on the federal side that the troops be on they own soil with they communication uninterrupted and could wait while general lee be in hostile territory a considerable distance from he base of supplies and must for that reason either attack he adversary or retreat he decide to attack to this decision he seem to have be impel in large measure by the extraordinary spirit of he troops whose demeanor in the subsequent struggle be say by a federal officer to resemble that of man drunk on champagne general longstreet describe the army at this moment as able from the singular afflatus which bear it up to undertake any thing and this sanguine spirit be the natural result of a nearly unbroken series of victory at fredericksburg chancellorsville and in the preliminary struggle of gettysburg they have drive the enemy before they in disorder and on the night succeed this last victory both officer and man speak of the coming battle as a certainty and the universal feeling in the army be one of profound contempt for a enemy whom they have beat so constantly and under so many disadvantage -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : colonel freemantle he be present and speak from observation -rrb- contempt of a adversary be dangerous and pride go before a fall the truth of these pithy adage be now about to be show general lee it be say share the general confidence of he troops and be carry away by it he say in he report find ourselves unexpectedly confront by the federal army it become a matter of difficulty to withdraw through the mountain with we large train at the same time the country be unfavorable for collect supplies while in the presence of the enemy 's main body as he be enable to restrain we foraging-party by occupy the pass of the mountain with regular and local troops a battle thus become in a measure unavoidable but even after the battle when the southern army be much weaker it be find possible without much difficulty to withdraw through the mountain with the train a stronger motive than this be state in the next sentence of general lee 's report : _ encourage by the successful issue of the engagement of the first day and in view of the valuable result that would ensue from the defeat of the army of general meade _ it be think advisable to renew the attack the meaning of the writer of these word be plain the federal troops have be defeat with little difficulty in the first day 's fight it seem probable that a more serious conflict would have similar result and a decisive victory promise to end the war general meade it seem scarcely expect to be attack he anticipate a movement on lee 's part over the emmetsburg road southward -lrb- footnote : testimony of general meade before the war committee -rrb- by give that direction to he army general lee would have force he adversary to retire from he strong position on cemetery hill or come out and attack he whether however it be desirable on general lee 's part to run the risk of such a attack on the southern column _ in transitu _ it be leave to other better able than the present writer to determine this unskilled comment must pass for what it be worth it be easy after the event for the smallest to criticise the greatest under whatever influence general lee determine not to retreat either through the south mountain or toward emmetsburg but marshal he army for a attack on the position hold by general meade the southern line be draw up on seminary ridge and on the ground near gettysburg longstreet 's corps be post on the right opposite the federal leave near the southern end of cemetery ridge next come hill 's corps extend along the crest nearly to gettysburg there it be join by ewell 's line which pass through the town bent round adapt itself to the position of the federal right which hold the high ground curve round in the shape of a hook at the north end of the ridge the federal line thus occupy the whole cemetery range -- which be higher command seminary ridge -- and consist count from right to left of the troops of general howard hancock sickle syke and sedgwick the two latter form a strong reserve to guard the federal leave the position be powerful as both flank rest upon high ground which give every advantage to the assail party but on the federal leave a accidental error it seem have be commit by general sickle he have advance he line to a ridge in front of the main range which appear to afford he a better position but this make it necessary to retire the left wing of he corps to cover the opening in that direction the result be a angle -- the effect of which be to expose troops to serious danger -- and this faulty disposition of the federal left seem to have induce general lee to direct he main attack at the point in question with the view of break the federal line and seize upon the main ridge in rear in front of general longstreet he say the enemy hold a position from which if he could be drive it be think that we army could be use to advantage in assail the more elevated ground beyond in order to coöperate in this the main attack ewell be order at the same time to assail the federal right toward gettysburg and hill direct to threaten they center and if there be a opening make a real attack these demonstration against the enemy 's right and center lee anticipate would prevent he from reënforcing he left longstreet would thus he hope be enable to reach the west of the ridge in rear of the federal line and general meade afterward say if they have succeed in occupy that it would have prevent I from hold any of the ground which i subsequently hold at the last -- that be to say that he would have be drive from the entire cemetery range such be the position of the two adversary and such the design of lee on the 2d of July when the real struggle be about to begin xvii the second day throughout the forenoon of the day about to witness one of those great passage of arm which throw so bloody a glare upon the page of history scarcely a sound disturbed the silence and it be difficult to believe that nearly two hundred thousand man be watch each other across the narrow valley ready at the word to advance and do they best to tear each other to piece during all these long hour when expectation and suspense be sufficient to try the stoutest nerve the two commander be marshal they line for the obstinate struggle which be plainly at hand general meade who know well the ability of he opponent be see in person to every thing and satisfy himself that he line be in order to receive the attack lee be make he preparation to commence the assault upon which there could be little doubt the event of the whole war depend from the gallantry which the federal troops display in this battle they must have be in good heart for the encounter it be certain that the southern army have never be in better condition for a decisive conflict we have speak of the extraordinary confidence of the man in themselves and in they commander this feeling now exhibit itself either in joyous laughter and the spirit of jest among the troops or in a air of utter indifference as of man sure of the result and give it scarcely a think the swarthy gunner still begrime with powder from the work of the day before lay down around the cannon in position along the crest and pass the moment in utter witticism or in slumber and the line of infantry seat or lie musket in hand be as careless the army be plainly ready and would respond with alacrity to lee 's signal of the result no human be in this force of more than seventy thousand man seem to have the least doubt lee be engage during the whole morning and until past noon in mature he preparation for the assault which he design make against the enemy 's leave in front of longstreet all be not ready until about four in the afternoon then he give the word and longstreet suddenly open a heavy artillery-fire on the position opposite he at this signal the gun of hill open from the ridge on he left and ewell 's artillery on the southern left in front of gettysburg thunder in response under cover of he cannon-fire longstreet then advance he line consist of hood 's division on the right and mclawe 's division on the left and make a headlong assault upon the federal force directly in he front the point aim at be the salient form by the projection of general sickle 's line forward to the high ground know as the peach orchard here as we have already say the federal line of battle form a angle with the left wing of sickle 's corps bend backward so as to cover the opening between he line and the main crest in he rear hood 's division swing round to assail the portion of the line thus retire and so rapid be the movement of this energetic soldier that in a short space of time he push he right beyond the federal left flank have pierce the expose point and be in direct proximity to the much-coveted crest of the ridge upon the possession of which depend the fate of the battle hood be fully aware of its importance and lose not a moment in advance to seize it he troops largely compose of those famous texa regiment which lee have say fight grandly and nobly and upon whom he rely in all tight place respond to he ardent order : a small run be cross the man rush up the slope and the crest be almost in they very grasp success at this moment would have decide the event of the battle of gettysburg and in all probability that of the war all that be need be a single brigade upon either side -- a force sufficient to seize the crest for neither side hold it -- and with this brigade a rare good fortune or rather the prompt energy of a single officer accord to northern historian supply the federal commander hood 's line be rush up with cheer to occupy the crest which here take the form of a separate peak and be know as little round top when general warren chief-engineer of the army who be pass see the importance of the position and determine at all hazard to defend it he accordingly order the federal signal-party which have use the peak as a signal-station but be hastily folding up they flag to remain where they be lay violent hand upon a brigade which be pass and order it to occupy the crest and when hood 's man rush up the rocky slope with yell of triumph they be suddenly meet by a fusillade from the newly-arrived brigade deliver full in they face a violent struggle ensue for the possession of the height the man fight hand to hand on the summit and the issue remain for some time doubtful at last it be decide in favor of the federal troops who succeed in drive hood 's man from the hill the summit of which be speedily crown with artillery which open a destructive fire upon the retreat southerner they fall back sullenly leave the ground strew with they dead and wounded hood have be wound and many of he best officer have fall for a instant he have grasp in he strong hand the prize which would have be worth ten time the amount of blood shed but he have be unable to retain he hold he be fall back from the coveted crest pursue by that roar of the enemy 's cannon which seem to rejoice in he discomfiture a obstinate struggle be meanwhile take place in the vicinity of the peach orchard where the left of hood and the division of mclaw have strike the front of general sickle and be now press he line back steadily toward the ridge in he rear in spite of resolute resistance the federal troops at this point be push back to a wheat-field in the rear of the peach orchard and follow up this advantage longstreet charge they and break they line which fall back in disorder toward the high ground in rear in this attack mclaw be assist by hill 's right division -- that of anderson with this force longstreet continue to press forward and pierce the federal line seem about to inflict upon they a great disaster by seize the commanding position occupy by the federal left nothing appear to have save they at this moment from decisive defeat but the masterly concentration of reënforcements after reënforcements at the point of danger the heavy reserve under general syke and sedgwick be opposite this point and other troops be hasten forward to oppose longstreet this reënforcement be continuous throughout the entire afternoon in spite of lee 's demonstration in other quarter to direct attention general meade -- drive by necessity -- continue to move fresh troops incessantly to protect he left and success finally come as the reward of he energy and soldiership longstreet find he weary troops meet at every new step in advance by fresh line and as night have now come he discontinue the attack the federal line have be drive considerably beyond the point which they have hold before the assault and be now east of the wheat-field where some of the hardest fighting of the day have take place but in spite of this loss of ground they have suffer no serious disaster and above all lee have not seize upon that crest of the ridge which be the keystone of the position thus longstreet 's attack have be neither a success nor a failure he have not accomplish all that be expect but he have drive back the enemy from they advanced position and hold strong ground in they front a continuance of the assault be therefore defer until the next day -- night have now come -- and general longstreet order the advance to cease and the firing to be discontinue during the action on the right hill have continue to make heavy demonstration on the federal center and ewell have meet with excellent success in the attack direct by lee to be make against the enemy 's right this be post upon the semicircular eminence a little southeast of gettysburg and the federal work be attack by ewell about sunset with early 's division on he right and johnson 's on he left ewell advance across the open ground in face of a heavy artillery-fire the man rush up the slope and in a brief space of time the federal artillerist and infantry be drive from the work which at nightfall remain in ewell 's hand such have be the fate of the second struggle around gettysburg the moon which rise just as the fight terminate throw its ghastly glare upon a field where neither side have achieve full success lee have not fail and he have not succeed he have aim to drive the federal force from the cemetery range and have not be able to effect that object but they have be force back upon both they right and leave and a substantial advantage seem thus to have be gain that the confederate success be not complete seem to have result from the failure to seize the round-top hill the crisis of the battle have undoubtedly be the moment when hood be so near capture this position -- in reference to the importance of which we quote general meade 's own word it be save to the federal army by the presence of mind it seem of a single officer and the gallantry of a single brigade such be the singular chance of battle in which the smallest cause so often effect the greatest result general lee in company with general hill have during the battle occupy he former position on seminary ridge near the center of he line -- quietly seat for the greater portion of the time upon the stump of a tree and look thoughtfully toward the opposite height which longstreet be endeavor to storm he demeanor be entirely calm and compose a observer would not have conclude that he be the commander-in-chief from time to time he raise he field-glass to he eye and rise say a few word to general hill or general long of he staff after this brief colloquy he would return to he seat on the stump and continue to direct he glass toward the wooded height hold by the enemy a notable circumstance and one often observe upon other occasion be that during the entire action he scarcely send a order during the time longstreet be engage -- from about half-past four until night -- he send but one message and receive but one report have give full direction to he able lieutenant and inform they of the object which he desire to attain he on this occasion as upon other leave the execution of he order to they rely upon they judgment and ability a singular incident occur at this moment which must have divert lee temporarily from he abstracted mood in the midst of the most furious part of the cannonade when the air be fill with explode shell a confederate band of music between the opposing line just below general lee 's position begin defiantly play polka and waltz on they instrument the incident be strange in the midst of such a hurly-burly the bloody battle-field seem turn into a ballroom with nightfall the firing sink to silence the moon have rise and the pale light now light up the face of the dead and wound of both side lee 's first great assault have fail to secure the full result which he have anticipate from it xviii the last charge at gettysburg the weird hour of the moonlit night succeed the second day at gettysburg witness a consultation between lee and he principal officer as to the propriety of renew the attack on the federal position or fall back in the direction of the potomac in favor of the latter course there seem to be many good reason the supplies both of provision and ammunition be run short the army although unshaken have lose heavily in the obstinately-disputed attack in the event of defeat now its situation might become perilous and the destruction of the army of northern virginium be likely to prove that of the southern cause on the other hand the result of the day 's fight if not decisive have be highly encourage on both the federal wing the confederate have gain ground which they still hold longstreet 's line be in advance of the peach orchard hold by the enemy on the morning of the second and ewell be still root firmly it seem in they work near gettysburg these advantage be certainly considerable and promise success to the southern arm if the assault be renew but the most weighty consideration prompt a renewal of the attack be the condition of the troops they be undismayed and unshaken either in spirit or efficiency and be know both to expect and to desire a resumption of the assault even after the subsequent charge of pickett which result so disastrously the ragged infantry be hear exclaim : we have not lose confidence in the old man this day 's work will not do he no harm uncle robert will get we into washington yet add to this the fact that the issue of the second day have stir up in lee himself all the martial ardor of he nature and there never live a more thorough _ soldier _ when he be fully arouse than the virginian all this soldiership of the man revolt at the thought of retreat and abandon he great enterprise he look on the one hand at he brave army ready at the word to again advance upon the enemy -- at that enemy scarce able on the previous day to hold he position -- and weigh every circumstance in he comprehensive mind which look before and after lee determine on the next morning to try a decisive assault upon the federal troops to storm if possible the cemetery range and at one great blow terminate the campaign and the war the powerful influence which we have mention coöperating shape the decision to which lee have come he would not retreat but fight the campaign should not be abandon without at least one great charge upon the federal position and order be now give for a renewal of the attack on the next morning the general plan of attack lee say be unchanged except that one division and two brigade of hill 's corps be order to support longstreet from these word it be obvious that lee 's main aim now as on the precede day be to force back the federal left in front of longstreet and seize the high ground command the whole ridge in flank and reverse to this end longstreet be reënforced and the great assault be evidently intend to take place in that quarter but circumstance cause a alteration as will be see in lee 's plan the center thus weaken be from stress of event to become the point of decisive struggle the assault of the previous day have be direct against the two extremity of the enemy the assault of the third day which would decide the fate of the battle and the campaign be to be the furious rush of pickett 's division of virginian troops at the enemy 's center on cemetery hill a preliminary conflict bring on by the federal commander take place early in the morning ewell have continue throughout the night to hold the enemy 's breastwork on they right from which he have drive they in the evening as dawn approach now he be about to resume the attack and in obedience to lee 's order attempt to dislodge the enemy from other part of the ridge when general meade take the initiative and open upon he a furious fire of cannon which be follow by a determine infantry charge to regain the hill ewell hold he ground with the obstinate nerve which characterize he and the battle rage about four hour -- that be until about eight o'clock at that time however the pressure of the enemy become too heavy to stand general meade succeed in drive ewell from the hill and the federal line be reëstablished on the commanding ground which they have previously occupy this event probably derange in some degree general lee 's plan which contemplate as we have see a attack by ewell contemporaneous with the main assault by longstreet ewell be in no condition at this moment to assume the offensive again and the pause in the fighting appear to have induce general lee to reflect and modify he plan throughout the hour succeed the morning 's struggle lee attend by general hill and longstreet and they staff-officer ride along the line reconnoitr the opposite height and the cavalcade be more than once salute by bullet from the enemy 's sharp-shooter and a occasional shell the result of the reconnoissance seem to have be the conclusion that the federal left -- now strengthen by breastwork behind which powerful reserve lay wait -- be not a favorable point for attack general meade no doubt expect a assault there and arouse to a sense of he danger by the confederate success of the previous day have make every preparation to meet a renewal of the movement the confederate left and center remain but it seem injudicious to think of attack from ewell 's position a concentration of the southern force there would result in a dangerous separation of the two wing of the army and in the event of failure the enemy would have no difficulty in descend and turn lee 's right flank and thus interpose between he and the potomac the center only be leave and to this lee now turn he attention a determine rush with a strong column at cemetery hill in he front might wrest that point from the enemy then they line would be pierce the army would follow lee would be root on this commanding ground directly between the two federal wing upon which they own gun might be turn and the defeat of general meade must certainly follow such be doubtless the reflection of general lee as he ride along the seminary range scanning through he field-glass the line of the federal work he decision be make and order be give by he to prepare the column for the assault for the hard work at hand pickett 's division of virginian troops which have just arrive and be fresh be select these be to be support by heth 's division of north carolina troops under general pettigrew who be to move on pickett 's left and a brigade of hill 's under general wilcox be to cover the right of the advance column and protect it from a flank attack the advance of the charge column be precede by a tremendous artillery-fire direct from seminary ridge at the enemy 's left and center this begin about a hour past noon and the amount of thunder thus unloose will be understand from the statement that lee employ one hundred and forty-five piece of artillery and the enemy reply with eighty -- in all _ two hundred and twenty-five _ gun all discharging at the same time for nearly two hour this frightful hurly-burly continue the harsh roar reverberate ominously in the gorge of the hill and throw back in crash after crash from the rocky slope of the two ridge to describe this fire afterward the cool soldier general hancock could find no other but the word _ terrific _ they artillery-fire he say be the most terrific cannonade i ever witness and the most prolonged it be a most terrific and appalling cannonade -- one possibly hardly ever parallel while this artillery-duel be in progress the charge column be be form on the west of seminary ridge opposite the federal center on cemetery hill pickett draw up he line with kemper 's and garnett 's brigade in front and armistead 's brigade in rear the brigade under general wilcox take position on the right and on the left be place the division under pettigrew which be to participate in the charge the force number between twelve and fifteen thousand man but as will be see nearly in the beginning of the action pickett be leave alone and thus he force of about five thousand be all that go forward to pierce the center of the federal army the oppose ridge at this point be about one mile asunder and across this space pickett move at the word he line advance slowly and perfectly dress with its red battle-flag fly and the sunshine dart from the gun-barrel and bayonet the two army be silent concentrate they whole attention upon this slow and ominous advance of man who seem in no haste and resolve to allow nothing to arrest they when the column have reach a point about midway between the oppose height the federal artillery suddenly open a furious fire upon they which inflict considerable loss this however have no effect upon the troops who continue to advance slowly in the same excellent order without exhibit any desire to return the fire it be impossible to witness this steady and well-ordered march under heavy fire without feel admiration for the soldiership of the troops who make it where shell tear gap in the rank the man quietly close up and the hostile front advance in the same ominous silence toward the slope where the real struggle all feel would soon begin they be within a few hundred yard of the hill when suddenly a rapid cannon-fire thunder on they right and shell and canister from nearly fifty piece of artillery sweep the southern line enfilade it and for a instant throw the right into some disorder this disappear at once however the column close up and continue to advance unmoved toward the height at last the moment come the steady common-time step have become quick time this have change to double-quick then the column rush headlong at the enemy 's breastwork on the slope of the hill as they do so the real thunder begin a fearful fire of musketry burst forth and strike they in the face and this hurricane scatter the raw troops of pettigrew as leaf be scatter by a wind that whole portion of the line give way in disorder and flee from the field which be strew with they dead and as the other support have not keep up the virginian under pickett be leave alone to breast the tempest which have now burst upon they in all its fury they return the fire from the breastwork in they front with a heavy volley and then with loud cheer dash at the enemy 's work which they reach storm and take possession of at the point of the bayonet they loss however be frightful garnett be kill armistead fall mortally wound as he leap on the breastwork cheer and wave he hat kemper be shoot and disabled and the rank of the virginian be thin to a handful the man do not however pause the enemy have partially retreat from they first line of breastwork to a second and stronger one about sixty yard beyond and near the crest and here the federal reserve as northern writer state be draw up four deep this line bristle with bayonet and cannon the virginian now charge in the desperate attempt to storm it with the bayonet and pierce in a decisive manner the center of the federal army but the work be too great for they power as they make they brave rush they be meet by a concentrated fire full in they face and on both flank at the same moment this fire do not so much cause they to lose heart as literally hurl they back before it the whole charge column seem to melt and disappear the bravest saw now that further fighting be useless -- that the work in they front could not be storm -- and with the frightful fire of the enemy still tear they line to piece the poor remnant of the brave division retreat from the hill as they fall back sullenly like bull-dog from whom they prey have be snatch just as it be in they grasp the enemy pursue they with a destructive fire both of cannon and musketry which mow down large number if large number indeed can be say to have be leave the command have be nearly annihilate three general fourteen field-officer and three-fourth of the man be dead wound or prisoner the virginian have do all that could be do by soldier they have advance undismayed into the focus of a fire unsurpassed perhaps in the annals of war have fight bayonet to bayonet have leave the ground strew with they dead and the small remnant who survive be now sullenly retire unsubdued and if repulse not whip such be the last great charge at gettysburg lee have concentrate in it all he strength it seem when it fail the battle and the campaign fail with it -lrb- illustration : lee at gettysburg -rrb- xix lee after the charge the demeanor of general lee at this moment when he hope be all reverse and he last great blow at the enemy have fail excite the admiration of all who witness it and remain one of the greatest glory of he memory see from he place on seminary ridge the unfortunate result of the attack he mount he horse and ride forward to meet and encourage the retreat troops the air be fill with explode shell and the man be come back without order general lee now meet they and with he staff-officer busy himself in rally they utter as he do so word of hope and encouragement colonel freemantle who take particular notice of he at this moment describe he conduct as perfectly sublime lee 's countenance he add do not show sign of the slightest disappointment care or annoyance but preserve the utmost placidity and cheerfulness the hurry and confusion of the scene seem not to move he in any manner and he ride slowly to and fro say in he grave kindly voice to the man : all this will come right in the end we 'll talk it over afterward but in the mean time all good man must rally we want all good and true man just now number of wound pass he some stretch on litter which man wear the red badge of the ambulance corps be bear to the rear other limp along bleed from hurt more or less serious to the badly wound lee utter word of sympathy and kindness to those but slightly injure he say : come bind up you wound and take a musket add my friend as be he habit a evidence of he composure and absence of flurry be present by a slight incident a officer near he be strike he horse violently for become frightened and unruly at the bursting of a shell when general lee see that the horse be terrify and the punishment would do no good say in tone of friendly remonstrance : do not whip he captain do not whip he i have get just such a foolish horse myself and whipping do no good meanwhile the man continue to stream back pursue still by that triumphant roar of the enemy 's artillery which sweep the whole valley and slope of seminary ridge with shot and shell lee be everywhere encourage they and they respond by take off they hat and cheer he -- even the wound join in this ceremony although expose himself with entire indifference to the heavy fire he advise colonel freemantle as that officer state to shelter himself say : this have be a sad day for we colonel a sad day but we can not expect always to gain victory as he be thus ride about in the fringe of wood general wilcox who about the time of pickett 's repulse have advance and speedily be throw back with loss ride up and say almost sob as he speak that he brigade be nearly destroy lee hold out he hand to he as he be speak and grasp the hand of he subordinate in a friendly manner reply with great gentleness and kindness : never mind general all this have be _ my _ fault it be _ i _ who have lose this fight and you must help I out of it in the best way you can this supreme calmness and composure in the commander-in-chief rapidly communicate itself to the troops who soon get together again and lay down quietly in line of battle in the fringe of wood along the crest of the ridge where lee place they as they come up in front of they the gun use in the great cannonade be still in position and lee be evidently make every preparation in he power for the highly probable event of a instant assault upon he in he disorder condition by the enemy it be obvious that the situation of affair at the moment be such as to render such a attack highly perilous to the southern troops -- and a sudden cheer which be now hear run along the line of the enemy on the opposite height seem clearly to indicate that they force be move every preparation possible under the circumstance be make to meet the anticipated assault the repulse troops of pickett like the rest of the army be ready and even eager for of the attack -- but it do not come the cheer be afterward ascertain to have be simply the greet of the man to some one of they officer as he ride along the line and night fall without any attempt on the federal side to improve they success that success be indeed sufficient and little would have be gain and perhaps much perill by a counter-attack lee be not defeat but he have not succeed general meade could with propriety refrain from a attack the battle of gettysburg have be a federal victory thus have end the last great conflict of arm on northern soil -- in a decisive if not a crush repulse of the southern arm the chain of event have be so closely follow in the foregoing page and the movement of the two army have be describe with such detail that any further comment or illustration be unnecessary the oppose army have be handle with skill and energy the man have never fight better and the result seem to have be decide rather by a occult decree of providence than by any other circumstance the number on each side be nearly the same or differ so slightly that in view of past conflict fight with much greater odds in favor of the one side they might be regard as equal the southern army when it approach gettysburg number sixty-seven thousand bayonet and the cavalry and artillery probably make the entire force about eighty thousand general meade 's statement be that he own force be about one hundred thousand the federal loss be twenty-three thousand one hundred and ninety the southern loss be also severe but can not be ascertain they must have amount however to at least as large a number even larger perhaps as a attack army always suffer more heavily than one that be attack what be certain however be that the southern army if diminish in number and strength be still unshaken xx lee 's retreat across the potomac lee commence he retreat in the direction of the potomac on the night of the 4th of July that the movement do not begin earlier be the best proof of the continued efficiency of he army and he own willingness to accept battle if the enemy be incline to offer it after the failure of the attack on the federal center he have withdraw ewell from he position southeast of gettysburg and form a continuous line of battle on seminary ridge await the anticipated assault of general meade what the result of such a assault would have be it be impossible to say but the theory that a attack would have terminate in the certain rout of the southern army have nothing whatever to support it the _ morale _ of lee 's army be untouched the man instead of be discourage by the tremendous conflict of the precede day be irate defiant and ready to resume the struggle foreign officer present at the time testify fully upon this point describe the demeanor of the troops as all that could be desire in soldier and general longstreet afterward state that with he two division under hood and mclaw and he powerful artillery he be confident have the enemy attack of inflict upon they a blow as heavy as that which they have inflict upon pickett the testimony of general meade himself fully corroborate these statement when give he evidence afterward before the war committee he say : my opinion be now that general lee evacuate that position _ not from the fear that he would be dislodge from it by any active operation on my part _ but that he be fearful that a force would be send to harper 's ferry to cut off he communication that be what cause he to retire when ask the question do you discover after the battle of gettysburg any symptom of demoralization in lee 's army general meade reply no sir i see nothing of that kind -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : report of committee on conduct of war part i page 337 -rrb- there be indeed no good reason why general lee should feel any extreme solicitude for the safety of he army which after all its loss still number more than fifty thousand troops and with that force of veteran combatant experience tell he he could count upon hold at bay almost any force which the enemy could bring against he at chancellorsville with a less number he have nearly route a larger army than general meade 's if the _ morale _ of the man remain unbroken he have the right to feel secure now and we have show that the troops be as full of fight as ever the exclamation of the ragged infantry overhear by colonel freemantle express the sentiment of the whole army recoil from the fatal charge on cemetery hill and still follow by the terrible fire they have heart to shout defiantly : we have not lose confidence in the old man this day 's work will not do he no harm uncle robert will get we into washington yet -- you bet he will lee 's reason for retire toward the potomac be unconnected with the _ morale _ of he army the difficulty of procure supplies he say render it impossible to continue longer where we be what he especially need be ammunition he supply of which have be nearly exhaust by the three day ' fighting and it be impossible to count upon new supplies of these essential store now that the enemy be in a condition to interrupt he communication in the direction of harper 's ferry and williamsport the danger to which the army be thus expose be soon show not to have be overrate general meade promptly send a force to occupy harper 's ferry and a body of he cavalry hastening across the south mountain reach the potomac near fall water where they destroy a pontoon bridge lay there for the passage of the southern army lee accordingly resolve to retire and after remain in line of battle on seminary ridge throughout the evening and night of the 3d and the whole of the 4th during which time he be busy bury he dead begin to withdraw by the fairfield and chambersburg road on the night of this latter day the movement be deliberate and without mark of haste the rear-guard not leave the vicinity of gettysburg until the morning of the 5th those who look upon the southern army at this time can testify that the spirit of the troops be unsubdued they have be severely check but there every thing have end weary cover with dust with wound whose bandage be soak in blood the man tramp on in excellent spirit and be plainly ready to take position at the first word from lee and meet any attack of the enemy with a nerve as perfect as when they have advance for the reason state by himself general meade do not attack he have secure substantial victory by await lee 's assault on strong ground and be unwilling now to risk a disaster such as he have inflict by attack lee in position the enthusiasm of the authority at washington be not share by the cool commander of the federal army he perfectly well understand the real strength and condition of he adversary and seem never to have have any intention of striking at he unless a change of circumstance give he some better prospect of success than he could see at that time the retrograde movement of the southern army now begin lee 's train retire by way of chambersburg and he infantry over the fairfield road in the direction of hagerstown general meade at first move directly on the track of he enemy the design of a stern chase be however speedily abandon by the federal commander who change the direction of he march and move southward toward frederick when near that point he cross the south mountain go toward sharpsburg and on the 12th of July find himself in front of the southern army near williamsport where lee have form line of battle to receive he adversary 's attack the deliberate character of general meade 's movement sufficiently indicate the disinclination he feel to place himself directly in he opponent 's front and thus receive the full weight of he attack there be reason indeed to believe that nothing could better have suit the view of general meade than for lee to have pass the potomac before he arrival -- which event would have signify the entire abandonment of the campaign of invasion leave victory on the side of the federal army but the element seem to conspire to bring on a second struggle despite the reluctance of both commander the recent rain have swollen the potomac to such a degree as to render it unfordable and as the pontoon near williamsport have be destroy by the federal cavalry lee be bring to bay on the north bank of the river where on the 12th as we have say general meade find he in line of battle lee 's demeanor at this critical moment be perfectly undisturbed and exhibit no trace whatever of anxiety though he must have feel much in he rear be a swollen river and in he front a adversary who have be reënforced with a considerable body of troops and now largely outnumber he in the event of battle and defeat the situation of the southern army must be perilous in the extreme nothing would seem to be leave it in that event but surrender or dispersion among the western mountain where the detach body would be hunt down in detail and destroy or capture confidence in himself and he man remain however with general lee and with he line extend from near hagerstown to a point east of williamsport he calmly await the fall of the river resolve doubtless if in the mean time the enemy attack he to fight to the last gasp for the preservation of he army no attack be make by general meade who arrive in front of lee on the 12th do no more on that day than feel along the southern line for a point to assault on the next day he assemble a council of war and lay the question before they whether or not it be advisable to make a assault the vote of the officer be almost unanimously against it as lee 's position seem strong and the spirit of he army defiant and the day pass without any attempt of the federal army to dislodge its adversary while general meade be thus hesitate lee be act a portion of the pontoon destroy by the enemy be recover new boat be build and a practicable bridge be complete near fall water by the evening of the 13th the river have also commence fall and by this time be fordable near williamsport toward dawn on the 14th the army commence move in the midst of a violent rain-storm across the river at both point and lee sit he horse upon the river 's bank superintend the operation as be he habit on occasion of emergency loss of rest and fatigue with that feeling of suspense unavoidable under the circumstance have impair the energy of even he superb physical constitution as the bulk of the rear-guard of the army safely pass over the shaky bridge which lee have look at with some anxiety as it sway to and fro lash by the current he utter a sigh of relief and a great weight seem take from he shoulder see he fatigue and exhaustion general stuart give he some coffee he drink it with avidity and declare as he hand back the cup that nothing have ever refresh he so much when general meade who be say to have resolve on a attack in spite of the opposition of he officer look on the morning of the 14th toward the position hold on the previous evening by the southern army he see that the work be desert the army of northern virginium have vanish from the hill on which it have be post and be at that moment cross the potomac press on its track toward fall water the federal cavalry come up with the rear and in the skirmish which ensue fall the brave pettigrew who have support pickett in the great charge at gettysburg where he have wave he hat in front of he man and in spite of a painful wound do all in he power to rally he troops with this exception and a few capture result from accident the army sustain no loss the movement across the potomac have be effect in face of the whole federal army as successfully as though that army have be a hundred mile distant -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : upon this point different statement be subsequently make by general lee and meade and lee 's reply to the statement of he opponent be here give : headquarters army northern virginium _ July 21 1863 _ _ general s cooper adjutant and inspector-general csa richmond va _ : general : i have see in northern papers what purported to be a official dispatch from general meade state that he have capture a brigade of infantry two piece of artillery two caisson and a large number of small-arm as this army retire to the south bank of the potomac on the 13th and 14th inst this dispatch have be copy into the richmond papers and as its official character may cause it to be believe i desire to state that it be incorrect the enemy do not capture any organize body of man on that occasion but only straggler and such as be leave asleep on the road exhaust by the fatigue and exposure of one of the most inclement night i have ever know at this season of the year it rain without cessation render the road by which we troops march to the bridge at fall water very difficult to pass and cause so much delay that the last of the troops do not cross the river at the bridge until 1 pm on the 14th while the column be thus detain on the road a number of man wear down by fatigue lay down in barn and by the roadside and though officer be send back to arouse they as the troops move on the darkness and rain prevent they from find all and many be in this way leave behind two gun be leave on the road the horse that draw they become exhaust and the officer go forward to procure other when they return the rear of the column have pass the gun so far that it be deem unsafe to send back for they and they be thus lose no arm cannon or prisoner be take by the enemy in battle but only such as be leave behind under the circumstance i have describe the number of straggler thus lose i be unable to state with accuracy but it be greatly exaggerate in the dispatch refer to i be with great respect you obedient servant re lee _ general _ the solicitude here exhibit by the southern commander that the actual fact should be record be natural and display lee 's spirit of soldiership he be unwilling that he old army should appear in the light of a route column retreat in disorder with loss of man and munitions when they lose neither -rrb- xxi across the blue ridge again lee move he army to the old encampment on the bank of the opequan which it have occupy after the retreat from sharpsburg in September 1862 and here a few day be spend in rest we have in the journal of a foreign officer a outline of lee 's personal appearance at this time and as we be not divert from these characteristic detail at the moment by the narrative of great event this account of lee give by the officer in question -- colonel freemantle of the british army -- be lay before the reader : general lee be almost without exception the handsomest man of he age i ever see he be tall broad-shouldered very well make well set up -- a thorough soldier in appearance -- and he manners be most courteous and full of dignity he be a perfect gentleman in every respect i imagine no man have so few enemy or be so universally esteem throughout the south all agree in pronounce he as near perfection as man can be he have none of the small vice such as smoking drinking chew or swearing and he bitterest enemy never accuse he of any of the greater one he generally wear a well-worn long gray jacket a high black-felt hat and blue trousers tuck into he wellington boot i never see he carry arm and the only mark of he military rank be the three star on he collar he ride a handsome horse which be extremely well govern he himself be very neat in he dress and person and in the most arduous march he always look smart and clean it be understand that general lee be a religious man though not so demonstrative in that respect as jackson and unlike he late brother-in-arm he be a member of the church of england he only fault so far as i can learn arise from he excessive amiability this personal description be entirely correct except that the word jacket convey a somewhat erroneous idea of lee 's undress uniform coat and he hat be generally gray otherwise the sketch be exactly accurate and be here present as the unprejudiced description and estimate of a foreign gentleman who have no inducement such as might be attribute to a southern writer to overcolor he portrait such in personal appearance be the leader of the southern army -- a plain soldier in a plain dress without arm with slight indication of rank courteous full of dignity a perfect gentleman and with no fault save a excessive amiability the figure be attractive to the eye -- it excite the admiration of a foreign officer and remain in many memory now when the sound of battle be hushed and the great leader in turn have finish he life-battle and lie down in peace the movement of the two army be soon resume and we shall briefly follow those movement which lead the adversary back to the rappahannock lee appear to have conceive the design after cross the potomac at williamsport to pass the shenandoah river and the blue ridge and thus place himself in the path of general meade if he cross east of the mountain or threaten washington this appear from he own statement owe he say to the swollen condition of _ the shenandoah river the plan of operation which have be contemplate when we recross the potomac could not be put in execution _ the point fix upon by lee for pass the mountain be probably snicker 's and ashby 's gap opposite berryville and millwood the rain have however make the river in these place unfordable on the 17th and 18th day of July less than a week after lee 's cross at williamsport general meade pass the potomac above leesburg and lee move he army in the direction of chester gap near front royal toward culpepper the new movement be almost identically the same as the old when general mcclellan advance in November 1862 and the adoption of the same plan by general meade involve a high compliment to he predecessor he act with even more energy as lee 's head of column be defile toward chester gap beyond front royal general meade strike at it through manassa gap directly on its flank and a action follow which promise at one time to become serious the enemy be however repulse and the southern column continue its way across the mountain the rest of the army follow and descend into culpepper from which position when longstreet be detach to the west lee retire take post behind the rapidan general meade thereupon follow and occupy culpepper he advance be about half-way between culpepper court-house and the river such be the position of the two army in the first day of October when lee weary it seem of inactivity set out to flank and fight he adversary part vii _ last campaign of the year _ 1863 i the cavalry of lee 's army in a work of the present description the writer have a choice between two course he may either record the event of the war in all quarter of the country as bear more or less upon he narrative or may confine himself to the life of the individual who be the immediate subject of he volume of these two course the writer prefer the latter for many reason to present a narrative of military transaction in all portion of the south would expand this volume to undue proportion and there be the further objection that these occurrence be familiar to all it might be necessary in write for person ignorant of the event of the great conflict to omit nothing but this ignorance do not probably exist in the case of the reader of these page and the writer will continue as heretofore to confine himself to the main subject only note incidentally such prominent event in other quarter as affect lee 's movement one such event be the fall of vicksburg which post surrender at the same moment with the defeat at gettysburg render thereafter impossible all movement of invasion and another be the advance of general rosecran toward atlanta which result in the month of September in a southern victory at chickamauga the immediate effect of the federal demonstration toward chattanooga have be to detach longstreet 's corps from general lee 's army for service under general bragg general meade 's force be say to have also be somewhat lessen by detachment send to enforce the draft in new york and these circumstance have in the first day of October reduce both army in virginium to a less force than they have number in the past campaign general meade however present a bold front to he adversary and with he headquarters near culpepper court-house keep close watch upon lee whose army lay along the south bank of the rapidan for some week no military movement take place and a occasional cavalry skirmish between the trooper of the two army be all which break the monotony of the autumn day this inactivity however be now about to terminate lee have resolve to attempt a flank movement around general meade 's right with the view of bring he to battle and a brief campaign ensue which if indecisive and reflect little glory upon the infantry be fruitful in romantic incident and highly creditable to the cavalry of the southern army in follow the movement and describe the operation of the main body of the army -- the infantry -- we have necessarily be compel to pass over to a great extent the service of the cavalry in the past campaign these have nevertheless be great -- no arm of the service have exhibit greater efficiency and but for the fact that in all army the brunt of battle fall upon the foot-soldier it might be add that the service of the cavalry have be as important as those of the infantry stuart be now in command of a force vary from five to eight thousand sabre and among he trooper be some of the best fighting-man of the south the cavalry have always be the favorite arm with the southern youth it have draw to itself as private in the rank thousand of young man of collegiate education great wealth and the highest social position and this force be officer in virginium by such resolute commander as wade hampton fitz lee william hf lee rosser jone wickham young munford and many other under these leader and assist by the hard-fighting stuart horse-artillery under pelham and he successor the cavalry have bear they full share in the hard march and combat of the army on the chickahominy in the march to manassa and the battle in maryland in the operation on the rappahannock and the incessant fighting of the campaign to gettysburg stuart and he trooper have vindicate they claim to the first honor of arm and if these service be not duly estimate by the infantry of the army the fact be mainly attributable to the circumstance that the fighting of the cavalry have be do at a distance upon the outpost far more than in the pitched battle where in modern time from the improve and destructive character of artillery playing havoc with horse the cavalry arm can achieve little and be not risk the actual loss in stuart 's command leave however no doubt of the obstinate soldiership of officer and man since the opening of the year he have lose general hampton cut down in a hand-to-hand sabre-fight at gettysburg general whf lee shot in the fight at fleetwood colonel frank hampton and william kill in the same action colonel butler tear by a shell major pelham chief of artillery kill while lead a charge -lrb- footnote : in this enumeration the writer mention only such name as occur at the moment to he memory a careful examination of the record of the cavalry would probably furnish the name of ten time as many equally brave and unfortunate -rrb- about six officer of he personal staff either kill wounded or capture and in the gettysburg campaign he have lose nearly one-third of he entire command of its value to the army the infantry might have they doubt but general lee have none stuart and he horseman have be the eye and ear of the army of northern virginium have fight incessantly as well as observe the enemy and lee never commit the injustice of undervalue this indispensable arm which if he official commendation of its operation under stuart be to be believe be only second in importance in he estimation to the infantry itself the army continue nevertheless to amuse itself at the expense of the cavalry and either assert or intimate on every favorable occasion that the _ real fight _ be do by themselves this flattering assumption might be natural under the circumstance but it be now about to be show to be wholly unfounded a campaign be at hand in which the cavalry be to turn the table upon they jocose critic and silence they where the infantry be doom to failure in nearly all which they attempt and the trooper be to do the greater part of the fighting and achieve the only success to the narrative of this brief and romantic episode of the war we now proceed general lee 's aim be to pass around the right flank of he adversary and bring he to battle and although the promptness of general meade 's movement defeat the last-named object nearly completely the maneuver of the two army form a highly-interesting study the eminent soldier command the force play a veritable game of chess with each other there be little hard fighting but more scientific manoeuvring than be generally display in a campaign the brain of lee and meade rather than the two army be match against each other and the conflict of idea prove more interesting than the actual fight ii lee flanks general meade in prosecution of the plan determine upon general lee on the morning of the 9th of October cross the rapidan at the ford above orange court-house with the corps of ewell and ap hill and direct he march toward madison court-house stuart move with hampton 's cavalry division on the right of the advance column -- general fitz lee have be leave with he division to guard the front on the rapidan -- and general imboden commanding west of the blue ridge be order by lee to advance down the valley and guard the gap of the mountain on we left we have say that lee 's design be to bring general meade to battle it be proper to state this distinctly as some writer have attribute to he in the campaign as he real object the design of manoeuvre he adversary out of culpepper and push he back to the federal frontier he own word be perfectly plain he set out with the design he declare of _ bring on a engagement with the federal army _ -- that be to say of _ fighting _ general meade not simply force he to fall back he opponent it seem be not averse to accept battle indeed from expression attribute to he he appear to have ardently desire it in case he could secure a advantageous position for receive the southern attack it be desirable that this readiness in both commander to fight should be keep in view the fact add largely to the interest of this brief campaign of maneuver in which the army fall back like that advance seek battle to proceed to the narrative which will deal in large measure with the operation of the cavalry -- that arm of the service as we have say have bear the chief share of the fighting and achieve the only success stuart move out on the right of the infantry which march directly toward madison court-house and near the village of jame city directly west of culpepper court-house drive in the cavalry and infantry outpost of general kilpatrick on the main body beyond the village continuous skirmishing ensue throughout the rest of the day -- stuart 's object be to occupy the enemy and divert attention from the infantry movement in he rear in this he seem to have fully succeed lee pass madison court-house and move as he say by circuitous and conceal road reach the vicinity of griffinsburg on what be call the sperryville road northwest of culpepper court-house a glance at the map will show the relative position of the two army at this moment general meade lay around culpepper court-house with he advance about half-way between that place and the rapidan and lee have attain a position which give he fair hope of intercept he adversary 's retreat that retreat must be over the line of the orange and alexandrium railroad but from griffinsburg to manassa be no farther than from culpepper court-house to the same point if the federal army fall back as lee anticipate it would be a question of speed between the retreat and pursue column and as the narrative will show the race be close -- a few hour lose make the difference between success and failure in lee 's movement on the morning of the 10th while the infantry be still near griffinsburg general stuart move promptly down upon culpepper court-house drive the enemy from they large camp near stonehouse mountain these be elaborately provide with luxury of every description and there be many indication of the fact that the troops have expect to winter there no serious fighting occur a regiment of infantry be charge and disperse by the jefferson company of captain baylor and stuart then proceed rapidly to culpepper court-house where the federal cavalry form the rear-guard of the army await he general meade be already move in the direction of the rappahannock the presence of the southern army near griffinsburg have become know to he he be at no loss to understand lee 's object and leave he cavalry to cover he rear he move toward the river as stuart attack the federal horse post on the hill east of the village the roar of cannon on he right steadily draw nearer indicate that general fitz lee be force the enemy in that direction to fall back stuart be now in high spirit and indulge in hearty laughter although the enemy 's shell be burst around he ride back to general lee he say to a officer of he staff and tell he we be force the enemy back on the rappahannock and i think i hear fitz lee 's gun toward the rapidan the officer obey and find general lee at he headquarters which consist of one or two tent with a battle-flag set up in front on the highway near griffinsburg he be converse with general ewell and the contrast between the two soldier be striking ewell be thin cadaverous and support himself upon a crutch for he have not yet recover from the wound receive at manassa general lee on the contrary be erect ruddy robust and exhibit indication of health and vigor in every detail of he person when stuart 's message be deliver to he he bow with that grave courtesy which he exhibit alike toward the highest and the lowest soldier in he army and say : thank you tell general stuart to continue to press they back toward the river he then smile and add with that accent of sedate humor which at time characterize he : but tell he too to spare he horse -- to spare he horse it be not necessary to send so many message he turn as he speak to general ewell and point to the officer who have come from stuart and another who have arrive just before he say with lurk humor : i think these two young gentleman make _ eight _ messenger send I by general stuart he then say to ewell : you may as well move on with you troops i suppose general and soon afterward the infantry begin to advance stuart be meanwhile engage in a obstinate combat with the federal cavalry near brandy in the immediate vicinity of fleetwood hill the scene of the great fight in June the stand make by the enemy be resolute but the arrival of general fitz lee decide the event that officer have cross the rapidan and drive general buford before he the result now be that while stuart be press the enemy in he front general buford come down on stuart 's rear and fitz lee on the rear of buford the scene which ensue be a grand commingling of the tragic and serio-comic every thing be mingle in wild confusion but the day remain with the southern cavalry who at nightfall have press they opponent back toward the river which the federal army cross that night blow up the railroad bridge behind they such be the first act of the bustling drama at the approach of lee general meade have vanish from culpepper and so well arrange be the whole movement in spite of its rapidity that scarce a empty box be leave behind lee 's aim to bring he adversary to battle south of the rappahannock have thus fail but the attempt be renew by a continuation of the flanking movement toward warrenton spring with the design lee say of reach the orange and alexandrium railroad north of the river and interrupt the retreat of the enemy unfortunately however for this project which require of all thing rapidity of movement it be find necessary to remain nearly all day on the 11th near culpepper court-house to supply the army with provision it be not until the 12th that the army again move stuart precede it and after a brisk skirmish drive the enemy from warrenton spring -- advance in person in front of he column as it charge through the river and up the hill beyond where a considerable body of federal marksman be put to flight the cavalry then press on toward warrenton and the infantry who have witness they prowess and cheer they heartily follow on the same road the race between lee and general meade be in full progress it be destine to become complicated and a error commit by general meade come very near expose he to serious danger it appear that after retreat across the rappahannock the federal commander begin to entertain doubt whether the movement have not be hasty and would not justly subject he to the charge of yield to sudden panic influence apparently by this sentiment he now order three corps of the federal army with a division of cavalry back to culpepper and this the main body accordingly cross back leave but one corps north of the river such be now the very peculiar situation of the two army general lee be move steadily in the direction of warrenton to cut off he adversary from manassa and that adversary be move back into culpepper to hunt up lee there the comedy of error be soon terminate but not so soon as it otherwise would have be but for a _ ruse de guerre _ play by general rosser and young general rosser have be leave by stuart near brandy with about two hundred horseman and one gun and when the three infantry corps and the cavalry division of general meade move forward from the river they encounter this obstacle insignificant as be he force general rosser so manoeuvre it as to produce the impression that it be considerable and though force of course to fall back he do so fight at every step assistance reach he just at dusk in the shape of a brigade of cavalry from above the court-house under general young the same officer whose charge at the fleetwood fight have have so important a bearing upon the result there young now form line with he man dismount and advance with a confident air open fire upon the federal army the darkness prove friendly and take advantage of it general young kindle fire along a front of more than a mile order he band to play and must have cause the enemy to doubt whether lee be not still in large force near culpepper court-house they accordingly go into camp to await the return of daylight when at midnight a fast-riding courier come with order from general meade these order be urgent and direct the federal troops to recross the river with all haste general lee it be now ascertain have leave a insignificant force in culpepper and with nearly he whole army be move rapidly toward warrenton to cut off he adversary iii a race between two army the game of hide-and-seek -- to change the figure -- be now in full progress and nothing more dramatic could be conceive of than the relative position of the two army at midnight on Monday October 12th lee 's army be near warrenton spring ready to advance in the morning upon warrenton while three of the four corps under general meade be half-way between the rappahannock and culpepper court-house expect battle there thus a choice of two course be present to the federal commander : to order back he main force and rapidly retreat toward manassa or move the fourth corps to support it and place he whole army directly in lee 's rear the occasion demand instant decision every hour now count but unfortunately for general meade he be still in the dark as to the actual amount of lee 's force in culpepper the movement toward warrenton might be a mere _ ruse _ the great master of the art of war to whom he be oppose might have lay this trap for he -- have count upon he fall into the snare -- and while a portion of the southern force be engage in culpepper might design a attack with the rest upon the federal right flank or rear in fact the situation of affair be so anomalous and puzzling that lee might design almost any thing and succeed in crush he adversary the real state of the case be that lee design nothing of this description have have no intimation whatever of general meade 's new movement back toward culpepper he be advance toward warrenton under the impression that he adversary be retreat and aim to come up with he somewhere near that place and bring he to battle upon this theory he opponent now act by promptly order back he three corps to the north bank of the rappahannock they begin to march soon after midnight recross the river near the railroad and on the morning of the 13th hasten forward by rapid march to pass the dangerous point near warrenton toward which lee be also move with he infantry in this race every advantage seem to be on the side of lee the three federal corps have fully twice as far to march as the southern force lee be concentrate near warrenton while they be far in the rear and if the confederate move with only half the rapidity of they adversary they be certain to intercept they and compel they either to surrender or cut they way through these comment -- tedious perhaps -- be necessary to the comprehension of the singular situation we proceed now with the narrative stuart have push on past warrenton with he cavalry toward the orange railroad when on the night of the 13th he meet with one of those adventure which be thickly strew throughout he romantic career he be near auburn just at nightfall when as he rear-guard close up information reach he from that quarter that the federal army be pass directly in he rear nearly at the same moment intelligence arrive that another column of the enemy consist like the first of infantry cavalry and artillery be move across he front stuart be now in a actual trap and he situation be perilous in the extreme he be enclose between two move wall of enemy and if discover he fate seem seal but one course be leave he : to preserve if possible complete silence in he command to lie _ perdu _ in the wood and await the occurrence of some fortunate event to extricate he from he highly-embarrassing situation he accordingly issue stringent order to the man that no noise of any description should be make and not a word be utter and there be little necessity to repeat this command the trooper remain silent and motionless in the saddle throughout the night ready at any instant to move at the order and thus pass the long hour of darkness -- the southern horseman as silent as phantom the federal column pass rapidly with the roll of artillery-wheel the tramp of cavalry-horse and the shuffling sound of foot on both side of the command -- the column move in rear of stuart be distant but two or three hundred yard this romantic incident be destine to terminate fortunately for stuart who have dispatch scout to steal through the federal column and announce he situation to general lee prepare to seize upon the first opportunity to release he command from its imminent peril the opportunity come at dawn the federal rear under general caldwell have bivouac near and have just kindle fire to cook they breakfast when from the valley beneath the hill on which the troops have halt stuart open suddenly upon they with he horse-artillery and as he say in he report knock over coffee-pot and other utensil at the moment when the man least expect it he then advance he sharp-shooter and direct a rapid fire upon the disorder troops and under cover of this fire wheel to the left and emerge safely toward warrenton the army greet he with cheer and he be himself in the highest spirit he have certainly good reason for this joy for he have just graze destruction as stuart 's artillery open the sound be take up toward warrenton where ewell in obedience to lee 's order have attack the federal column nothing result however from this assault : general meade have concentrate he army and be hasten toward manassa all now depend again upon the celerity of lee 's movement in pursuit he have lose many hour at warrenton where another halt be make he say to supply the troops with provision thus on the morning of the 14th he be as far from intercept general meade as before and all now depend upon the movement of hill who while ewell move toward greenwich have be send by way of new baltimore to come in on the federal line of retreat at bristoe station near manassa in spite however of he excellent soldiership and habitual promptness hill do not arrive in time he make the détour prescribe by lee pass new baltimore and hasten on toward bristoe where on approach that point he find only the rear-guard of the federal army -- the whole force with this exception have cross broad run and hasten on toward manassa hill 's arrival have thus be tardy : it would have be fortunate for he if he have not arrive at all see the federal column under general warren hasten along the railroad to pass broad run he order a prompt attack and cooke 's brigade lead the charge the result be unfortunate for the confederate general warren see he peril have promptly dispose he line behind the railroad embankment at the spot where protect by this impromptu breastwork the man rest they gun upon the iron rail and pour a destructive fire upon the southerner rush down the open slope in front by this fire general cooke be severely wound and fall and he brigade lose a considerable part of its number before a new attack could be make general warren hastily withdraw carry off with he in triumph a number of prisoner and five piece of artillery capture on the bank of the run before he retreat could be again interrupted he be safe on the opposite side of the stream and lose no time in hurry forward to join the main body which be retreat on centreville general meade have thus completely foiled he adversary lee have set out with the intention of bring the federal commander to battle have not succeed in do so owe to the rapidity of he retreat have come up only with he rear-guard under circumstance which seem to seal the fate of that detach force and the small rear-guard have repulse he completely capture prisoner and artillery from he and retire in triumph such have be the issue of the campaign all the success have be on the side of general meade he be say to have declare that it be like pull out he eye-tooth not to have have a fight but something resemble _ bona-fide _ fighting have occur on the bank of broad run and the victory be clearly on the side of the federal troops to turn to general lee it would be a interesting question to discuss whether he really desire to _ intercept _ general meade if there be any datum upon which to base a decision the writer hazard the observation that it seem doubtful whether this be lee 's intention he have a high opinion of general meade and be say to have declare of that commander that he give he -lrb- lee -rrb- as much trouble as any of they lee be thus oppose to a soldier whose ability he respect and it appear doubtful whether he desire to move so rapidly as to expose he own communication to interruption by he adversary this view seem to derive support from the apparently unnecessary delay at culpepper court-house and warrenton there be certainly no good reason why under ordinary circumstance a army so accustomed to rapid march as the army of northern virginium should not have be able to reach warrenton from the neighborhood of culpepper court-house in less than _ four day _ we be _ compel _ to halt lee write of the delay at culpepper but of that at warrenton he simply say another halt be make whether these view have or have not foundation the reader must judge we shall aim in a few page to conclude we account of this interesting campaign iv the fight at buckland lee ride forward to the field upon which general hill have sustain he bloody repulse and hill -- depressed and mortified at the mishap -- endeavor to explain the _ contretemp _ and vindicate himself from censure lee be say to have listen in silence as they ride among the dead body and to have at length reply gravely and sadly : well well general bury these poor man and let we say no more about it he have issue order that the troops should cease the pursuit and ride on the next morning with general stuart to the summit of a hill overlook broad run dismount and hold a brief conversation with the commander of he cavalry look intently as he speak in the direction of manassas he demeanor be that of a person who be far from pleased with the course of event and the word _ glum _ best describe he expression the safe retreat of general meade with the heavy blow strike by he in retire be indeed enough to account for this ill-humor the campaign be altogether a failure since general meade 's position at centreville be unassailable and if he be only drive therefrom he have but to retire to the defence at washington lee accordingly give stuart direction to follow up the enemy in the direction of centreville and order the orange and alexandrium railroad to be tear up back to the rappahannock put he infantry in motion and march back toward culpepper we shall now briefly follow the movement of the cavalry stuart advance to manassa follow up the federal rear and hasten they retreat across bull run beyond he then leave fitz lee 's division near manassa in the federal front and move with hampton 's division to the leave toward groveton pass the little catharpin proceed thence through the beautiful autumn forest toward frying pan and there find and attack with he command dismount and act as sharp-shooter the second corps of the federal army this sudden appearance of southern troops on the flank of centreville be say to have cause great excitement there as it be not know that the force be not general lee 's army the fact be soon apparent however that it be merely a cavalry attack the federal infantry advance whereupon stuart retire and the adventurous southern horseman move back in the direction of warrenton they be not to rejoin lee 's army however before a final conflict with the federal cavalry and the circumstance of this conflict be as dramatic and picturesque as the _ ruse de guerre _ of young in culpepper and the midnight adventure of stuart near auburn the bold assault on the second corps seem to have excite the ire of the federal commander and he promptly send forward a considerable body of he cavalry under general kilpatrick to pursue stuart and if possible come up with and defeat he stuart be near the village of buckland on the road to warrenton when intelligence of the approach of the federal cavalry reach he the movement which follow be suggest by general fitz lee he propose that stuart should retire toward warrenton with hampton 's division while he with he own division remain on the enemy 's left flank then at a give signal stuart be to face about he general fitz lee would attack they in flank when they rout would probably ensue this plan be carry out to the letter general kilpatrick who seem to have be confident of he ability to drive stuart before he press forward on the warrenton road closely follow up he adversary when the sudden boom of artillery from general fitz lee give the signal stuart wheel at the signal and make a headlong charge upon he pursuer fitz lee come in at the same moment and attack they in flank and the result be that general kilpatrick 's entire command be route and retreat in confusion stuart pursue as he write from within three mile of warrenton to buckland the horse at full speed the whole distance so terminate a incident afterward know among the trooper of stuart by the jocose title of the buckland race and the southern cavalry retire without further molestation behind the rappahannock the coöperation of general imboden in the campaign should not be pass over that officer whose special duty have be to guard the gap in the blue ridge advance from berryville to charlestown attack the federal garrison at the latter place drive they in disorder toward harper 's ferry and carry back with he four or five hundred prisoner the enemy follow he closely and he be force to fight they off at every step he succeed however in return in safety have perform more than the duty expect of he lee be now behind the rappahannock and it remain to be see what course general meade would pursue -- whether he would remain near centreville or strive to regain he lose ground all doubt be soon terminate by the approach of the federal army which march from centreville on October 19th and repair the railroad as it advance reach the rappahannock on the 7th of November lee 's army at this time be in camp toward culpepper court-house with advanced force in front of kelly 's ford and the railroad bridge general meade act with vigor on he arrival he promptly send a force across at kelly 's ford the southern troops occupy the rifle-pits there be drive off with the loss of many prisoner and a attack near the railroad bridge have still more unfortunate result for general lee a portion of early 's division have be post in the abandon federal work on the north bank at this point and these be now attack and after a fierce resistance completely route nearly the whole command be capture -- the remnant barely escape -- and the way have thus be clear general meade throw he army across into culpepper general lee retire before he with a heavy heart and a deep melancholy which in spite of he great control over himself be visible in he countenance the infantry-fighting of the campaign have begin and end in disaster for he in the thirty day he have lose at least two thousand man and be back again in he old camp have achieve absolutely nothing v the advance to mine run November of the bloody year 1863 have come and it seem not unreasonable to anticipate that a twelvemonth mark by such incessant fighting at chancellorsville fredericksburg salem church winchester gettysburg front royal bristoe and along the rappahannock would now terminate in peace permit the combatant on both side wear out by they arduous work to go into winter-quarter and recuperate they energy for the operation of the ensue spring but general meade have otherwise determine he have resolve to try a last advance in spite of the inclement weather and lee 's anticipation of a season of rest and refreshment for he troops undisturbed by hostile demonstration on the part of the enemy be destine speedily to be disappoint the southern army have go regularly into winter-quarter south of the rapidan and the man be felicitate themselves upon the prospect of a uninterrupted season of leisure and enjoyment in they rude cabin build in sheltered nook or under they breadth of canvas raise upon log and fit with rough but comfortable chimney build of notch pine-sapling when suddenly intelligence be bring by scout that the federal army be in motion the fact reverse all they hope of rest and song and laughter by the good log-fire the musket be take from its place on the rude wall the cartridge-box assume and the army be once more ready for battle -- as gay hopeful and resolve as in the first day of spring general meade have indeed resolve that the year should not end without another blow at he adversary and the brief campaign know as the advance to mine run follow it be the least favorable of all season for active operation but the federal commander be vindicate from the charge of bad soldiership by two circumstance which very properly have great weight with he the first be the extreme impatience of the northern authority and people at the small result of the bloody fighting of the year gettysburg have seem to they a complete defeat of lee since he have retreat thereafter without loss of time to virginium and yet three month afterward the defeat commander have advance upon and force back he victorious adversary that such should be the result of the year 's campaigning seem absurd to the north a clamorous appeal be make to the authority to order another advance and this general sentiment be say to have be share by general meade who have declare himself bitterly disappoint at miss a battle with lee in October a stronger argument in favor of active operation lay in the situation at the moment of the southern army lee anticipate no further fighting during the remainder of the year oppose the enemy on the rapidan with only one of he two corps -- that of ewell while the other -- that of hill -- be throw back in detach division at various point on the orange and the virginium central railroad for the purpose of subsistence during the winter this fact become know to general meade dictate it be say he plan of operation a advance seem to promise from the position of the southern force a decisive success ewell 's right extend no farther than morton 's ford on the rapidan and thus the various ford down to chancellorsville be open if general meade could cross suddenly and by a rapid march interpose between ewell and the scatter division of hill far in rear it appear not unreasonable to conclude that lee 's army would be completely disrupt and that the two corps one after another might be crush by the federal army this plan which be give on the authority of northern writer exhibit good soldiership and if lee be to be catch unawares promise to succeed without further comment we shall now proceed to the narrative of this brief movement which indecisive as it be in its result be not uninteresting and may prove as attractive to the military student as other operation more impose and accompany by bloodier fighting general meade begin to move toward the rapidan on November 26th and every exertion be make by he to advance with such secrecy and rapidity as to give he the advantage of a surprise in this however he be disappointed no sooner have he order be issue and the correspondent movement begin than the accomplished scout of stuart hurry across the rapidan with the intelligence stuart whose headquarters be in a hollow of the hill near orange and not far from general lee 's promptly communicate in person to the commander-in-chief this important information and lee dispatch immediately a order to general ap hill in rear to march at once and form a junction with ewell in the vicinity of verdierville the latter officer be direct to retire from he advanced position upon the rapidan which expose he to a attack on he right flank and rear and to fall back and take post behind the small stream call mine run in follow with a critical eye the operation of general lee the military student must be strike particularly by one circumstance that in all he movement he seem to proceed less accord to the nice technicality of the art of war than in accordance with the dictate of a broad and comprehensive good sense it may be say that in choose position he always choose the right and never the wrong one and the choice of mine run now as a defensive line be a proof of this the run be a small water-course which rise south of the great highway between orange and chancellorsville flow due northward amid wood and between hill to the rapidan into which it empty itself a few mile above germanna general meade 's main place of cross this stream be the natural defense of the right flank of a army post between orange and the rapidan it be also the natural and obvious line upon which to receive the attack of a force march from below toward gordonsville behind mine run therefore just east of the little village of verdierville general lee direct he two corps to concentrate and at the word the man lounge but now carelessly in winter-quarter spring to arm fall in and with burnished musket take up the line of march we have speak of the promptness with which the movement be make and it may almost be say that general meade have scarcely break up he camp north of the rapidan when lee be in motion to go and meet he on the night of the 26th stuart whose cavalry be post opposite the lower ford push forward in person and bivouac under some pine just below verdierville and before daylight general lee be also in the saddle and at sunrise have reach the same point the night have be severely cold for winter have set in in earnest but general lee always robust and careless of weather walk down without wrap and wear only he plain gray uniform to stuart 's _ impromptu _ headquarters under the pine where beside a great fire and without other cover than he army-blanket the commander of the cavalry have sleep since midnight as lee approach stuart come forward and lee say admiringly what a hardy soldier they consult stuart walk back with general lee and receive he order he then promptly mount and hasten to the front where take command of he cavalry he form it in front of the advance enemy and with artillery and dismount sharp-shooter offer every possible impediment to they advance general meade make the passage of the rapidan without difficulty and as he expedition be unencumbered with wagon advance rapidly the only serious obstruction to he march be make by johnson 's division of ewell 's corps which have be throw out beyond the run toward the river upon this force the federal third corps under general french suddenly blunder by take the wrong road it be say and a active engagement follow which result in favor of the southerner the verdict of lee 's troops afterward be that the enemy fight badly but general french probably desire nothing better than to shake off this hornet ' - nest into which he have stumble and to reach in the time prescribe by general meade the point of federal concentration near robertson 's tavern toward that point the northern force now converge from the various crossing of the river and stuart continue to reconnoitre and feel they along the entire front fighting obstinately and fall back only when compel to do so every step be thus contest with sharp-shooter and the horse-artillery from far below to above new-hope church the federal infantry however continue steadily to press forward force back the cavalry and on the 27th general meade be in face of mine run lee be ready hill have promptly march and he corps be come into position on the right of ewell receive intelligence of the enemy 's movement only upon the precede day lee have seem to move the division of hill far back toward charlottesville as by the wave of he hand the army be concentrate the line of defense occupy and general meade 's attempt to surprise he adversary by interpose between he widely-separated wing have result in decisive failure if he fight now the battle must be one of army against army and what be worst of all it be lee who hold all the advantage of position we have speak of mine run : it be a strong defensive position on its right bank and on its left flow generally between hill and with densely-wooded bank it be difficult to cross from either side in face of a oppose force and it be lee 's good fortune to occupy the attitude of the party to be assail he seem to feel that he have nothing to fear and be in excellent spirit as be the man a eye-witness describe they as gay lively laughing magnificent in front of he left wing he have already erect work he center and right be as yet undefended but the task of strengthen the line at these point be rapidly prosecute lee superintend in person the establishment of he order of battle and it be plain to those who see he thus engage that the department of military engineering be a favorite one with he ride along the western bank of the water-course a large part of which be densely clothe in oak chestnut and hickory he select with the quick eye of the trained engineer the best position for he line -- promptly move it when it have be establish on bad ground -- point out the position for artillery and as he thus ride slowly along the work which he have direct seem to spring up behind he as though by magic as the troops of hill come up and halt in the wood the man seize axis attack the large tree which soon fall in every direction and the heavy log be drag without loss of time to the prescribe line where they be pile upon each other in double wall which be fill in rapidly with earth and thus in a inconceivably short space of time the man have defence breast-high which would turn a cannon-shot in front for some distance too the timber have be fell and a _ abati _ thus form a few hour after the arrival of the troops on the line mark out by lee they be root behind excellent breastwork with forest stream and _ abati _ in front to delay the assail force under the fire of small-arm and cannon this account of the movement of the army and the preparation make to receive general meade 's attack may appear of undue length and minuteness of detail in view of the fact that no battle ensue but the volume before the reader be not so much a history of the battle of virginium which have often be describe as a attempt to delineate the military and personal character of general lee which display itself often more strikingly in indecisive event than in those whose result attract the attention of the world it be the vigorous brain indeed of the great soldier that make event indecisive -- ward off by military acumen and ability the disaster with which he be threaten at mine run lee 's quick eye for position and masterly handling of he force completely checkmate a adversary who have advance to deliver decisive battle with fell tree breastwork and a crawl stream lee reverse all the calculation of the commander of the federal army from the 27th of November to the night of the 1st of December general meade move to and fro in front of the formidable work of he adversary feel they with skirmisher and artillery and essay vainly to find some joint in the armor through which to pierce there be none lee have inaugurate that great system of breastwork which afterward do he such good service in he long campaign with general grant a feature of the military art unknown to jominus have thus its birth in the wood of america and this fact if there be naught else of interest in the campaign would communicate to the mine-run affair the utmost interest general meade it seem be bitterly oppose to foregoing a attack in spite of the powerful position of he adversary he order a assault it be say but this do not take place in consequence it would appear of the reluctance of general warren to charge the confederate right this seem so strong that the man consider it hopeless when the order be communicate to they each one write he name on a scrap of paper and pin it to he breast that he corpse might be recognize and if possible convey to he friend this be ominous of failure : general warren suspend the attack and general meade it be say acquiesce in he decision he declare it be related that he could carry the position _ with a loss of thirty thousand man _ but as that idea be frightful there seem nothing to do but retreat lee seem to realize the embarrassment of he adversary and be in excellent heart throughout the whole affair ride to and fro along he line among he merry man -- and they have never appear in finer spirit or with greater confidence in they commander -- he address encouraging word to they expose himself with entire indifference to the shell and seem perfectly confident of the result it be on this occasion that find a party of he ragged soldier devoutly kneel in one of the little glade behind the breastwork and hold a praying-meeting in the midst of burst shell he dismount take off he hat and remain silently and devoutly listen until the earnest prayer be conclude a great revival be then go on in the army and thousand be become professor of religion the fact may seem strange to those who have regard lee as only a west-pointer and soldier look like all soldier to military success but the religious enthusiasm of he man in this autumn of 1863 probably give he greater joy than any success achieve over he federal adversary those who see he on the line at mine run will remember the compose satisfaction of he countenance a eye-witness recall he mild face as he ride along accompany by hill in he droop hat simple and cordial early laughing ewell pale and haggard but with a smile _ de bon coeur _ -lrb- footnote : journal of a staff-officer -rrb- he be thus attend sit he horse upon a hill near the left of he line when a staff officer ride up and inform he that the enemy be make a heavy demonstration against he extreme right infantry or cavalry he ask with great calmness infantry i think general from the appearance of the gun general wilcox think so and have send a regiment of sharp-shooter to meet they who command the regiment ask general lee and it be to introduce this question that this trifle have be mention lee know he army man by man almost and could judge of the probable result of the movement here announce to he by the name of the officer in command finding that general meade would not probably venture to assail he lee determine on the night of December 1st to attack he adversary on the next morning he mildness on this night yield to soldierly ardor and he exclaim : they must be attack they must be attack he plan be say to have contemplate a movement of he right wing against the federal left flank for which the ground afford great advantage all be ready for such a movement and the order be say to have be issue when as the dawn break over the hill the federal camp be see to be desert general meade have abandon he campaign and be in full retreat toward the rapidan the army immediately move in pursuit with lee lead the column the disappearance of the enemy be a astounding event to they and they could scarcely realize it a entertaining illustration of this fact be find in the journal of a staff-officer who be send with a order to general hampton in look for he say the writer i get far to we right and in a hollow of the wood find a grand guard of the eleventh cavalry with picket and vidette out gravely sit they horse and watch the wood-road for the advance of a enemy who be then retreat across ely 's ford stuart be press they rear with he cavalry while the infantry be steadily advance but the pursuit be vain general meade have disappear like a phantom and be beyond pursuit to the extreme regret and disappointment of general lee who halt he troops in great discouragement at parker 's store tell general stuart he say with a air of deep melancholy to a officer whom he see pass that i have receive he dispatch when he turn into the brock road and have halt my infantry here not wish to march they unnecessarily even at that early hour all chance of effective pursuit be lose general meade without wagon and not even with the weight of the ration bring over which the man have consume have move with the rapidity of cavalry and be already cross the river far below he be afterward ask by a gentleman of culpepper whether in cross the rapidan he design a real advance certainly he be report by the gentleman in question to have reply i mean to go to richmond if i could but lee 's position be so strong that to storm it would have cost I thirty thousand man i could not remain without a battle -- the weather be so cold that my sentinel freeze to death on post the pursuit be speedily abandon by general lee as entirely impracticable and the man be march back between the burning wood set on fire by the federal campfire the spectacle be impose -- the numerous fire burn outerward in the carpet of thick leaf form picturesque ring of flame resemble brilliant necklace and as the flame reach the tall tree wrap to the summit in dry vine these would blaze aloft like gigantic torch -- true torch of war -- let fall by the federal commander in he hasty retrograde twenty-four hour afterward the larger part of general lee 's army be back in they winter-quarter in less than a week the mine-run campaign have begin and end the movement of general meade might have be compare to that of the king of france and he forty thousand man in the song but the campaign be not ill devise be rather the dictate of sound military judgment all that defeat it be the extreme promptness of lee the excellent choice of position and the beginning of that great system of impromptu breastwork which afterward become so powerful a engine against general grant vi lee in the autumn and winter of 1863 general lee 's headquarters remain throughout the autumn and winter of 1863 in a wood on the southern slope of the spur call clarke 's mountain a few mile east of orange court-house here he tent have be pitch in a clear space amid pine and cedar and the ingenuity of the courier as messenger and orderly be call in the southern army have fashion alley and walk lead to the various tent the tent of the commanding general occupy the center of the gentleman of general lee 's staff we have not consider it necessary to speak but it may here be say that it be compose of officer of great efficiency and of the most courteous manners from colonel taylor the indefatigable adjutant-general to the youngest and least prominent member of the friendly group among these able assistant of the commander-in-chief be colonel marshall of maryland a gentleman of distinguished intellect colonel peyton who have enter the battle of manassa as a private in the rank but on the evening of that day for courage and efficiency occupy the place of a commission officer on beauregard 's staff and other whose name be comparatively unknown to the army but whose part in the conduct of affair under direction of lee be most important with the gentleman of he staff general lee live on term of the most kindly regard he be a strict disciplinarian and abhor the theory that a commission officer from consideration of rank should hold himself above the private soldier but there be certainly no fault of this description to be find at army headquarters and the general and he staff work together in harmonious coöperation the respect feel for he by gentleman who see he at all hour and under none of the guise of ceremony be probably greater than that experience by the community who look upon he from a distance that distant perspective hide little weakness and reveal only the great proportion of a human being be say to be essential generally to the heroic sublime no man it have be say can be great to those always near he but in the case of general lee this be far from be the fact he seem greater and nobler day by day as he be better and more intimately know and upon this point we shall quote the word of the brave john b gordon one of he most trust lieutenant : it have be my fortune in life say general gordon from circumstance to have come in contact with some whom the world pronounce great -- some of the earth 's celebrated and distinguished but i declare it here to-day that of any mortal man whom it have ever be my privilege to approach he be the greatest and i assert here that _ grand as might be you conception of the man before he arise in incomparable majesty on more familiar acquaintance _ this can be affirm of few man who have ever live or die and of no other man whom it have ever be my fortune to approach like niagara the more you gaze the more its grandeur grow upon you the more its majesty expand and fill you spirit with a full satisfaction that leave a perfect delight without the slightest feeling of oppression grandly majestic and dignified in all he deportment he be genial as the sunlight of this beautiful day and not a ray of that cordial social intercourse but bring warmth to the heart as it do light to the understanding upon this point general breckinridge too bear he testimony : during the last year of that unfortunate struggle he say it be my good fortune to spend a great deal of time with he i be almost constantly by he side and it be during the two month immediately precede the fall of richmond that i come to know and fully understand the true nobility of he character in all those long vigil he be considerate and kind gentle firm and self-poised i can give no better idea of the impression it make upon I than to say it inspire I with a ardent love of the man and a profound veneration of he character it be so massive and noble so grand in its proportion that all man must admire its heroism and gallantry yet so gentle and tender that a woman might adopt and claim it as she own we beg the reader to observe that in these two tribute to the worth of the great soldier he distinguished associate dwell with peculiar emphasis upon the charm of private intercourse with he and bear they testimony to the fact that to know he better be to love and admire he more and more the fact be easily explain there be in this human being 's character naught that be insincere assume or pretentious it be a great and massive soul -- as gentle too and tender as a woman 's or a child 's -- that lay beneath the reserved exterior and make the soldier more beloved as its quality be better know other man reveal they weakness on nearer acquaintance -- lee only reveal he greatness and he be more and more loved and admire the justice of these comment will be recognize by all who have personal intercourse with the illustrious soldier and in this autumn and winter of 1863 he army lie around he along the rapidan begin to form that more intimate acquaintance which uniformly result in profound admiration for the man in the great campaign of the two past year the gray soldier have share they hardship and never relax he fatherly care for all they want he have lead they in battle expose he own person with entire indifference have never expose _ they _ when it be possible to avoid it and on every occasion have demand often with disagreeable persistence from the civil authority that the want of he veteran should be supply if all else be neglect these fact be now know to the troops and make lee immensely popular from the highest officer to the humblest private soldier he be universally respect and beloved the whole army seem to feel that in the plainly-clad soldier sleep like themselves under canvas in the wood of orange they have a guide and protect head ever studious of they well-being jealous of they hard-earned fame and ready both as friend and commander to represent they and claim they due we have speak of the great revival of religion which at this time take place in the army the touching spectacle be present of bearded veteran who have charge in a score of combat kneel devoutly under the rustic roof of evergreen build for religious gathering and pray to the god of battle who have so long protect they a commander-in-chief of the old european school might have ridicule these emotional assemblage or at best pass they without notice as freak in which he disdain to take part lee on the contrary greet the religious enthusiasm of he troops with undisguised pleasure he go among they converse with the chaplain assist the good work by every means in he power and no ordain minister of the gospel could have exhibit a simpler sincerer or more heartfelt delight than himself at the general extension of religious feeling throughout the army we have relate how in talk with army-chaplain he cheek flush and he eye fill with tear at the good tiding he beg they to pray for he too as no less need they pious intercession and in make the request he be as always simple and sincere unaccustomed to exhibit he feeling upon this the profoundest and most sacred of subject he be yet penetrate to he inmost soul by a sense of he own weakness and dependence on divine support and indeed it may be question whether any other element of the great soldier 's character be so deep-seated and control as he spirit of love to god it take in the eye of the world the form of a love of duty but with lee the word duty be but another name for the will of the almighty and to discover and perform this be first and last the sole aim of he life we elaborate this point before pass to the last great campaign of the war since to understand lee in those last day it be absolutely necessary to keep in view this utter subjection of the man 's heart to the sense of a overrule providence -- that providence which shape we end rough-hew they how we will we shall be call upon to delineate the soldier meeting adverse circumstance and disaster at every turn with a imperial calmness and a resolution that never shake and up to a certain point this noble composure may be attribute to the stubborn courage of the man 's nature there come in due time however a moment of trial when military courage simply be of no avail -- when that human be never live who look to earthly support alone would not have lose heart and give up the contest lee do not in this hour of conclusive trial either lose heart or give up the struggle and the world not understand the phenomenon gaze at he with wonder few be aware of the true explanation of he utter serenity when all thing be crumble around he and when he know that they be crumble the stout heart of the soldier who will not yield to fate be in he breast but he have a still stronger sentiment than manly courage to support he -- the consciousness that he be do he duty and that god watch over he and would make all thing work together for good to those who love he as yet that last great wrestle of the oppose army lay in the future the veteran of the army of northern virginium defend the line of the rapidan and the gray commander-in-chief in he tent on clarke 's mountain serenely await the further movement of the enemy during the long month of winter he be busily engage as usual in official correspondence in look to the welfare of he man and in preparation for the come campaign he often ride among the camp and the familiar figure in the well-known hat cape and gray uniform mount upon the powerful iron-gray -- the famous traveller who survive to bear he master after the war -- be everywhere greet by the ragged veteran with cheer and mark of the highest respect and regard at time he ride be extend to the bank of the rapidan and in pass he would stop at the headquarters of general stuart or other officer on these occasion he have always some good-humored speech for all not overlook the youngest officer but he shine in the most amiable light perhaps in converse with some old private soldier gray-haired like himself at such moment the general 's countenance be a pleasant spectacle a kindly smile light up the clear eye and move the lip half-conceal by the grizzled mustache the _ bonhomie _ of this smile be irresistible and the aged private soldier in he poor tattered fighting-jacket be make to feel by it that he commander-in-chief regard he as a friend and comrade we dwell at too great length perhaps upon these slight personal trait of the soldier but all relate to such a human being be interesting and worthy of record to the writer indeed this be the most attractive phase of he subject the analysis and description of campaign and battle be a unattractive task to he but the personal delineation of a good and great man even in he lesser and more familiar trait be a please relief -- a portion of he subject upon which he delight to linger what the writer here try to draw he look upon with he own eye the figure of a great calm soldier with kindly sweetness and dignity but above all a charming sincerity and simplicity in every movement accent and expression entirely free from the trappings of high command and with nothing to distinguish he from any other soldier save the well-worn star on the collar of he uniform-coat the commander-in-chief be recognizable at the very first glance and no less the simple and kindly gentleman he old soldier remember he as he appear on many battle-field and will describe he martial seat in the saddle as he advance with the advance line but they will speak of he with even greater pleasure as he appear in the winter of 1862 and 1863 on the rappahannock and the rapidan -- a gray and simple soldier ride among they and smile kindly as he eye fall upon they tattered uniform and familiar face part viii _ lee 's last campaign and last day _ i general grant cross the rapidan in the first day of may 1864 begin the immense campaign which be to terminate only with the fall of the confederacy for this which be regard as the decisive trial of strength the federal authority have make elaborate preparation new levy be raise by draft to fill up the rank of the deplete force great mass of war material be accumulate at the central depot at washington and the government summon from the west a officer of high reputation to conduct hostility on what be more plainly than ever before see to be the theater of decisive conflict -- virginia the officer in question be general ulyss s grant who have receive the repute of eminent military ability by he operation in the west he be now commission lieutenant-general and president lincoln assign he to the command of all the army of the united state at that time estimate to number one million man general grant promptly accept the trust confide to he and relinquish to major-general sherman the command of the western force proceed to culpepper and assume personal command of the army of the potomac although nominally that army remain under command of general meade the spring campaign be precede in February by two movement of the federal force : one the advance of general bf butler up the peninsula to the chickahominy where for a few hour he threaten richmond only to retire hastily when oppose by a few local troops the other the expedition of general kilpatrick with a body of cavalry from the rapidan toward richmond with the view of release the federal prisoner there this fail completely like the expedition up the peninsula general kilpatrick after threaten the city rapidly retreat and a portion of he command under colonel dahlgren be pursue and a large portion kill include they commander it be to be hope for the honor of human nature that colonel dahlgren 's design be different from those which be attribute to he on what seem unassailable proof papers find upon he body contain minute direction for release the prisoner and give up the city to they and for put to death the confederate president and he cabinet to return to the more important event on the rapidan general grant assume the direction of the army of the potomac under most favorable auspices other commander -- especially general mcclellan -- have labor under painful disadvantage from the absence of coöperation and good feeling on the part of the authority the new leader enter upon the great struggle under very different circumstance personally and politically acceptable to the government he receive they hearty coöperation : all power be place in he hand he be enable to concentrate in virginia the best troops in large number and the character of this force seem to promise he assure victory general mcclellan and other have command troops comparatively raw and be oppose by confederate army in the full flush of anticipated success general grant have now under he a army of veteran and the enemy he be oppose to have month by month lose strength under these circumstance it seem that he ought to succeed in crush he adversary the federal army present and ready for duty may 1 1864 number one hundred and forty-one thousand one hundred and sixty-six man that of general lee number fifty-two thousand six hundred and twenty-six colonel taylor adjutant-general of the army state the strictly effective at a little less viz : ewell 13000 hill 17000 longstreet 10000 infantry 40000 cavalry and artillery 10000 total 50000 the two statement do not materially differ and require no discussion the force at lee 's command be a little over one-third of general grant 's and if it be true that the latter commander continue to receive reënforcements between the 1st and 4th day of may when he cross the rapidan lee 's force be probably less than one-third of he adversary 's longstreet it will be see have be bring back from the west but the confederate labor under a even more serious disadvantage than want of sufficient force lee 's army small as it be be wretchedly supply half the man be in rag and worse still be but one-fourth feed against this suicidal policy in reference to a army upon which depend the fate of the south general lee have protest in vain whether from fault in the authority or from circumstance over which they could exercise no control adequate supplies of food do not reach the army and when it march to meet the enemy in the first day of may the man be gaunt half-fed and in no condition to enter upon so arduous a campaign there be naught to be do however but to fight on to the end upon the army of northern virginium deplete by casualty and unprovided with the commonest necessaries depend the fate of the struggle general grant and lee fully realize that fact and the federal commander have the acumen to perceive that the conflict be to be long and determine he indulge no anticipation of a early or easy success he plan as state in he official report be to _ hammer continuously _ against the armed force of the enemy and he resource until _ by mere attrition _ if by nothing else there should be nothing left of he but a equal submission with the loyal section of we common country to the constitution and the law the frightful cost in blood of this policy of hammer continuously and thus wear away he adversary 's strength by mere attrition do or do not occur to general grant in either case he be not justly to be blame it be the only policy which promise to result in federal success pitch battle have be try for nearly three year and in victory or in defeat the southern army seem equally unshaken and dangerous this fact be now feel and acknowledge even by its enemy lee 's army say a northern writer refer to it at this time be a army of veteran : it be a instrument sharpen to a perfect edge you turn its flank -- well its flank be make to be turn this effect little or nothing all that we reckon as gain therefore be the loss of life inflict on the enemy with a army thus train in many combat and harden against misfortune defeat in one or a dozen battle decide nothing general grant seem to have understand this and to have resolutely adopt the program of attrition -- coldly estimate that even if he lose ten man to general lee 's one he could better endure that loss and could afford it if thereby he crush the rebellion the military theory of the federal commander have thus be set forth in he own word it remain to notice he program for the approach campaign he have hesitate between two plan -- one to cross the rapidan below lee move by he right flank the other above move by he leave the last be abandon from the difficulty of keep open communication with any base of supplies and the latter adopt general grant determine to fight lee between culpepper and richmond if he would stand to advance straight upon the city and invest it from the north and west thereby cut its communication in three direction and then cross the jame river above the city form a junction with the left of major-general butler who move with about thirty thousand man from fortress monroe at the moment when the army of the potomac cross the rapidan be to occupy city point advance thence up the south side of jame river and reach a position where the two army might thus unite it be proper to keep in view this program of general grant lee completely reverse it by promptly move in front of he adversary at every step which he take in advance and it will be see that the federal commander be finally compel to adopt a plan which do not seem to have enter he mind save as a _ dernier ressort _ at the beginning of the campaign on the morning of the 4th of may general grant commence cross the rapidan at germanna and other ford above chancellorsville and by the morning of the 5th he army be over it appear from he report that he have not anticipate so easy a passage of the stream and greatly felicitate himself upon effect it so successfully this i regard he say as a great success and it remove from my mind the most serious apprehension i have entertain that of cross the river in the face of a active large well-appointed and ably-commanded army lee have make no movement to dispute the passage of the stream from the fact perhaps that he army be _ not _ either large or well-appointed he prefer to await the appearance of he adversary and direct a assault on the flank of he column as it pass across he front from a speech attribute to general meade it would seem to have be the impression in the federal army that lee design fall back to a defensive position somewhere near the south anna he movement be however very different instead of retire before general grant in the direction of richmond he move with he three corps toward the wilderness to offer battle -lrb- illustration : route of lee & grant may and June 1864 -rrb- the head of the column consist of ewell 's corps which have retain its position on the rapidan form the right of lee 's line general ap hill who have be station higher up near liberty mill follow and longstreet who lay near gordonsville bring up the rear these disposition dictate as will be see the position of the three command in the ensue struggle ewell advance in front down the old turnpike that one of the two great highway here run east and west which be nearest the rapidan hill come on over the orange plank-road a little south of the turnpike and thus form on ewell 's right and longstreet follow come in on the right of hill general grant have plunge with he army into the dense and melancholy thicket which have be the scene of general hooker 's discomfiture he army follow by its great train of four thousand wagon indicate the important nature of the movement have reach wilderness tavern and that brock road over which jackson advance in he secret flank-march against the federal right in may 1863 in may of 1864 now another federal army have penetrate the sombre and depressing shadow of the interminable thicket of the wilderness and a more determine struggle than the first be to mark with its bloody hand this historic territory ii the first collision in the wilderness to understand the singular combat which now ensue it be necessary to keep in view the fact that nothing more surprised general grant than the sudden appearance of he adversary face to face with he in the wilderness it have not be suppose either by the lieutenant-general or he corps-commander that lee with he small army would have recourse to a proceeding so audacious it be anticipate indeed that somewhere on the road to richmond lee would make a stand and fight in a carefully-selected position which would enable he to risk collision with he great adversary but that lee himself would bring on this collision by make a open attack unassisted by position of any sort be the last thing which seem to have occur to he adversary such however as have be say be the design from the first of the southern commander and he move with he accustomed celerity and energy as soon as general grant break up he camp north of the rapidan lee be apprise of the fact and order he three corps to concentrate in the direction of chancellorsville those who be present in the southern army at this time will bear record to the soldierly promptness of officer and man on the evening of the 3d of may the camp be the scene of noise merriment and parade : the band play the wood be alive nothing disturb the scene of general enjoyment of winter-quarter on the morning of the 4th all this be change the camp be desert no sound be anywhere hear the troops be twenty mile away fully arm and ready for battle general lee be in the saddle and he presence seem to push forward he column ewell march with celerity bivouac that night directly in face of the enemy and it be the suddenly-discovered presence of the troops of this commander which arrest general grant advance steadily in the direction of spottsylvania court-house he must have inwardly chafe at a circumstance so unexpected and embarrassing it have be no part of he plan to fight in the thicket of the wilderness and yet a adversary of but one-third he own strength be about to reverse he whole program and dictate the term of the first battle of the campaign there be nothing to do however but to fight and general grant hasten to form order of battle for that purpose with general sedgwick command he right general warren and burnside he center and general hancock he leave near the brock road the line thus form extend from northwest to southeast and as the right wing be in advance with respect to lee that circumstance occasion the first collision this occur about mid-day on the 5th of may and be bring on by general warren who attack the head of swell 's column on the old turnpike a obstinate engagement ensue and the division which receive the assault be force back it quickly however reform and be reënforced advance in turn against general warren and after a hard fight he be drive back with a loss of three thousand man and two piece of artillery this first collision of the army on the confederate left be follow almost immediately by a bloody struggle on the center this be hold by ap hill who have march down the plank-road and be near the important point of junction of that road with the brock road when he be suddenly attack by the enemy the struggle which ensue be long and determine general lee write : the assault be repeat and desperate but every one be repulse when night fall hill have not be drive back but have not advance and the two army rest on they arm await the return of light to continue the battle iii the battle of the 6th of may the morning of the 6th of may come and with the first light of dawn the adversary as by a common understanding advance at the same moment to attack each other the battle which follow be wellnigh indescribable and may be say in general term to have be naught but the blind and desperate clutch of two great body of man who could scarcely see each other when they be but a few foot apart and who fire at random rather by sound than sight a southern writer describe the country and the strange combat say : the country be sombre -- a land of thicket undergrowth jungle ooze where man could not see each other twenty yard off and assault have to be make by the compass the fight there be not even as easy as night attack in open country for at night you can travel by the star death come unseen regiment stumble on each other and send swift destruction into each other 's rank guide by the crackling of the bush it be not war -- military manoeuvring : science have as little to do with it as sight two wild animal be hunting each other when they hear each other 's step they spring and grapple the conqueror advance or go elsewhere the dead be lose from all eye in the thicket the curious spectacle be here present of officer advance to the charge in the jungle _ compass in hand _ attack not by sight but by the bearing of the needle in this mournful and desolate thicket do the great campaign of 1864 begin here in blind wrestle as at midnight do two hundred thousand man in blue and gray clutch each other -- bloodiest and weirdest of encounter war have have nothing like it the genius of destruction tired apparently of the old commonplace killing have invent the ` unseen death ' at five in the morning the opponent close in breast to breast in the thicket each have throw up here and there slight temporary breastwork of sapling and dirt beyond this they be unprotected the question now be which would succeed in drive he adversary from these defence almost within a few yard of each other and from behind which crackle the musketry never be sight more curious on the low line of these work dimly see in the thicket rest the muzzle spout flame from the depths rise cheer charge be make and repulse the line scarcely see each other man fall and writhe and die unseen -- they body lose in the bush they death-groan drown in the steady continuous never-ceasing crash these sentence convey a not incorrect idea of the general character of this remarkable engagement which have no precedent in the war we shall now proceed to speak of general lee 's plan and object and to indicate where they fail or succeed the commander of both army labor under great embarrassment general grant 's be the singular character of the country with which he be wholly unacquainted and general lee 's the delay in the arrival of longstreet owe to the distance of the camp of the last-named officer he have not at dawn reach the field of battle as he presence be indispensable to a general assault this delay in he appearance threaten to result in unfortunate consequence as it be nearly certain that general grant would make a early and resolute attack under these circumstance lee resolve to commence the action and do so count doubtless on he ability with the thirty thousand man at he command to at least maintain he ground he plan seem to have be to make a heavy demonstration against the federal right and when longstreet arrive throw the weight of he whole center and right against the federal leave with the view of seize the brock road run southward and force back the enemy 's left wing into the thicket around chancellorsville this brilliant conception which if carry out would have arrest general grant in the beginning of he campaign be very near meeting with success the attack on the federal right under general sedgwick commence at dawn and the fight on both side be obstinate it continue with indecisive result throughout the morning gradually involve the federal center but nearly at the moment when it begin a still more obstinate conflict be inaugurate between general hancock hold the federal left and hill who oppose he on the plank-road the battle rage in this quarter with great fury for some time but attack in front and flank at once by he able opponent hill be force back steadily and at last in some disorder a considerable distance from the ground which have witness the commencement of the action at this point however he be fortunately meet by longstreet that commander rapidly bring he troops into line meet the advance enemy attack they with great fury and after a bloody contest in which general wadsworth be kill drive they back to they original position on the brock road it now seem nearly certain that lee 's plan of seize upon this important highway would succeed general hancock have be force back with heavy loss longstreet be press on and as he afterward say he think he have another bull run on they when a singular casualty defeat all general longstreet who have ride in front of he advance line turn to ride back when he be mistake by he own man for a federal cavalryman fire upon and disabled by a musket-ball this throw all into disorder and the advance be discontinue general lee as soon as he be apprise of the accident hasten to take personal command of the corps and as soon as order be restore direct the line to press forward the most bloody and determine struggle of the day ensue the thicket fill the valley and as at chancellorsville a new horror be add to the horror of battle a fire break out in the thicket and soon wrap the adversary in flame and smoke they fight on however amid the crackling flame lee continue to press forward the federal breastwork along a portion of they front be carry and a part of general hancock 's line be drive from the field the struggle have however be decisive of no important result and from the lateness of the hour when it terminate it could not be follow up on the left lee have also meet with marked but equally indecisive success general gordon have attack the federal right drive the force at that point in disorder from they work and but for the darkness this success might have be follow up and turn into a complete defeat of that wing of the enemy it be only discover on the next morning what important success gordon have effect with a single brigade and there be reason to believe that with a larger force this able soldier might have achieve result of a decisive character -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : general early in he memoir of the last year of the war for independence bear he testimony to the important character of the blow strike by general gordon he say : at light on the morning of the 7th a advance be make which disclose the fact that the enemy have give up he line of work in front of my whole line and a good portion of johnson 's between the line a large number of he dead have be leave and at he breastwork a large number of musket and knapsack have be abandon and there be every indication of great confusion it be not till then that we understand the full extent of the success attend the movement of the evening before general gordon have propose make the attack on the _ morning _ of the 6th but be overrule -rrb- such have be the character and result of the first conflict between the two army in the thicket of the wilderness as we have already say the collision there be neither expect nor desire by general grant who unlike general hooker in may of the preceding year seem fully to have understand the unfavorable nature of the region for manoeuvre a large army he adversary have however force he to accept battle leave he no choice and the result of the action of the 5th and 6th have be such as to determine the federal commander to emerge as soon as possible from the tangled underwood which hamper all he movement on the 7th he accordingly make no movement to attack lee and on the night of that day march rapidly in the direction of hanover junction follow the road by todd 's tavern toward spottsylvania court-house for this determination to avoid further fighting in the wilderness general grant give a singular explanation on the morning of the 7th he say reconnoissance show that the enemy _ have fall behind he intrenched line _ with picket to the front cover a part of the battle-field from this it be evident that the two-day ' fighting have satisfy he of he inability to further maintain the contest in the open field _ notwithstanding he advantage of position _ and that he would wait a attack behind he work the intrenched line and advantage of position of lee be both imaginary no line of intrenchment have be make and the ground be not more favorable on general lee 's side than on general grant 's both army have erect impromptu breastwork of fell tree and earth as continue to be they habit throughout the campaign and the flat country give no special advantage to either the forward movement of general grant be susceptible of much easier explanation the result of the two-day ' fighting have very far from pleased he he desire to avoid further conflict in so difficult a country and take advantage of the quiescence of lee and the hour of darkness he move with he army toward the more open country iv the 12th of may throughout the entire day succeed this first great conflict general lee remain quiet watch for some movement of he adversary he success in the preliminary straggle have be gratify consider the great disproportion of number but he indulge no expectation of a retrograde movement across the rapidan on the part of general grant he expect he rather to advance and anxiously await some development of this intention there be no indication of such a design up to the night of the 7th but at that time to use the word of a confidential member of lee 's staff he all at once seem to conceive the idea that he enemy be prepare to forsake he position and move toward hanover junction _ via _ the spottsylvanium court-house and believe this he at once detail anderson 's division with order to proceed rapidly toward the court-house general anderson commence he march about nine o'clock at night when the federal column be already upon its way a race now begin for the coveted position and general stuart with he dismount sharp-shooter behind improvise breastwork harass and impede the federal advance at every step throughout the night this greatly delay they march and they head of column do not reach the vicinity of spottsylvania court-house until past sunrise general warren lead the federal advance then hurry forward follow by general hancock when suddenly he find himself in front of breastwork and be receive with a fire of musketry lee have succeed in interpose himself between general grant and richmond on the same evening the bulk of the two army be face each other on the line of the po by the rapidity of he movement general lee have thus completely defeat he adversary 's design to seize on the important point spottsylvanium court-house general grant apparently conceive some explanation of this untoward event to be necessary write : the enemy have become aware of we movement and _ have the shorter line _ be enable to reach there first the statement that general lee have the shorter of the two line to march over be a mistake the army move over parallel road until beyond todd 's tavern after which the distance to the south bank of the po be greater by lee 's route than general grant 's the map will sufficiently indicate this two other circumstance defeat general grant 's attempt to reach the point first -- the extreme rapidity of the march of the confederate advance force and the excellent fighting of stuart 's dismount man who harass and delay general warren lead the federal advance throughout the entire night a additional fact should be mention bear upon this point and upon general lee 's design general lee 's order to I say general early who from the sickness of ap hill have be assign to the command of the corps be to _ move by todd 's tavern along the brock road _ to spottsylvania court-house as soon as we front be clear of the enemy from this order it would appear either that general lee regard the brock road over which general grant move as the shorter line or that he intend the movement of early on the enemy 's rear to operate as a check upon they while he go forward to they front with he main body these comment may seem tedious to the general reader but all that illustrate the military design or defend the good soldiership of lee be worthy of record we proceed now to the narrative in the wilderness general grant have find a dangerous enemy ready to strike at he flank he now see in he front the same active and wary adversary prepare to bar the direct road to richmond general lee have take up he position on the south bank of one of the four tributary of the mattapony these four stream be know as the mat ta po and nye river and bear the same relation to the main stream that the finger of the open hand do to the wrist general lee be behind the po which be next to the nye the northernmost of these water-course both be difficult to cross and they bank heavily wood it be now to be see whether either by a front attack or a turn movement general grant could oust he adversary and whether general lee would stand on the defensive or attack all day during the 9th the two army be construct breastwork along they entire front and these work from the rapidan to the bank of the chickahominy remain yet in existence on the evening of this day a federal force be throw across the po on the confederate left but soon withdraw and on the 10th a similar movement take place near the same point which result in a brief but bloody conflict during which the wood take fire and many of the assaulting troops perish miserably in the flame the force be then recall and during that night and the succeed day nothing of importance occur although heavy skirmishing and a artillery-fire take place along the line on the morning of the 12th at the first dawn of day general grant make a more important and dangerous assault than any yet undertake in the campaign this be direct at a salient on general lee 's right center occupy by johnson 's division of ewell 's corps and be one of the bloodiest and most terrible incident of the war for this assault general grant be say to have select he best troops these advance in a heavy charge column through the half darkness of dawn pass silently over the confederate skirmisher scarcely firing a shot and just as the first streak of daylight touch the eastern wood burst upon the salient which they storm at the point of the bayonet in consequence of the suddenness of the assault and the absence of artillery -- against whose removal general johnston be state to have protest and which arrive too late -- the federal force carry all before they and gain possession of the work in spite of a stubborn and bloody resistance such be the excellent success of the federal movement and the southern line seem to be hopelessly disrupt nearly the whole of johnson 's division be take prisoner -- the number amount to about three thousand -- and eighteen piece of artillery fall into the hand of the assault column the position of affair be now exceedingly critical and unless general lee could reform he line at the point it seem that nothing be leave he but a abandonment of he whole position the federal army have break he line be pour into the opening and to prevent he from concentrate at the point to regain possession of the work heavy attack be begin by the enemy on he right and leave wing it be probable that at no time during the war be the southern army in greater danger of a bloody and decisive disaster at this critical moment general lee act with the nerve and coolness of a soldier whom no adverse event can shake those who see he will testify to the stern courage of he expression the glance of the eye which indicate a great nature arouse to the depth of its powerful organization line of battle be promptly form a short distance in rear of the salient then in the enemy 's possession and a fierce charge be make by the southerner under the eye of lee to regain it it be on this occasion that on fire with the ardor of battle which so seldom master he lee go forward in front of he line and take he station beside the color of one of he virginian regiment take off he hat and turn to the man point toward the enemy a storm of cheer greet the general as he sit he gray war-horse in front of the man -- he head bare he eye flash and he cheek flush with the fighting-blood of the soldier general gordon however spur to he side and seize he rein general lee he exclaim this be no place for you go to the rear these be virginian and georgian sir -- man who have never fail -- man you will not fail now he cry rise in he stirrup and address the troops no no be the reply of the man and from the whole line burst the shout lee to the rear lee to the rear instead of be need it be obvious that he presence be a embarrassment as the man seem determine not to charge unless he retire he accordingly do so and the line advance to the attack lead by general gordon and other officer of approve ability and courage the charge which follow be resolute and the word ferocious best describe the struggle which follow it continue throughout the entire day lee make not less than five distinct assault in heavy force to recover the work the fight involve the troops on both flank and be desperate and unyielding the oppose flag be at time within only a few yard of each other and so incessant and concentrate be the fire of musketry that a tree of about eighteen inch in diameter be cut down by bullet and be still preserve it be say in the city of washington as a memorial of this bloody struggle -lrb- illustration : the wilderness lee to the rear -rrb- the fight only cease several hour after dark lee have not regain he advanced line of work but he be firmly root in a interior and straighter line from which the federal troops have find it impossible to dislodge he this result of the stubborn action be essentially a success as general grant 's aim in the operation have be to break asunder he adversary 's army -- in which he very nearly succeed at midnight all be again silent the ground near the salient be strew with dead body the loss of the three thousand man and eighteen gun of johnson have be follow by a bloody retaliation the federal commander have lose more than eight thousand man v from spottsylvanium to the chickahominy after the bloody action of the 12th of may general grant remain quiet for many day await he say the arrival of reënforcements from washington the number of these fresh troops be not know to the present writer general lee have no reinforcement to expect and continue to confront he adversary with he small army which must have be reduce by the heavy fight to less than forty thousand man while that of general grant number probably about one hundred and forty thousand finding that he opponent be not dispose to renew hostility general lee on the 19th of may send general ewell to turn he right flank but this movement result in nothing save the discovery by general ewell that the federal army be move this intelligence be dispatch to general lee on the evening of the 21st and reach he at souther 's house on the bank of the po where he be calmly reconnoitr the position of the enemy as soon as he read the note of general ewell he mount he horse say in he grave voice to he staff come gentleman and order be send to the army to prepare to move the troops begin they march on the same night in the direction of hanover junction which they reach on the evening of the 22d when on may 23d general grant reach the bank of the north anna he find lee station on the south bank ready to oppose he cross the failure of general grant to reach and seize upon the important point of hanover junction before the arrival of lee decide the fate of the plan of campaign originally devise by he if the reader will glance at the map of virginium this fact will become apparent hanover junction be the point where the virginium central and richmond and fredericksburg railroad cross each other and be situate in the angle of the north anna and south anna river which unite a short distance below to form the pamunkey once in possession of this point general grant would have have easy communication with the excellent base of supplies at aquium creek would have cut the virginium central railroad and a direct march southward would have enable he to invest richmond from the north and northwest in accordance with he original plan lee have however reach the point first and from that moment unless the southern force be drive from its position the entire plan of campaign must necessarily be change the great error of general grant in this arduous campaign would seem to have be the feebleness of the attack which he here make upon lee the position of the southern army be not formidable and on he arrival they have have no time to erect defence the river be not difficult of cross and the ground on the south bank give no decide advantage to a force occupy it in spite of these fact -- which it be proper to say general grant deny however -- nothing be effect and but little attempt a few word will sum up the operation of the army during the two or three day reach the river general grant throw a column across some mile up the stream at a point know as jericho ford where a brief but obstinate encounter ensue between general hill and warren and this be follow by the capture of a old redoubt defend the chesterfield bridge near the railroad cross opposite lee 's right which enable another column to pass the stream at that point these two successful passage of the river on lee 's left and right seem to indicate a fix intention on the part of he adversary to press both the southern flank and bring on a decisive engagement and to coöperate in this plan a third column be now throw over opposite lee 's center these movement be however promptly meet lee retire he two wing but strike suddenly with he center at the force attempt to cross there and then active operation on both side cease in spite of have pass the river with the bulk of he army and form line of battle general grant resolve not to attack he explanation of this be that lee 's position be find stronger than either of he previous one such be the result of the able disposition of the southern force at this important point general grant find he whole program reverse and on the night of the 26th silently withdraw and hasten down the north bank of the pamunkey toward hanovertown precede by the cavalry of general sheridan that officer have be detach from the army as it approach spottsylvania court-house to make a rapid march toward richmond and destroy the confederate communication in this he partially succeed but attempt to ride into richmond be repulse with considerable loss the only important result indeed of the expedition be the death of general stuart this distinguished commander of general lee 's cavalry have be direct to pursue general sheridan have do so with he customary promptness and intercept he column near richmond at a spot know as the yellow tavern and here in a stubborn engagement in which stuart strive to supply he want of troops by the fury of he attack the great chief of cavalry be mortally wound and expire soon afterward he fall be a grievous blow to general lee 's heart as well as to the southern cause endow by nature with a courage which shrink from nothing active energetic of immense physical stamen which enable he to endure any amount of fatigue devoted heart and soul to the cause in which he fight and look up to the commander of the army with childlike love and admiration stuart could be ill spare at this critical moment and general lee be plunge into the deepest melancholy at the intelligence of he death when it reach he he retire from those around he and remain for some time commune with he own heart and memory when one of he staff enter and speak of stuart general lee say in a low voice i can scarcely think of he without weep the command of the cavalry devolve upon general hampton and it be fight throughout the succeed campaign with the nerve and efficiency of a great soldier but stuart have as it be form and mould it with he own hand he be the first great commander of horse in the war and it be hard for he successor however great they genius to compete with he memory he name will thus remain that of the greatest and most prominent cavalry-officer of the war cross the pamunkey at hanovertown after a rapid night-march general grant send out a force toward hanover court-house to cut off lee 's retreat or discover he position this result in nothing since general lee have not move in that direction he have as soon as the movement of general grant be discover put he line in motion direct he march across the country on the direct route to cold harbor and halt behind the tottapotomous have form he line there to check the progress of he adversary on the main road from hanovertown toward richmond for the third time thus general grant have find he adversary in he path and no generalship or rapidity in the movement of he column seem sufficient to secure to he the advantage of a surprise on each occasion the march of the federal army have take place in the night from the wilderness on the night of may 7th from spottsylvanium on the night of may 21st and from near the north anna on the night of may 26th lee have imitate these movement of he opponent interpose on each occasion at the critical moment in he path and invite battle this last statement may be regard as too strongly express as it seem the opinion of northern writer that lee in these movement aim only to maintain a strict defensive and by means of breastwork simply keep he adversary at arm 's length this be a entire mistake confident of the efficiency of he army small as it be he be always desirous to bring on a decisive action under favorable circumstance general early bear he testimony to the truth of this statement i happen to know say this officer that general lee have always the greatest anxiety to strike at grant in the open field during the whole movement from the wilderness to cold harbor the confederate commander be in excellent spirit when at hanover junction he speak of the situation almost jocosely and say to the venerable dr gwathmey speaking of general grant if i can get one more pull at he i will defeat he this expression do not seem to indicate any depression or want of confidence in he ability to meet general grant in a open pitched battle it may however be ask why if such be he desire he do not come out from behind he breastwork and fight the reply be that general grant invariably defend he line by breastwork as powerful as -- in many case much more powerful than -- he adversary 's the oppose mound of earth and tree along the route of the two army remain to prove the truth of what be here state at cold harbor especially the federal work be veritable fort in face of they the theory that general grant uniformly act upon the offensive without fear of offensive operation in turn on the part of lee will be find untenable nor be this statement make with the view of represent general grant as over-cautious or of detract from he merit as a commander it be on the contrary highly honorable to he that oppose to a adversary of such ability he should have neglect nothing reach the tottapotomous general grant find he opponent in a strong position behind that sluggish water-course prepare to dispute the road to richmond and it now become necessary to force the passage in he front or by another flank march move still farther to the left and endeavor to cross the chickahominy somewhere in the vicinity of cold harbor this last operation be determine upon by general grant and send he cavalry toward cold harbor he move rapidly in the same direction with he infantry this movement be discover at once by lee he send longstreet 's corps forward and when the federal army arrive the southern force be draw up in they front between they and richmond thus bar for the fourth time in the campaign the road to the capital during these movement nearly continuous fighting have take place between the oppose column which cling to each other as it be each shape its march more or less by that of the other at last they have reach the ground upon which the obstinate struggle of June 1862 have take place and it now become necessary for general grant either to form some new plan of campaign or by throw he whole army in one great mass against he adversary break through all obstacle cross the chickahominy and seize upon richmond this be now resolve upon heavy fighting take place on June 2d near bethesda church and at other point while the army be come into position but this be feel to be but the preface to the greater struggle which general lee now clearly divine it come without loss of time on the morning of the 3d of June soon after daylight general grant throw he whole army straightforward against lee 's front -- all along he line the conflict which follow be one of those bloody grapple rather than battle which discard all manoeuvring or brain-work in the commander depend for the result upon the brute strength of the force engage the action do not last half a hour and in that time the federal loss be thirteen thousand man when general lee send a messenger to ap hill ask the result of the assault on he part of the line hill take the officer with he in front of he work and point to the dead body which be literally lie upon each other say : tell general lee it be the same all along my front the federal army have indeed sustain a blow so heavy that even the constant mind and fix resolution of general grant and the federal authority seem to have be shake the war seem hopeless to many person in the north after the frightful bloodshed of this thirty minute at cold harbor of which fact there be sufficient proof so gloomy say a northern historian -lrb- 1 -rrb- be the military outlook after the action on the chickahominy and to such a degree by consequence have the moral spring of the public mind become relax that there be at this time great danger of a collapse of the war the history of this conflict truthfully write will show this the archive of the state department when one day make public will show how deeply the government be affect by the want of military success and to what resolution the executive have in consequence come have not success elsewhere come to brighten the horizon it would have be difficult to have raise new force to recruit the army of the potomac which shake in its structure its valor quench in blood and thousand of its ablest officer kill and wound be the army of the potomac no more -lrb- footnote 1 : mr swinton in he able and candid campaign of the army of the potomac -rrb- the campaign of one month -- from may 4th to June 4th -- have cost the federal commander sixty thousand man and three thousand officer -- number which be give on the authority of federal historian -- while the loss of lee do not exceed eighteen thousand the result would seem a unfavorable comment upon the choice of the route across the country from culpepper instead of that by the jame general mcclellan two year before have reach cold harbor with trifling loss to attain the same point have cost general grant a frightful number of life nor could it be say that he have any important success to offset this loss he have not defeat he adversary in any of the battle-field of the campaign nor do it seem that he have stricken he any serious blow the army of northern virginium not reënforced until it reach hanover junction and then only by about nine thousand man under general breckinridge and pickett have hold its ground against the large force oppose to it have repulse every assault and in a final trial of strength with a force largely its superior have inflict upon the enemy in about a hour a loss of thirteen thousand man these fact highly honorable to lee and he troops be the plainest and most compendious comment we can make upon the campaign the whole movement of general grant across virginium be indeed now concede even by he admirer to have be unfortunate it fail to accomplish the end expect from it -- the investment of richmond on the north and west -- and the life of about sixty thousand man be it would seem unnecessarily lose to reach a position which might have be attain with loss comparatively trifling and without the unfortunate prestige of defeat vi first battle at petersburg general lee remain face he adversary in he line at cold harbor for many day after the bloody struggle of the 3d of June confident of he ability to repulse any new attack and completely bar the way to richmond the federal campaign it be now see be at a end on that line and it be obvious that general grant must adopt some other plan in spite of he determination express in the beginning of the campaign to fight it out on that line if it take all the summer the summer be but begin and further fighting on that line be hopeless under these circumstance the federal commander resolve to give up the attempt to assail richmond from the north or east and by a rapid movement to petersburg seize upon that place cut the confederate railroad lead southward and thus compel a evacuation of the capital -lrb- illustration : map of petersburg and environs -rrb- it would be interesting to inquire what the course of general lee would have be in the event of the success of this plan and how the war would have result it would seem that under such circumstance he only resource would have be to retire with he army in the direction of lynchburg where he communication would have remain open with the south and west if drive from that point the fastness of the alleghany be at hand and contemplate afterward the possibility of be force to take refuge there he say : with my army in the mountain of virginium i could carry on this war for twenty year longer that spectacle be lose to the world -- lee and he army fight from mountain fastness to mountain fastness -- and the annals of war be not illustrate by a chapter so strange that lee be confident of he ability to carry on such a struggle successfully be certain and washington have conceive the same idea in the old revolution when he say that if he be drive from the seaboard he would take refuge in west augusta and thereby prolong the war interminably to return from these speculation to the narrative of event general grant remain in front of lee until the 12th of June when move again by he left flank he cross the chickahominy proceed in the direction of city point at which place the appomattox and jame river mingle they water and cross the jame on pontoon hasten forward in order to seize upon petersburg this important undertaking have be strangely neglect by major-general butler who in obedience to general grant 's order have sail from fortress monroe on the 4th of may reach bermuda hundred the peninsula opposite city point make by a remarkable bend in jame river and proceed to intrench himself it be in he power on he arrival to have seize upon petersburg but this he fail to do at that time and the appearance of a force under general beauregard from the south soon induce he to give he entire attention to he own safety a attack by beauregard have be promptly make which nearly result in general butler 's destruction he succeed however in retire behind he work across the neck of the peninsula in which he now find himself completely shut up and so powerless be he situation with he large force of thirty thousand man that general grant write he army be as completely shut off as if it have be in a bottle strongly cork the attempt of general grant to seize upon petersburg by a surprise fail he force be not able to reach the vicinity of the place until the 15th when they be bravely oppose behind impromptu work by a body of local troops who fight like regular soldier and succeed in hold the work until night end the contest when morning come long line be see defile into the breastwork and the familiar battle-flag of the army of northern virginium rise above the long line of bayonet give assurance that the possession of petersburg would be obstinately dispute general lee have move with he accustomed celerity and as usual without that loss of time which result from doubt of a adversary 's intention if general grant retire without another battle on the chickahominy it be obvious to lee that he must design one of two thing : either to advance upon richmond from the direction of charle city or attempt a campaign against the capital from the south of jame river lee seem at once to have satisfy himself that the latter be the design a inconsiderable force be send to feel the enemy near the white-oak swamp he be encounter there in some force but satisfy that this be a feint to mislead he general lee proceed to cross the jame river above drury 's bluff near wilton and concentrate he army at petersburg on the 16th he be in face of he adversary there general grant have adopt the plan of campaign which lee expect he to adopt general mcclellan have not be permit in 1862 to carry out the same plan it be now undertake by general grant who sustain better relation toward the government and the result would seem to indicate that general mcclellan be after all a soldier of sound view as soon as general lee reach petersburg he begin promptly to draw a regular line of earthwork around the city to the east and south for its defense it be obvious that general grant would lose no time in striking at he in order to take advantage of the slight character of the defence already exist and this anticipation be speedily realize general lee have scarcely get he force in position on the 16th when he be furiously attack and such be the weight of this assault that lee be force from he advanced position east of the city behind he second line of work by this time well forward in process of construction against this new line general grant throw heavy force in attack after attack on the 17th and 18th lose it be say more than four thousand man but effect nothing on the 21st general lee be call upon to meet a more formidable assault than any of the precede one -- this time more to he right in the vicinity of the weldon railroad which run southward from petersburg a heavy line be advance in that quarter by the enemy but observe that a interval have be leave between two of they corps general lee throw forward a column under general hill cut the federal line and repulse they attack bear off nearly three thousand prisoner on the same night a important cavalry expedition consist of the division of general wilson and kautz numbering about six thousand horse be send westward to cut the weldon southside and danville railroad which connect the southern army with the south and west this raid result in apparently great but really unimportant injury to the confederate communication against which it be direct the federal cavalry tear up large portion of the track of all three railroad burn the wood-work and lay waste the country around but the further result of the expedition be unfavorable they be pursue and harass by a small body of cavalry under general w hf lee and on they return in the direction of ream 's station be meet near sapponey church by a force of fifteen hundred cavalry under general hampton that energetic officer at once attack the fighting continue furiously throughout the entire night and at dawn the federal horse retreat in confusion they misfortune be not however end near ream 's at which point they attempt to cross the weldon railroad they be meet by general fitz lee 's horseman and about two hundred infantry under general mahone and this force complete they discomfiture after a brief attempt to force they way through the unforeseen obstacle they break in disorder leave behind they twelve piece of artillery and more than a thousand prisoner and with foam and exhaust horse regain the federal line such be the result of a expedition from which general grant probably expect much the damage do to lee 's communication be inconsiderable and do not repay the federal commander for the loss sustain the railroad be soon repair and in work order again and the federal cavalry be for the time render unfit for further operation it be now the end of June and every attempt make by general grant to force lee 's line have prove unsuccessful it be apparent that surprise of the able commander of the confederate army be hopeless he work be grow stronger every day and nothing be leave to he great adversary but to lay regular siege to the long line of fortification to draw line for the protection of he own front from attack and by gradually extend he left reach out toward the weldon and southside railroad to obtain possession of these road be from this time general grant 's great object and all he movement be shape by that paramount consideration vii the siege of richmond begin the first day of July 1864 witness at petersburg the commencement of a series of military maneuver for which few if any precedent exist in all the annals of war a army of forty or fifty thousand man intrench along a line extend finally over a distance of nearly forty mile be defend against a force of about thrice its number a capital more than twenty mile in its rear and from July of one year to April of the next there never be a moment when to have break through this line would not have terminate the war and result in the destruction of the confederacy a few word in reference to the topography of the country and the situation will show this petersburg be twenty-two mile south of richmond and be connect with the south and west by the weldon and southside railroad which latter road cross the danville railroad the main line of communication between the capital and the gulf state with the enemy once hold these road and those north of the city as they be prepare to do the capital would be isolate and the confederate government must evacuate virginium in that event the army of northern virginium have also nothing leave to it but retreat virginium must be abandon the federal authority would be extend over the oldest and one of the largest and most important member of the confederacy and under circumstance so adverse it might well be a question whether dishearten as they would be by the loss of so powerful a ally the other state of the confederacy would have sufficient resolution to continue the contest these consideration be say to have be fully weigh by general lee whose far-reaching military sagacity divine the exact situation of affair and the probable result of a conflict so unequal as that which general grant now force upon he we have notice on a precede page he opinion upon this subject express to a confidential friend as far back as 1862 he then declare that the true line of assault upon richmond be that now adopt by general grant as long as the capital be assail from the north or the east he might hope with some reason by hard fight to repulse the assault and hold richmond but with a enemy at petersburg threaten with a large force the southern railroad it be obviously only a question of time when richmond and consequently virginium must be abandon general lee we repeat fully realize the fact here state when he adversary give up all other line cross jame river to petersburg lee be say we know not with what truth to have coolly recommend a evacuation of richmond but this meet with no favor a powerful party include both the friend and enemy of the executive speak of the movement as a pernicious idea if recommend by lee it be speedily abandon and all the energy of the government be concentrate upon the difficult task of hold the enemy at arm 's length south of the appomattox and in charle city in a few week after the appearance of the adversary opposite each other at petersburg the line of leaguer and defense be draw and the long struggle begin general grant have cross a force into charle city on the north bank of jame river and thus menace richmond with a assault from that quarter he line extend thence across the neck of the peninsula of bermuda hundred and east and south of petersburg where day by day it gradually reach westward approach nearer and nearer to the railroad feed the southern army and capital lee 's line conform itself to that of he adversary in addition to the work east and southeast of richmond a exterior chain of defence have be draw face the hostile force near deep bottom and the river at drury 's bluff a fortification of some strength have be guard by sunken obstruction against the approach of the federal gunboat the southern line then continue face those of the enemy north of the appomattox and cross that stream extend around the city of petersburg gradually move westward in conformity with the work of general grant a glance at the accompany diagram will clearly indicate the position and relation to each other of the federal and confederate work these will show that the real struggle be anticipate by both commander west of petersburg and as the day wear on it be more and more apparent that somewhere in the vicinity of dinwiddie court-house the last great wrestle of the oppose army must take place to that conclusive trial of strength we shall advance with as few interruption as possible the operation of the two army at petersburg do not possess for the general reader that dramatic interest which be find in battle such as those of chancellorsville and gettysburg decide for the time the fate of great campaign at petersburg the fight seem to decide little and the bloody collision have no name the day of pitched battle indeed seem past it be one long battle day and night week after week and month after month -- during the heat of summer the sad hour of autumn and the cold day and night of winter it be in fact the siege of richmond which general grant have undertake and the fight consist less of battle in the ordinary acceptation of that word than of attempt to break through the line of he adversary -- now north of jame river now east of petersburg now at some point in the long chain of redan which guard the approach to the coveted southside railroad which once in possession of the federal commander would give he victory of this long obstinate and bloody struggle we shall describe only those prominent incident which rise above the rest with a species of dramatic splendor for the full narrative the reader must have recourse to military history aim to chronicle the operation of each corps division and brigade in the two army -- a minuteness of detail beyond we scope and probably not desire by those who will peruse these page viii lee threaten washington the month of July begin and go upon its way with incessant fight all along the confederate front both north of jame river and south of the appomattox general grant be thus engage in the persistent effort to at some point break through he opponent 's work when intelligence suddenly reach he by telegraph from washington that a strong confederate column have advance down the shenandoah valley cross the potomac and be rapidly move eastward in the direction of the federal capital this portentous incident be the result of a plan of great boldness devise by general lee from which he expect much a few word will explain this plan a portion of general grant 's plan of campaign have be a advance up the valley and another from western virginium toward the lynchburg and tennessee railroad -- the two column to coöperate with the main army by cut the confederate communication the column in western virginium effect little but that in the valley under general hunter hasten forward almost unopposed from the small number of the southern force and early in June threaten lynchburg the news reach lee at cold harbor soon after he battle there with general grant and he promptly detach general early at the head of about eight thousand man with order to move to the valley through swift-run gap or brown 's gap attack hunter and then cross the potomac and threaten washington -lrb- footnote : this statement of he order be derive from lieutenant-general early -rrb- general early a officer of great energy and intrepidity move without loss of time and a engagement ensue between he and general hunter near lynchburg the battle be soon decide general hunter who have more cruelly oppress the inhabitant of the valley than even general milroy be completely defeat drive in disorder flight toward the ohio and early hasten down the valley and thence into maryland with the view of threatening washington as he have be order to do by lee he march be exceedingly rapid and he find the road unobstructed until he reach the monocacy near frederick city where he be oppose by a force under general wallace this force he attack and soon drive from the field he then press forward and on the 11th of July come in sight of washington it be the intelligence of this advance of a confederate force into maryland and toward the capital which come to startle general grant while he be hotly engage with lee at petersburg the washington authority seem to have be completely unnerved and to have regard the capture of the city as nearly inevitable general grant however stand firm and do not permit the terror of the civil authority to affect he he send forward to washington two army corps and these arrive just in time if it have be in the power of general early to capture washington -- which seem questionable -- the opportunity be lose he find himself compel to retire across the potomac again to avoid a attack in he rear and this he effect without loss take up in accordance with order from lee a position in the valley where he remain for some month a standing threat to the enemy such be the famous march of general early to washington and there seem at present little reason to doubt that the federal capital have a narrow escape from capture by the confederate what the result of so singular a event would have be it be difficult to say but it be certain that it would have put a end to general grant 's entire campaign at petersburg then -- but speculation of this character be simply loss of time the city be not capture the war go upon its way and be destine to terminate by pure exhaustion of one of the combatant unaffected by _ coup de main _ in any part of the theater of conflict we have briefly speak of the engagement between general early and hunter near lynchburg and the abrupt retreat of the latter to the western mountain and thence toward the ohio it may interest the reader to know general lee 's view on the subject of this retreat which it seem be draw from he by a letter address to he by general hunter : as soon after the war as mail communication be open write the gentleman of high character from whom we derive this incident general david hunter write to general lee beg that he would answer he frankly on two point : ' i he -lrb- hunter 's -rrb- campaign in 1864 be undertake on information receive by general halleck that general lee be about to detach forty thousand pick troops to send to georgium do not he -lrb- hunter 's -rrb- move prevent this ` ii when he find it necessary to retreat from lynchburg do he not take the most feasible route ' general lee write a very courteous reply in which he say : ' i general halleck be misinform i have _ no troops to spare _ and forty thousand would have take nearly my whole army ` ii i be not advise as to the motive which induce you to adopt you line of retreat and be not perhaps competent to judge of the question _ but i certainly expect you to retreat by way _ of the shenandoah valley ' general hunter add we correspondent never publish this letter but i hear general lee tell of it one day with evident pleasure lee 's opinion of the military ability of both general hunter and sheridan be indeed far from flattering he regard those two commander -- especially general sheridan -- as enjoy reputation solely confer upon they by the exhaustion of the resource of the confederacy and not warrant by any military efficiency in themselves ix the mine explosion the end of the month of July be now approach and every attempt make by general grant to break through lee 's line have result in failure at every point which he assail a armed force sufficient to repulse he most vigorous attack seem to spring from the earth and no movement of the federal force however sudden and rapid have be able to take the confederate commander unaware the campaign be apparently settle down into stubborn fighting day and night in which the object of general grant be to carry out he program of attrition such be the feeling in both army when at dawn on the 30th of July a loud explosion hear for thirty mile take place on the line near petersburg and a vast column of smoke shooting upward to a great height seem to indicate the blow up of a extensive magazine instead of a magazine it be a mine which have thus be explode and the incident be not the least singular of a campaign unlike any which have precede it the plan of form a breach in the southern work by explode a mine beneath they be say by northern writer to have originate with a subordinate officer of the federal army who observe the close proximity of the oppose work near petersburg conceive it feasible to construct a subterranean gallery reach beneath those of general lee the undertaking be begin the earth be carry off in cracker-box and such be the steady persistence of the workman that a gallery five hundred foot long with lateral opening beneath the confederate work be soon finish and in these lateral recess be place a large amount of powder all be now ready and the question be how to utilize the explosion general grant decide to follow it by a sudden charge through the breach seize a crest in rear and thus interpose a force directly in the center of lee 's line a singular discussion however arise and cause some embarrassment should the assault column consist of white or negro troops this question be decide general grant afterward declare by pull straw or toss copper -- the white troops be the fortunate or unfortunate one -- and on the morning of July 30th the mine be explode the effect be frightful and the incident will long be remember by those present and escape unharmed the small southern force and artillery immediately above the mine be hurl into the air a open one hundred and fifty foot long sixty foot wide and thirty foot deep suddenly appear where a moment before have extend the confederate earthwork and the federal division select for the charge rush forward to pierce the open the result do not justify the sanguine expectation which seem to have be excite in the breast of the federal officer a southern writer thus describe what ensue : the ` white division ' charge reach the crater stumble over the _ débris _ be suddenly meet by a merciless fire of artillery enfilade they right and left and of infantry fusillade they in front falter hesitate be badly lead lost heart give up the plan of seize the crest in rear huddle into the crater man on top of man company mingle with company and upon this disorder unstrung quiver mass of human being white and black -- for the black troops have follow -- be pour a hurricane of shot shell canister musketry which make the hideous crater a slaughter-pen horrible and frightful beyond the power of word all order be lose all idea of charge the crest abandon lee 's infantry be see concentrate for the carnival of death he artillery be mass to destroy the remnant of the charge division those who desert the crater to scramble over the _ débris _ and run back be shoot down then all that be leave to the shudder mass of black and whites in the pit be to shrink lower evade the horrible _ mitraille _ and wait for a charge of they friend to rescue they or surrender these sentence sufficiently describe the painful scene which follow the explosion of the mine the charge column be unable to advance in face of the very heavy fire direct upon they by the southern infantry and artillery and the effect of this fire be so appalling that general mahone command at the spot be say to have order it to cease add that the spectacle make he sick the federal force finally succeed in make they way back with a loss of about four thousand prisoner and general lee whose loss have be small reëstablished he line without interruption before pass from this incident a singular circumstance connect with it be deserving of mention this be the declaration of the congressional committee which in due time investigate the whole affair the conclusion of the committee be not flattering to the veteran army of the potomac the report declare that the first and great cause of disaster be the employment of white instead of black troops to make the charge x end of the campaign of 1864 throughout the month of August and September lee continue to be attack at various point along he entire front but succeed in repulse every assault general grant 's design may be say in general term to have be a steady extension of he left toward the confederate communication west of petersburg while take the chance by attack north of jame river to break through in that quarter and seize upon richmond it be probable that he hope of effect the last-mentioned object be small but operation in that direction promise the more probable result of cause lee to weaken he right and thus uncover the southside railroad a indecisive attack on the north of jame river be follow toward the end of August by a heavy advance to seize upon the weldon railroad near petersburg in this general grant succeed a event clearly foresee by lee who have long before inform the authority that he could not hold this road general grant follow up this success by send heavy force to seize ream 's station on the same road farther south and afterward to destroy it to hicksford -- which however effect less favorable result lee meeting and defeat both force after obstinate engagement in which the federal troops lose heavily and be compel to retreat these vary success do not however materially affect the general result the federal left gradually reach farther and farther westward until finally it have pass the vaughan squirrel level and other road run south-westward from petersburg and in October be establish on the left bank of hatcher 's run which unite with gravelly run to form the rowanty it be now obvious that a further extension of the federal left would probably enable general grant to seize upon the southside railroad a energetic attempt be speedily make by he to effect this important object to which it be say he attach great importance from its anticipated bearing on the approach presidential election on the 27th of October a heavy column be throw across hatcher 's run in the vicinity of burgess 's mill on the boydton road and a obstinate attack be make on lee 's line there with the view of break through to the southside road in this however general grant do not succeed he column be meet in front and flank by general hampton -- who here lose he brave son preston -- and whf lee with dismount sharp-shooter infantry be hasten to the threaten point by general lee and after a obstinate struggle the federal force be drive back general lee report that general mahone charge and break three line of battle -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ dispatch of lee October _ 28 1864 -- it be the habit of general lee throughout the last campaign of the war to send to richmond from time to time brief dispatch announce whatever occur along the line and these in the absence of official report of these occurrence on the confederate side be valuable record of the progress of affair these brief summary be reliable from the absence of all exaggeration but can not be depend upon by the historian for a very singular reason namely that almost invariably the confederate success be understate on the present occasion the federal loss in prisoner near burgess 's mill and east of richmond -- where general grant have attack at the same time to effect a diversion -- be put down by general lee at eight hundred whereas thirteen hundred and sixty-five be receive at richmond lee 's dispatch of October 28th be here give as a specimen of these brief military report headquarters army northern virginium _ October _ 28 1864 _ hon secretary of war _ : general hill report that the attack of general heth upon the enemy on the boydton plank-road mention in my dispatch last evening be make by three brigade under general mahone in front and general hampton in the rear mahone capture four hundred prisoner three stand of color and six piece of artillery the latter could not be bring off the enemy have possession of the bridge in the attack subsequently make by the enemy general mahone break three line of battle and during the night the enemy retreat from the boydton road leave he wound and more than two hundred and fifty dead on the field about nine o'clock pm a small force assault and take possession of we work on the baxter road in front of petersburg but be soon drive out on the williamsburg road general field capture upward of four hundred prisoner and seven stand of color the enemy leave a number of dead in front of we work and to-day retreat to he former position re lee -rrb- with this repulse of the federal force terminate active operation of importance for the year and but one other attempt be make during the winter to gain ground on the leave this take place early in February and result in failure like the former -- the confederate lose however the brave general john pegram the presidential election at the north have be decide in favor of mr lincoln -- general mcclellan and mr pendleton the suppose advocate of peace suffering defeat the significance of this fact be unmistakable it be now see that unless the confederate fight they way to independence there be no hope of a favorable termination of the war and this conclusion be courageously face by general lee the outlook for the coming year be far from encourage the resource of the confederacy be steadily be reduce she coast be blockade she army be diminish discouragement seem slowly to be invade every heart -- but in the midst of this general foreboding the commander of the army of northern virginium retain a August composure and converse with one of the southern senator say for myself i intend to die sword in hand that he sense of duty do not afterward permit he to do so be perhaps one of the bitterest pang of he whole life xi lee in the winter of 1864 - '65 before enter upon the narrative of the last and decisive campaign of the war we shall speak of the personal demeanor of general lee at this time and endeavor to account for a circumstance which astonish many person -- he surprising equanimity and even cheerfulness under the pressure of care sufficient it would seem to crush the most powerful organization he have establish he headquarters a mile or two west of petersburg on the cox road nearly opposite he center and here he seem to await whatever the future would bring with a tranquillity which be a source of surprise and admiration to all who be throw in contact with he many person will bear they testimony to this extraordinary composure he countenance seldom if ever exhibit the least trace of anxiety but be firm hopeful and encourage those around he in the belief that he be still confident of success that he do not however look forward with any thing like hope to such success we have endeavor already to show from the first he seem to have regard he situation unless he army be largely reënforced as almost desperate those reënforcements do not come and yet as he see he number day by day decrease and general grant 's increase a still larger ratio he retain he courage confront the misfortune close in upon he with unmoved composure and at no time seem to lose he heart of hope of this phenomenon the explanation have be seek in the constitutional courage of the individual and that instinctive rebound against fate which take place in great organization this explanation doubtless be not without a certain amount of truth but a attentive consideration of the principle which guide this eminent soldier throughout he career will show that he equanimity at a moment so try be due to another and more controlling sentiment this sentiment be he devotion to duty -- the sublimest word in we language throughout he entire life he have seek to discover and perform he duty without regard to consequence that have be with he the great question in April 1861 when the war break out : he have decide in he own mind what he ought to do and have not hesitate from that time forward he continue to do what duty command without a murmur in the obscure campaign of western virginia -- in the unnoted work of fortify the southern coast -- in the great campaign which he have subsequently fight -- and everywhere he consciousness of have perform he duty to the best of he knowledge and ability sustain he it sustain he above all at gettysburg where he have do he best give he strength to take upon himself the responsibility of that disaster and now in these last dark day at petersburg it must have be the sense of have do he whole duty and expend upon the cause every energy of he be which enable he to meet the approach catastrophe with a calmness which seem to those around he almost sublime if this be not the explanation of the composure of general lee throughout the last great struggle with the federal army the writer of these page be at a loss to account for it the phenomenon be plain to all eye and crown the soldier with a glory greater than that which he have derive from he most decisive military success great and unmoved in the dark hour as in the bright he seem to have determine to perform he duty to the last and to shape he conduct under whatever pressure of disaster upon the two maxim do you duty and human virtue should be equal to human calamity there be little reason to doubt that general lee see this calamity come for the effort to reënforce he small army with fresh levy seem hopeless the reason for this unfortunate state of thing must be seek elsewhere the unfortunate fact will be state without comment that while the federal army be regularly and largely reënforced so that its number at no time fall below one hundred and fifty thousand man lee 's entire force at petersburg at no time reach sixty thousand and in the spring of 1865 when he still continue to hold he long line of defence number scarcely half of sixty thousand this be the primary cause of the failure of the struggle general grant 's immense hammer continue to beat upon he adversary wear away he strength day by day no new troops arrive to take the place of those who have fall and general lee see draw closer and closer the inevitable hour when drive from he work or with the federal army upon he communication he must cut he way southward or surrender a last circumstance in reference to general lee 's position at this time should be state the fact that from the autumn of 1864 to the end in the spring of 1865 he be feel by the country and the army to be the sole hope of the confederacy to he alone now all man look as the _ deus ex machinâ _ to extricate they from the danger surround they this sentiment need no expression in word it be see in the face and the very tone of voice of all old man visit he and beg he with falter voice not to expose himself for if he be kill all would be lose the troops follow he with they eye or they cheer whenever he appear feel a singular sense of confidence from the presence of the gray-haired soldier in he plain uniform and assure that as long as lee lead they the cause be safe all class of the people thus regard the fate of the confederacy as rest not partially but solely upon the shoulder of lee and although he be not entitle by he rank in the service to direct operation in other quarter than virginium there be a very general desire that the whole conduct of the war everywhere should be intrust to he hand this be do as will be see toward the spring of 1865 but it be too late these notice of general lee individually be necessary to a clear comprehension of the conclude incident of the great conflict it be doubtful if in any other struggle of history the hope of a people be more entirely wrap up in a single individual all criticism of the eminent soldier have long since be silence and it may indeed be say that something like a superstitious confidence in he fortune have become widely disseminate it be the general sentiment even when lee himself see the end surely approach that all be safe while he remain in command of the army this hallucination must have greatly pained he for no one ever see more clearly or be less blind by irrational confidence lee fully understand and represent to the civil authority -- with whom he relation be perfectly friendly and cordial -- that if he line be break at any point the fate of the campaign be seal feeling this truth of which he military sagacity leave he in no doubt he have to bear the further weight of that general confidence which he do not share he do not complain however or in any manner indicate the desperate strait to which he have come he call for fresh troops to supply he loss when they do not arrive he continue to oppose he powerful adversary with the remnant still at he command these be now more like old comrade than mere private soldier under he order what be leave of the army be its best material the fire of battle have test the metal and that which emerge from the furnace be gold free from alloy the man remain with lee be those whom no peril of the cause in which they be fight could dishearten or prompt to desert or even temporarily absent themselves from the southern standard and this _ corps d' élite _ be devoted wholly to they commander for this devotion they certainly have valid reason never have leader exhibit a more systematic unfailing and almost tender care of he troops lee seem to feel that these veteran in they ragged jacket with they gaunt face be personal friend of he own who be entitle to he most affectionate exertion for they welfare he call on the civil authority in they behalf be uncease the burden of these demand be that unless he man 's want be attend to the southern cause be lose and it plainly revolt he sense of the fitness of thing that man upon whom depend the fate of the south should be shoeless in tatters and force to subsist on a quarter of a pound of rancid bacon and a little corn bread when thousand remain out of the army and dodge the enrolling-officer be well clothed and fed and never hear the whistle of a bullet the man understand this care for they and return the affectionate solicitude of they commander in full he be now they ideal of a leader and all that he do be perfect in they eye all awe of he have long since leave they -- they understand what treasure of kindness and simplicity lay under the grave exterior the tattered private approach the commander-in-chief without embarrassment and he reception of they be such as to make they love he more than ever have we space we might dwell upon this marked respect and attention pay by general lee to he private soldier he seem to think they more worthy of mark of regard than he highest officer and there be never the least air of condescension in he when throw with they but a perfect simplicity kindness and unaffected sympathy which go to they heart this be almost a natural gift with lee and arise from the genuine goodness of he heart he feeling toward he soldier be show in a incident which occur at this time and be thus relate in one of the richmond journal : a gentleman who be in the train from this city to petersburg a very cold morning not long ago tell we he attention be attract by the effort of a young soldier with he arm in a sling to get he overcoat on he tooth as well as he sound arm be bring into use to effect the object but in the midst of he effort a officer rise from he seat advance to he and very carefully and tenderly assist he draw the coat gently over he wounded arm and button it up comfortably then with a few kind and pleasant word return to he seat now the officer in question be not clothe in gorgeous uniform with a brilliant wreath upon he collar and a multitude of gilt line upon the sleeve resemble the famous labyrinth of crete but he be clothe in a simple suit of gray distinguish from the garb of a civilian only by the three star which every confederate colonel in the service by the regulation be entitle to wear and yet he be no other than we chief general robert e lee who be not braver than he be good and modest to terminate this brief sketch of general lee personally in the winter of 1864 he look much older than at the beginning of the war but by no means less hardy or robust on the contrary the arduous campaign through which he have pass seem to have harden he -- develop to the highest degree the native strength of he physical organization he cheek be ruddy and he eye have that clear light which indicate the presence of the calm self-poised will but he hair have grow gray like he beard and mustache which be worn short and well-trimmed he dress as always be a plain and serviceable gray uniform with no indication of rank save the star on the collar cavalry-boot reach nearly to he knee and he seldom wear any weapon a broad-brimmed gray-felt hat rest low upon the forehead and the movement of this soldierly figure be as firm measure and impose as ever it be impossible to discern in general lee any evidence of impaired strength or any trace of the wear hardship through which he have pass he seem make of iron and would remain in he saddle all day and then at he desk half the night without apparently feel any fatigue he be still almost a anchorite in he personal habit and live so poorly that it be say he be compel to borrow a small piece of meat when unexpected visitor dine with he such in brief outline be the individual upon whose shoulder in the last month of 1864 and the early part of 1865 rest the southern confederacy xii the situation at the beginning of 1865 in approach the narrative of the last tragic scene of the confederate struggle the writer of these page experience emotion of sadness which will probably be share by not a few even of those reader whose sympathy from the nature of thing be on the side of the north to doubt this would be painful and would indicate a contempt for human nature not only in the eye of he friend and follower but even in the eye of he bitterest enemy lee must surely have appear great and noble right or wrong in the struggle he believe that he be perform he duty and the brave army at he back which have fight so heroically be inspire by the same sentiment and risk all on the issue this great soldier be now about to suffer the cruellest pang which the spite of fate can inflict and he army to be disband to return in poverty and defeat to they home that spectacle be surely tragic and appeal to the hardest heart and if any rejoice in such misery he must have be unsusceptible of the sentiment of admiration for heroism in misfortune the last and decisive struggle between the two army at petersburg begin in march 1865 but event of great importance in many quarter have precede this final conflict the result of which have be to break down all the outer defence of the confederacy leave only the inner citadel still intact the event in question be so familiar to those who will peruse these page that a pass reference to they be all that be necessary affair in the valley of virginium from autumn to spring have steadily proceed from bad to worse in September general sheridan with a force of about forty-five thousand have assail general early near winchester with a force of about eight or nine thousand musket and succeed in drive he up the valley beyond strasburg whence attack a second time he have retreat toward staunton this be follow in October by another battle at cedar run where early attack and nearly crushed general sheridan but eventually be again repulse and force a second time to retreat up the valley to waynesboro ' where in February he little remnant be assail by overwhelming number and dispersed general sheridan who have effect this inglorious but important success then proceed to the lowland join general grant 's army and be ready with he large force of horse to take part in the coming battle a more important success have attend the federal arm in the west general johnston who have be restore to command there at the solicitation of lee have find he force insufficient to oppose general sherman 's large army the confederate have accordingly retreat and general sherman almost unresisted from the exhaustion of he adversary march across the country to savannah which fall a easy prize and thence advance to goldsborough in north carolina where he directly threaten lee 's line of retreat from virginium such be the condition of affair in the month of February and march 1865 in the former month commissioner from the confederate government have meet president lincoln in hampton road but no term of peace could be agree upon the issue be still leave to be decide by arm and every advantage be upon the federal side general lee who have just be appoint general-in-chief -- have thus impose upon he the mockery of a rank no longer of any value -- see the army of the enemy closing in upon he and do not deceive himself with the empty hope that he could longer hold he line at petersburg the country oppress as it be and labor under a sentiment akin to despair still retain in almost undiminished measure its superstitious confidence in he but he himself see clearly the desperate character of the situation general grant be in he front with a force of about one hundred and fifty thousand man and general sherman be about to enter virginium with a army of about the same number lee 's force at petersburg be a little over thirty thousand man -- that of johnston be not so great and be detain by sherman under these circumstance it be obviously only a question of time when the army of northern virginium would be overwhelm in February 1865 these fact be perfectly apparent to general lee : but one course be leave to he -- to retreat from virginium and he promptly begin that movement in the latter part of the month order he train to amelia court-house and direct pontoon to be get ready at roanoke river he aim be simple -- to unite he army with that of general johnston and retreat into the gulf state in the mountain of virginium he could carry on the war he have say for twenty year in the fertile region of the south he might expect to prolong hostility or at least make favorable term of peace -- which would be better than to remain in virginium until he be completely surround and a unconditional submission would alone be leave he it will probably remain a subject of regret to military student that lee be not permit to carry out this retreat into the gulf state the movement be arrest after a consultation with the civil authority at richmond upon what grounds a course so obviously necessary be oppose the present writer be unable to declare whatever the consideration lee yield he judgment the movement suddenly stop and the army of northern virginium -- if a skeleton can be call such -- remain to await its fate the condition of the army in which company scarce exist regiment be count by ten and division by hundred only need not here be elaborately dwell upon it be indeed the phantom of a army and the gaunt face be almost ghostly shoeless in rag with just sufficient coarse food to sustain life but never enough to keep at arm 's - length the gnawing fiend hunger lee 's old veteran remain firm scatter like a thin skirmish-line along forty mile of work while opposite they lay a enemy in the highest state of efficiency and numbering nearly five man to they one that the soldier of the army retain they nerve under circumstance so discourage be surely a honorable fact and will make they name glorious in history they remain unshaken and fight undismayed to the last although they courage be subject to trial of the most exhausting character day and night for month after month the incessant fire of the federal force have continue and every engine of human destruction have be put in play to wear away they strength they fight all through the cheerless day of winter and when they lay down in the cold trench at night the shell of the federal mortar rain down upon they burst and mortally wound they all day long the fire of musket and cannon -- then from sunset to dawn the curving fire of the roar mortar and the steady never-ceasing crack of the sharp-shooter along the front snow or blinding sleet or freezing rain might be fall but the fire go on -- it seem destine to go on to all eternity in march 1865 however the end be approach and general lee must have feel that all be lose he last hope have be the retreat southward in the month of February that hope have be take from he the result be at hand and he private correspondence if he intrust to paper he view of the situation will probably show that from that moment he give up all anticipation of success and prepare to do he simple duty as a soldier leave the issue of affair to providence whatever may have be he emotion they be not reflect in he countenance the same August composure which have accompany he in he previous campaign remain with he still and cheer the faint heart around he to the 2d of April and even up to the end this remarkable calmness continue nearly unchanged and we can offer no explanation of a circumstance so astonishing save that which we have already give in a precede chapter xiii lee attack the federal center general lee become aware as the end of march draw near that preparation be be make in the federal army for some important movement what that movement would be there be little reason to doubt the federal line have be extend gradually toward the southside railroad and it be obvious now that general grant have in view a last and decisive advance in that quarter which should place he on he opponent 's communication and completely intercept he retreat southward the catastrophe which general lee have plainly foresee for many month now stare he in the face and unless he have recourse to some expedient as desperate as the situation the end of the struggle must soon come the sole course leave to he be retreat but this now seem difficult if not impossible general grant have a powerful force not far from the main road over which lee must move and unless a diversion of some description be make it seem barely possible that the southern army could extricate itself this diversion general lee now proceed to make and although we have no authority to state that he object be to follow up the blow if it be successful by a evacuation of he line at petersburg it be difficult to conceive what other design he could have have in risk a operation so critical he have resolve to throw a column against the federal center east of petersburg with the view to break through there and seize the commanding ground in rear of the line he would thus be root in the middle of general grant 's army and the federal left would probably be recall leave the way open if he design to retreat if he design however to fight a last pitched battle which should decide all he would be able to do so in case the federal work be break to greater advantage than under any other circumstance the point fix upon be fort steadman near the south bank of the appomattox where the oppose work be scarcely two hundred yard from each other the ground in front be cover with _ abati _ and otherwise obstruct but it be hope that the assault column would be able to pass over the distance undiscovered in that event a sudden rush would probably carry the work -- a large part of the army would follow -- the hill beyond would be occupy -- and general grant would be compel to concentrate he army at the point for he own protection on the morning of march 25th before dawn the column be ready it consist of three or four thousand man under general gordon but a additional force be hold in reserve to follow up the attack if it succeed just as dawn appear gordon put he column in motion it advance silently over the intervene space make a rush for the federal work mount they drive from they in great confusion the force occupy they and a loud cheer prove that the column of gordon have do its work but this auspicious beginning be the only success achieve by the confederate for reason unknown to the present writer the force direct by lee to be hold in readiness and to move at once to gordon 's support do not go forward the brave commander and he man be leave to breast the whole weight of the federal onslaught which ensue and disaster follow the first great success the fort to the right and left of fort steadman suddenly open they thunder and something like a repetition of the scene succeed the mine explosion ensue a considerable portion of the assault column be unable to get back and fall into the enemy 's hand they work be quickly reoccupy and lee see that he last hope have fail nothing be leave to he now but such courageous resistance as it be in he power to make and he prepare with the worn weapon which he still hold in he firm grasp to oppose as he best could the immense hammer -- to use general grant 's own illustration -- which be plainly about to be raise to strike xiv the southern line break the hour of the final struggle now rapidly draw near on the 29th of march general lee discover that a large portion of the federal army be move steadily in the direction of he work beyond burgen mill and there could be no doubt what this movement signify general grant be plainly about to make a decisive attack on the confederate right on the white-oak road and if that attack succeed lee be lose have not general lee and he man become accustomed to retain they coolness under almost any circumstance of trial the prospect now before they must have fill they with despair the bulk of the federal army be obviously about to be throw against the confederate right and it be no secret in the little body of southerner that lee would be able to send thither only a painfully inadequate force unless he extensive work be leave in charge of a mere line of skirmisher this could not be think of the struggle on the right must be a desperate one and the southern troops must depend upon hard fighting rather than number if they hope to repulse the attack of the enemy such be the situation of affair and neither the confederate commander nor he man shrink in the hour of trial leave longstreet to confront the enemy north of the jame and gordon in command of ewell 's corps -- if it could be call such -- in front of petersburg lee move with nearly the whole remainder of he small force westward beyond hatcher 's run to meet the anticipated attack the force thus move to the right to receive general grant 's great assault consist of about fifteen thousand infantry and about two thousand cavalry under general fitz lee who in consequence of the departure of hampton to north carolina now command the cavalry of the army this force however be cavalry only in name and general lee speaking afterward of general sheridan say that he victory be win when we have no horse for we cavalry and no man to ride the few broken-down steed that we could muster with this force amounting in all to about seventeen thousand man lee proceed to take position behind the work extend along the white-oak road in the direction of five fork a important _ carrefour _ beyond he extreme right the number of man leave north of jame river and in front of petersburg be a little under twenty thousand as general grant have at he command a force about four time as great as he adversary 's it seem scarcely possible that lee would be able to offer serious resistance it soon become evident however that in spite of this great disproportion of force general lee have determine to fight to the last to attribute this determination to despair and recklessness would be do injustice to the great soldier it be still possible that he might be able to repulse the assault upon he right and by disable the federal force there open he line of retreat to this hope he no doubt clung and the fighting-blood of he race be now thoroughly arouse at chancellorsville and elsewhere the odds have be nearly as great and a glance at he gaunt veteran show he that they might still be depend upon for a struggle as obstinate as any in the past history of the war the event certainly vindicate the justice of this latter view and we shall briefly trace the occurrence of the next three or four day which terminate the long conflict at petersburg general grant 's assault force be not in position near the boydton road beyond hatcher 's run until march 31st when before he could attack lee suddenly advance and make a furious onslaught on the federal front before this attack the division first encounter give way in confusion and it seem that the confederate commander at a single blow be about to extricate himself from he embarrassing situation the force oppose to he however be too great and he find himself unable to encounter it in the open field he therefore fall back to he work and the fight cease only to be renew however at five fork this have be seize by the cavalry of general sheridan and as the point be one of importance lee detach a small body of infantry to drive away the federal horse this be do without difficulty and the confederate infantry then advance toward dinwiddie court-house but late at night it be withdraw and the day 's fighting end on the next day the 1st of April a more determine struggle ensue for the possession of five fork where lee have station the small remnant of the division of pickett and johnson these make a brave resistance but be wholly unable to stand before the force bring against they they maintain they ground as long as possible but be finally break to piece and scatter in confusion the whole right of the confederate line and the southside road fall into the hand of the enemy -lrb- illustration : lee at petersburg -rrb- this be virtually the end of the contest but general grant it would appear deem it inexpedient to venture any thing so thinly man be the line in front of petersburg in the absence of longstreet north of jame river and the troops send beyond hatcher 's run that on the 1st of April the federal commander might have break through the work at almost any point he elect to wait however until the follow day thereby run the risk of awake to find that lee have retreat at dawn on the 2d the long struggle end the federal force advance all along the confederate front make a furious attack and break through in front of the city carry all before they the fort especially fort gregg make a gallant resistance this work be defend by the two hundred and fifty man of harri 's mississippus brigade and these fight until they number be reduce to thirty killing or wound five hundred of the assailant the fort be take at last and the federal line advance toward the city in this attack fall the eminent soldier general ap hill whose record have be so illustrious and whose fortune it be to thus terminate he life while the southern flag still float xv lee evacuate petersburg any further resistance upon the part of general lee seem now impossible and nothing appear to be leave he but to surrender he army this course he do not seem however to have contemplate it be still possible that he might be able to maintain he position on a inner line near the city until night and if he could do so the friendly hour of darkness might enable he to make good he retreat to the north bank of the appomattox and shape he course toward north carolina where general johnston await he if the movement of the federal force however be so prompt as to defeat he march in that direction he might still be able to reach lynchburg beyond which point the defile of the alleghany promise he protection against the utmost effort of he enemy of he ability to reach north carolina follow the line of the danville railroad lee however seem to have have no doubt the federal army would not probably be able to concentrate in sufficient force in he path to bar he progress if he march be rapid if detach body only oppose he on he line of retreat there be little doubt that the army of northern virginium reduce as it be would be able to cut its way through they this preface be necessary to a intelligent comprehension of lee 's movement on the unfortunate 2d of April when he line be break this occurrence take place as we have say about sunrise and a hour or two afterward the federal force press forward all along the line surge toward the suburb of petersburg we have mention the position of general lee 's headquarters about a mile and a half west of the city on the cox road nearly opposite the tall federal observatory standing on the lawn in front of he headquarters general lee now see approach rapidly a heavy column of federal infantry with the obvious design of charge a battery which have open fire upon they from a hill to the right the spectacle be picturesque and striking across the extensive field house set on fire by shell be send aloft huge cloud of smoke and tongue of flame at every instant be see the quick glare of the federal artillery firing from every knoll and in front come on the charge column move at a double quick with burnish gun-barrel and bayonet flash in the April sunshine general lee watch with attention but with perfect composure this determine advance of the enemy and although he must have realize that he army be on the verge of destruction it be impossible to discern in he feature any evidence of emotion he be in full uniform and have buckle on he dress-sword which he seldom wear -- have on this morning declare it be say that if he be compel to surrender he would do so in full harness of he calmness at this try moment the writer be able to bear he personal testimony chance to hear a question address to a member of he staff general lee turn with great courtesy raise he gray hat in response to the writer 's salute and give he the desire information in a voice entirely measure and compose it be impossible to regard a calmness so striking without strong sentiment of admiration and lee 's appearance and bearing at this moment will always remain vividly impressed upon the writer 's memory the federal column be soon in dangerous proximity to the battery on the hill and it be oblige to retire at a gallop to escape capture a attempt be make to hold the ground near the headquarters but a close musketry-fire from the enemy render this also impossible -- the artillery be withdraw -- and general lee mount he iron-gray slowly ride back accompany by a number of officer toward he inner line he still remain entirely compose and only say to one of he staff in he habitual tone : this be a bad business colonel well colonel he say afterward to another officer it have happen as i tell they it would at richmond the line have be stretch until it have break the federal column be now press forward along the cox road toward petersburg and general lee continue to ride slowly back in the direction of the city he be probably recognize by officer of the federal artillery or he _ cortége _ draw they fire the group be furiously shell and one of the shell burst a few foot in rear of he kill the horse of a officer near he cut the bridle-rein of other and tear up the ground in he immediate vicinity this incident seem to arouse in general lee he fighting-blood he turn he head over he right shoulder he cheek become flush and a sudden flash of the eye show with what reluctance he retire before the fire direct upon he no other course be leave he however and he continue to ride slowly toward he inner line -- a low earthwork in the suburb of the city -- where a small force be draw up ardent hopeful defiant and salute the shell now burst above they with cheer and laughter it be plain that the fighting-spirit of the ragged troops remain unbroken and the shout of welcome with which they receive lee indicate they unwavering confidence in he despite the untoward condition of affair arrangement be speedily make to hold the inner line if possible until night to general gordon have be intrust the important duty of defend the line east of the city and general longstreet have be direct to vacate the work north of jame river and march at once to the line of petersburg this officer make he appearance with he small force at a early hour of the day and except that the federal army continue firing all along the front no other active operation take place to those present on the confederate side this fact appear strange as the force beyond hatcher 's run have be completely defeat and disperse general lee 's number for the defense of petersburg on this day do not amount to much if any more than fifteen thousand man general grant 's force be probably one hundred and fifty thousand of whom about one hundred thousand might it would appear have be concentrate in a hour or two directly in front of the city that with this large force at he disposal the federal commander do not at once attack and so end all on that day surprise the confederate troops and still continue to surprise the writer night come at last and general lee begin he retreat he have send early in the morning a dispatch to the civil authority at richmond inform they of the fact that he line have be break and that he would that night retreat from petersburg order have also be send to all the force hold the line north of jame river to move at once and join he and just at nightfall the army at petersburg begin cross the appomattox this movement be effect without interruption from the enemy and the army turn into what be call the hickory road lead up the north bank of the river move on steadily through the half light its march be superintend by lee in person he have station himself at the mouth of the hickory road and standing with the bridle of he horse in he hand give he order he bearing still remain entirely compose and he voice have lose none of its grave strength of intonation when the rear be well close up lee mount he horse ride on slowly with he man and in the midst of the glare and thunder of the explode magazine at petersburg the small remnant of the army of northern virginium amounting to about fifteen thousand man go on its way through the darkness xvi the retreat and surrender on the morning of the 3d of April general lee after allow he column a brief period of rest continue he march up the north bank of the appomattox the aspect of affair at this time be threatening and there seem little ground to hope that the small force would be able to make good its retreat to north carolina general grant have a short and direct route to the danville railroad -- a considerable portion of he army be already as far west as dinwiddie court-house -- and it be obvious that he have only to use ordinary diligence to completely cut general lee off in the vicinity of burkesville junction a glance at the map will indicate the advantage possess by the federal commander he could move over the chord while lee be compel to follow the arc of the circle unless good fortune assist lee and ill fortune impede he opponent the event seem certain and it will be see that these condition be completely reverse under the circumstance here state it appear reasonable to expect in lee and he army some depression of spirit the fact be strikingly the reverse the army be in excellent spirit probably from the highly-agreeable contrast of the bud April wood with the squalid trench and the long-unfelt joy of a unfettered march through the field of spring general lee share this hopeful feeling in a very remarkable degree he expression be animated and buoyant he seat in the saddle erect and commanding and he seem to look forward to assure success in the critical movement which he have undertake i have get my army safe out of its breastwork he say on the morning of this day and in order to follow I the enemy must abandon he line and can derive no further benefit from he railroad or jame river the design of the confederate commander have be already state but a important condition upon which he depend for success have not be mention this be a supply of food for he army the troops during the whole winter have live from day to day on quarter-ration dole out to they with a spare hand and in move now from petersburg lee see that he must look to supplies somewhere upon he line of retreat these he have direct to be bring from the south and deposit at amelia court-house and the expectation of finding at that point full subsistence for he man have doubtless a great effect in buoy up he spirit a evil chance however reverse all the hope base on this anticipation from fault or misapprehension the train load with supplies proceed to richmond without deposit the ration at amelia court-house there be no time to obtain other subsistence and when after unforeseen delay in consequence of high water in the appomattox lee at the head of he half-starved soldier reach amelia court-house it be only to find that there be nothing there for the support of he army and to realize that a successful retreat under the circumstance be wellnigh hopeless those who accompany the southern army on this arduous march will recall the dismayed expression of the emaciated face at this unlooked-for calamity and no face wear a heavier shadow than that of general lee the failure of the supply of ration completely paralyze he he have intend and be confident of he ability to cut he way through the enemy but a army can not march and fight without food it be now necessary to halt and send out forage party into the impoverished region around meanwhile general grant with he great force be rapidly move to bar he adversary 's further advance the want of a few thousand pound of bread and meat have virtually terminate the war a anxious and haggard expression come to general lee 's face when he be inform of this great misfortune and at once abandon he design of cut he way through to north carolina he turn westward and shape he march toward lynchburg this movement begin on the night of the 5th of April and it would seem that general grant have have it in he power to arrest it by a attack on lee at amelia court-house general sheridan be in the immediate vicinity with a force of about eighteen thousand well-mounted cavalry and although it be not probable that this command could effect any thing against lee 's army of about the same number of infantry it might still have delay he by construct breastwork in he way and thus give the federal infantry time to come up and attack -lrb- illustration : lee at the surrender -rrb- the opportunity of crush he adversary at amelia court-house be thus allow to pass and general grant now press forward he infantry to bring lee to bay if possible before he reach lynchburg from this moment begin the struggle between the adversary which be to continue day and night without intermission for the next four day the phenomenon be here present of a army reduce to less than twenty thousand man hold at arm 's - length a enemy numbering about one hundred and fifty thousand and very nearly defeat every effort of the larger force to arrest they march it would not interest the reader probably to follow in minute detail the circumstance of this melancholy retreat from the importance of the transaction and the natural attention direct to they both north and south they be doubtless familiar to all who will read these page we shall only speak of one or two incident of the retreat wherein general lee appear prominent personally leave to the imagination of the reader the remainder of the long and tragic struggle whose result decide the fate of the confederacy general grant doubtless saw now that every thing depend upon the celerity of he movement and send in advance he large body of cavalry he hasten forward as rapidly as possible with he infantry bent on interpose if possible a heavy force in he adversary 's front lee 's movement be equally rapid he seem speedily to have regain he old calmness after the try disappointment at amelia court-house and those who share he counsel at this time can testify that the idea of surrender scarcely enter he mind for a moment -- or if it do so be speedily banish under the pressure of circumstance so adverse that they seem calculate to break down the most stubborn resolution general lee do not falter and throughout the disheartening scene of the retreat from the moment when he leave amelia court-house to the hour when he little column be draw near appomattox still continue to believe that the situation be not desperate and that he would be able to force he way through to lynchburg on the evening of the 6th when the army be near farmville a sudden attack be make by the federal cavalry on the train of the army move on a parallel road and the small force of infantry guard they be break and scatter this occurrence take place while general lee be confront a body of federal infantry near sailor 's creek and take a small brigade he immediately repair to the scene of danger the spectacle which follow be a very striking and impose one and be thus describe by one who witness it : the scene be one of gloomy picturesqueness and tragic interest on a plateau raise above the forest from which they have emerge be the disorganized troops of ewell and anderson gather in group un-officered and utter tumultuous exclamation of rage and defiance rise above the weary group which have throw themselves upon the ground be the grim barrel of cannon in battery ready to fire as soon as the enemy appear in front of all be the still line of battle just place by lee and wait calmly general lee have rush he infantry over just at sunset lead it in person he face animated and he eye brilliant with the soldier 's spirit of fight but he bearing unflurry as before a artist desire to paint he picture ought to have see the old cavalier at this moment sweep on upon he large iron-gray whose mane and tail float in the wind carry he field-glass half-raised in he right hand with head erect gesture animated and in the whole face and form the expression of the hunter close upon he game the line once interpose he ride in the twilight among the disorder group above mention and the sight of he arouse a tumult fierce cry resound on all side and with hand clinch violently and raise aloft the man call on he to lead they against the enemy ` it be general lee ' ` uncle robert ' ` where 's the man who will not follow uncle robert ' i hear on all side -- the swarthy face full of dirt and courage light up every instant by the glare of the burning wagon altogether the scene be indescribable on the 7th the army press on beyond farmville still harass as it advance by the federal infantry and cavalry but in some of these encounter the pursue force meet with what be probably a very unexpected discomfiture general fitz lee bring up the rear of the army with he force of about fifteen hundred cavalry on broken-down horse succeed not only in repulse the attack of the large and excellently-mounted force under general sheridan but achieve over they highly-honorable success one such incident take place on the 7th when general gregg attack with about six thousand horse but be meet defeat and capture by general fitz lee to the great satisfaction of general lee who say to he son general whf lee : keep you command together and in good spirit general -- do not let they think of surrender -- i will get you out of this on the 8th and 9th however this hope seem unwarranted by the circumstance and the commander-in-chief appear to be almost the only human being who remain sanguine of the result the hardship of the retreat arise chiefly from want of food begin to seriously impair the resolution of the troops and the scene through which they advance be not calculate to raise they spirit these scene declare one who witness they be of a nature which can be apprehend only by man who be thoroughly familiar with the harrowing detail of war behind and on either flank a ubiquitous and increasingly adventurous enemy -- every mud-hole and every rise in the road choke with blaze wagon -- the air fill with the deafening report of ammunition explode and shell burst when touch by the flame dense column of smoke ascend to heaven from the burning and explode vehicle exhaust man worn-out mule and horse lie down side by side -- gaunt famine glare hopelessly from sunken lack-lustre eye -- dead mule dead horse dead man everywhere -- death many time welcome as god 's messenger in disguise -- who can wonder if many heart try in the fiery furnace of four unparalleled year and never hitherto find want should have quail in presence of starvation fatigue sleeplessness misery unintermitted for five or six day and culminate in hopelessness it can not however be say with truth that any considerable portion of the southern force be greatly demoralize to use the military phrase as the fighting of the last two day when the suffering of the retreat culminate will show the man be almost entirely without food and be glad to find a little corn to eat but those who be not physically unable longer to carry they musket -- and the number of these latter be large -- still march and fight with soldierly cheerfulness and resolution general lee 's spirit do not seem at any time to have flag and up to a late period of the retreat he have not seriously contemplated surrender the necessity for this painful course come home to he corps commander first and they request general pendleton the efficient chief of artillery of the army to inform general lee that in they opinion further struggle be hopeless general pendleton inform general lee of this opinion of he officer and it seem to communicate something like a shock to he surrender he exclaim with a flash of the eye i have too many good fighting-man for that nevertheless the necessity of seriously contemplate this result be soon force upon he since the morning of the 7th a correspondence have take place between himself and general grant and as these note be interesting we here present those which be exchange up to the night of the 8th : _ April _ 7 1865 _ general re lee command csa _ : general : the result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on

last council of war -rrb- no reply be receive to this last communication from general lee on the evening of the 8th and that night there be hold around a bivouac-fire in the wood the last council of war of the army of northern virginium the scene be a very picturesque one the red glare from the bivouac-fire light up the group and bring out the detail of each figure none be present but general lee and general longstreet gordon and fitz lee all corps commander general gordon and fitz lee half recline upon a army-blanket near the fire longstreet sit upon a log smoking and general lee stand by the fire holding in he hand the correspondence which have pass between himself and general grant the question what course it be advisable to pursue be then present in a few calm word by general lee to he corps commander and a informal conversation ensue it be finally agree that the army should advance on the next morning beyond appomattox court-house and if only general sheridan 's cavalry be find in front brush that force from its path and proceed on its way to lynchburg if however the federal infantry be discover in large force beyond the court-house the attempt to break through be to be abandon and a flag dispatch to general grant request a interview for the arrangement of the term of a capitulation of the southern army with a heavy heart general lee acquiesce in this plan of proceeding and soon afterward the council of war terminate -- the corps commander salute the commander-in-chief who return they bow with grave courtesy and separate to return to they own bivouac in spite however of the discourage and almost desperate condition of affair general lee seem still to have cling to the hope that he might be able to cut he way through the force in he front he wake from brief slumber beside he bivouac-fire at about three o'clock in the morning and call a officer of he staff colonel venable send he to general gordon command the front to ascertain he opinion at that moment of the probable result of a attack upon the enemy general gordon 's reply be tell general lee that my old corps be reduce to a frazzle and unless i be support by longstreet heavily i do not think we can do any thing more general lee receive this announcement with a expression of great feeling and after a moment 's silence say : there be nothing left but to go to general grant and i would rather die a thousand death he staff-officer have now gather around he and one of they say : what will history say of we surrender if there be any possibility of escape posterity will not understand it to these word general lee reply : yes yes they will not understand we situation but that be not the question the question be whether it be _ right _ and if it be right i take the responsibility he expression of buoyant hopefulness have now change to one of deep melancholy and it be evident to those around he that the thought of surrender be worse to he than the bitterness of death for the first time he courage seem to give way and he be nearly unmanned turn to a officer standing near he he say he deep voice fill with hopeless sadness : how easily i could get rid of this and be at rest i have only to ride along the line and all will be over he be silent for a short time after utter these word and then add with a heavy sigh : but it be we duty to live what will become of the woman and child of the south if we be not here to protect they the moment have now come when the fate of the retreat be to be decide to general gordon who have prove himself in the last operation of the war a soldier of the first ability have be intrust the command of the advance force and this be now move forward against the enemy beyond appomattox court-house gordon attack with he infantry support by fitz lee 's

infantry state afterward by federal officer to number about eighty thousand as he own force be less than five thousand musket he find it impossible to advance farther and the federal line be already

man a paroled prisoner of the army of northern virginium the parting between he and he soldier be pathetic he exchange with all near he a close pressure of the hand utter a few simple word of farewell and mount he iron-gray traveller who have pass through all the fighting of the campaign unharmed ride slowly in the direction of richmond he be escort by a detachment of federal cavalry precede only by a guidon and the party include the officer who accompany he consist of about twenty-five horseman the _ cortége _ be follow by several wagon carry the private effect of himself and he companion and by the well-known old black open vehicle which he have occasionally use during the campaign of the preceding year when indisposition prevent he from mount he horse in this vehicle it have be he custom to carry store for the wound -- it have never be use for article contribute to he personal convenience general lee 's demeanor on he way to richmond be entirely compose and he thought seem much more occupy by the unfortunate condition of the poor people at whose house he stop than by he own situation when he find that all along he route the impoverished people have cook provision in readiness for he and be look anxiously for he with every indication of love and admiration he say to one of he officer : these good people be kind -- too kind they heart be as full as when we begin we first campaign in 1861 they do too much -- more than they be able to do -- for we he soldierly habit remain unchanged and he seem unwilling to indulge in any luxury or comfort which could not be share by the gentleman accompany he at a house which he reach just as night come a poor woman have prepare a excellent bed for he but with a courteous shake of the head he spread he blanket and sleep upon the floor stop on the next day at the house of he brother charle carter lee in powhatan he spend the evening in conversation but when bedtime come left the house in spite of the fact that it have begin to rain and cross the road into the wood take up he quarter for the night on the hard plank of he old black vehicle on the route he exhibit great solicitude about a small quantity of oats which he have bring with he in one of the wagon for he old companion traveller mention it more than once and appear anxious lest it should be lose or use by some one -lrb- illustration : lee 's entry into richmond after the surrender -rrb- the party come in sight of richmond at last and two or three mile from the city general lee ride ahead of he escort accompany only by a few officer and cross the pontoon bridge below the ruin of mayo 's bridge which have be destroy when the confederate force retreat enter the capital the spectacle which meet he eye at this moment must have be exceedingly painful in the great conflagration which have take place on the morning of the 3d of April a large portion of the city have be burn and as general lee ride up main street formerly so handsome and attractive he see on either hand only mass of blacken ruin as he ride slowly through the opening between these mass of _ débris _ he be recognize by the few person who be on the street and instantly the intelligence of he presence spread through the city the inhabitant hasten from they house and flock to welcome he salute he with cheer and the wave of hat and handkerchief he seem desirous however of avoid this ovation and return the greet by simply raise he hat ride on and reach he house on franklin street where respect he desire for privacy under circumstance so painful he admirer do not intrude upon he we have present this brief narrative of the incident attend general lee 's return to he home after the surrender to show with what simplicity and good sense he accept he try situation a small amount of diplomacy -- send forward one of he officer to announce he intended arrival stop for a few moment as he ascend main street make a address to the citizen who first recognize he and thus afford time for a crowd to assemble -- these proceedings on the part of general lee would have result in a ovation such as a vanquished commander never before receive at the hand of any people nothing however be less desire by general lee than this tumultuous reception the native modesty of the man not only shrink from such a ovation he avoid it for another reason -- the pretext it would probably afford to the federal authority to proceed to harsh measure against the unfortunate person who take part in it in accordance with these sentiment general lee have not announce he come have not stop as he ride through the city and now shut himself up in he house signify he desire to avoid a public reception and to be leave in privacy this policy he be well know to have pursue from that time to the end of he life he uniformly decline with great courtesy but firmly invitation to attend public gathering of any description where he presence might arouse passion or occasion discussion connect with the great contest in which he have be the leader of the south a mind less firm and noble would doubtless have yield to this great temptation it be sweet to the soldier who have be overwhelm and have yield up he sword to feel that the love and admiration of a people still follow he and to have the consolation of receive public evidence of this unchanged devotion that this love of the southern people for lee deeply touch he there can be no doubt but it do not blind he to he duty as the representative individual of the south feeling that nothing be now leave the southern people but a honest acceptance of the situation and a cessation as far as possible of all rancor toward the north he refuse to encourage sentiment of hostility between the two section and do all in he power to restore amicable feeling i be very glad to learn he say in a note to the present writer that you life of general jackson be of the character you describe i think all topic or question calculate to excite angry discussion or hostile feeling should be avoid these few word convey a distinct idea of general lee 's view and feeling he have fight to the best of he ability for southern independence of the north the south have fail in the struggle and it be now in he opinion the duty of every good citizen to frankly acquiesce in the result and endeavor to avoid all that keep open the bleeding wound of the country he military career have place he in the estimation of the first man of he time among the greatest soldier of history but the dignity and moderation of the course pursue by he from the end of the war to the time of he death will probably remain in the opinion of both he friend and enemy the noblest illustration of the character of the man xviii general lee after the war in the conclude page of this volume we shall not be call upon to narrate either military or political event with the surrender at appomattox court-house the confederate war end -- no attempt be make by general johnston or other commander to prolong it -- in that great whirlpool all hope of further resistance disappear we have therefore now no task before we but to follow general lee into private life and present a few detail of he latter year and he death these notice will be brief but will not we hope be devoid of interest the soldier who have so long lead the confederate army be to enter in he latter day upon a new field of labor and if in this field he win no new glory he at least display the loftiest virtue and exhibit that rare combination of greatness and gentleness which make up a character altogether lovely adhering to the resolution form in 1861 never again to draw he sword except in defense of virginium general lee after the surrender seek for some occupation feel the necessity doubtless of in some manner employ he energy he be say to have have offer to he but to have courteously decline estate in england and ireland and to have also decline the place of commercial agent of the south in new york which would have prove exceedingly lucrative in the summer of 1865 however he accept a offer more congenial to he feeling -- that of the presidency of washington college at lexington -- and in the autumn of that year enter upon he duty which he continue to perform with great energy and success to the day of he death of the excellent judgment and great administrative capacity which he display in this new field of labor we have never hear any question it be the name and example however of lee which prove so valuable draw to the college more than five hundred student from all portion of the south and some even from the north upon the subject of general lee 's life at washington college a more important authority than that of the present writer will soon speak in the memorial volume whose publication will probably precede or immediately follow the appearance of this work full detail will no doubt be present of this interesting period the subject possess rare interest and the fact present will beyond all question serve to bring out new beauty in a character already regard with extraordinary love and admiration by man of all party and opinion to the volume in question we refer the reader who desire the full-length portrait of one concern whom too much can not be write during the period extend between the end of the war and general lee 's death he appear in public but two or three time -- once at washington as a witness before a congressional committee style the reconstruction committee to inquire into the condition of thing in the south again as a witness on the propose trial of president davi and perhaps on one or two additional occasion not of great interest or importance he testimony be not take on the trial of the president which be defer and finally abandon but he be subject before the washington committee to a long and search examination in which it be difficult to decide whether he own calmness good sense and outspoken frankness or the bad taste of some of the question prepound to he be the more remarkable as the testimony of general lee upon this occasion present a full exposition of he view upon many of the most important point connect with the condition of the south and the reconstruction policy a portion of the newspaper report of he evidence be here give as both calculate to interest the reader and to illustrate the subject the examination of general lee take place in march 1866 and the follow be the main portion of it : general robert e lee swear and examine by mr howard : question where be you present residence answer lexington va q how long have you reside in lexington a since the 1st of October last -- nearly five month the feeling in virginium q be you acquaint with the state of feeling among what we call secessionist in virginium at present toward the government of the united state a i do not know that i be i have be live very retired and have have but little communication with politician i know nothing more than from my own observation and from such fact as have come to my knowledge q from you observation what be you opinion as to the loyalty toward the government of the united state among the secession portion of the people of that state at this time a so far as have come to my knowledge i do not know of a single person who either feel or contemplate any resistance to the government of the united state or indeed any opposition to it no word have reach I to either purpose q from what you have observe among they be it you opinion that they be friendly toward the government of the united state and that they will coöperate to sustain and uphold the government for the future a i believe that they entirely acquiesce in the government of the united state and so far as i have hear any one express a opinion they be for coöperating with president johnson in he policy q in he policy in regard to what a he policy in regard to the restoration of the whole country i have hear person with whom i have converse express great confidence in the wisdom of he policy of restoration and they seem to look forward to it as a hope of restoration q how do they feel in regard to that portion of the people of the united state who have be forward and zealous in the prosecution of the war against the rebellion a well i do not know as i have hear anybody express any opinion in regard to it as i say before i have not have much communication with politician in the country if there be any every one seem to be engage in he own affair and endeavor to restore the civil government of the state i have hear no expression of a sentiment toward any particular portion of the country q how do the secessionist feel in regard to the payment of the debt of the united state contract in the prosecution of the war a i have never hear anyone speak on the subject i suppose they must expect to pay the tax levy by the government i have hear they speak in reference to the payment of tax and of they effort to raise money to pay tax which i suppose be for they share of the debt i have never hear any one speak in opposition to the payment of tax or of resistance to they payment they whole effort have be to try and raise the money for the payment of the tax the debt q from you knowledge of the state of public feeling in virginium be it you opinion that the people would if the question be leave to they repudiate and reject that debt a i never hear any one speak on that subject but from my knowledge of the people i believe that they would be in favor of the payment of all just debt q do they in you opinion regard that as a just debt a i do not know what they opinion be on the subject of that particular debt i have never hear any opinion express contrary to it indeed as i say in the beginning i have have very little discussion or intercourse with the people i believe the people will pay the debt they be call upon to pay i say that from my knowledge of the people generally q would they pay that debt or they portion of it with as much alacrity as people ordinarily pay they tax to they government a i do not know that they would make any distinction between the two the tax lay by the government so far as i know they be prepare to pay to the best of they ability i never hear they make any distinction q what be the feeling of that portion of the people of virginium in regard to the payment of the so-called confederate debt a i believe so far as my opinion go -- i have no fact to go upon but merely base my opinion on the knowledge i have of the people -- that they would be willing to pay the confederate debt too q you think they would a i think they would if they have the power and ability to do so i have never hear any one in the state with whom i have converse speak of repudiate any debt q i suppose the confederate debt be almost entirely valueless even in the market in virginium a entirely so as far as i know i believe the people generally look upon it as lose entirely i never hear any question on the subject q do you recollect the term of the confederate bond -- when they be make payable a i think i have a general recollection that they be make payable six month after a declaration of peace q six month after the ratification of a treaty of peace between the united state and the confederate government a i think they run that way q so that the bond be not due yet by they term a i suppose unless it be consider that there be a peace now they be not due the freedman q how do the people of virginium secessionist more particularly feel toward the freedman a every one with whom i associate express the kindest feeling toward the freedman they wish to see they get on in the world and particularly to take up some occupation for a living and to turn they hand to some work i know that effort have be make among the farmer near where i live to induce they to engage for the year at regular wages q do you think there be a willingness on the part of they old master to give they fair living wages for they labor a i believe it be so the farmer generally prefer those servant who have be live with they before i have hear they express they preference for the man whom they know who have live with they before and they wish to get they to return to work q be you aware of the existence of any combination among the whites to keep down the wages of the black a i be not i have hear that in several county the land-owner have meet in order to establish a uniform rate of wages but i never hear nor do i know of any combination to keep down wages or establish any rule which they do not think fair the means of pay wages in virginium be very limit now and there be a difference of opinion as to how much each person be able to pay q how do they feel in regard to the education of the black be there a general willingness to have they educate a where i be and have be the people have exhibit a willingness that the black should be educate and they express a opinion that it would be better for the black and better for the whites q general you be very competent to judge of the capacity of black man for acquire knowledge -- i want you opinion on that capacity as compare with the capacity of white man a i do not know that i be particularly qualify to speak on that subject as you seem to intimate but i do not think that the black man be as capable of acquire knowledge as the white man there be some more apt than other i have know some to acquire knowledge and skill in they trade or profession i have have servant of my own who learn to read and write very well q do they show a capacity to obtain knowledge of mathematics and the exact science a i have no knowledge on that subject i be merely acquaint with those who have learn the common rudiment of education q general be you aware of the existence among the black of virginium anywhere within the limit of the state of combination have in view the disturbance of the peace or any improper or unlawful act a i be not i have see no evidence of it and have hear of none wherever i have be they have be quiet and orderly not dispose to work or rather not dispose to any continuous engagement to work but just very short job to provide they with the immediate means of subsistence q have the color race generally as great love of money and property as the white race possess a i do not think it have the black with whom i be acquaint look more to the present time than to the future q do that absence of a lust of money and property arise more from the nature of the negro than from he former servile condition a well it may be in some measure attribute to he former condition they be a amiable social race they like they ease and comfort and i think look more to they present than to they future condition in case of war would virginia join we enemy q in the event of a war between the united state and any foreign power such as england or france if there should be hold out to the secession portion of the people of virginium or the other recently rebel state a fair prospect of gain they independence and shake off the government of the united state be it or be it not you opinion that they would avail themselves of that opportunity a i can not answer with any certainty on that point i do not know how far they might be actuate by they feeling i have nothing whatever to base a opinion upon so far as i know they contemplate nothing of the kind now what may happen in the future i can not say q do you not frequently hear in you intercourse with secessionist in virginium expression of a hope that such a war may break out a i can not say that i have hear it on the contrary i have hear person -- i do not know whether you could call they secessionist or not i mean those people in virginium with whom i associate -- express the hope that the country may not be lead into a war q in such a event do you not think that that class of people whom i call secessionist would join the common enemy a it be possible it depend upon the feeling of the individual q if it be a fair question -- you may answer or not as you choose -- what in such a event might be you choice a i have no disposition now to do it and i never have have q and you can not foresee that such would be you inclination in such a event a no i can only judge from the past i do not know what circumstance it may produce i can not pretend to foresee event so far as i know the feeling of the people of virginium they wish for peace q during the civil war be it not contemplate by the government of the confederacy to form a alliance with some foreign nation if possible a i believe it be they wish to do so if they could it be they wish to have the confederate government recognize as a independent government i have no doubt that if it could have make favorable treaty it would have do so but i know nothing of the policy of the government i have no hand or part in it i merely express my own opinion q the question i be about to put to you you may answer or not as you choose do you take a oath of fidelity or allegiance to the confederate government a i do not recollect have do so but it be possible that when i be commission i do i do not recollect whether it be require if it be require i take it or if it have be require i would have take it but i do not recollect whether it be or not q -lrb- by mr blow -rrb- in reference to the effect of president johnson 's policy if it be adopt would there be any thing like a return of the old feeling i ask that because you use the expression acquiesce in the result a i believe it would take time for the feeling of the people to be of that cordial nature to the government they be formerly q do you think that they preference for that policy arise from a desire to have peace and good feeling in the country or from the probability of they regain political power president johnson 's policy a so far as i know the desire of the people of the south it be for restoration of they civil government and they look upon the policy of president johnson as the one which would most clearly and most surely reëstablish it condition of the poorer class q do you see any change among the poorer class in virginium in reference to industry be they as much or more interested in develop they material interest than they be a i have not observe any change every one now have to attend to he business for he support q the poorer class be generally hard at work be they a so far as i know they be i know nothing to the contrary q be there any difference in they relation to the color people be they prejudice increase or diminish a i have notice no change so far as i do know the feeling of all the people of virginium they be kind to the color people i have never hear any blame attribute to they as to the present condition of thing or any responsibility q there be very few color laborer employ i suppose a those who own farm have employ more or less one or two color laborer some be so poor that they have to work themselves q can capitalist and workingman from the north go into any portion of virginium with which you be familiar and go to work among the people a i do not know of any thing to prevent they they peace and pleasure there would depend very much on they conduct if they confine themselves to they own business and do not interfere to provoke controversy with they neighbor i do not believe they would be molest q there be no desire to keep out capital a not that i know of on the contrary they be very anxious to get capital into the state q you see nothing of a disposition to prevent such a thing a i have see nothing and do not know of any thing as i say before the manner in which they would be receive would depend entirely upon the individual themselves they might make themselves obnoxious as you can understand q -lrb- by mr howard -rrb- be there not a general dislike of northern man among secessionist a i suppose they would prefer not to associate with they i do not know that they would select they as associate q do they avoid and ostracize they socially a they might avoid they they would not select they as associate unless there be some reason i do not know that they would associate with they unless they become acquaint i think it probable they would not admit they into they social circle the position of the color race q -lrb- by mr blow -rrb- what be the position of the color man in virginium with reference to person they work for do you think they would prefer to work for northern or southern man a i think it very probable they would prefer the northern man although i have no fact to go upon q that have be state very frequently in reference to the cotton state do it result from a bad treatment on the part of the resident population or from the idea that they will be more fairly treat by the new-comer what be you observation in that respect in regard to virginia a i have no means of form a opinion i do not know any case in virginium i know of number of the black engage with they old master and i know of many to prefer to go off and look for new home whether it be from any dislike of they former master or from any desire to change or they feel more free and independent i do not know the material interest of virginium q what be you opinion in regard to the material interest of virginium do you think they will be equal to what they be before the rebellion under the change aspect of affair a it will take a long time for they to reach they former standard i think that after some year they will reach it and i hope exceed it but it can not be immediately in my opinion q it will take a number of year a it will take a number of year i think q on the whole the condition of thing in virginium be hopeful both in regard to its material interest and the future peace of the country a i have hear great hope express and there be great cheerfulness and willingness to labor q suppose this policy of president johnson should be all you anticipate and that you should also realize all that you expect in the improvement of the material interest do you think that the result of that will be the gradual restoration of the old feeling a that will be the natural result i think and i see no other way in which that result can be bring about q there be a fear in the public mind that the friend of the policy in the south adopt it because they see in it the means of repair the political position which they lose in the recent contest do you think that that be the main idea with they or that they merely look to it as you say as the best means of restore civil government and the peace and prosperity of they respective state a as to the first point you make i do not know that i ever hear any person speak upon it i never hear the point separate i have hear they speak generally as to the effect of the policy of president johnson the feeling be so far as i know now that there be not that equality extend to the southern state which be enjoy by the north q you do not feel down there that while you accept the result we be as generous as we ought to be under the circumstance a they think that the north can afford to be generous q that be the feel down there a yes and they think it be the best policy those who reflect upon the subject and be able to judge q i understand it to be you opinion that generosity and liberality toward the entire south would be the surest means of regain they good opinion a yes and the speediest q -lrb- by mr howard -rrb- i understand you to say generally that you have no apprehension of any combination among the lead secessionist to renew the war or any thing of the kind a i have no reason in the world to think so q have you hear that subject talk over among any of the politician a no sir i have not i have not hear that matter even suggest q let I put another hypothetical state of thing suppose the executive government of the united state should be hold by a president who like mr buchanan reject the right of coercion so call and suppose a congress should exist here entertain the same political opinion thus present to the once rebel state the opportunity to again secede from the union would they or not in you opinion avail themselves of that opportunity or some of they a i suppose it would depend : upon the circumstance exist at the time if they feeling should remain embittered and they affection alienate from the rest of the state i think it very probable they might do so provide they think it be to they interest q do you not think that at the present time there be a deep-seated feeling of dislike toward the government of the united state on the part of the secessionist a i do not know that there be any deep-seated dislike i think it be probable there may be some animosity still exist among the people of the south q be there not a deep-seated feeling of disappointment and chagrin at the result of the war a i think that at the time they be disappoint at the result of the war q do you mean to be understand as say that there be not a condition of discontent against the government of the united state among the secessionist generally a i know none q be you prepare to say that they respect the government of the united state and the loyal people of the united state so much at the present time as to perform they duty as citizen of the united state and of the state faithfully and well a i believe that they will perform all the duty that they be require to perform i think that be the general feeling so far as i know q do you think it would be practicable to convict a man in virginium of treason for have take part in this rebellion against the government by a virginian jury without pack it with direct reference to a verdict of guilty a on that point i have no knowledge and i do not know what they would consider treason against the united state -- if you refer to past act mr howard : yes sir witness : i have no knowledge what they view on that subject in the past be q you understand my question suppose a jury be impanell in you own neighborhood take by lot would it be possible to convict for instance jefferson davi for have levy war upon the united state and thus have commit the crime of treason a i think it be very probable that they would not consider he have commit treason they view of treason q suppose the jury should be clearly and plainly instruct by the court that such a act of war upon the part of mr davi or any other lead man constitute the crime of treason under the constitution of the united state would the jury be likely to heed that instruction and if the fact be plainly in proof before they convict the offender a i do not know sir what they would do on that question q they do not generally suppose that it be treason against the united state do they a i do not think that they so consider it q in what light would they view it what would be they excuse or justification how would they escape in they own mind i refer to the past -- i be refer to the past and the feeling they would have a so far as i know they look upon the action of the state in withdraw itself from the government of the united state as carry the individual of the state along with it that the state be responsible for the act not the individual and that the ordinance of secession so call or those act of the state which recognize a condition of war between the state and the general government stand as they justification for they bearing arm against the government of the united state yes sir i think they would consider the act of the state as legitimate that they be merely use the reserved rights which they have a right to do q state if you please -- and if you be disincline to answer the question you need not do so -- what you own personal view on that question be a that be my view that the act of virginium in withdraw herself from the united state carry I along as a citizen of virginium and that she law and she act be bind on I q and that you feel to be you justification in take the course you do a yes sir q i have be tell general that you have remark to some of you friend in conversation that you be rather wheedle or cheat into that course by politician a i do not recollect ever make any such remark i do not think i ever make it q if there be any other matter about which you wish to speak on this occasion do so freely a only in reference to that last question you put to I i may have say and may have believe that the position of the two section which they hold to each other be bring about by the politician of the country that the great mass of the people if they understand the real question would have avoid it but not that i have be individually wheedle by the politician q that be probably the origin of the whole thing a i may have say that but i do not even recollect that but i do believe at the time that it be a unnecessary condition of affair and might have be avoid if forbearance and wisdom have be practice on both side q you say that you do not recollect have swear allegiance and fidelity to the confederate government a i do not recollect it nor do i know it be ever require i be regularly commission in the army of the confederate state but i do not really recollect that that oath be require if it be require i have no doubt i take it or if it have be require i would have take it q be there any other matter which you desire to state to the committee a no sir i be ready to answer any question which you think proper to put to I negro citizenship q how would a amendment to the constitution be receive by the secessionist or by the people at large allow the color people or certain class of they to exercise the right of voting at election a i think so far as i can form a opinion in such a event they would object q they would object to such a amendment a yes sir q suppose a amendment should nevertheless be adopt confer on the black the right of suffrage would that in you opinion lead to scene of violence or breach of the peace between the two race in virginium a i think it would excite unfriendly feeling between the two race i can not pretend to say to what extent it would go but that would be the result q be you acquaint with the propose amendment now pend in the senate of the united state a no sir i be not i scarcely ever read a paper -lrb- the substance of the propose amendment be here explain to the witness by mr conkling -rrb- so far as i can see i do not think that the state of virginium would object to it q would she consent under any circumstance to allow the black people to vote even if she be to gain a large number of representative in congress a that would depend upon she interest if she have the right of determine that i do not see why she would object if it be to she interest to admit these people to vote that might overrule any other objection that she have to it q what in you opinion would be the practical result do you think that virginium would consent to allow the negro to vote a i think that at present she would accept the smaller representation i do not know what the future may develop if it should be plain to she that these person will vote properly and understandingly she might admit they to vote q -lrb- by mr blow -rrb- do you not think it would turn a good deal in the cotton state upon the value of the labor of the black people upon the amount which they produce a in a good many state in the south and in a good many county in virginium if the black people be allow to vote it would i think exclude proper representation -- that be proper intelligent people would not be elect and rather than suffer that injury they would not let they vote at all q do you not think that the question as to whether any southern state would allow the color people the right of suffrage in order to increase representation would depend a good deal on the amount which the color people might contribute to the wealth of the state in order to secure two thing -- first the larger representation and second the influence desire from those person vote a i think they would determine the question more in reference to they opinion as to the manner in which those vote would be exercise whether they consider those people qualify to vote my own opinion be that at this time they can not vote intelligently and that give they the right of suffrage would open the door to a good deal of demagogism and lead to embarrassment in various way what the future may prove how intelligent they may become with what eye they may look upon the interest of the state in which they may reside i can not say more than you can the above extract present the main portion of general lee 's testimony and be certainly a admirable exposition of the clear good sense and frankness of the individual once or twice there be obviously a under-current of dry satire as in he reply upon the subject of the confederate bond when ask whether he remember at what time these bond be make payable he reply that he general recollection be that they be make payable six month after a declaration of peace the correction be at once make by he interrogator in the word six month after _ the ratification of a treaty of peace _ etc i think they run that way reply general lee so that retort he interrogator the bond be not yet due by they term general lee 's reply be i suppose _ unless it be consider that there be a peace now they be not due _ this seem to have put a abrupt termination to the examination on that point to the question whether he have take a oath of allegiance to the confederate government he reply : i do not recollect have do so but it be possible that when i be commission i do i do not recollect whether it be require if it be require i take it or if it have be require i would have take it if this reply of general lee be attentively weigh by the reader some conception may be form of the bitter pang which he must have experience in send in as he do to the federal government he application for pardon the fact can not be conceal that this proceeding on the part of general lee be a subject of deep regret to the southern people but there can be no question that he motive be disinterested and noble and that he present in so do the most remarkable evidence of the true greatness of he character he have no personal advantage to expect from a pardon care absolutely nothing whether he be pardon or not and to one so proud and so thoroughly convince of the justice of the cause in which he have fight to appear as a supplicant must have be inexpressibly painful he nevertheless take this mortifying step -- actuate entirely by that sense of duty which remain with he to the last overmastering every other sentiment of he nature he seem in this as in many other thing to have feel the immense import of he example the old soldier of he army and thousand of civilian be oblige to apply for amnesty or remain under civic disability brave man with family depend upon they have be drive to this painful course and general lee seem to have feel that duty to he old comrade demand that he too should swallow this bitter draught and share they humiliation as he have share they danger and they glory if this be not the explanation of the motive control general lee 's action the writer be unable to account for the course which he pursue that it be the sole explanation the writer no more doubt than he doubt the fact of he own existence xix general lee 's last year and death for about five year -- from the latter part of 1865 nearly to the end of 1870 -- general lee continue to concentrate he entire attention and all he energy upon he duty as president of washington college to which he great name and the desire of southern parent to have they son educate under a guide so illustrious attract as we have say more than five hundred student the sedentary nature of these occupation be a painful trial to one so long accustomed to lead a life of activity but it be not in the character of the individual to allow personal consideration to interfere with the performance of he duty and the laborious supervision of the education of this large number of young gentleman continue day after day and year after year to occupy he mind and he time to the exclusion wellnigh of every other think he personal popularity with the student be very great and it be unnecessary to add that they respect for he be unbounded by the citizen of lexington and especially the graver and more pious portion he be regard with a love and admiration greater than any feel for he during the progress of he military career this be attributable doubtless to the franker and clearer exhibition by general lee in he latter year of that extraordinary gentleness and sweetness culminate in devoted christian piety which -- conceal from all eye in some degree during the war -- now plainly reveal themselves and be evidently the broad foundation and control influence of he whole life and character to speak first of he gentleness and moderation in all he view and utterance of these eminent virtue -- eminent and striking above all in a defeat soldier with so much to embitter he -- general lee present a very remarkable illustration the result of the war seem to have leave he great soul calm resigned and untroubled by the least rancor while other not more devoted to the south permit passion and sectional animosity to master they and dictate act and expression full of bitterness toward the north general lee refrain systematically from every thing of that description and by simple force of greatness one would have say rise above all prejudice and hatred of the hour counselling and give in he own person to all who approach he the example of moderation and christian charity he aim to keep alive the old southern tradition of honor and virtue but not that sectional hatred which could produce only evil to a lady who have lose she husband in the war and on bring she two son to the college indulge in expression of great bitterness toward the north general lee say gently : madam do not train up you child in hostility to the government of the united state remember that we be one country now dismiss from you mind all sectional feeling and bring they up to be american a still more suggestive exhibition of he freedom from rancor be present in a interview which be thus describe : one day last autumn the writer see general lee standing at he gate talk pleasantly to a humbly-clad man who seem very much pleased at the cordial courtesy of the great chieftain and turn off evidently delighted as we come up after exchange salutation the general say point to the retreat form ` that be one of we old soldier who be in necessitous circumstance ' i take it for grant that it be some veteran confederate when the noble-hearted chieftain quietly add ` he fight on the other side but we must not think of that ' i afterward ascertain -- not from general lee for he never allude to he charity -- that he have not only speak kindly to this ` old soldier ' who have ` fight on the other side ' but have send he on he way rejoice in a liberal contribution to he necessity of the extent of this christian moderation another proof be give by the soldier at a moment when he might not unreasonably have be suppose to labor under emotion of the extremest bitterness soon after he return to richmond in April 1865 when the _ immedicabile vulnus _ of surrender be still open and bleed a gentleman be request by the federal commander in the city to communicate to general lee the fact that he be about to be indict in the united state court for treason -lrb- 1 -rrb- in acquit himself of he commission the gentleman express sentiment of violent indignation at such a proceeding but these feeling general lee do not seem to share the threat of arraign he as a traitor produce no other effect upon he than to bring a smile to he lip and take the hand of he friend as the latter rise to go he say in he mildest tone : we must forgive we enemy i can truly say that not a day have pass since the war begin that i have not pray for they -lrb- footnote 1 : this be afterward do by one of the federal judge but result in nothing -rrb- the incident here related define the view and feeling of general lee as accurately as they could be set forth in a whole volume the defeat commander who could open he poor purse to one of _ we _ old soldier who _ fight on the other side _ and pray daily during the bitterest of conflict for he enemy must surely have train he spirit to the perfection of christian charity of the strength and control character of general lee 's religious conviction we have more than once speak in precede page of this volume these now seem to exert a more marked influence over he life and indeed to shape every action and utterance of the man during the war he have exhibit much greater reserve upon this the most important of all subject which can engage the attention of a human being and although he have be from a early period we believe a communicant of the protestant episcopal church he seldom discuss religious question or speak of he own feeling present in this a marked contrast as we have say to he illustrious associate general jackson even during the war however as the reader have see in we notice of he character at the end of 1863 general lee 's piety reveal itself in conversation with he chaplain and other good man and be not conceal from the troops as on the occasion of the prayer-meeting in the midst of the fighting at mine run on another occasion when review he army near winchester he be see to raise he hat to a chaplain with the word i salute the church of god and again near petersburg be observe kneel in prayer a short distance from the road as he troops march by still another incident of the period -- that of the war -- will be record here in the word of the rev j william jone who relate it : not long before the evacuation of petersburg the writer be one day distribute tract along the trench when he perceive a brilliant cavalcade approach general lee -- accompany by general john b gordon general ap hill and other general officer with they staff -- be inspect we line and reconnoitr those of the enemy the keen eye of gordon recognize and he cordial grasp detain the humble tract-distributor as he warmly inquire about he work general lee at once rein in he horse and join in the conversation the rest of the party gather around and the humble colporteur thus become the center of a group of whose notice the highest prince of earth might well be proud general lee ask if we ever have call for prayer-book and say that if we would call at he headquarters he would give we some for distribution -- ` that some friend in richmond have give he a new prayer-book and upon he say that he would give he old one that he have use ever since the mexican war to some soldier the friend have offer he a dozen new book for the old one and he have of course accept so good a offer and now have twelve instead of one to give away ' we call at the appoint hour the general have go out on some important matter but -lrb- even amid he press duty -rrb- have leave the prayer-book with a member of he staff with instruction concern they he have write on the fly-leaf of each ` present by re lee ' and we be sure that those of the gallant man to whom they be give who survive the war will now cherish they as precious legacy and hand they down as heirloom in they family these incident unmistakably indicate that general lee conceal under the natural reserve of he character a earnest religious belief and trust in god and we savior nor be this a new sentiment with he after he death a well-worn pocket bible be find in he chamber in which be write re lee lieutenant-colonel we army it be plain from this that even during the day of he earlier manhood in mexico and on the western prairie he have read he bible and strive to conform he life to its teaching with the retirement of the great soldier however from the care of command which necessarily interfere in a large degree with pious exercise and meditation the religious phase of he character become more clearly define assume far more prominent and striking proportion the suffering of the southern people doubtless have a powerful effect upon he and feel the powerlessness of man he must have turn to god for comfort but this inquiry be too profound for the present writer he shrink from the attempt to sound the depths of this truly great soul with the view of discover the influence which mould it into a almost ideal perfection general lee be fortunately for the world surround in he latter day by good and intelligent man fully competent to present a complete exposition of he view and feeling -- and to these the arduous undertaking be leave we easier task be to place upon record such incident as we have gather bear upon the religious phase of the illustrious soldier 's character he earnest piety can not be better display than in the anxiety which he feel for the conversion of he student converse with the rev dr kirkpatrick of the presbyterian church on the subject of the religious welfare of those intrust to he charge he be so overcome by emotion say dr kirkpatrick that he could not utter the word which be on he tongue he utterance be choke but recover himself with he eye overflow with tear he lip quiver with emotion and both hand raise he exclaim : oh doctor if i could only know that all the young man in the college be good christian i should have nothing more to desire when another minister the rev mr jone deliver a earnest address at the concert of prayer for college urge that all christian should pray for the aid of the holy spirit in change the heart of the student general lee after the meeting approach the minister and say with great warmth : i wish sir to thank you for you address it be just what we need we great want be a revival which shall bring these young man to christ one morning while the venerable dr white be pass general lee 's house on he way to chapel the general join he and they enter into conversation upon religious subject general lee say little but just as they reach the college stop and remark with great earnestness he eye fill with tear as he speak : i shall be disappointed sir i shall fail in the lead object that bring I here unless the young man all become real christian and i wish you and other of you sacred profession to de all you can to accomplish this result when a great revival of religious feeling take place at the virginium military institute in 1868 general lee say to the clergyman of he church with deep feeling : that be the best news i have hear since i have be in lexington would that we could have such a revival in all we college although a member of the protestant episcopal church and prefer that communion general lee seem to have be completely exempt from sectarian feeling and to have aim first and last to be a true christian loving god and he neighbor and not busy himself about theological dogma when he be ask once whether he believe in the apostolic succession he reply that he have never think of it and aim only to become a real christian he catholic view be show by the letter of invitation which he address at the commencement of each session of the college to minister of all religious denomination at lexington to conduct in turn the religious exercise at the college chapel and he charity which be large for a person of he limited means be give to all alike these charity he seem to have regard as a binding duty and be so private that only those receive they know any thing of they it only come to be know accidentally that in 1870 he give one hundred dollar for the education of the orphan of southern soldier one hundred dollar to the young man 's christian association and regularly make other donation amount in all to considerable sum nearly he last act be a liberal contribution to a important object connect with he church we shall conclude these anecdote illustrate general lee 's religious character with one for which we be indebted to the kindness of a reverend clergyman of lexington who know general lee intimately in he latter year and enjoy he confidence the incident will present in a agreeable light the great soldier 's simplicity and love for child and no less he catholic feeling in reference to sect in the christian church : i will give you just another incident write the reverend gentleman illustrate general lee 's love for child and they freedom with he when i first come to lexington my boy carter -lrb- just four year old then -rrb- use to go with I to chapel service when it be my turn to officiate the general would tell he that he must always sit by he and it be a scene for a painter to see the great chieftain reverentially listen to the truth of god 's word and the little boy nestle close to he one Sunday we sunday-school superintendent tell the child that they must bring in some new scholar and that they must bring old people as well as the young since none be too old or too wise to learn god 's word the next sabbath carter be with I at the chapel from which he be to go with I to the sunday-school at the close of the service i notice that carter be talk very earnestly with general lee who seem very much amuse and on call he to come with I he say with childish simplicity : ` father i be try to get general lee to go to the sunday-school and _ be my scholar _ ' ` but ' say i ` if the general go to any school he will go to he own ' ` which be he own father ' ` the episcopal ' i reply heave a deep sigh and with a look of disappointment the little fellow say : ' i be very sorry he be ' _ piscopal _ i wish he be a baptist so he could go to _ we _ sunday-school and be my scholar ' the general seem very much amuse and interest as he reply ` ah carter we must all try and be _ good christian _ -- that be the most important thing ' ` he know all the child in town ' add mr jone ` and they grief at he death be very touch ' this incident may appear singular to those who have be accustom to regard general lee as a cold reserve and even stern human being -- a statue beneath whose chill surface no heart ever throb but instead of a marble heart there lay under the gray uniform of the soldier one of warm flesh and blood -- tender impressible susceptible to the quick touch of all gentle and sweet emotion and fill as it be with quiet happiness at the sight of child and the sound of they voice this impressibility have even be make the subject of criticism a foreign writer declare that the soldier 's character exhibit a feminine softness unfitting he for the conduct of affair of moment what the confederacy want intimate the writer in question be a rough dictator with little regard for nice question of law -- one to lay the rough hand of the bear master on the helm and force the crew from the highest to the lowest to obey he will that will probably remain a question general lee 's _ will _ be strong enough to break down all obstacle but those erect by rightful authority that with this masculine strength he unite a exquisite gentleness be equally beyond question a noble action flush he cheek with a emotion that the reader may if he will call feminine a tale of suffer bring a sudden moisture to he eye and a loving message from one of he poor old soldier be see one day to melt he to tear this poor and incomplete attempt to indicate some of the less-known trait of the illustrious commander-in-chief of the southern army will now be bring to a conclusion we approach the sorrowful moment when surround by he weep family -lrb- 1 -rrb- he tranquilly pass away -lrb- footnote 1 : general lee have three son and four daughter all of whom be live except one of the latter miss anne lee who die in north carolina during the war the son be general gw custi lee aide-de-camp to president davi -- subsequently commander of infantry in the field and now president of washington and lee college a officer of such ability and of character so eminent that president davi regard he as a fit successor of he illustrious father in command of the army of northern virginium -- general whf lee a prominent and able commander of cavalry and captain robert e lee a efficient member of the cavalry-staff these gentleman bear they full share in the peril and hardship of the war from its commencement to the surrender at appomattox -rrb- on the 28th of September 1870 after laborious attention to he duty during the early part of the day general lee attend in the afternoon a meeting of the vestry of grace church of which he be a member over this meeting he preside and it be afterward remember that he last public act be to contribute the sum of fifty-five dollar to some good object the requisite amount to effect which be thus make up after the meeting general lee return to he home and when tea be serve take he place at the table to say grace as be he habit as it have be in camp throughout the war he lip open but no sound issue from they and he sink back in he chair from which he be carry to bed the painful intelligence immediately become know throughout lexington and the utmost grief and consternation be visible upon every face it be hope at first that the attack would not prove serious and that general lee would soon be able to resume he duty but this hope be soon dissipate the skilful physician who hasten to he bedside pronounce he malady congestion of the brain and from the appearance of the patient who lay in a species of coma the attack be evidently of the most alarming character the most discouraging phase of the case be that physically general lee be -- if we may so say -- in perfect health he superb physique although not perhaps as vigorous and robust as during the war exhibit no indication whatever of disease he health appear perfect and twenty year more of life might have be predict for he from simple reference to he appearance the malady be more deeply seat however than any bodily disease the cerebral congestion be but a symptom of the mental malady which be kill its victim from the testimony of the able physician who watch the great soldier day and night throughout he illness and be thus best competent to speak upon the subject there seem no doubt that general lee 's condition be the result of mental depression produce by the suffering of the southern people every mail it be say have bring he the most piteous appeal for assistance from old soldier whose family be in want of bread and the woe of these poor people have a prostrate effect upon he a year or two before he health have be seriously impaired by this brooding depression and he have visit north carolina the white sulphur spring and other place to divert he mind in this he fail the shadow go with he and the result be at last the alarming attack from which he never rally during the two week of he illness he scarcely speak and evidently regard he condition as hopeless when one of he physician say to he general you must make haste and get well _ traveller _ have be stand so long in he stable that he need exercise general lee shake he head slowly to indicate that he would never again mount he favorite horse he remain in this state with few alteration in he condition until Wednesday October 12th when about nine in the morning in the midst of he family the great soldier tranquilly expire of the universal grief of the southern people when the intelligence be transmit by telegraph to all part of the country it be not necessary that we should speak the death of lee seem to make all heart stand still and the toll

we people -- say the _ southern magazine _ from whose page this interesting summary be take -- we have think that a selection of the most eloquent or otherwise interesting address deliver at the various memorial meeting may not be unacceptable louisville ky on October 15th nearly the whole city be drape in mourning and business be suspend a funeral service be hold at st paul 's church in the evening a immense meeting assemble at weissiger hall and after a opening address by mayor baxter the follow resolution be adopt : _ resolve _ that in the death of robert e lee the american people without regard to state or section or antecedent or opinion lose a great and good man a distinguished and useful citizen renown not less in arm than in the art of peace and that the cause of public instruction and popular culture be deprive of a representative whose influence and example will be feel by the youth of we country for long age after the passion in the midst of which he be engage but which he do not share have pass into history and the peace and fraternity of the american republic be cement and restore by the broadest and purest american sentiment _ resolve _ that a copy of these resolution be forward to the family of general lee to the trustee of washington college and to the governor and general assembly of virginium address of general breckinridge _ mr president lady and gentleman _ : in the humble part which it fall to I to take in these interesting ceremony if for any cause it have be suppose that i be to deliver a lengthy address i be not responsible for the origination of that supposition i come here to-night simply to mingle my grief with yours at the loss of one of we most distinguished citizen and indeed i feel more like silence than like word i be awe-stricken in the presence of this vast assemblage and my mind go back to the past it be preoccupy by memory come in prominent review of the frequent and ever-varying vicissitude which have characterize the last ten year i find myself in the presence of a vast assemblage of the people of this great and grow city who meet together without distinction of party and preside over by you chief officer for the purpose of express respect to the memory of the man who be the leader of the confederate army in the late war between the state it be in itself the omen of reunion i be not surprise at the spectacle present here throughout the entire south one universal cry of grief have break forth at the death of general lee and in a very large portion of the north manly and noble tribute have be pay to he memory my word shall be brief but plain why be it that at the south we see this universal spontaneous demonstration first because most of the people mourn the loss of a leader and a friend but beyond that i must say they seem to enter a unconscious protest against the ascription either to he or they of treason or personal dishonor it may be a unconscious protest against the employment by a portion of the public press of those epithet which have cease to be use in social intercourse it be a invitation on they part to the people of the north and south east and west if there be any remain rancor in they bosom to bury it in the grave forever i will not recall the past i will not enter upon any consideration of the cause of that great struggle this demonstration we see around we give the plainest evidence that there be no disposition to indulge in useless repining at the result of that great struggle it be for the pen of the historian to declare the cause progress and probable consequence of it in regard to those who follow general lee who glory in he success and share he misfortune i have but this to say : the world watch the contest in which they be engage and yet give testimony to they gallantry the magnanimity with which they accept the result of they defeat the obedience they have yield to the law of the federal government give a exhibition so rare that they be ennoble by they calm yet noble submission for the rest they escutcheon be unstained the conqueror themselves for they own glory must confess that they be brave neither my friend do i come here to-night to speak of the military career of general lee i need not speak of it this evening i believe that this be universally recognize not only in the united state but in europe it have make the circuit of the world i come but to utter my tribute to he as a man and as a citizen as a man he will be remember in history as a man of the epoch how little need i to speak of he character after listen to the thrilling delineation of it which we have this morning we all know that he be great noble and self-poised he be just and moderate but be perhaps misunderstand by those who be not personally acquaint with he he be suppose to be just but cold far from it he have a warm affectionate heart during the last year of that unfortunate struggle it be my good fortune to spend a great deal of time with he i be almost constantly by he side and it be during the two month immediately precede the fall of richmond that i come to know and fully understand the true nobility of he character in all those long vigil he be considerate and kind gentle firm and self-poised i can give no better idea of the impression it make upon I than to say it inspire I with a ardent love of the man and a profound veneration of he character it be so massive and noble so grand in its proportion that all man must admire its heroism and gallantry yet so gentle and tender that a woman might adopt and claim it as she own if the spirit which animate the assembly before I to-night shall become general and permeate the whole country then may we say the wound of the late war be truly heal we ask for he only what we give to other among the more eminent of the depart federal general who be distinguish for they gallantry they nobility of character and they patriotism may be mention thoma and mcpherson what confederate be there who would refuse to raise he cap as they funeral-train go by or hesitate to drop a flower upon they grave why because they be man of courage honor and nobility because they be true to they conviction of right and soldier whose hand be unstained by cruelty or pillage those of we who be so fortunate as to know he and who have appear before this assemblage compose of all shades of opinion claim for he you veneration because he be pure and noble and it be because of this that we see the city and town of the south in mourning this have be the expression throughout the whole south without distinction of party and also of a large portion of the north be not this why these tribute have be pay to he memory be it not because he piety be humble and sincere because he accord in victory because he fill he position with admirable dignity because he teach he prostrate comrade how to suffer and be strong in a word because he be one of the noblest product of this hemisphere a fit object to sit in the niche which he create in the temple of fame but he fail the result be in the future it may be for better or for worse we hope for the better but this be not the test for he greatness and goodness success often gild the shallow man but it be disaster alone that reveal the quality of true greatness be he life a failure be only that man successful who erect a material monument of greatness by the enforcement of he idea be not that man successful also who by he valor moderation and courage with all they associate virtue present to the world such a specimen of true manhood as he child and child 's child will be proud to imitate in this sense he be not a failure pardon I for have detain you so long i know there be here and there those who will reach out and attempt to pluck from he name the glory which surround it and strike with malignant fury at the honor award to he yet history will declare that the remains which repose in the vault beneath the little chapel in the lovely virginium valley be not only those of a valorous soldier but those of a great and good american general john w finnell next address the audience briefly and be follow by general william preston _ mr chairman lady and gentleman _ : i feel that it would be very difficult for I to add any eulogy to those which be contain in the resolution of the committee or a more merited tribute of praise than those which have already fall from the lip of the gentleman who have precede I yet on a occasion like this i be willing to come forward and add a word to testify my appreciation of the great virtue and admirable character of one that command not only we admiration but that of the entire country not alone of the entire country but he character have excite more admiration in europe than among ourselves in come age he name will be mark with lustre and will be one of the richest treasure of the future i speak of one just go down to death ripe in all the noble attribute of manhood and illustrious by deed the most remarkable in character that have occur in the history of america since its discovery it be now some two-and-twenty year since i first make the acquaintance of general lee he be then in the prime of manhood in mexico and i first see he as the chief-engineer of general scott in the valley of mexico i see around I two old comrade who then see general lee he be a man of remarkable personal beauty and great grace of body he have a finished form delicate hand graceful in person while here and there a gray hair streak with silver the dark lock with which nature have clothe he noble brow there be discerning mind that appreciate he genius and saw in he the come captain of america he commander and he comrade appreciate he ability to a club which be then organize he belong together with general mcclellan general albert sydney johnston general beauregard and a host of other they recognize in lee a master-spirit he be never violent he never wrangle he be averse to quarrel and not a single difficulty mark he career but all acknowledge he justness and wonderful evenness of mind rare intelligence combine with these quality serve to make he a fit representative of he great prototype general washington he have be accomplish by every finish that a military education could bestow i remember when general lee be appoint lieutenant-colonel at the same time that sydney johnston be appoint colonel and general scott think that lee should have be colonel i be talk with general scott on the subject long before the late struggle between the north and south take place and he then say that lee be the greatest living soldier in america he do not object to the other commission but he think lee should have be first promote finally he say to I with emphasis which you will pardon I for relate ' i tell you that if i be on my death-bed to-morrow and the president of the united state should tell I that a great battle be to be fight for the liberty or slavery of the country and ask my judgment as to the ability of a commander i would say with my die breath let it be robert e lee ' ah great soldier that he be princely general that he be he have fulfil he mission and bear it so that no invidious tongue can level the shaft of calumny at the great character which he have leave behind he but lady and gentleman it be not in this that the matchless attribute of he character be find you have assemble here not so much to do honor to general lee but to testify you appreciation of the worth of the principle govern he character and if the mind of this assemblage be explore you would find there be a gentleness and a grace in he character which have win you love and bring forth testimonial of universal admiration take but a single instance at the battle of gettysburg after the attack on the cemetery when he troops be repulse and beat the man throw up they musket and say ` general we have fail and it be we fault ' ` no my man ' say he know the style of fighting of general stonewall jackson ` you have do well ` tis my fault i be to blame and no one but I ' what man be there that would not have go to renew death for such a leader so when we examine he whole character it be in he private life that you find he true greatness -- the christian simplicity of he character and he great veneration for truth and nobility the grand element of he greatness what man could have lay down he sword at the foot of a victorious general with greater dignity than do he at appomattox court-house he lay down he sword with grace and dignity and secure for he soldier the best term that fortune would permit in that he show marked greatness seldom show by great captain after the battle of sedan the wild cry of the citizen of paris go out for the blood of the emperor but at appomattox veneration and love only meet the eye of the troops who look upon they commander i will not trespass upon you time much farther when i last see he the raven hair have turn white in a small village church he reverent head be bow in prayer the humblest step be that of robert e lee as he enter the portal of the temple erect to god in broken response he answer to the service of the church noble sincere and humble in he religion he show forth he true character in lay aside he sword to educate the youth of he country never do he appear more noble than at that time he be now go and rest in peace and have cross that mysterious stream that stonewall jackson see with inspired eye when he ask that he might be permit to take he troops across the river and forever rest beneath the shadow of the tree after a few remark from hon dy lyttle the meeting adjourn augusta ga a meeting be hold at augusta on October 18th at the city hall the preamble and resolution adopt be as follow : _ whereas _ this day throughout all this southern land sorrow many-tongued be ascend to heaven for the death of robert e lee and community everywhere be honor themselves in strive to do honor to that great name and we the people of augusta who be not laggard in uphold he glorious banner while it float to the breeze would swell the general lamentation of he departure : therefore be it _ resolve _ that no people in the tide of time have be bereave as we be bereave for no other people have have such a man to lose greece rich in hero rome prolific mother of great citizen so that the name of roman be the synonyme of all that be noblest in citizenship -- have no man come up to the full measure of this great depart on score of battle-field consummate commander everywhere bravest soldier in failure sublimest hero in disband he army most pathetic of writer in persecution most patient of power 's victim in private life purest of man -- he be such that all christendom with one consent name he great we recall that so also mankind have style alexander caesar frederick and napoleon and beholding in the confederate leader quality higher and better than theirs find that language poor indeed which only enable we to call he ` great ' -- he stand among the great of all age preëminent _ resolve _ that we admiration of the man be not the partial judgment of he adherent only but so clear stand he greatness and he goodness that even the bitterest of foe have not venture to asperse he while the air have be fill with calumny and reviling of he cause none have be aim at he if there be spirit so base that they can not discover and reverence he greatness and he goodness they have at least shrink from encounter the certain indignation of mankind this day -- disfranchise by stupid power as he be brand as he be in the perverted vocabulary of usurper as rebel and traitor -- he death have even in distant land move more tongue and stir more heart than the siege of a mighty city and the triumph of a great king _ resolve _ that while he die far too soon for he country he have live long enough for he fame this be complete and the future could unfold nothing to add to it in this age of startling change imagination might have picture he even in the year which he yet lack of the allotted period of human life once more at the head of devoted army and the conqueror of glorious field but none could have be more glorious than those he have already win wrong too might again have triumph over right and he have bear defeat with sublimest resignation but this he have already do at appomattox unrelenting hate to he lost cause might have again consign he to the walk of private life and he have become a exemplar of all the virtue of a private station but this he have already be in the shades of lexington the contingency of the future could only have reveal he greatest soldier sublimest hero best of man and he be already all of these the year to come be barren of any thing which could add to he perfect name and fame he have nothing to lose but alas we he people every thing by he departure from this world which be unworthy of he to that other where the good and the pure of all age will welcome he thither follow he the undying love of every true southern man and woman and the admiration of all the world address of general ar wright _ mr chairman _ : i rise simply to move the adoption of the resolution which have just be read to the meeting by major cum you have hear and the people here assemble have hear these resolution they be truthful eloquent and expressive although announce as a speaker on this sad occasion i have determine to forego any such attempt but a allusion a pass reference to one of the sublime virtue of the illustrious dead make in the resolution which have just be read in you hearing have induce I to add a word or two you resolution speak of general lee 's patience under the persecution of power it be this virtue which ennoble the character as it be one of the most prominent trait in the life of he for whose death a whole nation grief-stricken mourn and to pay a tribute to the memory of whom this multitude have assemble here this morning while general lee be all and more than have be say of he -- the great general the true christian and the valiant soldier -- there be another character in which he appear more conspicuously than in any of the rest -- the quiet dignity with which he encounter defeat and the patience with which he meet the persecution of malignant power we may search the page of all history both sacred and profane and there seem to be but one character who possess in so large a degree this remarkable trait take general lee 's whole life and examine it observe he skill and courage as a soldier he patriotism and he fidelity to principle the purity of he private life and then remember the disaster which he face and the persecution to which he be subject and it would seem that _ no one _ ever endure so much -- not even david the sweet singer of israel job have be hand down to posterity by the page of sacred history as the embodiment of patience as the man who overwhelm with the most numerous and bitter affliction never lose he fortitude and who endure every fresh trial with uncomplaining resignation but it seem to I that even job display not the patience of we own loved hero for while job suffer much he endure less than general lee job be compel to lose he child he friend and he property but he be never require to give up country general lee be and with more than the persecution of job he stand reveal to the world the truest and the most sublime hero whom the age have produce to a patriot like lee the loss of country be the greatest evil which could be experienced and it be this last blow which have cause we to assemble here to-day to mourn he departure he lose friend and kindred and property in the struggle and yet accord to the news which the telegraph bring we this morning it be the loss of he cause which finally sunder the heart-string of the hero and draw he from earth to heaven yes the weight of this great sorrow which first fall upon he under the fatal apple-tree at appomattox have dwell with he grow heavier and more unendurable with each succeed year from that time until last Wednesday morn when the soul of lee pass away as i say before mr chairman i only rise to move the adoption of the resolution and if i have say more than i ought to have say it be because i know the illustrious dead because i love he and because i mourn he loss address of judge hilliard it be proper that the people should pay a public tribute to the memory of a great man when he die not a ruler not one who merely hold a great public position but a great man one who have serve he day and generation it can not benefit the dead but it be eminently profitable to the live the consciousness than when we cease to live we memory will be cherish be a noble incentive to live well this great popular demonstration be due to general lee 's life and character it be not order by the government -- the government ignore he but be render as a spontaneous tribute to the memory of a illustrious man -- good true and great he hold no place in the government and since the war have have no military rank but he be a true man after all that be the noblest tribute you can pay to any man to say of he he be a true man general lee 's character be eminently american in europe they have they idea they standard of merit they reward for great exploit they cover one with decoration they give he a great place in the government they make he a marshal wellington begin he career with humble rank he be young wellesley he rise to be the duke of wellington in we country we have no such reward for great deed one must enjoy the patronage of the government or he must take the fortune of private life general lee be educate at the great military academy west point he enter the army be promote from time to time for brilliant service in mexico fight gallantly under the flag of the united state and be still advance in he military career in 1861 when virginium become involve in the great contest that then grow up between the state virginium be he mother she call he to she side to defend she and resign he commission in the army of the united state not for a moment look for advancement there not count the cost not offer he sword to the service of power nor yet lay it down at the foot of the government -- he unsheathe it and take he stand in defense of the great principle assert by virginium in the revolution when she contend with great britain the right of every people to choose they own form of government lose or win to he the cause be always the same -- it be the cause of constitutional liberty he stand by it to the last what must have be the conviction of a man like general lee when mount on the same horse that have bear he in battle upon which he be seat when the line of battle form by he own heroic man waver and he seize the standard to lead the charge but he soldier rush to he and lay they hand on he bridle say ` general we can not fire a gun unless you retire ' what must have be he emotion as he ride through he own line at appomattox to the commander of the oppose army and tender he sword search the annals of history ancient and modern consult the life of hero study the example of greatness record in greece lead the way on the triumph of popular liberty or in rome in the best day of she imperial rule take statesman general or man of patient think who outwatch the star in explore knowledge and i declare to you that i do not find anywhere a sublimer sentiment than general lee utter when he say ` human virtue ought to be equal to human calamity ' it will live forever general lee die at the right time he sun do not go down in the strife of battle in the midst of the thunder of cannon dim by the lurid smoke of war he survive all this : live with so much dignity silent yet thoughtful unseduced by the offer of gain or of advancement however tempting disdain to enter into contest for small object until the broad disk go down behind the virginium hill shed its depart lustre not only upon this country but upon the whole world he memory be as much respect in england as it be here and at the north as well as at the south true heart honor it there be one thing i wish to say before i take my seat general lee 's fame ought to rest on the true base he do not draw he sword to perpetuate human slavery whatever may have be he opinion in regard to it he do not seek to overthrow the government of the united state he draw it in defense of constitutional liberty that cause be not dead but will live forever the result of the war establish the authority of the united state the union will stand -- let it stand forever the flag float over the whole country from the atlantic to the pacific let it increase in lustre and let the power of the government grow still the cause for which general lee strike be not a lose cause it be concede that these state must continue unite under a common government we do not wish to sunder it nor to disturb it but the great principle that underlie the government of the united state -- the principle that the people have a right to choose they own form of government and to have they liberty protect by the provision of the constitution -- be a indestructible principle you can not destroy it like milton 's angel it be immortal you may wind but you can not kill it it be like the volcanic fire that flame in the depths of the earth it will yet upheave the ocean and the land and flame up to heaven young emmett say ` let no man write my epitaph until my country be free and take she place among the nation of the earth ' but you may write general lee 's epitaph now the principle for which he fight will survive he he evening be in perfect harmony with he life he have time to think to recall the past to prepare for the future a offer originate in georgium and i believe in this very city be make to he to place a immense sum of money at he disposal if he would consent to reside in the city of new york and represent southern commerce million would have flow to he but he decline he say : ` no i be grateful but i have a self-imposed task which i must accomplish i have lead the young man of the south in battle i have see many of they fall under my standard i shall devote my life now to training young man to do they duty in life ' and he do it be beautiful to see he in that glorious valley where lexington stand the lofty mountain throw they protect shadow over its quiet home general lee 's fame be not bound by the limit of the south nor by the continent i rejoice that the south give he birth i rejoice that the south will hold he ash but he fame belong to the human race washington too be bear in the south and sleep in the south but he great fame be not to be appropriate by this country it be the inheritance of mankind we place the name of lee by that of washington they both belong to the world new orlean a meeting be hold in the st charle theater as the largest building in the city the hon wm burwell deliver a eloquent address of which we regret that we have be able to obtain no report the meeting be then address by the hon thoma j semme robert e lee be dead the potomac overlook by the home of the hero once divide contend people but now no longer a boundary convey to the ocean a nation 's tear south of the potomac be mourn profound grief pervade every heart lamentation be hear from every hearth for lee sleep among the slay whose memory be so dear to we in the language of moina : ` they be slay for we and they blood flow out in a rain for we red rich and pure on the plain for we and year may go but we tear shall flow o'er the dead who have die in vain for we ' north of the potomac not only sympathize with its widow sister but with respectful homage the brave and generous clustering around the corpse of the great virginian with one accord exclaim : ` this earth that bear thee dead bear not alive so stout a gentleman ' sympathetic nation to whom we lamentation have be transmit on the wing of lightning will with pious jealousy envy we grief because robert e lee be a american seven city claim the honor of have give birth to the great pagan poet but all christian nation while revere america as the mother of robert e lee will claim for the nineteenth century the honor of he birth there be but one lee the great christian captain and he fame justly belong to christendom the nineteenth century have attack every thing -- it have attack god the soul reason moral society the distinction between good and evil christianity be vindicate by the virtue of lee he be the most brilliant and cogent argument in favor of a system illustrate by such a man he be the type of the reign of law in the moral order -- that reign of law which the philosophic duke of argyll have so recently and so ably discuss as pervade the natural as well as the supernatural world one of the chief characteristic of the christian be duty throughout a checkered life the conscientious performance of duty seem to have be the mainspring of the action of general lee in he relation of father son husband soldier citizen duty shine conspicuous in all he act he agency as he advance to more elevated station attract more attention and surround he with a brighter halo of glory but he be unchanged from first to last it be robert e lee the most momentous act of he life be the selection of side at the commencement of the political trouble which immediately precede the recent conflict high in military rank caress by general scott court by those possess of influence and authority no politician happy in he domestic relation and in the enjoyment of competent fortune consist in the main of property situate on the border of virginium -- nevertheless impel by a sense of duty as he himself testify before a congressional committee since the war general lee determine to risk all and unite he fortune with those of he native state whose ordinance as one of she citizen he consider himself bind to obey have join the confederate army he complain not that he be assign to the obscure duty of construct coast-defence for south carolina and georgia nor that he be subsequently relegate to unambitious command in western virginia the accidental circumstance that general joseph e johnston be wound at the battle of seven pine in may 1862 place lee in command of the army of northern virginium as commander of that army he achieve world-wide reputation without give occasion during a period of three year to any complaint on the part of officer man or citizen or enemy that he have be guilty of any act illegal oppressive unjust or inhuman in its character this be the highest tribute possible to the wisdom and virtue of general lee for as a general rule law be degrade officer whether justly or unjustly be constantly the subject of complaint and discord and jealousy prevail in camp and in the senate-chamber there be a fraction of we people represent by a unavailing minority in congress who either feel or profess to feel a jealousy whose theory be just but whose application at such a time be unsound they wish to give as little power as possible because they dread a military despotism and thus desire to send we army forth with half a shield and broken sword to protect the government from its enemy lest if the buckler be entire and the sword perfect they might be tempt in the heyday of victory to smite they employer but this want of confidence never manifest itself toward general lee whose conduct satisfy the most suspicious that he ambition be not of glory but of the performance of duty the army always feel this : the fact that he sacrifice no mass of human being in desperate charge that he might gather laurel from the spot enrich by they gore a year or more before he be appoint commander-in-chief of all the confederate force a bill pass congress create that office it fail to become a law the president have withhold he approval lee make no complaint he friend solicit no vote to counteract the veto when a bill for the same purpose be pass at a subsequent period it be whisper about that he could not accept the position to a committee of virginian who have call on he to ascertain the truth he reply be that he feel bind to accept any post the duty of which he country believe he competent to perform after the battle of gettysburg he tender he resignation to president davi because he be apprehensive he failure the responsibility for which he do not pretend to throw on he troops or officer would produce distrust of he ability and destroy he usefulness i be inform the president in a beautiful and touching letter decline to listen to such a proposition during the whole period of the war he steadily decline all present and when on one occasion a gentleman send he several dozen of wine he turn it over to the hospital in richmond say the wound and sick need it more than he he be extremely simple and unostentatious in he habit and share with he soldier they privation as well as they danger toward the close of the war meat be very scarce within the confederate line in the neighborhood of the contend army a aide of the president have occasion to visit general lee en official business in the field be invite to dinner the meal spread on the table consist of corn-bread and a small piece of bacon bury in a large dish of green the quick-eyed aide discover that none of the company which be compose of the general 's personal staff partook of the meat though request to do so in the most urbane manner by the general who preside he therefore also decline and notice that the meat be carry off untouched after the meal be over he inquire of one of the officer present what be the reason for this extraordinary conduct he reply be ` we have borrow the meat for the occasion and promise to return it ' duty alone induce this great soldier to submit to such privation for the slightest intimation give to friend in richmond would have fill he tent with all the luxury that blockade-runner and speculator have introduce for the favored few able to purchase this performance of duty be accompany by no harsh manner or cynical expression for the man whose soul be ennoble by true heroism possess a heart as tender as it be firm he calmness under the most try circumstance and he uniform sweetness of manner be almost poetical they manifest ` the most sustained tenderness of soul that ever caress the chord of a lyre ' in council he be temperate and patient and he word fall softly and evenly as snow-flake like the sentence that fall from the lip of ulyss on the termination of the war he conduct until he death have challenge the admiration of friend and foe he honestly acquiesce in the inevitable result of the struggle no discontent sourness or complaint have mar he tranquil life at washington college where death find he at he post of duty engage in fitting the young man of he country by proper discipline and education for the performance of the varied duty of life it be somewhat singular that both lee and he great lieutenant jackson should in they last moment have refer to hill it be report that general lee say ` let my tent be strike send for hill ' while the lament jackson in he delirium cry out ` let ap hill prepare for action march the infantry rapidly to the front let we cross over the river and rest under the shade of the tree ' both hero die with command for military movement on they lip both the noblest specimen of the christian soldier produce by any country or any age both now rest under the shade of the tree of heaven rev dr palmer then speak as follow : _ lady and gentleman _ : i should have be better pleased have i be permit to sit a simple listener to the eloquent tribute pay to the immortal chieftain who now repose in death by the speaker who have just take he seat the nature of my call so far separate I from public life that i be scarcely competent for the office of allude to the element which naturally gather around he career when inform that other artist would draw the picture of the warrior and the hero i yield a cheerful compliance in the belief that nothing be leave but to describe the christian and the man you be entirely familiar with the early life of he over whose grave you this night shed tear with he grave and sedate boyhood give promise of the reserved force of mature manhood with he academic career at west point where he receive the highest honor of a class brilliant with such name as general joseph e johnston he seizure of the highest honor of a long apprenticeship in that institution and he abrupt ascension in the mexican war from obscurity to fame -- all be too firmly stamp in the mind of he admirer to require even a allusion you be too familiar to need a repetition from my lip of that great mental and spiritual struggle pass not one night but many when abandon the service in which he have gather so much of honor and reputation he determine to lay he heart upon the altar of he native state and swear to live or die in she defense it would be a somewhat singular subject of speculation to discover how it be that national character so often remarkably express itself in single individual who be bear as representative of a class it be wonderful for it have be the remark of age how the great be bear in cluster sometimes indeed one star shine with solitary splendor in the firmament above but generally gather in grand constellation fill the sky with glory what be that combination of influence partly physical partly intellectual but somewhat more moral which should make a particular country productive of man great over all other on earth and to all age of time ancient greece with she indented coast invite to maritime adventure from she earliest period be the mother of hero in war of poet in song of sculptor and artist and stand up after the lapse of century the educator of mankind living in the grandeur of she work and in the immortal production of mind which modern civilization with all its cultivation and refinement and science never surpass and scarcely equal and why in the three hundred year of american history it should be give to the old dominion to be the grand mother not only of state but of the man by whom state and empire be form it might be curious be it possible for we to inquire unquestionably mr president there be in this problem the element of race for he be blind to all the truth of history to all the revelation of the past who do not recognize a select race as we recognize a select individual of a race to make all history but pretermitt all speculation of that sort when virginium unfold the scroll of she immortal son -- not because illustrious man do not precede he gather in constellation and cluster but because the name shine out through those constellation and cluster in all its peerless grandeur -- we read the name of george washington and then mr president after the interval of three-quarter of a century when you jealous eye have range down the record and trace the name that history will never let die you come to the name -- the only name in all the annals of history that can be name in the perilous connection -- of robert e lee the second washington well may old virginium be proud of she twin son bear almost a century apart but shine like those binary star which open they glory and shed they splendor on the darkness of the world sir it be not a artifice of rhetoric which suggest this parallel between two great name in american history for the suggestion spring spontaneously to every mind and man scarcely speak of lee without thinking of a mysterious connection that bind the two together they be alike in the presage of they early history -- the history of they boyhood both earnest grave studious both alike in that peculiar purity which belong only to a noble boy and which make he a brave and noble man fill the page of a history spotless until close in death alike in that commanding presence which seem to be the signature of heaven sometimes place on a great soul when to that soul be give a fit dwelling-place alike in that noble carriage and command dignity exercise a mesmeric influence and a hidden power which could not be repress upon all who come within its charm alike in the remarkable combination and symmetry of they intellectual attribute all bring up to the same equal level no faculty of the mind overlap any other -- all so equal so well develop the judgment the reason the memory the fancy that you be almost dispose to deny they greatness because no single attribute of the mind be project upon itself just as object appear sometimes smaller to the eye from the exact symmetry and beauty of they proportion alike above all in that soul-greatness that christian virtue to which so beautiful a tribute have be render by my friend whose high privilege it be to be a compeer and comrade with the immortal dead although in another department and sphere and yet alike mr president in they external fortune so strangely dissimilar -- the one the representative and the agent of a stupendous revolution which it pleased heaven to bless and give birth to one of the mightiest nation on the globe the other the representative and agent of a similar revolution upon which it pleased high heaven to throw the darkness of its frown so that bear upon he generous heart the weight of this crushed cause he be at length overwhelm and the nation whom he lead in battle gather with spontaneity of grief over all this land which be plough with grave and redden with blood and the tear of a widow nation in she bereavement be shed over he honor grave but these crude suggestion which fall almost impromptu from my lip suggest that which i desire to offer before this audience to-night i accept robert e lee as the true type of the american man and the southern gentleman a brilliant english writer have well remark with a touch of sound philosophy that when a nation have rush upon its fate the whole force of the national life will sometimes shoot up in one grand character like the aloe which bloom at the end of a hundred year shoot up in one single spike of glory and then expire and wherever philosophy refinement and culture have go upon the globe it be possible to place the finger upon individual man who be the exemplar of a nation 's character those typical form under which other less noble less expand have manifest themselves that gentle that perfect moderation that self-command which enable he to be so self-possessed amid the most try difficulty of he public career a refinement almost such as that which mark the character of the purest woman be blended in he with that massive strength that mighty endurance that consistency and power which give he and the people whom he lead such momentum under the disadvantage of the struggle through which he pass bear from the general level of american society blood of a noble ancestry flow in he vein and he be a type of the race from which he spring such be the grandeur and urbaneness of he manner the dignity and majesty of he carriage that he only peer in social life could be find in court and among those educate amid the refinement of court and throne in that regard there be something beautiful and appropriate that he should become in the later year of he life the educator of the young sir it be a cause for mourn before high heaven to-night that he be not spare thirty year to educate a generation for the time that be to come for as in the day when the red banner stream over the land the south send she son to fight under he flag and beneath the wave of he sword these son have be send again to sit at he foot when he be the disciple of the muse and the teacher of philosophy oh that he might have bring he more than regal character he majestic fame all he intellectual and moral endowment to the task of fitting those that should come in the crisis of the future to take the mantle that have fall from he shoulder and bear it to the generation that be unborn general lee i accept as the representative of he people and of the temper with which this whole southland enter into that gigantic that prolonged and that disastrous struggle which have close but close as to we in grief sir they wrong we who say that the south be ever impatient to rupture the bond of the american union the war of 1776 which sir have no more yet a written history than have the war of 1861 to 1865 tell we that it be this southland that work the revolution of 1776 we be the heir of all the glory of that immortal struggle it be purchase with we blood with the blood of we father which yet flow in these vein and which we desire to transmit pure and consecrate to the son that be bear to we loin the tradition of the past sixty year be a portion of we heritage and it never be easy for any great heart and reflective mind even to seem to part with that heritage to enter upon the perilous effort of establish a new nationality mr president it be my privilege once to be thrill in a short speech utter by one of the noblest name clustering upon the roll of south carolina for sir south carolina be virginia 's sister and south carolina stand by virginium in the old struggle as virginium stand by south carolina in the new and the little state small as greece barren in resource but great only in the grandeur of the man in they gigantic proportion whom she like virginium be permit to produce -- i hear sir one of south carolina 's noblest son speak once thus : ' i walk through the tower of london that grand repository where be gather the memorial of england 's martial prowess and when the guide in the pride of he english heart point to the spoil of war collect through century of the past ' say this speaker lifting himself upon tiptoe that he might reach to he greatest height ' i say you can not point to one single trophy from my people or my country though england engage in two disastrous war with she ' sir this be the sentiment we love every inch of american soil and love every part of that canvas -lrb- point to the star and stripe above he -rrb- which as a symbol of power and authority float from the spire and from the mast-head of we vessel and it be after the anguish of a woman in birth that this land that now lie in she sorrow and ruin take upon herself that great peril but it be all emblematize in the regret experience by he whose praise be upon we lip and who like the english nelson recognize duty engrave in letter of light as the only ensign he could follow and who tear away from all the association of he early life and abandon the reputation gain in the old service make up he mind to embark in the new and with that modesty and that firmness belong only to the truly great express he willingness to live and die in the position assign to he and i accept this noble chieftain equally as the representative of this southland in the spirit of he retirement from struggle it could not escape any speaker upon this platform to allude to the dignity of that retirement how from the moment he surrender he withdraw from observation hold aloof from all political complication and devote he entire energy to the great work he have undertake to discharge in this he represent -- a the true attitude of the south since the close of the war attitude of quiet submission to the conquer power and of obedience to all exaction but without resile from those great principle which be embalm in the struggle and which as the conviction of a lifetime no honest mind could release all over this land of ours there be man like lee -- not as great not as symmetrical in the development of character not as grand in the proportion which they have reach but who like he be sleep upon memory that be holy as death and who amid all reproach appeal to the future and to the tribunal of history when she shall render she final verdict in reference to the struggle close for the vindication of the people embark in that struggle we be silent resign obedient and thoughtful sleep upon solemn memory mr president but as say by the poet-preacher in the good book ' i sleep but my heart waketh ' look upon the future that be to come and powerless in every thing except to pray to almighty god who rule the destiny of nation that those who have the power may at least have the grace give they to preserve the constitutional principle which we have endeavor to maintain and sir be it my privilege to speak in the hearing of the entire nation i would utter with the profoundest emphasis this pregnant truth : that no people ever traverse those moral idea which underlie its character its constitution its institution and its law that do not in the end perish in disaster in shame and in dishonor whatever be the glory the material civilization of which such a nation may boast it still hold true that the truth be immortal and that idea rule the world and now i have but a single word to say and that be that the grave of this noble hero be bedew with the most tender and sacred tear ever shed upon a human tomb i be think in my study this afternoon strive to strike out something i might utter on this platform and this parallel between the first washington and the second occur to I i ask my own heart the question ` would you not accept the fame and the glory and the career of robert e lee just as soon as accept the glory and career of the immortal man who be he predecessor ' sir there be a pathos in fall fortune which stir the sensibility and touch the very fountain of human feeling i be not sure that at this moment napoleon the enforced guest of the prussian king be not grander than when he ascend the throne of france there be a grandeur in misfortune when that misfortune be bear by a noble heart with the strength of will to endure and endure without complain or break perhaps i slip easily into this train of remark for it be my peculiar office to speak of that chasten with which a gracious providence visit man on this earth and by which he prepare they for heaven hereafter and what be true of individual in a state of adversity be true of nation when clothe in sorrow sir the man in these gallery that once wear the gray be here to-night that they may bend the knee in reverence at the grave of he whose voice and hand they obey amid the storm of battle : the young widow who but as yesterday lean upon the arm of she soldier-husband but now clasp wildly to she breast the young child that never behold its father 's face come here to shed she tear over this grave to-night and the aged matron with the tear streaming from she eye as she recall she unforgotten dead lie on the plain of gettysburg or on the height of fredericksburg now to-night join in we dirge over he who be that son 's chieftain and counsellor and friend a whole nation have rise up in the spontaneity of its grief to render the tribute of its love sir there be a unity in the grape when they grow together in the cluster upon the vine and hold the bunch in you hand you speak of it as one but there be another unity when you throw these grape into the wine-press and the foot of those that bruise these grape trample they almost profanely beneath they foot together in the communion of pure wine and such be the union and communion of heart that have be fuse by tribulation and sorrow and that meet together in the true feeling of a honest grief to express the homage of they affection as well as to render a tribute of praise to he upon whose face we shall never look until on that immortal day when we shall behold it transfigure before the throne of god the meeting then adopt the follow preamble and resolution : _ whereas _ like orphan at the grave of a parent untimely snatch away we heart have linger and brood with a grief that no cunning of speech could interpret over the think that robert edward lee exist no more in bodily life in sensible form in visible presence for we love and veneration for we edification and guidance for we comfort and solace and -- _ whereas _ we have invoke all mute funeral emblem to aid we with they utmost eloquence of woe and we can not content ourselves with contemplate from the depth and the gloom of we bereavement the exalted and radiant virtue of the dead : _ resolve _ that we the people of new orlean have come together under one common impulse to render united homage to the memory which hold mastery in we mind whether we turn with bitter regard to the past or with prayerful and chasten aspiration to the future _ resolve _ that as louisianian as southerner as american we proudly claim we share in the fame of lee as a inheritance rightfully belong to we and endowed with which we shall piously cherish though all calamity should rain upon we true poverty -- the poverty indeed that abase and starve the spirit can never approach we with its noisome breath and withering look _ resolve _ that it be infinitely more bitter to have to mourn the loss of we lee than not to have learn to prize he as the noblest gift which could have be allot to a people and a epoch a grand man round to the symmetry of equal moral and intellectual power grace and accomplishment a man whose masterly and heroic energy leave nothing undo in defend a just cause while there be a possibility of striking for it a rational and hopeful blow and whose sublime resignation when the last blow be strike in vain and when human virtue be challenge to match itself with the consummation of human adversity teach wiser more convincing more reassure more soul-sustaining lesson than be to be find in all the philosophy of all book _ resolve _ that worthily to show we veneration for this majestic and beautiful character we must revolve it habitually in we thought and try to appropriate it to the purification and elevation of we life and so educate we child that they shall if possible grow up into its likeness _ resolve _ that while it be honorable for a people to deeply lament the death of such a man it would be glorious for a generation to mould itself after he model for it would be a generation fraught with all high manly quality temper with all gentle and christian virtue for truth love goodness health strength would be with it and consequently victory liberty majesty and beauty _ resolve _ that we would hail the erection of the propose monument as well adapt to the purpose of preserve this admirable and most precious memory as a vital and beneficent influence for all time to come and we will therefore cordially aid in promote the lee monument which have just be inaugurate atlanta ga a crowded meeting assemble in this city on October 15th after a impressive prayer from the rev dr brantly the meeting be address by general john b gordon _ my friend _ : we have meet to weep to mingle we tear and give vent to we burst heart the sorrowing south already clothe in mourner ' weed bow she head afresh to-day in a heart-stricken orphanage and if i could have be permit to indulge the sensibility of my heart i would have flee this most honorable task and in solitude and silence have weep the loss of the great and good man whose death we so deplore i love general lee for it be my proud privilege to know he well i love he with a profound and all-filial love with a sincere and unfaded affection i say i would have retire from this flattering task which you kindness have impose but remember that he word he deed he great example have teach we that duty be the most commanding obligation i yield this morning to you wish we have meet to honor general lee to honor he dead whom we love while live honor general lee how utterly vain what a mockery of language do these word seem honor lee why my countryman he deed have honor he the very trump of fame itself be proud to honor he europe and the civilized world have unite to honor he supremely and history itself have catch the echo and make it immortal honor lee why sir as the sad news of he death be with the speed of think communicate to the world it will carry a pang even to the heart of marshal and of monarch and i can easily fancy that amid the din and clash and carnage of war the cannon itself in mute pause at the whisper news will briefly cease its roar around the wall of paris the task be not without pain while yet he manly frame lie stretch upon he bier to attempt to analyze the element that make he truly great it have be my fortune in life from circumstance to have come in contact with some whom the world pronounce great -- some of the earth 's celebrated and distinguished but i declare it here to-day that of any mortal man whom it have ever be my privilege to approach he be the greatest and i assert here that grand as might be you conception of the man before he arise in incomparable majesty on more familiar acquaintance this can be affirm of few man who have ever live or die and of no other man whom it have ever be my fortune to approach like niagara the more you gaze the more he grandeur grow upon you the more he majesty expand and fill you spirit with a full satisfaction that leave a perfect delight without the slightest feeling of oppression grandly majestic and dignified in all he deportment he be genial as the sunlight of this beautiful day and not a ray of that cordial social intercourse but bring warmth to the heart as it do light to the understanding but as one of the great captain will general lee first pass review and inspection before the criticism of history we will not compare he with washington the mind will halt instinctively at the comparison of two such man so equally and gloriously great but with modest yet calm and unflinching confidence we place he by the side of the marlborough and wellington who take high niche in the pantheon of immortality let we dwell for a moment my friend on this thought marlborough never meet defeat it be true victory marked every step of he triumphant march but when where and whom do marlborough fight the ambitious and vain but able loui xiv but he have already exhaust the resource of he kingdom before marlborough step upon the stage the great marshal turenne and condé be no more and luxembourg the beloved have vanish from the scene marlborough preëminently great as he certainly be nevertheless lead the combined force of england and of holland in the freshness of they strength and the fulness of they financial ability against prostrate france with a treasury deplete a people wear out discourage and deject but let we turn to another comparison the great von moltke who now ride upon the whirlwind and command the storm of prussian invasion have recently declare that general lee in all respects be fully the equal of wellington and you may the better appreciate this admission when you remember that wellington be the benefactor of prussium and probably von moltke 's special idol but let we examine the argument ourselves france be already prostrate when wellington meet napoleon that great emperor have seem to make war upon the very element themselves to have contend with nature and to have almost defeat providence itself the enemy of the north more savage than goth or vandal mount the swift gale of a russian winter have carry death desolation and ruin to the very gate of pari wellington fight at waterloo a bleeding and broken nation -- a nation electrify it be true to almost superhuman energy by the genius of napoleon but a nation prostrate and bleed nevertheless compare this my friend the condition of france and the condition of the united state in the freshness of she strength in the luxuriance of she resource in the lustihood of she gigantic youth tell I whether to place the chaplet of military superiority with he or with marlborough or wellington even the greatest of captain in he italian campaign flash fame in lightning splendor over the world even bonaparte meet and crush in battle but three or four -lrb- i think -rrb- austrian army while we lee with one army badly equip in time incredibly short meet and hurl back in broken and shattered fragment five of the greatest prepared and most magnificently appoint invasion yea more he discrown in rapid succession one after another of the united state ' most accomplished and admirable commander lee be never really defeat lee could not be defeat overpower foiled in he effort he might be but never defeat until the prop which support he give way never until the platform sink beneath he do any enemy ever dare pursue on that melancholy occasion the downfall of the confederacy no leipsic no waterloo no sedan can ever be record general lee be know to the world as a military man but it be easy to divine from he history how mindful of all just authority how observant of all constitutional restriction would have be he career as a civilian when near the conclusion of the war darkness be thicken about the fall fortune of the confederacy when its very life be in the sword of lee it be my proud privilege to know with a special admiration the modest demeanor the manly decorum respectful homage which mark all he dealings with the constitute authority of he country clothe with all power he hide its very symbol behind a genial modesty and refuse ever to exert it save in obedience to law and even in he triumphant entry into the territory of the enemy so regardful be he of civilized warfare that the observance of he general order as to private property and private rights leave the line of he march marked and mar by no devastate field char ruin or desolate home but it be in he private character or rather i should say he personal emotion and virtue which he countryman will most delight to consider and dwell upon he magnanimity transcend all historic precedent seem to form a new chapter in the book of humanity witness that letter to jackson after he wound at chancellorsville in which he say : ' i be pray for you with more fervor than i have ever pray for myself ' and that other more disinterested and pathetic : ' i could for the good of my country wish that the wound which you have receive have be inflict upon my own body ' or that of the latter message say to general jackson that ` he wound be not so severe as mine for he lose but he left arm while i in my loss lose my right ' or that other expression of unequalled magnanimity which enable he to ascribe the glory of they joint victory to the sole credit of the die hero do i say unequalled yes that be a avowal of unequalled magnanimity until it meet its parallel in he own grander self-negation in assume the sole responsibility for the defeat at gettysburg ay my countryman alexander have he arbela caesar he pharsalium napoleon he austerlitz but it be reserve for lee to grow grander and more illustrious in defeat than even in victory -- grander because in defeat he show a spirit greater than in the heroism of battle or all the achievement of war a spirit which crown he with a chaplet grander far than ever mighty conqueror wear i turn I now to that last closing scene at appomattox and i will draw thence a picture of that man as he lay aside the sword the unrivalled soldier to become the most exemplary of citizen i can never forget the deferential homage pay this great citizen by even the federal soldier as with uncovered head they contemplate in mute admiration this now captive hero as he ride through they rank impressed forever daguerreotype on my heart be that last parting scene with that handful of hero still crowd around he few indeed be the word then speak but the quiver lip and the tearful eye tell of the love they bear he in symphony more eloquent than any language can describe can i ever forget no never can i forget the word which fall from he lip as i ride beside he amid the defeat dejected and weep soldiery when turn to I he say ' i could wish that i be number among the fall in the last battle ' but oh as he think of the loss of the cause -- of the many dead scatter over so many field who sleep neglect with no governmental arm to gather up they remains -- sleep neglect isolate and alone beneath the weep star with naught but they soldier ' blanket about they -- oh as these emotion sweep over he great soul he feel that he would have lay he down to rest in the same grave where lay bury the common hope of he people but providence will it otherwise he rest now forever my countryman he spirit in the bosom of that father whom he so faithfully serve he body beside the river whose bank be forever memorable and whose water be vocal with the glory of he triumph no sound shall ever wake he to martial glory again no more shall he lead he invincible line to victory no more shall we gaze upon he and draw from he quiet demeanor lesson of life but oh it be a sweet consolation to we my countryman who love he that no more shall he bright spirit be bow down to earth with the burden of the people 's wrong it be sweet consolation to we that he last victory through faith in he crucified redeemer be the most transcendently glorious of all he triumph at this very hour while we mourn here kind friend be consign the last that remain of we hero to he quiet sleeping-place surround by the mountain of he native state -- mountain the autumnal glory of whose magnificent forest to-day seem but habiliment of mourning in the valley the pearly dew-drops seem but tear of sadness upon the grass and flower let he rest and now as he have go from we and as we regard he in all the aspect of he career and character and attainment as a great captain ranking among the first of any age as a patriot whose sacrifice devotion to he country rank he with washington as a christian like havelock recognize he duty to he god above every other earthly consideration with a native modesty that refuse to appropriate the glory of he own and which surround now he entire character and career with a halo of unfading light with a integrity of life and a sacred regard for truth which no man dare assail with a fidelity to principle which no misfortune could shake -- he must ever stand peerless among man in the estimation of christendom this representative son of the south robert e lee of virginium richmond va a meeting be hold on November 3d preside over by mr jefferson davi mr davi deliver a address of which we regret that we have receive no complete copy we give it as report in the richmond _ dispatch _ remark of president davi as mr davi arise to walk to the stand every person in the house stand and there follow such a storm of applause as seem to shake the very foundation of the building while cheer upon cheer be echo from the throat of veteran salute one whom they delight to honor mr davi speak at length and with he accustomed thrilling move eloquence we shall not attempt at the late hour at which we write to give a full report of he address he address he hearer as soldier and sailor of the confederacy comrade and friend : assemble on this sad occasion with heart oppress with the grief that follow the loss of he who be we leader on many a bloody battle-field a please though melancholy spectacle be present hitherto and in all time man have be honor when successful but here be the case of one who amid disaster go down to he grave and those who be he companion in misfortune have assemble to honor he memory it be as much a honor to you who give as to he who receive for above the vulgar test of merit you show yourselve competent to discriminate between he who enjoy and he who deserve success robert e lee be my associate and friend in the military academy and we be friend until the hour of he death we be associate and friend when he be a soldier and i a congressman and associate and friend when he lead the army of the confederacy and i preside in its cabinet we pass through many sad scene together but i can not remember that there be ever aught but perfect harmony between we if ever there be difference of opinion it be dissipate by discussion and harmony be the result i repeat _ we never disagree _ and i may add that i never in my life see in he the slightest tendency to self-seeking it be not he to make a record it be not he to shift blame to other shoulder but it be he with a eye fix upon the welfare of he country never falter to follow the line of duty to the end he be the heart that brave every difficulty he be the mind that work victory out of defeat he have be charge with ` want of dash ' i wish to say that i never know lee to falter to attempt any thing ever man could dare a attempt have also be make to throw a cloud upon he character because he leave the army of the united state to join in the struggle for the liberty of he state without trench at all upon politics i deem it my duty to say one word in reference to this charge virginian bear descend from a family illustrious in virginium 's annals give by virginium to the service of the united state he represent she in the military academy at west point he be not educate by the federal government but by virginium for she pay she full share for the support of that institution and be entitle to demand in return the service of she son enter the army of the united state he represent virginium there also and nobly on many a hard-fought field lee be conspicuous battle for he native state as much as for the union he come from mexico crown with honor cover by brevet and recognize young as he be as one of the ablest of he country 's soldier and to prove that he be estimate then as such let I tell you that when lee be a captain of engineer station in baltimore the cuban junta in new york select he to be they leader in the struggle for the independence of they native country they be anxious to secure he service and offer he every temptation that ambition could desire he think the matter over and i remember come to washington to consult I as to what he should do and when i begin to discuss the complication which might arise from he acceptance of the trust he gently rebuke I say that this be not the line upon which he wish my advice : the simple question be ` whether it be right or not ' he have be educate by the united state and feel wrong to accept a place in the army of a foreign power such be he extreme delicacy such be the nice sense of honor of the gallant gentleman whose death we deplore but when virginia withdraw the state to whom he owe he first and last allegiance the same nice sense of honor lead he to draw he sword and throw it in the scale for good or for evil pardon I for this brief defense of my illustrious friend when virginium join the confederacy robert lee the highest officer in the little army of virginium come to richmond and not pause to inquire what would be he rank in the service of the confederacy go to western virginium under the belief that he be still a officer of the state he come back carry the heavy weight of defeat and unappreciated by the people whom he serve for they could not know as i know that if he plan and order have be carry out the result would have be victory rather than retreat you do not know for i would not have know it have he not breathe it in my ear only at my earnest request and beg that nothing be say about it the clamor which then arise follow he when he go to south carolina so that it become necessary on he go to south carolina to write a letter to the governor of that state tell he what manner of man he be yet through all this with a magnanimity rarely equal he stand in silence without defend himself or allow other to defend he for he be unwilling to offend any one who be wear a sword and striking blow for the confederacy mr davi then speak of the strait to which the confederacy be reduce and of the danger to which she capital be expose just after the battle of seven pine and tell how general lee have conceive and execute the desperate plan to turn they flank and rear which after seven day of bloody battle be crown with the protection of richmond while the enemy be drive far from the city the speaker refer also to the circumstance attend general lee 's cross the potomac on the march into pennsylvanium he -lrb- mr davi -rrb- assume the responsibility of that movement the enemy have long be concentrate he force and it be evident that if he continue he steady progress the confederacy would be overwhelm we only hope be to drive he to the defense of he own capital we be enable in the mean time to reënforce we shattered army how well general lee carry out that dangerous experiment need not be tell richmond be relieve the confederacy be relieved and time be obtain if other thing have favor to reënforce the army but say mr davi i shall not attempt to review the military career of we fall chieftain of the man how shall i speak he be my friend and in that word be include all that i could say of any man he moral quality rise to the height of he genius self-denying always intent upon the one idea of duty self-controlled to a extent that many think he cold he feeling be really warm and he heart melt freely at the sight of a wounded soldier or the story of the suffering of the widow and orphan during the war he be ever conscious of the inequality of the means at he control but it be never he to complain or to utter a doubt it be always he to do when in the last campaign he be beleaguer at petersburg and painfully aware of the strait to which we be reduce he say : ` with my army in the mountain of virginium i could carry on this war for twenty year longer ' he man exhaust and he supplies fail he be unable to carry out he plan a untoward event cause he to anticipate the movement and the army of northern virginium be overwhelmed but in the surrender he anticipate condition that have not be fulfil he expect he army to be respect and he paroled soldier to be allow the enjoyment of life and property whether these condition have be fulfil let other say here he now sleep in the land he love so well and that land be not virginia only for they do injustice to lee who believe he fight only for virginium he be ready to go anywhere on any service for the good of he country and he heart be as broad as the fifteen state struggle for the principle that we forefather fight for in the revolution of 1776 he be sleep in the same soil with the thousand who fight under the same flag but first offer up they life here the living be assemble to honor he memory and there the skeleton sentinel keep watch over he grave this citizen this soldier this great general this true patriot leave behind he the crowning glory of a true christian he christianity ennoble he in life and afford we grounds for the belief that he be happy beyond the grave but while we mourn the loss of the great and the true drop we also tear of sympathy with she who be he helpmeet -- the noble woman who while she husband be in the field lead the army of the confederacy though a invalid herself pass the time in knit sock for the march soldier a woman fit to be the mother of hero and hero be descend from she

word of sorrow with those of the good and great throughout christendom for he fame be go over the water he deed will be remembered and when the monument we build shall have crumble into dust he virtue

the resolution of the committee i can not refrain from express the feeling inspire by the memory that crowd upon my mind when i reflect that these resolution be intend to express what general lee 's survive soldier feel toward general lee the committee be fully aware of they inability to do justice to the sentiment that inspire the heart of those for whom they speak how can we portray in word the gratitude the pride the veneration the anguish that now fill the heart of those who share he victory and he reverse he triumph and he defeat how can we tell the world what we can only feel ourselves how can we give expression to the crowd memory call forth by the sad event we be meet to deplore we recall he as he appear in the hour of victory grand impose awe-inspiring yet self-forgetful and humble we recall the great scene of he triumph when we hail he victor on many a bloody field and when above the paean of victory we listen with reverence to he voice as he ascribe ` all glory to the lord of host from whom all glory be ' we remember that grand magnanimity that never stoop to pluck those meaner thing that grow nearest the earth upon the tree of victory but which with eye turn toward the star and hand raise toward heaven gather the golden fruit of mercy pity and holy charity that ripen on its topmost bough beneath the approve smile of the great god of battle we remember the sublime self-abnegation of chancellorsville when in the midst of he victorious legion who with the light of battle yet on they face hail he conqueror he think only of he great lieutenant lie wound on the field and transfer to he all the honor of that illustrious day i will be pardon i be sure for refer to a incident which afford to my mind a most striking illustration of one of the grandest feature of he character on the morning of may 3 1863 as many of you will remember the final assault be make upon the federal line at chancellorsville general lee accompany the troops in person and as they emerge from the fierce combat they have wage in ` the depths of that tangled wilderness ' drive the superior force of the enemy before they across the open ground he ride into they midst the scene be one that can never be efface from the mind of those who witness it the troops be press forward with all the ardor and enthusiasm of combat the white smoke of musketry fringe the front of the line of battle while the artillery on the hill in the rear of the infantry shake the earth with its thunder and fill the air with the wild shriek of the shell that plunge into the mass of the retreat foe to add greater horror and sublimity to the scene the chancellorsville house and the wood surround it be wrap in flame in the midst of this awful scene general lee mount upon that horse which we all remember so well ride to the front of he advance battalion he presence be the signal for one of those uncontrollable outburst of enthusiasm which none can appreciate who have not witness they the fierce soldier with they face blacken with the smoke of battle the wound crawl with feeble limb from the fury of the devour flame all seem possess with a common impulse one long unbroken cheer in which the feeble cry of those who lay helpless on the earth blended with the strong voice of those who still fight rise high above the roar of battle and hail the presence of the victorious chief he sit in the full realization of all that soldier dream of -- triumph and as i look upon he in the complete fruition of the success which he genius courage and confidence in he army have win i think it must have be from some such scene that man in ancient day ascend to the dignity of the god he first care be for the wound of both army and he be among the foremost at the burning mansion where some of they lay but at that moment when the transport of he victorious troops be drown the roar of battle with acclamation a note be bring to he from general jackson it be bring to general lee as he sit on he horse near the chancellorsville house and unable to open it with he gauntleted hand he pass it to I with direction to read it to he the note make no mention of the wound that general jackson have receive but congratulate general lee upon the great victory i shall never forget the look of pain and anguish that pass over he face as he listen with a voice break with emotion he bid I say to general jackson that the victory be he and that the congratulation be due to he i know not how other may regard this incident but for myself as i give expression to the thought of he exalted mind i forget the genius that win the day in my reverence for the generosity that refuse its glory there be one other incident to which i beg permission to refer that i may perfect the picture on the 3d day of July 1863 the last assault of the confederate troops upon the height of gettysburg fail and again general lee be among he baffled and shattered battalion as they sullenly retire from they brave attempt the history of that battle be yet to be write and the responsibility for the result be yet to be fix but there with the painful consciousness that he plan have be frustrate by other and that defeat and humiliation have overtake he army in the presence of he troops he openly assume the entire responsibility of the campaign and of the lost battle one word from he would have relieve he of this responsibility but that word he refuse to utter until it could be speak without fear of do the least injustice thus my fellow-soldier i have present to you we great commander in the supreme moment of triumph and defeat i can not more strongly illustrate he character have it be surpass in history be there another instance of such self-abnegation among man the man rise high above victory in one instance and harder still the man rise superior to disaster in the other it be such incident as these that give general lee the absolute and undoubting confidence and affection of he soldier need i speak of the many exhibition of that confidence you all remember they my comrade have you not see a waver line restore by the magic of he presence have you not see the few forget that they be fight against the many because he be among the few but i pass from the contemplation of he greatness in war to look to he example under the oppressive circumstance of final failure -- to look to that example to which it be most useful for we now to refer for we guidance and instruction when the attempt to establish the southern confederacy have fail and the event of the war seem to have establish the indivisibility of the federal union general lee give he adhesion to the new order of thing he be no hollow truce but with the pure faith and honor that mark every act of he illustrious career he immediately devote himself to the restoration of peace harmony and concord he enter zealously into the subject of education believe as he often declare that popular education be the only sure foundation of free government he give he earnest support to all plan of internal improvement design to bind more firmly together the social and commercial interest of the country and among the last act of he life be the effort to secure the construction of a line of railway communication of incalculable importance as a connect link between the north and the south he devote all he great energy to the advancement of the welfare of he countryman while shrink from public notice and seek to lay deep and strong the foundation of government which it be suppose would rise from the ruin of the old but i need not repeat to you my comrade the history of he life since the war you have watch it to its close and you know how faithfully and truly he perform every duty of he position let we take to heart the lesson of he bright example disregard all that malice may impute to we with a eye single to the faithful performance of we duty as american citizen and with a honest and sincere resolution to support with heart and hand the honor the safety and the true liberty of we country let we invoke we fellow-citizen to forget the animosity of the past by the side of this honor grave and ` join hand

come from soldier and statesman i need not speak of the comparative merit of general lee and the union general who oppose he this be not the place or time for a discussion of they respective success

for he be not only on account of he skill on the battle-field and the skilful manner with which he plan and execute he campaign but the humane manner in which he perform he sad duty they allude

the account he would have to render in heaven would be one of judgment seasoned with mercy he have a right to believe that when god pass judgment upon the account of he life though he would find he a err human be he would find virtue enough and religious faith enough to save he from any other verdict than that of ` well do good and faithful servant ' the monument will be raise and when it be raise many a man will visit richmond to stand beside it to do reverence to the remain it may cover and to say ` here lie the remains of one of the noblest man who ever live or die in america ' hon george william brown _ mr chairman and gentleman _ : the able and eloquent gentleman who have precede I have leave but little for I to say i rise however to express my hearty assent to the resolution they broad and liberal view be worthy of the great and good man whose virtue and fame we seek to commemorate he have pass away from earth and we blame or censure be nothing to he now the most eloquent eulogy that human lip can utter and the loftiest monument that human hand can build can not affect he now but it be a satisfaction to we to know that expression of the love for he which live in every southern heart -- ay in many a northern heart -- be hear long before he death and that honor shed noble lustre around the last year of he life he be the representative of a lose cause he have sheathe he sword forever he have surrender he army to superior number he be break in fortune and in health and be only president of a virginium college yet he be one of the foremost man of all the world it have be say of general lee as it have be say of washington that he be deficient in genius he character be so complete that what would have seem evidence of genius with other man be lose in the combination of he character and mind he be always and especially in every great crisis a leader among man during the four year of he education at west point he do not receive a single reprimand as a cavalry-officer wherever he go he be a marked man and when general scott make he wonderful march to the capital of mexico captain lee be he right arm at the commencement of the late war though only a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry he be offer the command of the army of the united state what a prize for ambition fortune fame and honor await he where would he have be to-day probably in the presidential chair of this great nation but he reject all to take he chance with he own people and to unite with they in they resistance to the vast number and resource which he know the north be able to bring against they there be nothing more remarkable in the annals of warfare than the success with which general lee defeat for year the army of the united state consider the six-day ' battle around richmond the second battle of manassa the battle at antietam fredericksburg and gettysburg the wonderful contest at chancellorsville then again the remarkable battle of the wilderness in which it have be say by federal authority that general lee actually kill as many man as he have under he command the defense at cold harbor the prolonged defense of richmond and petersburg and the admirably-conducted retreat with but a handful before a immense army well have he be speak of as ` the incomparable strategist ' do any man ever fight against more desperate odds or resource but not merely as a great general be general lee to be admire he claim we admiration as a great man -- great in adversity i think there be nothing more admirable in all he life than he conduct in assume the sole responsibility at gettysburg in the midst of defeat lee be calm unmoved show no fear where despair would have be in the heart of any other general and say to he officer and man ` the fault be all mine ' let the monument be raise not merely by soldier of general lee but by all man no matter of what political feeling who appreciate and honor that which be manly great and patriotic the monument at richmond will be the resort of pilgrim from the north as well as from the south and the grave of lee will be second only in the heart of the people to the grave of washington lexington ky at the meeting at lexington resolution be adopt similar to those already give the meeting be address by general preston and other general w preston i be permit to accompany the report with a few remark although i deem it unnecessary to use one word of commendation on the character of such a man these resolution be no doubt very short but they will testify the feeling of every right-minded noble-hearted man no matter what may have be he opinion as to the past every true and generous soul feel that these resolution be expressive of the sorrow entertain by the whole country we speak not only the common voice of america but of the world at this hour it be no ordinary case of eulogy over a ordinary be but over one who be the man of the century a man who by mighty army command with admirable skill by great victory achieve and yet never stain by exultation by mighty misfortune meet with a calm eye and submit to with all the dignity that belong to elevated intelligence and by he simplicity and grandeur challenge the admiration of civilized mankind and still more remarkable after yield to the greatest vicissitude that the world ever see resigned himself to the improvement of the youth of the country to the last moment of he mortal life look to the glorious life which he contemplate beyond the tomb i must confess that notwithstanding the splendor and glory of he career i envy he the dignity of the pacific close of he life nothing more gentle nothing more great nothing more uncomplaining have ever be record in the history of the world by return to napoleon we find he murmur we find all the mark of mortality and mortal anger but in lee we find a man perfect in christian principle -- dignified yet simple i know he first when he be a captain i be then a young man connect with one of the regiment of this state in mexico the fourth kentucky and when i first see he he be a man of extreme physical beauty remarkable for he great gentleness of manner and for he freedom from all military and social vice at that time general scott by common consent have fix upon general lee as the man who would make he mark if ever the country need he service he never swear a oath he never drink he never wrangle but there be not a single dispute between gentleman that he voice be not more potent than any other he rare calmness serenity and dignity be above all when the war come on he follow he native state virginium for he be the true representative of the great virginium family at washington he be the real type of he race he be possess of all the most perfect point of washington 's character with all the noble trait of he own scott maintain that lee be the greatest soldier in the army he discerning eye compare man and i remember when in some respects i think general lee 's military education have not fit he for the great talent which he be destine to display i remember when general scott make use of these remarkable word : ' i tell you one thing if i be on my death-bed and know there be a battle to be fight for the liberty of my country and the president be to say to I scott who shall command i tell you that with my die breath i should say robert lee nobody but robert lee robert lee and nobody but lee ' that impress I very much because at the beginning of the campaign lee be not prosperous and why because he be build up he man with that science which he possess he great quality be discern not after he remarkable campaign but long before it he name be regard with that respect preëminence to which it do rise under that campaign and i now say and even opposite officer will admit that no man have display greater power more military ability or more noble trait of character than robert e lee therefore it be that america have lose much europe will testify this as well as ourselves in this local community europe will weigh this but after-age will weigh he with moltke and bazaine with the duke of magenta and with all military man and in my judgment those age will say that the greatest fame and ability belong to robert lee but let we look to he moral character to which i have already allude through he whole life he have be a fervent and simple christian throughout he campaign he be a brave and splendid soldier if you ask of he friend you will find that they adore he if you ask he character from he enemy you will find that they respect he and respect be the involuntary tribute which friend and enemy alike have to pay to elevated worth and to-day as the bell toll they sound will vibrate with the tenderest feeling through every noble heart public confession of he worth and he greatness will be make through thousand of the town and city throughout this broad land and even where they be silent monitor within will tell that a great spirit have flee this secret monitor will tell that a great and good man have pass away who have leave in my opinion no equal behind he rev dr henderson since the announcement of the death of robert e lee i have be momentarily expect the appearance of a call to pay some tribute to he splendid memory but if a notice have be give of this meeting it altogether escape my attention else i would have be here freely and voluntarily if i be a stranger in lexington and my lot have be cast here only during the last three week yet i be happy that my fellow-citizen here have pay I such great respect as to call on I on such a occasion as the present to testify to the greatness and glory of general robert e lee some public calamity be require to bring we into one great brotherhood ` one touch of nature make the whole world kin ' though you be all stranger to I yet in that common sympathy which we all feel we be mourner together at the bier of depart worth it do not become one of my profession to take any partisan view of the life of such a man although it be my fortune to follow the same flag which he carry to victory upon so many field when it be furl it be do with such calm magnificence as to win the admiration of he enemy and of the world yet i do not stand here to make any reference to that cause which have pass from the theater of earth 's activity and take its place only in history but i do claim the right from the stand-point which i occupy of point to a man worthy of the emulation of all who love the true nobility of humanity a man who be magnanimous to he enemy who would weep at the calamity of he foe who throughout the sanguinary struggle could preserve in himself the fullest share of human sympathy history will challenge the world to produce a single instance in which this great man ever wantonly inflict a blow or ever wilfully impose punishment upon any of he captive or ever push he victory upon a enemy to gain unnecessary result -- a man who in all he campaign show the same bright example to all the battalion that follow the lead of he sword and now since that flag which he carry have be furl what a magnificent example have be present to the world it be say of washington that he be first in war and first in peace but in the latter regard robert e lee show more greatness than even the father of he country he be strike down the sun that have brighten up the horizon of hope sink in dark eclipse to set in the shadow of disappointment calm and magnificent in the repose of conscious strength he feel that he have live and struggle for a principle that be dear to he though dead it only remain for he to be we example to the stricken and suffer people for whom he labor and to show how magnanimously a brave and true christian could act even when all he hold sacred and dear be shatter by the hand of calamity and at the close of he career he devote he splendid capacity to the culture of the mind of he country 's youth he come down from the summit on which he have win the world 's admiration to the steady regular duty of the school-room to take he place in the vestry of a christian church and to administer the affair of a country parish in the interest of christianity a man who by he dignity and simplicity preserve the constant admiration of he enemy without even give offence to he friend such a man should receive a niche in the pantheon of fame he stand in that great struggle of which as a star he be the leader of unclouded brightness draw over its mournful history a splendor which be reflect from every sentence of its chronicle he be a example of a man who though brand because of defeat still by he exalted character give a dignity and nobility to a cause which doubtless be forever dead yet still be render immortal by the achievement of robert e lee 's sword and character new york service be hold last evening say a new-york journal in the large hall of the cooper institute in commemoration of the life

distinguish man who join with we this evening testify that the afflict voice of he bereaved people have charm down with sweet persuasion the angry passion kindle by the conflict in which he be they choose leader this be not the occasion either for a elaborate review of he life or a eulogy of he character i propose to attempt neither bear of one of the oldest and most distinguished family of we country -- one so renowned in the field and in the cabinet that it seem almost impossible to give brighter lustre to it -- general robert e lee render that family name even more illustrious and by he genius and virtue extend its fame to region of the globe where it have never before be mention there be no cause for envy or hatred left now he soldier adore he most not in the glare of he brilliant victory but in the hour of he deepest humiliation when he last great battle have be fight and lose -- when the government for which he have struggle be crumble about he -- when he staff ask in despair ` what can now be do ' he give that memorable reply ` it be strange indeed if human virtue be not at least as strong as human calamity ' this be the key to he life -- the belief that trial and strength suffering and consolation come alike from god obedience to duty be ever he ruling principle infallibility be not claim for he in the exercise of he judgment in decide what duty be but what he believe duty to command that he perform without thought of how he would appear in the performance in the judgment of many he may have mistake he duty when he decide that it do not require he to draw he sword ` against he home he kindred and he child ' but lee be no casuist or politician he be a soldier ` all that he would do highly that would he do holily ' he teach the world that the christian and the gentleman could be unite in the warrior it be not when in pomp and power -- when he command successful legion and lead army to victory -- but when in sorrow and privation he assume the instruction and guidance of the youth of virginium lay the only true foundation upon which a republic can rest the christian education of its youth -- that he reap the rich harvest of a people 's love goodness be the chief attribute of lee 's greatness unite in himself the rigid piety of the puritan with the genial generous impulse of the cavalier he win the love of all with whom he come in contact from the thoughtless child with whom it be ever he delight to sport to the great captain of the age with whom he fight all the hard-won battle of mexico some may believe that the world have give birth to warrior more renowned to ruler more skilled in statecraft but all must concede that a purer nobler man never live what successful warrior or ruler in ancient or modern time have descend to he grave amid such universal grief and lamentation as we lee caesar fall by the hand of he own beloved brutus because by he tyranny he would have enslave rome frederick the great the founder of a empire become so hate of man and learn so to despise they that he order he ` poor carcass ' as he call it to be bury with he favorite dog at potsdam napoleon reach he giddy height by path which lee would have scorn to tread only to be hurl from he eminence by all the power of europe which he insatiate ambition have combine against he wellington the conqueror of napoleon become the leader of a political party and live to need the protection of police from a mob even we own washington whose character be as high above that of the mere warrior and conqueror as be the blue vault of heaven above we to the low earth we tread beneath we foot be libel in life and slander in death such be the fate of the most successful captain and warrior of the world for four long year lee occupy a position not less prominent than that of the most distinguish among they the eye of the civilized world watch he every movement and scan he every motive he cause be lose he be unsuccessful yet he live to illustrate to the world how despite failure and defeat a soldier could command honor and love from those for whom he struggle and admiration and respect from he foe such as no success have ever before win for warrior prince or potentate and when he life be end the whole population of the south form one mighty funeral procession follow he to he grave he obsequy modestly perform by those most tenderly ally to he he sleep in the bosom of the land he love so well he spotless fame will gather new vigor and freshness from the lapse of time and the day be not distant when that fame will be claim not as the property of a section but as the heritage of a united people he soul now forever free from earth 's defilement bask in the sunlight of god ' _ pro tumulo ponas patriam pro tegmine caelum sidera pro facibus pro

forth by this national calamity and these no doubt have suffer injustice by imperfect reporting but we have show as we wish to show the standard by which we people estimate a heroic character and how the south love and honor the memory of she great leader a few extract from the english press will show the feeling in that country : the pall mall gazette even amid the turmoil of the great european struggle the intelligence from america announce that general robert e lee be dead will be receive with deep sorrow by many in this country as well as by he follower and fellow-soldier in america it be but a few year since robert e lee rank among the great man of the present time he be the able soldier of the southern confederacy the bulwark of she northern frontier the obstacle to the advance of the federal army and the leader who twice threaten by the capture of washington to turn the tide of success and to accomplish a revolution which would have change the destiny of the united state six year pass by and then we hear that he be die at a obscure town in virginium where since the collapse of the confederacy he have be act as a school-master when at the head of the last eight thousand of he valiant army the remnant which battle sickness and famine have leave he he deliver up he sword to general grant at appomattox court-house he public career end he pass away from man 's thought and few in europe care to inquire the fate of the general whose exploit have arouse the wonder of neutral and belligerent and whose noble character have excite the admiration of even the most bitter of he political enemy if however success be not always to be account as the sole foundation of renown general lee 's life and career deserve to be hold in reverence by all who admire the talent of a general and the noblest quality of a soldier he family be well know in virginium descend from the cavalier who first colonize that state they have produce more than one man who fight with distinction for they country they be ally by marriage to washington and previous to the recent war be possess of much wealth general -lrb- then colonel -rrb- robert lee reside when not employ with he regiment at arlington height one of the most beautiful place in the neighborhood of washington when the civil war first break out he be a colonel in the united state army who have serve with distinction in mexico and be account among the best of the american officer to he as to other the difficult choice present itself whether to take the side of he state which have join in the secession of the south or to support the central government it be say that lee debate the matter with general scott then commander-in-chief that both agree that they first duty lay with they state but that the former only put the theory into practice it be not until the second year of the war that lee come prominently forward when at the indecisive battle of fair oak in front of richmond general johnston have be wound he take command of the army and subsequently drive mcclellan with great loss to the bank of the jame river from that time he become the recognize leader of the confederate army of virginium he repulse wave after wave of invasion army after army be hurl against he only to be throw back beat and in disorder the government at washington be keep in constant alarm by the near vicinity of he troops and witness more than once the entry into they intrenchment of a defeat and disorganize rabble which a few day previous have leave they a confident host twice he enter the northern state at the head of a successful army and twice indecisive battle alone preserve from destruction the federal government and turn the fortune of the war he impress he character on those who act under he ambition for he have no charm duty alone be he guide he simplicity of life check luxury and display among he officer while he disregard of hardship silence the murmur of he harass soldiery by the troops he be love as a father as well as admire as a general and he deeply-religious character impressed itself on all who be bring in contact with he and make itself feel through the rank of the virginian army it be say that during four year of war he never sleep in a house but in winter and summer share the hardship of he soldier such be the man who in mature age at a period of life when few general have acquire renown fight against overwhelming odds for the cause which he believe just he see many of he bravest general and dearest friend fall around he but although constantly expose to fire escape without a wound the battle which prolong and finally decide the issue of the contest be now little more than name antietam fredericksburg chancellorsville and gettysburg be forget in europe by all except those who study recent war as lesson for the future and would collect from the deed of other army experience which they may apply to they own to they the boldness of lee 's tactic at chancellorsville will ever be a subject of admiration while even those who least sympathize with he cause will feel for the general who see the repulse of longstreet 's charge at gettysburg and behold the failure of a attempt to convert a defensive war into one of attack together with the consequent abandonment of the bold stroke which he have hope would terminate the contest quietly he rally the broken troops take all the blame on himself he encourage the officer dispirit by the reverse and in person form up the scatter detachment again when fortune have turn against the confederacy when overwhelming force from all side press back she defender lee for a year hold he ground with a constantly-diminishing army fight battle after battle in the forest and swamp around richmond no reverse seem to dispirit he no misfortune appear to ruffle he calm brave temperament only at last when he see the remnant of he noble army about to be ride down by sheridan 's cavalry when eight thousand man half-starved and break with fatigue be surround by the net which grant and sherman have spread around they do he yield he fortitude for the moment give way he take farewell of he soldier and give himself up as a prisoner retire a ruin man into private life gain he bread by the hard and uncongenial work of govern lexington college when political animosity have calm down and when american can look back on those year of war with feeling unbiassed by party strife then will general lee 's character be appreciate by all he countryman as it now be by a part and he name will be honor as that of one of the noblest soldier who have ever draw a sword in a cause which they believe just and at the sacrifice of all personal consideration have fight manfully a lose battle the Saturday review this journal after some remark on the death of admiral farragut continue : a still more famous leader in the war have lately close a blameless life there may be a difference of opinion on the military quality of the general who fight on either side in the civil war but it be no disparagement to the capacity of grant or of sherman to say that they have no opportunity of rival the achievement of general lee assume the chief command in the confederate army in the second campaign of the war he repel three or four invasion of virginium win as many pitched battle over a enemy of enormously superior resource after drive mcclellan from the peninsula he inflict on burnside and pope defeat which would have be ruinous if the belligerent have be on equal term but twenty million of man with the absolute command of the sea and the river eventually overpower a third of they number the draw battle of gettysburg prove that the invasion of the northern state be a blunder and in 1863 it become evident that the fall of the confederacy could not be much longer delay nevertheless general lee keep grant 's swarm legion at bay for the whole summer and autumn and the loss of the northern army in the final campaign exceed the entire strength of the gallant defender of richmond when general lee outnumber cut off from he communication and almost surround by he enemy surrender at appomattox court-house he might console himself with the thought that he have only fail where success be impossible from that moment he use he unequalled and merited authority to reconcile the southern people to the new order of affair he have originally dissent from the policy of secession and he follow the banner of he state exclusively from a sense of duty in disregard of he professional and private interest he might at pleasure have be commander-in-chief of the northern army for he be second in rank to general scott he ancient home and he ample estate on the potomac be ravage by the enemy but he never express a regret for the sacrifice of he fortune there can be no doubt that he be often thwart by political superior and by incompetent subordinate but he equable temper and lofty nature never incline he to complaint the regret for he loss which be feel throughout the vast region of the south be a just tribute to one of the greatest and purest character in american history it will not be inappropriate to reproduce here the tribute which appear in the london _ standard _ on the receipt of the news of general lee 's illness : the standard the announcement that general re lee have be strike down by paralysis and be not expect to recover will be receive even at this crisis with universal interest and will everywhere excite a sympathy and regret which testify to the deep impression make on the world at large by he character and achievement few be the general who have earn since history begin a greater military reputation still fewer be the man of similar eminence civil or military whose personal quality would bear comparison with he the bitterest enemy of he country hardly dare to whisper a word against the character of she most distinguished general while neutral regard he with a admiration for he deed and a respect for he lofty and unselfish nature which almost grow into veneration and he own countryman learn to look up to he with as much confidence and esteem as they ever feel for washington and with a affection which the cold demeanor and austere temper of washington could never inspire the death of such a man even at a moment so exciting as the present when all thought be absorb by a nearer and present conflict would be feel as a misfortune by all who still retain any recollection of the interest with which they watch the virginian campaign and by thousand who have almost forget the name of fredericksburg and chancellorsville the wilderness and spottsylvanium by the south it would be recognize as a national calamity -- as the loss of a man not only inexpressibly dear to a unfortunate people by he intimate association with they fall hope and they proudest recollection but still able to render service such as no other man could perform and to give counsel whose value be enhance tenfold by the source from which it come we hope even yet that a life so honorable and so useful so pure and noble in itself so valuable to a country that have much need of man like he may be spare and prolong for further enjoyment of domestic peace and comfort for further service to he country we can not bear to think of a career so singularly admirable and so singularly unfortunate should close so soon and so sadly by the ten of thousand who will feel as we do when they read the news that now lie before we may be measure the impression make upon the world by the life and the deed of the great chief of the army of virginium whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the merit of the general against whom he have to contend and especially of the antagonist by whom he be at last overcome no one pretend to understand in the least either the general principle of military science or the particular condition of the american war doubt that general lee give higher proof of military genius and soldiership than any of he opponent he be outnumber from first to last and all he victory be gain against greatly superior force and with troops greatly deficient in every necessary of war except courage and discipline never perhaps be so much achieve against odds so terrible the southern soldier -- ` that incomparable southern infantry ' to which a late northern writer render due tribute of respect -- be no doubt as splendid troops as a general could desire but the different fortune of the east and the west prove that the virginian army owe something of its excellence to its chief always outnumber always oppose to a foe abundantly supply with food transport ammunition clothing all that be want to he own man he be always able to make courage and skill supply the deficiency of strength and of supplies and from the day when he assume the command after the battle of seven pine where general joseph johnston be disabled to the morning of the final surrender at appomattox court-house he be almost invariably victorious in the field at gettysburg only he be defeat in a pitched battle on the offensive at the chickahominy at centreville and at chancellorsville on the defensive at antietam fredericksburg the wilderness and spottsylvanium he be still successful but no success could avail he any thing from the moment that general grant bring to bear upon the virginian army the inexhaustible population of the north and employ sherman to cut they off from the rest of the confederacy set himself to work to wear they out by the simple process of exchange two life for one from that moment the fate of richmond and of the south be seal when general lee commence the campaign of the wilderness he have we believe about fifty thousand man he adversary have thrice that number at hand and a still larger force in reserve when the army of virginium march out of richmond it still number some twenty-six thousand man after a retreat of six day in the face of a overwhelming enemy with a crush artillery -- a retreat impede by constant fighting and harass by countless horde of cavalry -- eight thousand be give up by the capitulation of appomattox court-house brilliant as be general lee 's earlier triumph we believe that he give higher proof of genius in he last campaign and that hardly any of he victory be so honorable to himself and he army as that six-day ' retreat there have however be other general of genius as brilliant of courage and endurance hardly less distinguished how many man have ever display the perfect simplicity of nature the utter absence of vanity or affectation which belong to the truest and purest greatness in triumph or in defeat as general lee have do when commander-in-chief of the southern army he move from point to point as duty require with less parade than a european general of division wear no sword attend by no other staff than the immediate occasion demand and chat with a comrade or a visitor with a simple courtesy which have in it no shade of condescension only on one occasion do he seem to have be accoutr with the slightest regard to military display or personal dignity and that characteristically be the last occasion on which he wear the confederate uniform -- the occasion of he interview with general grant on April 9 1865 after the war he retire without a word into privacy and obscurity ruin by the seizure and destruction of he property which mcclellan protect and which he successor give up to ravage and pillage the late commander-in-chief of the southern army accept the presidency of a virginium college and devoted himself as simply and earnestly to its duty as if he have never fill a higher station or perform more exciting function well aware of the jealous temper of the party dominant in the north and anxious above all thing to avoid exasperate that temper against he conquered countryman he carefully abstain from appear in any public ceremony or take any overt part in political question he influence have be exert quietly but steadily in one direction with a single view to restore harmony and good-will between the two section and to reconcile the oppressed southerner to the union from which he fight so gallantly to free they he have discountenance all regretful longing after the lose vision of southern independence all demonstration in honor of the ` conquer banner ' and have encourage the south to seek the restoration of she material prosperity and the satisfaction of she national feeling in a frank acceptance of the result of the war and a loyal adhesion to the federal bond it be characteristic and worthy of the man that he be among the first to sue for a formal pardon from president johnson not for any advantage which he personally could obtain thence but to set the example of submission to he comrades-in-arm and to reconcile they to a humiliation without which the conqueror refuse they that restitution to civil rights necessary to any effort to retrieve they own or they country 's fortune truer greatness a loftier nature a spirit more unselfish a character purer more chivalrous the world have rarely if ever know of stainless life and deep religious feeling yet free from all taint of cant and fanaticism and as dear and congenial to the cavalier stuart as to the puritan stonewall jackson unambitious but ready to sacrifice all at the call of duty devote to he cause yet never move by he feeling beyond the line prescribe by he judgment never provoke by just resentment to punish wanton cruelty by reprisal which would have give a character of needless savagery to the war -- both north and south owe a deep debt of gratitude to he and the time will come when both will be equally proud of he and well they may for he character and he life afford a complete answer to the reproach commonly cast on money-grubbing mechanical america a country which have give birth to man like he and those who follow he may look the chivalry of europe in the face without shame for the fatherland of sidney and of bayard never produce a nobler soldier gentleman and christian than general robert e lee we may add to these the follow just remark upon the occupation to which general lee devoted himself at the close of he military career from the old dominion surely it should be a cause of thankfulness and encouragement for those who be teacher that they profession have receive this reflection of glory and honor from this choice of he from this life and from this death and it be endure honor for all the college of the south and for all we school -- a honor in which all may share alike without jealousy -- that this pure and bright name be inseparably connect by the will of he that bear it with the cause of education and be blended now with that of washington in the name of one of we own institution of learn we think that so long as the name of lee be honor and love among we we southern teacher may rejoice and grow stronger in they work when they remember that he be one of they number and that he great heart that have so bravely bear the fortune of a great empire bear also amid its latest aspiration the interest the anxiety and the hope of the unpretending but noble profession of teaching to leave this out of the account would be indeed to do sad injustice to general lee 's own memory and that not only because he position in this profession be of he own choice and be steadily maintain with unchanging purpose to the end of he life but also because the acknowledgment of he service here be necessary to the completeness of he fame in no position of he life do he more signally develop the great quality of he character than in this and it may truly be say that some of the greatest can only be fully understand in the light of the serene patience and of the simple and quiet self-consecration of he latest year it be then that far from the tumult of arm and from the great passion of public life with no great ambition to nerve he heart nor any great event to obscure the public criticism of he conduct he display in calm and steady light the grandest feature of he character and by this crucial test add certain confirmation to the highest estimate that could have be form of he character and of he ability it be indeed a ` crucial test ' for such a man and that he sustain it as he do be not among the smallest of he claim to the admiration of he countryman no tribute to he memory can be just that do not take this last great service into the account and no history of he life can be fairly write that shall not place in the strongest light he career and influence as president of washington college and we may appropriately close with the follow thoughtful word from the pen of hon alexander h stephen in the darkest hour of we trial in the very midst of we deepest affliction mourning over the loss of the noble lee heaven send to we as consolation the best sign of the time vouchsafe in many a day it address the heart rent as it be in survey the desolation around we as the rainbow upon the breast of the recede storm-cloud when its power and fury be over that sign be the unmistakable estimation in which the real merit and worth of this illustrious chieftain of the cause of the southern state be hold by all class of person not only in the south but in the north partisan and leader aim at the overthrow of we institution may while temporarily in high place by fraud and usurpation keep up the false cry of _ rebel _ and _ traitor _ but these irrepressible outbursting of popular sentiment regard no restraint on great-occasion which cause _ nature _ to speak show clearly how this cry and charge be regard and look upon by the mass of the people everywhere everywhere lee be honor not only as a _ hero _ but as a _ patriot _ this be but the foreshadowing of the general judgment of the people of the whole united state and of the world not only upon lee but upon all of he associate who fight bleed and die in that glorious cause in which he win he immortality that cause be the sovereign right of local self-government by the people of the several state of this continent _ that _ cause be not dead let it never be abandon but let its friend rally to its standard in the forum of reason and justice with the renew hope and energy from this soul-inspiriting sign that it lie deeply impressed upon the heart of the great majority of the people in all section of this country in these popular manifestation of respect and veneration for the man who win all he glory in maintain this cause present usurper should read they doom and all friend of constitutional liberty should take fresh courage in all political conflict never to lower they standard of
