establish by we lord and he apostle profess by they follower during the first two century of the church and which be now follow by the protestant or reform christian i be conscious that neither my ability nor my education qualify I for this task a mere mechanic and possess but few advantage of education i find it very difficult to express as i could wish the thought and feeling which crowd upon my mind but how great and numerous so ever may be the difficulty which i must encounter in such a undertaking i be impel to it by the tender affection i bear you and by the earnest desire and hope of be useful to you may god be my helper may he not suffer I to be deter by any obstacle and may he grant I the blessing of accomplish that which i consider as a sacred duty it _ be _ my imperative duty to make you acquaint with the real motive which have produce the most important solemn and decisive step in my life it be my duty to give glory to god for the unspeakable mercy which he have deign to show I in call I from darkness into he marvellous light in open to I the treasure of he infinite compassion and in give I the hope of salvation by faith in he son who only have the word of eternal life be alone the way the truth and the life it be my duty to endeavor to render my experience profitable to you to show you the path by which it have please god to lead I to truth and to the fountain

the blessing of god contribute to the triumph of the gospel and to the glory of we great god and savior jesus christ by fill you heart with the love of truth and by lead you in the way of true religion it be in the thirty-third year of my age in the present year -lrb- 1826 -rrb- that i openly embrace and profess the protestant religion after have give it the most serious and attentive examination and be convince that it be indeed the true religion of christ agreeable in every respect to the revelation of he gospel like you my dear child i be bear in the romish church but birth have in fact very little to do with religion the utmost that it can effect be to predispose the mind or to serve as a pretext to timid interested or indifferent person to justify they external adherence to a form of worship in which they heart do not unite as we savior declare to he disciple peter it be not flesh or blood that can make know to we the true god the creator preserver and savior of man faith through which alone we can become child of god and true member of the church of christ be a gift of the holy spirit and by no means transmit to we with we existence by we parent st john teach we this when he say as many as receive he to they give he power to become the son of god even to they that believe on he name : which be bear not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john 1 : 12 13 thus you see that we be neither catholic nor protestant by birth and it be a great error for any one to feel himself bind to either church because he have be bear within its pale religion like every thing else must be study and examine and no one be truly a member of a church further than as he understand and acknowledge its doctrine he adherence on any other ground only prove he credulous ignorant and superstitious the slave of prejudice and habit as for I my child although bear in the romish church i can assure you that i never participate in its belief it would be foreign to the end i have in view to relate here the various circumstance of my childhood and youth which preserve I from be bring into the bosom of the catholic church by the usual rite and ceremony god so order it that i make no vow by which _ i might _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- have afterwards feel myself bind to the church of rome -lrb- footnote 5 : _ i might have _ but i be far from suppose that i _ ought _ to have fall myself indissolubly tie to the roman catholic church by any sacrament that i might have receive or by any engagement that i might have enter into : on the contrary i lay it down as a incontestable principle that every vow and every oath be null and neither can nor ought to bind any one to a church in which he have discover error or doctrine and habit oppose to the word of god and contrary to he own conscience truth alone and the full conviction of truth constitute a tie which can inviolably connect we with any church whatever from the moment that this conviction no longer exist and that error be discover it be a imperative duty to abandon a mode of worship which do not accord with we true sentiment and he who persevere against this conviction become a hypocrite contemptible in the eye of man and condemn before god -rrb- unknown to I that be at a age when i could have no idea of what be do to I i be doubtless receive into the church by the usual ceremony but as this act be perform without any consent or co-operation on my part i have never regard it in the light of a engagement to the catholic church with regard to what be call the first communion -lrb- which be consider as the public ratification and confirmation of the vow of my parent -rrb- this i never receive in the romish church nor do i receive what be call the sacrament of confirmation before i could be unite by the sacred bond of marriage to you virtuous and beloved mother it be necessary that i should confess this i do with extreme reluctance feeling that nothing could be at once more absurd more tyrannical or more degrading than to oblige a man to prostrate himself at the foot of a priest a mortal a sinner a child of corruption like himself and there to make confession to he which offend deity alone could have a right to require : and to receive absolution from he for fault with which he have no concern i could not however marry without confession and therefore i be oblige to submit but no power on earth could have constrain I to go further the sacrament as the roman catholic receive it have from infancy excite in I feeling of disgust my mind have always revolt at the idea that the great god of heaven could allow himself to be _ eat _ by he creature in the form of a little flour under various pretence therefore i contrived to avoid the ceremony and obtain the nuptial benediction without it the lord who never leave himself without the witness of he numerous mercy to we even when we be offend he in so many way be please to bless we marriage you birth my dear child crown we joy and leave we nothing to wish but to see you grow and prosper and to devote ourselves to you happiness alas little do we suspect whilst thus delightfully engage that this joy be to be so soon disturbed and that death would deprive we of she who have give you birth but we great god whose way and whose design though often inscrutable be always full of wisdom see good to separate we you from a tender and excellent mother and I from a beloved companion and inestimable friend she die February 11 1821 after a few day ' illness leave I in a state of affliction which it would be in vain to attempt to describe nevertheless terrible as be the stroke and heart-rending as be the separation i can now acknowledge my child that it be a salutary chastisement send by sovereign love and one of the link of that chain of providence by which the lord see good to deliver I from the miserable state in which i be then live and to lead I to the fountain of grace and true peace in fact the death of you poor mother give rise to a train of circumstance which by draw my attention to subject that i have hitherto totally disregard and by exciting in my mind a degree of energy of which i could not have suppose myself capable end by engage I most unexpectedly in the serious study of religion the particulars i be about to give you respect these thing will convince you that god can overrule the wickedness of man for good and will show you that a romish priest be the means of direct I to _ the way _ -lrb- i mean the perusal and free examination of the word of god -rrb- which lead I eventually to the protestant church you mother 's funeral be conduct with catholic ceremony and accord to my means i spare nothing to honor she remains i likewise consent either from conformity to custom or from a wish to please my relative who be influence by the fear of purgatory or perhaps from participate myself in the false notion that buy prayer can mitigate the suffering of the dead -- from one or all of these cause aggravate by the sorrow which fill my heart and inflamed my imagination i consent to the performance of the nine customary mass for the rest of the soul the priest to whom i first go tell I that he be too busy to undertake the whole but that i might depend upon he for three from he i go to another who engage to say the remain six and do so without delay Sunday after Sunday for a considerable time i go to the first to inquire whether my three mass would be say in the follow week he always find some excuse say that there be other more urgent than myself -- that he be previously engage -- that he have undertake more than be in he power to perform from February to June i be thus put off under various pretext wear out at length by so many fruitless effort i resolve to put a end to they and mention the subject to you aunt you mother 's sister express to she my extreme annoyance she ask I if i have offer the priest the amount of the mass which he have promise to say no i say the idea never occur to I but even if it have i should not have dare to do it for fear of offend he it be not usual i add scornfully to pay before one be serve no one ever pay I for a saddle before i make it no matter reply you aunt my advice to you be to return to the priest and offer to pay for the mass which you have order i do as she advise I and this time my request be favourably receive the priest seize the six-franc piece which i lay on the table look at I and say do you wish I to say six no i reply with a feeling of indignation which i could hardly repress -- no sir i only want three return to I the rest of the money poor folk can not afford to spend so much at once i leave the priest thoroughly ashamed of have contribute to gratify he cupidity and very much disposed to think the religion we be teach be nothing but a tissue of fable and imposture to which the thirst of gold and silver have give birth i can not tell you all the sad and painful reflection that occupy my mind during the remainder of that day i be overcome by they and rejoice to see the night hope to find relief in sleep i go to bed but could not close my eye still haunt by the remembrance of what have so disgusted I a multitude of thought crowd on my imagination i know that the priest claim the word of god as they authority for all they doctrine and ceremony which word i also know be contain in the old and new testament although to my misfortune i do not then regard they as a divine revelation in fact i believe no more in the holy bible _ as the word of god _ than i do in the doctrine of purgatory still i feel a desire to search and to ascertain whether this _ lucrative _ doctrine be contain in the gospel and in what manner it be there establish : at the same moment i recollect that there be on the chimney-piece of my room a new testament in which i have learn to read but which i have never open since i be nine or ten year old i jump out of bed and hastily dress myself resolve to begin without delay my research on the subject of purgatory with this sole object in view i read through the gospel the act of the apostle the epistle and the revelation of st john confine my attention exclusively to those point that tend either to establish or controvert this doctrine this perusal of the new testament which from my eagerness to satisfy my curiosity and resolve my doubt i accomplish without once stop except for refreshment prove to I that the doctrine of purgatory be not to be find in the gospel but must have be derive from some other source indeed my dear child i do not find a single passage which establish it either directly or indirectly : on the contrary i be strike with many declaration completely oppose to it thus i read in st matthew : the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal matt 25:46 this absolutely destroy the idea of any intermediate abode between heaven and hell i read the song of simeon by which it clearly appear that the good old man have no idea that he be to stop in the road to heaven or that he would have to undergo any _ purge fire _ before he could get there for he exclaim hold the infant jesus in he arm lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eye have see thy salvation & c luke 2:29 30 i read the promise which jesus make to the thief on the cross when he say to he lord remember I when thou comest into thy kingdom luke 23:42 43 if there be such a place as purgatory and if any one be likely to be subject to its fire surely it would have be this malefactor condemn by human law and probably guilty of many crime : yet we savior reply verily i say unto thee _ to-day _ thou shalt be with I in paradise i read in the epistle of st paul to the roman that there be now _ no _ condemnation to they which be in christ jesus rom 8:1 a doctrine altogether oppose to that of purgatory which teach that christian be after this life subject to a process of torment before they be free from condemnation i read in the epistle to the hebrew that it be appoint to man once to die but after this the judgment heb 9 : 27 which clearly prove that the destiny both of the bad and good be irrevocably fix from the moment of they death and that there be no purgatory from which mass prayer or rather gold and silver can deliver any one i read also in the first epistle of st john that the blood of jesus christ the son of god cleanseth we from _ all _ sin 1 john 1:7 which exclude all other kind of purification and formally contradict the doctrine of purgatory finally i read in the book of revelation that bless be the dead which die in the lord from henceforth : yea saith the spirit that they may rest from they labor and they work do follow they here be another declaration which confirm what the precede and many other passage establish in so convince a manner not have discover a single text of the new testament which tell in favor of purgatory but on the contrary have observe and meditate on those which i have quote and many other equally oppose to this doctrine i be fully persuade that it never have be think of by the writer of the gospel you may easily believe my dear child that this discovery in no way tend to strengthen the bond which hold I to the romish church nor to confirm I in they faith still however i be dissatisfied and still long to know positively _ from whence _ the priest have derive they vain system this desire fill my mind for some day and at last it strike I that _ the pope _ must have be the inventor of it i then naturally begin to wish to discover _ who _ the pope be and what right he have to impose such a doctrine i have often read and hear both in conversation and from the pulpit that st peter be the chief and head of the apostle that he have be the first pope at rome and that all succeed pope have inherit he rights and prerogative i conceive a wish to know what the new testament say upon this subject and i immediately undertake a second perusal of it in the same state of mind as before that be to say absorb by one sole object and have nothing in view but to find out whether st peter have really be set over all the other apostle and place at rome as head of all the church this examination which be pursue with a degree of attention of which i should now be scarcely capable end in convince I that the supremacy of st peter be no better establish by the new testament than the first doctrine which i have seek for and that undoubtedly the papacy be without scriptural authority i find in st matthew the _ calling of _ simon who be afterwards call peter matt 4:18 1920 but it do not appear to I to differ from that address to andrew he brother and all the other apostle in the tenth chapter of the same gospel i also observe that the first _ mission _ which jesus christ give to he apostle be give to all without any particular prerogative to peter it be true that peter be the first name but this be merely a accidental priority which imply neither distinction nor superiority one must have be mention first i make the same observation on the last mission which they receive on the day of they master 's ascension and which be relate by st matthew 28:19 20 by st mark 16:15 and in the act of the apostle 1:8 this mission though variously express in the three place be the same in substance it be give indiscriminately to all the promise by which it be accompany be for all and on all the same power be equally confer the 18th and 19th verse of chapter 16 of st matthew where it be say thou art peter and on this rock i will build my church startle I for a moment and i be on the point of mistake the true meaning of this declaration but have reflect that jesus christ ask the question in the 15th verse of _ all _ he disciple and that peter express the sentiment of _ all _ in he animated reply in the 16th verse i consider that the word which christ address to peter be applicable to all disciple and that no supremacy could be attribute to he from this passage more than from any of the precede i be confirm in this opinion when i read in the gospel of st john that jesus _ speak to all _ have make they nearly the same promise : whose so ever sin ye remit they be remit unto they and whose so ever sin ye retain they be retain -lrb- john 20:23 -rrb- and also by what st paul say to the ephesian ye be build upon the foundation of the apostle and prophet jesus christ himself be the chief corner-stone in whom all the building fitly frame together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord ephe 2:20 21 i be still more strengthen when i find in the revelation that st john say the wall of the city have _ twelve foundation _ and in they the name of the twelve apostle of the lamb rev 21:14 by these passage and many other which i think it unnecessary to quote i discern that jesus christ be the true _ foundation _ the _ corner stone _ on which the christian church rest : that all the apostle and prophet be indeed mention as its foundation but only because all they doctrine refer to he and i be convince that st peter be in no degree more distinguished or more elevated than he fellow-labourer although i do not then understand at least not so fully as i do now the evangelical meaning of the 18th and 19th verse of chapter 16 of st matthew yet i be persuade that the papacy or sovereignty of st peter could not reasonably be deduce from they finally my conviction that st peter be not above the other apostle be complete by observe what he say himself in he first epistle the elder which be among you i exhort who be _ also a elder _ 1 pet 5:1 by what st paul say to the corinthian i be not a whit behind the very chiefest apostle 2 cor 11:5 by notice that st paul accord to he own account withstand he to the face because he be to be blame gal 2:11 and that he severely and publicly reprehend he because he constrain the gentile to be circumcise by see how the common disciple of the church of jerusalem make no scruple of reprove peter because he go in unto man uncircumcised and do eat with they act 11:3 how they require from he a explanation of he conduct and how the apostle hasten to justify himself by relate to they exactly how the thing have happen finally by observe that when the apostle which be at jerusalem hear that samarium have receive the word of god _ they send _ unto they peter and john act 8:14 there can be no doubt think i as i perused and re-perused all these testimony that peter be in every respect equal to the other apostle that he have no superiority nor jurisdiction over they have he be have he think himself or have other think he the prince of the apostle and sovereign pastor of the church would he have call himself a elder like unto the other elder be it possible that st paul would have declare himself to be ` not a whit behind he ' that he would have ` withstand he to he face ' and blame he publicly be it probable that mere believer common member of the church should have venture to dispute with he to require a explanation of he conduct or that he should have think it necessary to satisfy they by give one -lrb- 6 -rrb- be it likely that he would have be send by the other apostle or have receive they order when it would have be he part have he be they chief to command and to send they -lrb- footnote 6 : the pope he pretended successor have not be so oblige they have be always solicitous to make they authority feel -rrb- i need no more evidence to be thoroughly convince that all which be teach by the romish church of the supremacy of st peter and of the sovereignty of the pope he pretended successor be a fable destitute of the slightest foundation at all event a doctrine no more to be find in the gospel than that of purgatory if i be surprise at this i be no less so when i observe that in the whole new testament there be not one word which give reason to imagine that st peter have ever preach or have even ever be at rome where the roman catholic assert and believe as a article of faith that he be the first pope the act of the apostle maintain the most profound silence on this subject and afford no ground whatever for the supposition all the epistle leave it equally in darkness those of st paul to the galatian to the ephesian to the philippian to the colossian the second to timothy and the epistle to philemon all write from rome at different period and that to the hebrew write from italy make no mention of peter 's be there in the last four the apostle speak of he companion in suffer in labor and in the work of the lord but say not a word of peter as be with he undoubtedly he would have mention he as he mention tychicus onesimus aristarchus dema pruden livius claudium & c have he be at rome but neither he name nor any allusion to he abode in the capital of the world be to be discover in any part of st paul 's epistle in my opinion there be no proof of he ever have be there much less of he have hold the bishopric finally he own two epistle furnish no evidence for such a supposition : the first and in all probability the second also be write from babylon 1 peter 5:13 and address not to the roman but to the stranger -lrb- that be to say the convert jew -rrb- scatter throughout pontus galatium cappadocium asia and bithynium 1 peter 1:1 country where it would appear that he exercise he ministry after have for some year preach to the church at antioch thus my child i discover that these two primary doctrine of the romish church viz purgatory and the supremacy of st peter have not at any rate be inculcate by the writer of the gospel i can not tell you what interest i feel in the new idea i have acquire the new testament which i be still far from regard as a divine revelation appear to I a collection of precious document in whose authority i then begin to feel some degree of confidence though i find this study novel and difficult to a poor uneducated artisan like myself it be at the same time so attractive to I that i be induce to continue my research i have already mention to you my dear child the invincible repugnance which i have always feel to receive the sacrament as administer in the romish church i have say that nothing in the world could have force I to this act by which it be profanely pretend that the _ creature _ eat _ he creator _ i could never even think of it without shudder this doctrine which assert that jesus christ be present in body and in spirit in the consecrated wafer and that every communicant be actually nourish by he flesh and blood be of all the tenet of popery that which contribute the most to alienate I from the christian religion to which i attach it and to drive I to infidelity this therefore now attract all my attention and again i begin to read the new testament entirely occupy as previously by the one object which i have in view i find nothing in the three gospel of st matthew st mark or st luke which give I the least reason to suppose that they author have recognize the real and corporeal presence of jesus christ in the sacrament of the holy supper the word of the institution as relate by the first matt 26:26 27 28 by the second mark 14:22 23 24 and by the third luke 22:19 20 report with slight variation by the three evangelist and which i take great pain to collate and compare convey no other idea than that of a _ commemorative ceremony _ design to preserve and call to remembrance the suffering the passion and the death of christ in my then wretched condition of unbelief the magnitude the sanctity and the power of the sacrament do not strike my mind but except that i imbibe from the consideration of these passage the view which i still hold so far then i have not discover the doctrine of the real presence but i think i _ have _ indeed find it specifically establish when i read these word : i be the living bread which come down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give be my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jew therefore strive among themselves say how can this man give he flesh to eat then jesus say unto they verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink he blood we have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and i will raise he up at the last day for my flesh be meat indeed and my blood be drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in I and i in he john 6:51 -56 these word appear to I to be undoubtedly the foundation of the romish faith on this head i even think that the writer of they have the establishment of this doctrine especially in view at that moment i be tempt to stop and to carry no further my research on a doctrine which i think i have find clearly set forth but the absurdity of which have never appear to I so palpable i then feel a utter disgust towards the gospel nevertheless internally spur on by a invisible power which be then unknown to I but which i now recognize to have be the holy spirit the author of all divine revelation and attract as it be in spite of myself by the spirit of god who graciously purpose to teach I to appreciate and in time to receive the truth of he word i resume my new testament which i have for a moment throw aside and recommence the perusal of the sixth chapter of st john i read it to the end which i have not do before when i reach the sixty-third verse i be strike as by a flash of light which instantaneously discover to I the mistake that i have at first make in the meaning of the six verse transcribe above and impart a new value to the gospel when i read it be the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing -- the word that i speak unto you they be spirit and they be life john 6:63 i have as it be the key of the chapter and no longer discern in it the doctrine of the real presence i perceive that it in no way refer to swallow and digest with we corporeal organ the body and blood of christ : i see that the expression of eating and drinking be use figuratively and that they really signify nothing but know christ come to he and believe in he as it be explain in the thirty-fifth verse of the same chapter where jesus christ say i be the bread of life he that cometh to I shall never hunger and he that believeth on I shall never thirst it be then as clear to I as the day that jesus christ use the term _ eat _ and _ drinking _ only in a spiritual manner and -lrb- as i now understand they -rrb- as refer to that faith which while it be live and active in we heart unite we to he in a inexplicable manner and clothes we in he merit at the same time that it purify and sanctify we view we sentiment and we desire after have thus discover my error i find myself more than ever incline to persevere in my reading and to search and see whether the doctrine of the real presence would not he better establish in the subsequent part of the book the further i advance my dear child the more reason i have to be convince that neither jesus nor he apostle ever intend to convey such a idea i should be too tedious be i to point out to you all the passage which i find expressly contradictory to this revolting tenet it will be sufficient to quote a few i find in the act that the apostle see jesus christ ascend on high carry upward by a cloud which conceal he from they sight and that two angel appear and say unto they man of galilee why stand ye gaze up into heaven this same jesus which be take up from you into heaven shall so come in _ like manner _ as ye have see he go into heaven act 1:9 11 there never be a priest say i there never be a roman catholic administer or receive the sacrament that ever see christ descend from heaven in this manner to enter into the bread nevertheless the angel declare that he should descend from heaven in the same manner as he go up into heaven i find in the same book that the heaven must receive jesus christ till the time of the restitution of all thing act 3:21 he be then say i no longer corporeally on the earth i find in the epistle to the colossian that christ sitteth on the right hand of god chap 3:1 from whence i draw the inference that he certainly can not be actually present on so many altar or in so great a number of wafer as the doctrine of the real presence necessarily suppose i find in the epistle to the hebrew chapter 9 and 10 the strongest declaration not only against the real presence but against the whole system of the mass by which it be pretended daily to renew the passion and sacrifice of we savior when the apostle say that christ be enter into heaven itself heb 9:24 when he say that unto they that look for he shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation ver 28 lastly when he say it be the will of god to sanctify we through the offering of the body of jesus christ once make chap 10:10 and that this man after he have offer one sacrifice for sin for ever sit down at the right hand of god ver 12 have by one offering perfect for ever they that be sanctify ver 14 it appear to I to prove with the most unanswerable evidence that the doctrine of the real presence and all connect with it be as far remove from the creed of the apostle as the east be from the west or as heaven from hell finally my dear child the very word of the institution of the lord 's supper relate by st paul 1 cor 11 and to which i pay particular and repeated attention do not leave a shadow of doubt on my mind that the doctrine of the romish church on the subject of the eucharist be utterly devoid of any foundation in the gospel and must consequently have be derive from some other source in fact all that we savior say on the occasion of institute the lord 's supper clearly show that it be a _ memorial of himself _ which he establish and which he wish to leave behind he after have take bless and break the bread he command that it should be eat _ in remembrance of he _ have give they the cup to drink he add this do ye as oft as ye drink it _ in remembrance _ of I the word this be my body -- this cup be the new testament in my blood appear to I only what they really be figurative expression signify that the bread _ represent _ he body and the wine he blood these word do in no degree change or modify the principal idea that of _ commemoration _ which run throughout this action of we lord have it even be possible that these word have deceive I have i take they in they literal meaning i should soon have be undeceived by those which immediately follow which in themselves utterly overthrow the doctrine of the real presence and the whole system of the mass these be the word : as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do _ show _ the lord 's death _ till he come _ 1 cor 11:26 after this declaration connect with so many other what further proof be want that st paul never believe that the bread and wine contain the actual body of christ i clearly see that in this passage he mean that it be really bread we eat and wine we drink in the sacrament and not the actual body and blood of the son of god i perceive that he teach that the lord be not actually present in that ceremony accord to the sense of the romish church because he distinctly say that by participate in it we do _ show _ the lord 's death _ till he come _ in short i be convince that accord to st paul it be not the body and blood of jesus christ that the priest hold in they hand and which they offer as a sacrifice in the mass here my child i suspend my research convince as much as it be possible to be convince of any thing that the doctrine of transubstantiation be not to be find in the new testament i conclude that it must have the same origin as those of the papacy and of purgatory divert as i have be from my usual occupation during the time that i have thus devote to study and meditation oblige to maintain myself and you by the sweat of my brow and have no other immediate subject of perplexity i return to my daily labor and discontinue the perusal of the gospel my new testament have certainly gain much in my esteem but without stop to consider exactly in what way i value it i think i may say that it be _ not _ as contain the word of god and the knowledge which be unto salvation thus not be really or heartily interested in it i replace it a second time on the spot it have so long occupy on the chimney-piece of my room and eighteen month or two year pass without my thinking of consult it anew during this period i marry again : you tender age and the care you require which my business and absence prevent my give you be the motive which induce I to take this step god in he fatherly kindness mercifully direct my choice though i have never think of ask he to do so and you have find a second mother in she who have ever be to I the most estimable and best of friend during this period also i think more of religion than ever before though i have read the gospel only to satisfy my curiosity on the three point of doctrine that i have mention and although my attention have be exclusively direct to these point it be probable notwithstanding that i have almost unconsciously imbibe some of the impression which the word of god be calculate to produce and that even then i be in some measure under its secret influence one thing i be sure of that from that time some idea of religion although then comparatively vague and confused never leave I i frequently catch myself muse on the origin of the universe on the vicissitude of nature and on the future condition of those numerous being who be see for a short time on the earth and then disappear my own destiny also frequently engage my thought but i be far from refer it to he on whom i now see that it entirely depend in all these thought god be exclude from the place he ought to have hold with nothing but false and uncertain notion of he i be far indeed from regard he as the vivify principle which to the eye of the christian animate and embellish every thing and as that pure light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world i be bind to tell you my child what be the real state of my soul at that time i be in so deplorable a condition of blindness and ignorance that sometimes i think there be no god but that he be a imaginary being and sometimes confound he with the work of he almighty hand i attribute divinity to the material world the fool have say in he heart there be no god and i dare not deny that these word of david be for a long time and even perhaps at the period of which i be speak applicable to I but while i acknowledge that the natural corruption of my heart and the bad book i have read be in part the cause of the sad state i have describe i can not help also attribute the greatest part of they to the _ abuse _ the _ superstition _ and the _ error _ which disfigure christianity in the romish church and which have so disgusted I that they have drive I into total infidelity such then be in fact my religious state you may well believe my child that i be not happy for it be impossible to be so without trust in god who be the source of supreme good and true peace i be assiduous in my occupation i frequent the society of my friend but my heart empty and incessantly craving after something which i could not obtain be never content my mind restless and agitate could no where find a object to fix and satisfy it listlessness follow I every where and seem to increase upon I o how unhappy and how pitiable be those who be as be then without god without christ without hope in the world i be in this wretched state when it pleased god to have pity upon I and to cause a ray of light to penetrate my mind one evening after the labor of the day instead of go as usual to the club which i frequented i go alone upon the public walk where i remain till the night be far advance : the moon shine clear and bright : i have never before be so strike by the magnificence of the heaven and i feel unusually disposed to reflection no i say -lrb- after contemplate for a long time the impressive scene before I -rrb- no nature be not god -lrb- for till then i have entertain this opinion -rrb- god be certainly distinct from nature : in all this i can only recognize a _ work _ replete with harmony order and beauty although i can not perceive the author whose power intelligence and wisdom be every where so strongly imprint on it still both my reason and my feeling combine to convince I of he existence this conclusion which i sincerely adopt be the result of the reflection in which i have be that evening absorb some day after this the examination of a watch its spring its various wheel and its motion bring I afresh to the same conclusion and for ever confirm I in the belief of a god the creator of all thing if this watch i argue could not make itself and necessarily lead we to suppose a artist who make each part and so arrange the whole as to produce these movement -- how much stronger reason have we for conclude that the universe have a contriver and maker i be no sooner fully satisfy of the existence of a god than i tremble at the thought of he attribute and my relationship to he the sense of my unworthiness and sinfulness deeply affect I when i call to mind the many year i have pass in forgetfulness of this great god in indifference to or in a culpable unbelief of he existence i feel that i must indeed be in he sight the most ungrateful and the most sinful of he creature my next feeling be a anxious desire to amend my conduct and i determine to lay down such a plan for my future life as i hope might not be unworthy of that be whose eye i then feel be upon I after have make many effort to recall the best maxim of wisdom and rule of virtue that i have meet with in the course of my reading i at length come to a resolution of examine what moral precept the new testament might contain and whether it might not afford I the rule i be seek for the regulation of my conduct this be the motive which bring I again to the new testament and induce I to undertake a fourth time the perusal of it i wish it be in my power to recount to you my dear child all the effect that the eternal word of god produce upon my heart for from that time i recognize it to be what it be in fact the revelation of sovereign wisdom the genuine expression of the divine will the message of a tender and compassionate father address to he ungrateful and rebellious child solicit they to return and find happiness in he i wish i could retrace all the impression that this divine message produce on my mind the vivid emotion i experienced and the thought and feeling -lrb- never i trust to be forget -rrb- excite by that reading i be like a man bear blind who should suddenly recover he sight in a magnificent apartment splendidly illuminate my feeling at least correspond with those of a man under such circumstance be they possible how glorious be the light of the gospel to I i seek for morality and i find _ there _ the most simple clear complete and perfect system of morality that could be conceive and _ there _ i find precept suit to every circumstance that could present itself in life as a son a brother a father a friend a subject a servant a labourer a man a reasonable creature : my duty in every relation of life i there find inculcate in the most admirable manner i could not imagine one moral duty for which i do not there find a precept not one precept unaccompanied by a motive and no motive that do not appear to I to be dictate by reason or enforce by a authority against which i feel that i have nothing to object i observe two kind of precept which though tend to the same end ie perfection produce a different effect upon I the _ positive _ precept present to my mind a idea of the high degree of holiness at which that man would arrive who could keep they without a single violation the _ negative _ precept by lead I to a close self-examination impress I with a deep sense of my corruption and convinced I that the author of they must have possess a profound knowledge of the human heart in general and of my heart individually who then say i be the writer of this book and when i reflect that they be poor uneducated mechanic like myself the question immediately present itself -- how could fisherman tax-gatherer and tent-maker acquire such extraordinary sagacity penetration wisdom and knowledge ah i exclaimed this be indeed a problem which can only be solve by admit they own assertion that the spirit of god direct they pen and that all they write be divinely inspire such my child be my conclusion after this examination of the morality lay down in the gospel thus i recognize the divine origin of the new testament and take my first step toward christianity when i have once acknowledge the divine origin of the _ morality _ of the gospel reason and personal experience combine to convince I of the truth and divine source of the _ doctrine _ on which it be found if god inspire the apostle and enable they to give to the world the purest and most perfect system of morality that can be conceive be it to be suppose that in the remainder of they writings he would leave they to themselves and permit error or imposture to be mixed and confound with truth no : from the same source can not proceed sweet water and bitter as the moral precept of the gospel be divinely inspire so likewise _ must _ be its doctrine this reasoning appear to I incontrovertible and i receive with full conviction the whole contents of the new testament as dictate by the spirit of truth from that time jesus christ he history he divine character he miracle the end for which he come into the world he suffering and death attract and absorb my whole attention at the account of he passion which till then i have read with indifference my heart be melt and my eye overflow with tear in short i find and feel such a suitableness between the want of my sinful soul destitute as it be of all peace and comfort and the work which the savior have accomplish by he death on the cross that i no longer doubt that the promise of the gospel be personally address to I i believe that jesus christ have offer himself a sacrifice for I to expiate my sin and to reconcile I unto god and from that moment i have enjoy a inward peace the source of which i believe to be faith in christ alone -- a peace which the world can neither give nor take away and which as i myself have frequently experience be alone able to support and strengthen we through all the suffering and affliction of life in this manner you see how a sinner and prodigal as i be we heavenly father meet I and receive I to the arm of he mercy how he make know to I he free grace and heavenly gift of which i be utterly unworthy it be he grace that have accomplish all in I he it be who begin who carry on and who i trust will perfect this work of salvation without he intervention that be to say without the aid of he spirit operate upon my heart it never could have experience a _ real _ conversion to he also do i ascribe with gratitude my admission into the protestant church of which i have now the privilege of be a member -- as i shall proceed to tell you have find as i have already say peace and joy in that word of god which i have receive with my whole heart i immediately feel the desire and the need of intercourse with gospel christian i be convince that such there be because the savior have promise that the power of hell should never prevail against he church but not find they in the roman catholic church which present to I nothing but a religion of tradition equally degenerate in doctrine and worship i be greatly at a loss where to find the real christian for whom i be in search for the first time in my life the thought occur be it possible they may be among the protestant but instantly i repel a idea which early prejudice have render revolt to I in place inhabit exclusively by roman catholic where the doctrine and worship of the protestant christian be little known the term protestant be regard by most as synonymous with heretic blasphemer and reprobate the people generally be imbue with these prejudice which be diligently keep up and disseminate by some among they and i myself be at that time too much under they influence to admit at once that the protestant could be the true christian for whom i be seek soon however the thought return and as i reflect on that declaration of st paul all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution 2 tim 3:12 possibly say i these protestant may be calumniate on the very ground of they religion be more in accordance with the gospel many other passage of scripture present themselves to my mind which lead I to believe that this supposition might be correct i therefore determine to lose no opportunity of clear my doubt upon this point as there be no protestant either in we town or neighborhood whom i could consult i determine to write to the only one i know and though but little acquaint with she i venture to request that i might be apprise of she pastor 's next visit signify that i be anxious to consult he on a subject of importance either she do not understand my letter or from some other motive she answer though oblige be not satisfactory on that point which most interested I i wait patiently for some time and apply myself diligently to reading and meditate on the word of god which have become like necessary food to my soul in all my prayer i entreated the lord that he would condescend to direct I to those true christian of whom he church be compose and permit I to become one of they number i feel a confidence from all that i have experience that my divine benefactor would grant my request whenever he see it good for I this confidence quiet I but could not remove my desire to ascertain what the protestant religion really be one day particularly this anxiety become stronger than ever and degenerate i acknowledge into real impatience i be unhappy at my lonely and isolate situation without a friend to whom i could communicate my dearest interest i believe i could have go a hundred mile to have find any one who think and feel as i do it be at this moment of perplexity and weariness on my return home at the close of a day 's work that the thought strike I of consult my wife you present mother and i have a presentiment that through she i should discover what i so long wish to know she be as you know a native of libo and i remember have hear she say that there be protestant reside in that town and neighborhood when the supper be end and we be seat by the fire each in we chimney-corner she take she work and i begin the conversation nearly in the follow word : annette say i have i not hear you say that there be many protestant in libo and the neighborhood yes bayssière she reply there be a great many but they be a good deal scatter about the country they belong to the church of mont flanquin where they priest or minister reside and do you know any of they have you ever speak to they or be at they house o yes i be acquaint with many family i know mr -- and mr -- & c & c -lrb- i suppress name -rrb- i have be employ in they house and see they frequently well then can you tell I what sort of people they be and what they character and habit o yes i can assure you that they be the best set of people in the world they be esteem loved and respect by every one : i never hear any thing but good of those i know and they always appear to I to conduct themselves irreproachably -lrb- illustration : peter bayssiere -rrb- i continue to question you mother on the manner in which the protestant bring up they child how they treat they servant stranger and the poor i ask if domestic harmony prevail among they and how they conduct themselves as parent and child brother and sister all she answer tend to convince I that pious protestant live under the influence of the word of god and at each disclosure she make -lrb- though unconscious of the value i attach to it -rrb- i say to myself _ this be _ the morality of the gospel satisfy on this point i turn to another : how do the protestant spend they sabbath and festival i ask separate as they be from each other and they church do they ever assemble for prayer or do they live without worship o no they do not live without worship they have they divine service they be at too great a distance from they minister and each other to meet every Sunday but they have a church in the country where they assemble many time in a year i believe once a month and at other time they meet for prayer at they own house oh then they have a church near libo i should very much like to know say i how they conduct they worship and what they do at they church i can tell you perfectly reply you mother for i be present at one of they assembly there be nothing grand or striking in they church they contain neither altar chapel image nor any ornament whatever but consist simply of four whitewashed wall at the lower end be a pulpit like that use by we priest in front of which be a table and around it be seat occupy by the elder the rest of the church be fit up with bench place in order on which the congregation seat themselves as they enter i observe that most of they before they sit down lean upon the back of the seat before they and seem to be in the act of prayer they service be as simple as the building devoid of ceremony when the congregation have assemble one of the elder ascend the pulpit and pray aloud in french then he give notice that he be about to read the word of god and have request they attention he do read for some time from a great book which they tell I be the holy bible he then offer prayer and preach a sermon which give I great pleasure at the time but which i now forget i well remember that throughout the service there be no noise nor disturbance of any kind in the church and one feeling seem to pervade the whole : this strike I forcibly in this description of the protestant worship imperfect as it be i think i could recognize those trait of simplicity that characterize the worship of the primitive christian : and when you mother have finish i say to myself this be indeed like the worship record in the act of the apostle but i add without allow she to perceive the extreme satisfaction that this information afford I be this all you know of the protestant worship do you never see they receive the sacrament yes i have she reply on that same day which be the only time i ever enter they church do tell I then how be it conduct i tell you if you remember that there be a table in front of the pulpit : this table be they altar it be cover with a very white cloth : in the middle of it be a plate of bread and two chalice of wine when the minister have finish preach he take a book and read from it some beautiful passage on the communion suffering and death of christ he also speak of the duty of communicant then every one stand up while he pray : after which he descend from the pulpit and come in front of the holy table he here repeat aloud some word which i have forget and take a small piece of bread and eat it this do he take the two cup in he hand and again say something that i do not hear he drink some of the wine the elder then approach the table and each receive a piece of bread which they eat and drink a little of the wine from the cup which be present to they the rest of the congregation do the same the woman after the man and when all have communicate the minister re-ascend the pulpit give another exhortation offer a conclude prayer and close the whole by urge upon they the care of the poor this think i be indeed the supper of the lord the conformity that i have already observe between the practice of the protestant and those of the primitive christian create in I a feeling of joy which i have never before experienced i desire with renew ardor to search to the bottom of they doctrine and from that time i anticipate that i might myself become a decide protestant this expectation my child soon increase into a certainty on the tenth of February last two pamphlet fall into my hand one be publish by a roman catholic priest and contain a attack on the protestant religion : the other be a answer in defense of that religion write by a protestant minister : these be the first word of religious controversy i have ever read and eagerly do i devour these two little work that of the first -lrb- which have be write on the occasion of a respectable family have recently embrace the protestant faith -rrb- contain nothing that be solid or that i could not have refute in the very word of christ and he apostle therefore i do not dwell upon it but the second under the title of _ a letter to malanie _ be the very thing i want and be so anxiously desire to find -- a exposition of the protestant creed or at least of its most essential point it teach I that the gospel be they only rule of faith worship and conduct : that they admit all that they find establish by the holy scripture but reject every thing else and especially prohibit the invocation of saint the worship of image of relic and of the holy virgin it teach I that they worship god alone through jesus christ he son that they only hope of salvation be in he mercy reveal in the sacrifice of the cross of christ that they recognize no other mediator no other advocate and no other intercessor with god than he who give himself as such and who alone have the right of say to sinner come unto I and i will give you rest it teach I that they believe no more than myself in purgatory in the supremacy of the pope or in the real presence & c in short it teach I that the protestant receive and profess no other than primitive christianity it would be impossible for I to tell you how rejoice i be to find my most intimate feeling express by a minister of a religion found on the gospel from this and from all that you mother have tell I i clearly see that the protestant be unjustly accuse and misrepresent by the wicked or the ignorant and that they be in truth those christian accord to the word of god to whom the promise of the gospel be make from that time i acknowledge they as my true brethren in christ jesus and my chief desire be to be admit into they communion i clearly foresee my child that by make a open avowal of my religious principle and by publicly declare myself a protestant i should raise many violent passion against myself and expose myself to a thousand trial but the truth be dearer to I than life and conscience speak louder than the fear of man i resolve therefore without hesitation to confess my savior before man let the result be what it might and i immediately write to mr -- the pastor at nérac and the author of the letter i have read request the assistance of he experience and kind advice in short after i have be eleven month in correspondence with this excellent minister of the lord after i have visit he in order to acquaint he more fully with the state of my mind and to enjoy the privilege of he instruction after i have frequently attend the performance of protestant worship and they different religious ordinance after i have carefully compare these as well as they doctrine with the only standard of truth the word of god and be fully convince of they perfect accordance i no longer see a motive for delay but request admission and be receive as a member of the protestant church on the twenty-third of the December follow i go to nérac and on christmas day in the presence of the whole congregation have as i trust first give my heart unto the lord i become publicly unite to he saint and receive the sacred _ symbol _ of the body and blood of my savior at the lord 's supper and pledge myself to remain faithful to he till death i trust that he will vouchsafe to I he assistance for the fulfilment of this promise and manifest he strength in my weakness thus it be my beloved child that i become a member of the reform church of christ i have now explain to you the circumstance and motive that have lead I to its sanctuary in the presence of god i attest the truth of all i have now write the rank of the true church be not recruit by means of bribery deceit fraud false miracle or compulsion all means be reject but _ instruction reason _ and persuasion this church have be form and still exist notwithstanding the blow that have be level at it and it will for ever continue in spite of all the rage of hell sustain by the simple exhibition of that gospel which be its only guide and support may it please that god whom i supplicate for the salvation of all man and more especially for the conversion and prosperity of my enemy to give he grace to you my child that you may be find among the number of those who shall be save happy should i be not only to be you natural father but also you spiritual father happy indeed should i be if at that great day when we shall appear before god to receive the sentence of we eternal destiny i might be able to present myself and you without fear and say here lord be i and the child thou hast give I p bayssiere _ montaigut dec _ 31 1826 the history of a bible history of a bible after remain a close prisoner for some month in a bookseller 's shop i

plunge himself and posterity into misery william not relish this conversation close my mouth desire I to say no more at that time a few day afterwards he allow I to talk of the wickedness of the old world : how god send noah to reprove they iniquity and to threaten the destruction of the whole world if they do not repent and turn to the lord that the world be deaf to he remonstrance and that god at last desire noah to build a ark of wood such as would contain himself and family for he be soon to destroy the inhabitant of the earth by a deluge of water this conversation be rather more relish

heat of passion lock I into my old cell where i remain in close confinement for some day but william could not dispense with my company accordingly i be send for i find he very pale and pensive however i faithfully tell he that the imagination of the thought of the heart be only evil and that continually he say he lately begin to feel that he have try to make it better but could not upon this a stranger enter the room and i be hide at the back of a sofa because the family be quite ashamed that i should be see talk with william the stranger remark that he have see he talk with I assure

under heaven the glad news that christ have die for the _ ungodly _ have finish redemption and ascend up on high to receive gift for man and to bestow they on all who believe god 's testimony concern he god open the mind of william to perceive the importance and truth of these thing he begin to hope in god through the offering of he son a sacrifice for sin i advise he now to follow holiness without which no man shall see the lord in heaven or can continue to see he glory on earth to have no fellowship with wicked man to be a faithful steward of whatever god have give he i tell he how christ reward those who overcome all they enemy through faith in he blood and by believe the word of he testimony this conversation make he very happy and he leave I rejoice in the lord sometime after he come with a sorrowful heart complain that he do not feel the lord 's presence that god have forsake he i assure he that be impossible for god expressly say he will _ never _ leave nor forsake he people and that he change not in he love to they i warn he to be cautious how he speak against god for such language be call god a liar i tell he likewise that the church have once prefer a similar complaint against she god upon which jehovah protest that it be possible for a mother to forsake she infant child but impossible for he ever to leave or to forsake he people for he have pledge he _ word _ to the contrary wherefore i warn he to be no more faithless but believe and by do so he would glorify god greatly before man : it would tend to make man think more favourably of god and probably lead some to seek a interest in he favor who otherwise would not upon this he cry out with tear lord i believe help thou my unbelief i change in my love but thou changest not william leave I determine to rejoice evermore and to pray without cease at first he friend think religion have make he less happy than he be before now they declare they have never see he in such good spirit and so truly happy they begin to wish they be like he william longed for the come of the lord while they tremble at the very think of it : they rather wish he might never come this be a great advantage he have over they by the grace and tender mercy of the lord he exhort they to come to the same savior and he would receive they also with open arm william be afterwards bring into great affliction i tell he god send it to he for good to make he more holy humble dead to sin and the world and more fit for heaven he believe I and praise god for he attention to he to send this messenger of affliction to do he good a person who come in express sorrow at see he so pained william reply do not sorrow for I rejoice rather because god have say that we light affliction which be but for a moment work out for we a far more exceed and a eternal weight of glory i be willing to be sick or to die or to recover just as god please whatever please he please I i be never from he during he sickness he praise god daily that he have ever see I he be happy only when he talk with I or about I he recommend I to all who come near he declare that my word create a heaven in he soul he find I to be the mouth of god to
