's statement ix write statement index i introduction after the great war it be difficult to point out a single nation that be happy but this have come out of the war that there be not a single nation outside indium that be not either free or strive to be free it be say that we too be on the road to freedom that it be better to be on the certain though slow course of gradual unfoldment of freedom than to take the troubled and dangerous path of revolution whether peaceful or violent and that the new reform be a half-way house to freedom the new constitution grant to indium keep all the military force both in the direction and in the financial control entirely outside the scope of responsibility to the people of indium what do this mean it mean that the revenue of indium be spend away on what the nation do not want but after the mid-eastern complication and the fresh asiatic addition to british imperial sphere of action this indian military servitude be a clear danger to national interest the new constitution give no scope for retrenchment and therefore no scope for measure of social reform except by fresh taxation the heavy burden of which on the poor will outweigh all the advantage of any reform it maintain all the exist foreign service and the cost of the administrative machinery high as it already be be further increase the reform constitution keep all the fundamental liberty of person property press and association completely under bureaucratic control all those law which give to the irresponsible officer of the executive government of indium absolute power to override the popular will be still unrepealed in spite of the tragic price pay in the punjab for demonstrate the danger of unrestrained power in the hand of a foreign bureaucracy and the inhumanity of spirit by which tyranny in a panic will seek to save itself we stand just where we be before at the mercy of the executive in respect of all we fundamental liberty not only be despotism intact in the law but unparalleled crime and cruelty against the people have be encourage and even after boastful admission and clearest proof leave unpunished the spirit of unrepentant cruelty have thus be allow to permeate the whole administration the mussalman agony to understand we present condition it in not enough to realize the general political servitude we should add to it the reality and the extent of the injury inflict by britain on islam and thereby on the mussalman of indium the article of islamic faith which it be necessary to understand in order to realize why mussalman indium which be once so loyal be now so strongly move to the contrary be easily set out and understand every religion should be interpret by the professor of that religion the sentiment and religious idea of muslim found on the tradition of long generation can not be alter now by logic or cosmopolitanism as other understand it such a attempt be the more unreasonable when it be make not even as a bonafide and independent effort of proselytise logic or reason but only to justify a treaty enter into for political and worldly purpose the khalifa be the authority that be entrust with the duty of defend islam he be the successor to muhammad and the agent of god on earth accord to islamic tradition he must possess sufficient temporal power effectively to protect islam against non-islamic power and he should be one elect or accept by the mussalman world the jazirat-ul-arab be the area bound by the red sea the arabian sea the persian gulf and the water of the tigri and the euphrate it be the sacred home of islam and the center towards which islam throughout the world turn in prayer accord to the religious injunction of the mussalman this entire area should always be under muslim control its scientific border be believe to be a protection for the integrity of islamic life and faith every mussalman throughout the world be enjoin to sacrifice he all if necessary for preserve the jazirat-ul-arab under complete muslim control the sacred place of islam should be in the possession of the khalifa they should not merely be free for the entry of the mussalman of the world by the grace or the license of non-muslim power but should be the possession and property of islam in the fullest degree it be a religion obligation on every mussalman to go forth and help the khalifa in every possible way where he unaided effort in the defense of the khilifat have fail the grievance of the indian mussalman be that a government that pretend to protect and spread peace and happiness among they have no right to ignore or set aside these article of they cherish faith accord to the peace treaty impose on the nominal government at constantinople the khalifa far from have the temporal authority or power need to protect islam be a prisoner in he own city he be to have no real fight force army or navy and the financial control over he own territory be vest in other government he capital be cut off from the rest of he possession by a intervene permanent military occupation it be needless to say that under these condition he be absolutely incapable of protect islam as the mussulman of the world understand it the jazirat-ul-arab be split up a great part of it give to powerful non-muslim power the remnant leave with petty chief dominate all round by non-muslim government the holy place of islam be all take out of the khalifa 's kingdom some leave in the possession of minor muslim chief of arabium entirely dependent on european control and some relegate to newly-formed non-muslim state in a word the mussalman 's free choice of a khalifa such as islamic tradition define be make a unreality the hindu dharma the age of misunderstanding and mutual warfare among religion be go if indium have a mission of its own to the world it be to establish the unity and the truth of all religion this unity be establish by mutual help and understanding between the various religion it have come as a rare privilege to the hindu in the fulfilment of this mission of indium to stand up in defense of islam against the onslaught of the earth-greed of the military power of the west the dharma of hinduism in this respect be place beyond all doubt by the bhagavat gita those who be the votary of other god and worship they with faith -- even they o kaunteya worship I alone though not as the shastra require -- ix 23 whoever be devoted wish in perfect faith to worship a particular form of such a one i maintain the same faith unshaken -- vii 21 hinduism will realize its fullest beauty when in the fulfilment of this cardinal tenet its follower offer themselves as sacrifice for the protection of the faith of they brother the mussalman if hindu and mussalman attain the height of courage and sacrifice that be need for this battle on behalf of islam against the greed of the west a victory will be win not alone for islam but for christianity itself militarism have rob the crucify god of he name and he very cross and the world have be mistake it to be christianity after the battle of islam be win islam and hinduism together can emancipate christianity itself from the lust for power and wealth which have strangle it now and the true christianity of the gospel will be establish this battle of non-cooperation with its suffering and peaceful withdrawal of service will once for all establish its superiority over the power of brute force and unlimited slaughter what a glorious privilege it be to play we part in this history of the world when hinduism and christianity will unite on behalf of islam and in that strife of mutual love and support each religion will attain its own truest shape and beauty a enduring treaty swaraj for indium have two great problem one internal and the other external how can hindu and mussalman so different from each other form a strong and united nation govern themselves peacefully this be the question for year and no one could believe that the two community could suffer for each other till the miracle be actually work the khilafat have solve the problem by the magic of suffer each have truly touch and capture the other 's heart and the nation now be strong and unite not internal strength and unity alone have the khilafat bring to india the great block in the way of indian aspiration for full freedom be the problem of external defense how be indium leave to herself defend she frontier against she mussalman neighbor none but emasculate nation would accept such difficulty and responsibility as a answer to the demand for freedom it be only a people whose mentality have be pervert that can soothe itself with the domination by one race from a distant country as a preventative against the aggression of another a permanent and natural neighbor instead of develop strength to protect ourselves against those near whom we be permanently place a feeling of incurable impotence have be generate two strong and brave nation can live side by side strengthen each other through enforce constant vigilance and maintain in full vigor each its own national strength unity patriotism and resource if a nation wish to be respect by its neighbor it have to develop and enter into honorable treaty these be the only natural condition of national liberty but not a surrender to distant military power to save oneself from one 's neighbor the khilafat have solve the problem of distrust of asiatic neighbor out of we future the indian struggle for the freedom of islam have bring about a more lasting _ entente _ and a more binding treaty between the people of indium and the people of the mussalman state around it than all the entente and treaty among the government of europe no war of aggression be possible where the common people on the two side have become grateful friend the faith of the mussulman be a better sanction than the seal of the european diplomat and plenipotentiary not only have this great friendship between indium and the mussulman state around it remove for all time the fear of mussulman aggression from outside but it have erect round indium a solid wall of defense against all aggression from beyond against all greed from europe russium or elsewhere no secret diplomacy could establish a better _ entente _ or a stronger federation than what this open and non-governmental treaty between islam and indium have establish the indian support of the khilafat have as if by a magic wand convert what be once the pan-islamic terror for europe into a solid wall of friendship and defense for indium the british connection every nation like every individual be bear free absolute freedom be the birthright of every people the only limitation be those which a people may place over themselves the british connection be invaluable as long as it be a defense against any worse connection seek to be impose by violence but it be only a means to a end not a mandate of providence of nature the alliance of neighbor bear of suffer for each other 's sake for end that purify those that suffer be necessarily a more natural and more enduring bond than one that have result from pure greed on the one side and weakness on the other where such a natural and enduring alliance have be accomplish among asiatic people and not only between the respective government it may truly be feel to be more valuable than the british connection itself after that connection have deny freedom or equality and even justice the alternative be violence or total surrender the only choice open to any people to whom freedom or justice be deny violence at a time when the whole world have learn from bitter experience the futility of violence be unworthy of a country whose ancient people 's privilege it be to see this truth long ago violence may rid a nation of its foreign master but will only enslave it from inside no nation can really be free which be at the mercy of its army and its military hero if a people rely for freedom on its soldier the soldier will rule the country not the people till the recent awakening of the worker of europe this be the only freedom which the power of europe really enjoy true freedom can exist only when those who produce not those who destroy or know only to live on other 's labor be the master even be violence the true road to freedom be violence possible to a nation which have be emasculate and deprive of all weapon and the whole world be hopelessly in advance of all we possibility in the manufacture and the wield of weapon of destruction submission or withdrawal of co-operation be the real and only alternative before indium submission to injustice put on the tempting garb of peace and gradual progress but there be no surer way to death than submission to wrong the fifth upaya we ancient classify the art of conquest into four well-known _ upaya _ sama dana uheda and danda a fifth upuya be recognize sometimes by we ancient which they call _ upeshka _ it be this _ punchamopaya _ that be place by mahatma gandhus before the people of indium in the form of non-cooperation as a alternative besides violence to surrender where in any case negotiation have fail and the enemy be neither corruptible nor incapable of be divide and a resort to violence have fail or would certainly be futile the method of _ upeshka _ remain to be apply to the case indeed when the very existence of the power we seek to defeat really depend on we continuous co-operation with it and where we _ upeskha _ its very life we _ upeskha _ or non-co-operation be the most natural and most effective expedient that we can employ to bend it to we will no englishman believe that he nation can rule or keep indium for a day unless the people of indium actively co-operate to maintain that rule whether the co-operation be give willingly or through ignorance cupidity habit or fear the withdrawal of that co-operation mean impossibility of foreign rule in indium some of we may not realize this but those who govern we have long ago know and be now keenly alive to this truth the active assistance of the people of this country in the supply of the money man and knowledge of the language custom and law of the land be the main-spring of the continuous life of the foreign administration indeed the circumstance of british rule in this country be such that but for a double supply of co-operation on the part of the govern it must have break down long ago any system of race domination be unnatural and can be keep up only by active coercion through a foreign-recruited public service invest with large power however much it may he help by the perversion of mentality shape the education of the youth of the country the foreign recruit service must necessarily be very highly pay this create a wrong standard for the indian recruit official also military expenditure have to cover not only the need of defense against foreign aggression but also the possibility of internal unrest and rebellion police charge have to go beyond the prevention and deletion of ordinary crime for though this would be the only expenditure over the police of a self-governing people where any nation govern another a large chapter of artificial crime have to be add to the penal code and the work of the police extend accordingly the military and public organization must also be such as not only to result in outside efficiency but also at the same time guarantee internal impotency this be to be achieve by the adjustment and careful admixture of officer and unit from different race all this can be and be maintain only by extra cost and extra-active co-operation on the part of the people the slightest withdrawal of assistance must put such machinery out of gear this be the basis of the program of progressive non violent non-co-operation that have be adopt by the national congress some objection the powerful character of the measure however lead some to object to non-co-operation because of that very reason striking as it do at the very root of government in indium they fear that non-co-operation must lead to anarchy and that the remedy be worse than the disease this be a objection arise out of insufficient allowance for human nature it be assume that the british people will allow they connection with indium to cease rather than remedy the wrong for which we seek justice if this assumption be correct no doubt it must lead to separation and possibly also anarchy for a time if the operative in a factory have grievance negotiation have fail a strike would on a similar argument be never admissible unyielding obstinacy be presume it must end in the close down of the factory and break up of the man but if in ninety-nine out of a hundred case it be not the case that strike end in this manner it be more unlikely that instead of right the manifest wrong that india complain about the british people will value they indian dominion so low as to prefer to allow we to non-co-operate up to the point of separation it would be a totally false reading of british character and british history but if such wicked obstinacy be ultimately show by a government far be it from we to prefer peace at the price of abject surrender to wrong there be no anarchy greater than the moral anarchy of surrender to unrepentant wrong we may however be certain that if we show the strength and unity necessary for non-co-operation long before we progress with it far we shall have develop true order and true self-government wherein there be no place for anarchy another fear sometimes express that if non-co-operation be to succeed the british would have to go leave we unable to defend ourselves against foreign aggression if we have the self-respect the patriotism the tenacious purpose and the power of organization that be necessary to drive the british out from they entrenched position no lesser foreign power will dare after that undertake the futile task of conquer or enslave we it be sometimes say that non-co-operation be negative and destructive of the advantage which a stable government have confer on we that non-co-operation be negative be merely a half-truth non-co-operation with the government mean greater co-operation among ourselves greater mutual dependence among the many different caste and class of we country non-co-operation be not mere negation it will lead to the recovery of the lost art of co-operation among ourselves long dependence on a outside government which by its interference suppress or prevent the consequence of we difference have make we forget the duty of mutual trust and the art of friendly adjustment have allow government to do everything for we we have gradually become incapable of do anything for ourselves even if we have no grievance against this government non-co-operation with it for a time would be desirable so far as it would perforce lead we to trust and work with one another and thereby strengthen the bond of national unity the most tragic consequence of dependence on the complex machinery of a foreign government be the atrophy of the communal sense the direct touch with administrative cause and effect be lose a outside protector perform all the necessary function of the community in a mysterious manner and communal duty be not realize by the people the one reason address by those who deny to we the capacity for self-rule be the insufficient appreciation by the people of communal duty and discipline it be only by actually refrain for a time from dependence on government that we can regain self-reliance learn first-hand the value of communal duty and build up true national co-operation non-co-operation be a practical and positive training in swadharma and swadharma alone can lead up to swaraj the negative be the best and most impressive method of enforce the value of the positive few outside government circle realize in the present police anything but tyranny and corruption but if the unit of the present police be withdraw we would soon perforce set about organise a substitute and most people would realize the true social value of a police force few realize in the present tax anything but coercion and waste but most people would soon see that a share of every man 's income be due for common purpose and that there be many limitation to the economical management of public institution we would begin once again to contribute directly build up and maintain national institution in the place of those that now mysteriously spring up and live under government order emancipation freedom be a priceless thing but it be a stable possession only when it be acquire by a nation 's strenuous effort what be not by chance or outward circumstance or give by the generous impulse of a tyrant prince or people be not a reality a nation will truly enjoy freedom only when in the process of win or defend its freedom it have be purify and consolidate through and through until liberty have become a part of its very soul otherwise it would be but a change of the form of government which might please the fancy of politician or satisfy the class in power but could never emancipate a people a act of parliament can never create citizen in hindustan the strength spirit and happiness of a people who have fight and win they liberty can not be get by reform act effort and sacrifice be the necessary condition of real stable emancipation liberty unacquired merely find will on the test fail like the dead-sea-apple or the magician 's plenty the war that the people of indium have declare and which will purify and consolidate indium and forge for she a true and stable liberty be a war with the latest and most effective weapon in this war what have hitherto be in the world a undesirable but necessary incident in freedom 's battle the killing of innocent man have be eliminate and that which be the true essential for forge liberty the self-purification and self-strengthening of man and woman have be keep pure and unalloyed it be for man woman and youth every one of they that live in and love indium to do he bit in this battle not wait for other not calculate the chance of he survive the battle to enjoy the fruit of he sacrifice soldier in the old-world war do not insure they life before go to the front the privilege of youth in special be for country 's sake to exercise they comparative freedom and give up the yearning for life and career build on the slavery of the people that on which a foreign government truly rest whatever may be the illusion on they or we part be not the strength of its armed force but we own co-operation actual service on the part of one generation and educational preparation for future service on the part of the next generation be the two main branch of this co-operation of slave in the perpetuation of slavery the boycott of government service and the law-court be aim at the first the boycott of government controlled school be to stop the second if either the one or the other of these two branch of co-operation be withdraw in sufficient measure there will be a automatic and perfectly peaceful change from slavery to liberty the beat preparation for any one who desire to take part in the great battle now go on be a silent study of the writings and speech collect herein and propose to be complete in a supplementary volume to be soon issue c rajagopalachar ii the khilafat why i have join the khilafat movement a esteem south african friend who be at present living in england have write to I a letter from which i make the follow excerpt : -- you will doubtless remember have meet I in south africa at the time when the rev jj doke be assist you in you campaign there and i subsequently return to england deeply impressed with the rightness of you attitude in that country during the month before war i write and lecture and speak on you behalf in several place which i do not regret since return from military service however i have notice from the papers that you appear to be adopt a more militant attitude i notice a report in the time that you be assist and countenance a union between the hindu and moslem with a view of embarrassing england and the ally power in the matter of the dismemberment of the ottoman empire or the ejection of the turkish government from constantinople know as i do you sense of justice and you humane instinct i feel that i be entitle in view of the humble part that i have take to promote you interest on this side to ask you whether this latter report be correct i can not believe that you have wrongly countenance a movement to place the cruel and unjust despotism of the stamboul government above the interest of humanity for if any country have cripple these interest in the east it have surely be turkey i be personally familiar with the condition in syrium and armenia and i can only suppose that if the report which the time have publish be correct you have throw to one side you moral responsibility and ally yourself with one of the prevail anarchy however until i hear that this be not you attitude i can not prejudice my mind perhaps you will do I the favor of send I a reply i have send a reply to the writer but as the view express in the quotation be likely to be share by many of my english friend and as i do not wish if i can possibly help it to forfeit they friendship or they esteem i shall endeavor to state my position as clearly as i can on the khilafat question the letter show what risk public man run through irresponsible journalism i have not see _ the time _ report refer to by my friend but it be evident that the report have make the writer to suspect my alliance with the prevail anarchy and to think that i have throw to one side my moral responsibility it be just my sense of moral responsibility which have make I take up the khilafat question and to identify myself entirely with the mahomedan it be perfectly true that i be assist and countenance the union between hindu and muslim but certainly not with a view of embarrassing england and the ally power in the matter of the dismemberment of the ottoman empire it be contrary to my creed to embarrass government or anybody else this do not how ever mean that certain act of mine may not result in embarrassment but i should not hold myself responsible for have cause embarrassment when i resist the wrong of a wrong-doer by refuse assistance in he wrong-doing on the khilafat question i refuse to be party to a broken pledge mr lloyd george 's solemn declaration be practically the whole of the case for indian mahomedan and when that case be fortify by scriptural authority it become unanswerable moreover it be incorrect to say that i have ally myself to one of the prevail anarchy or that i have wrongly countenance the movement to place the cruel and unjust despotism of the stamboul government above the interest of humanity in the whole of the mahomedan demand there be no insistance on the retention of the so-called unjust despotism of the stamboul government on the contrary the mahomedan have accept the principle of take full guarantee from that government for the protection of non-muslim minority i do not know how far the condition of armenia and syrium may be consider a ` anarchy ' and how far the turkish government may be hold responsible for it i much suspect that the report from these quarter be much exaggerated and that the european power be themselves in a measure responsible for what misrule there may be in armenia and syrium but i be in no way interested in support turkish or any other anarchy the ally power can easily prevent it by means other than that of end turkish rule or dismembering and weaken the ottoman empire the ally power be not deal with a new situation if turkey be to be partition the position should have be make clear at the commencement of the war there would then have be no question of a broken pledge as it be no indian mahomedan have any regard for the promise of british minister in he opinion the cry against turkey be that of christianity _ vs _ islam with england as the louder in the cry the latest cablegram from mr mahome alus strengthen the impression for he say that unlike as in england he deputation be receive much support from the french government and the people thus if it be true as i hold it be true that the indian mussalman have a cause that be just and be support by scriptural authority then for the hindu not to support they to the utmost would be a cowardly breach of brotherhood and they would forfeit all claim to consideration from they mahomedan countryman as a public-server therefore i would be unworthy of the position i claim if i do not support indian mussalman in they struggle to maintain the khilafat in accordance with they religious belief i believe that in support they i be render a service to the empire because by assist my mahomedan countryman to give a disciplined expression to they sentiment it become possible to make the agitation thoroughly orderly and even successful the turkish treaty the turkish treaty will be out on the 10th of may it be state to provide for the internationalisation of the strait the occupation of gallipolus by the ally the maintenance of ally contingent in constantinople and the appointment of a commission of control over turkish finances the san remo conference have entrust britain with mandate for mesopotamium and palestine and france with the mandate for syrium as regard smyrna the account so far receive inform that turkish suzerainty over smyrna will be indicate by the fact that the population will not be entitle to send delegate to the greek parliament but at the end of five year local smyrna parliament will have the right of voting in favor of union with greece and in such a event turkish suzerainty will cease turkish suzerainty will be confine to the area within the chatalja line with regard to emir foisul 's position there be no news except that the mandate of britain and france transform he military title into a civil title \* \* \* \* \* we have give above the term of the turkish treaty as indicate in router 's message these report be incomplete and all of they be not equally authenticate but if these term be true they be a challenge to the muslim demand turkish sovereignty be confine to the chatalja line this mean that the big three of the supreme council have cut off thrace from turkish dominion this be a distinct breach of the pledge give by one of these three _ viz _ the premier of the british empire to remain within the chatalja line and we be afraid as a dependent of the ally be for the sultan a humiliating position inconsistent with the koranic injunction such a restricted position of the turk be virtually a success of the bag and baggage school it be not yet know how the supreme council dispose of the rich and renowned land of asia minor if mr lloyd george 's view recently express in this respect have receive the ally ' sanction -- it be probable -- nothing less than a common control be expect the decision in the case of smyrna will be satisfy to none though the ally seem to have make by they arrangement a skillful attempt to please all the party concerned mr lloyd george in he reply to the khilafat deputation have talk about the careful investigation by a impartial committee and have add the great majority of the population undoubtedly prefer greek rule to turkish rule so i understand but the decision postpone to carry out he understand till a period of five year \* \* \* \* \* when we come to the question of mandate the ally power ' motive come out more distinctly the arab ' claim of independence be use as a difficulty against keep turkish sovereignty this be defend in the of self-determination and by point out parallel of transylvanium and other province when the final moment come the ally have venture to divide the spoil amongst themselves britain be give the mandate over mesopotamium and palestine and france have the mandate over syrium the arab delegation complain in they note lately issue express they disappointment at the supreme council 's decision with regard to the arab liberated country which it declare be contrary to the principle of self-determination \* \* \* \* \* so what little news have arrive about the turkish treaty be uniformly disquieting the moslem have find sufficient ground to honor russium more than the ally russium have recognize the freedom of khiva and bokhara the moslem world as h m the amir of afghanistan say in he speech will feel grateful towards russium in spite of all the rumor abroad about its anarchy and disorder whereas the whole moslem world will resent the action of the other european nation who have ally with each other to carry out a joint coercion and extinction of turkey in the name of self-determination and partly in the guise of the interest of civilization \* \* \* \* \* the term of the turkish treaty be not only a breach of the premier 's pledge not only a sin against the principle of self-determination but they also show a reckless indifference of the ally power towards the koranic injunction the term point out that mr lloyd george 's misinformed idea of khilafat have prevail in the council like mr lloyd george other statesman also at san remo have compare caliphate with popedom and ignore the koronic idea of associate spiritual power with temporal power these misguided statesman be too much possess by haughtiness and so they refuse to receive any enlightenment on the question of khilafat from the deputation they could have correct themselves have they hear mr mahomed alus on this point speaking at the essex hall meeting mr mahome alus distinguish between popedom and caliphate and clearly explain what caliphate mean he say : islam be supernational and not national the basis of islamic sympathy be a common outlook on life and common culture and it have two centre the personal center be the island of arabium the khalifa be the commander of the faithful and he order must be obey by all muslim so long and so long only as they be not at variance with the commandment of god and the tradition of the prophet but since there be no lacerating distinction between thing temporal and thing spiritual the khalifa be something more than a pope and can not be vaticanise but he be also less than a pope for he be not infallible if he persist in un-islamic conduct we can depose he and we have depose he more than once but so long as he order only that which islam demand we must support he he and no other ruler be the defender of _ we _ faith these few word could have remove the mis-undertaking root in the mind of those that at san remo if they be in earnest for a just solution but mr mahome alus 's deputation be not give any hearing by the peace conference they be tell that the peace conference have already hear the official delegation of indium on this question but the wrong notion the ally still entertain about caliphate be a sufficient indication of the effect of the work of this official delegation the result of these wrong notion be the present settlement and this unjust settlement will unsettle the world they know not what they do turkish peace term the question of question to-day be the khilafat question otherwise know as that of the turkish peace term he excellency the viceroy deserve we thanks for receive the joint deputation even at this late hour especially when he be busy prepare to receive the head of the different province he excellency must be thank for the unfailing courtesy with which he receive the deputation and the courteous language in which he reply be couch but mere courtesy valuable as it be at all time never so valuable as at this be not enough at this critical moment ` sweet word butter no parsnip ' be a proverb more applicable to-day than ever before behind the courtesy there be the determination to punish turkey punishment of turkey be a thing which muslim sentiment can not tolerate for a moment muslim soldier be as responsible for the result of the war as any other it be to appease they that mr asquith say when turkey decide to join the central power that the british government have no design on turkey and that he majesty 's government would never think of punish the sultan for the misdeed of the turkish committee examine by that standard the viceregal reply be not only disappointing but it be a fall from truth and justice what be this british empire it be as much mahomedan and hindu as it be christian its religious neutrality be not a virtue or if it be it be a virtue of necessity such a mighty empire could not be hold together on any other term british minister be therefore bind to protect mahomedan interest as any other indeed as the muslim rejoinder say they be bind to make the cause they own what be the use of he excellency have present the muslim claim before the conference if the cause be lose the mahomedan will be entitle to think that britain do not do she duty by they and the viceregal reply confirm the view when he excellency say that turkey must suffer for she have join the central power he but express the opinion of british minister we hope therefore with the framer of the muslim rejoinder that he majesty 's minister will mend the mistake if any have be commit and secure a settlement that would satisfy mahomedan sentiment what do the sentiment demand the preservation of the khilafat with such guarantee as may be necessary for the protection of the interest of the non-muslim race live under turkish rule and the khalif 's control over arabium and the holy place with such arrangement as may be require for guarantee arab self-rule should the arab desire it it be hardly possible to state the claim more fairly than have be do it be a claim back by justice by the declaration of british minister and by the unanimous hindu and muslim opinion it would be midsummer madness to reject or whittle down a claim so back the suzerainty over arabium as i tell you in my last letter i think mr gandhus have make a serious mistake in the kailafat business the indian mahomedan base they demand on the assertion that they religion require the turkish rule over arabium : but when they have against they in this matter the arab themselves it be impossible to regard the theory of the indian mahomedan as essential to islam after all if the arab do not represent islam who do it be as if the german roman catholic make a demand in the name of roman catholicism with rome and the italian make a contrary demand but even if the religion of the indian mahomedan do require that turkish rule should be impose upon the arab against they will one could not now-a-days recognize as a really religious demand one which require the continue oppression of one people by another when a assurance be give at the beginning of the war to the indian mahomedan that the mahomedan religion would be respect that could never have mean that a temporal sovereignty which violate the principle of self-determination would be uphold we could not now stand by and see the turk re-conquer the arab -lrb- for the arab would certainly fight against they -rrb- without grossly betray the arab to whom we have give pledge it be not true that the arab hostility to the turk be due simply to european suggestion no doubt during the war we avail ourselves of the arab hostility to the turk to get another ally but the hostility have exist long before the war the non-turkish mahomedan subject of the sultan in general want to get rid of he rule it be the indian mahomedan who have no experience of that rule who want to impose it on other as a matter of fact the idea of any restoration of turkish rule in syrium or arabium seem so remote from all possibility that to discuss it seem like discuss a restoration of the holy roman empire i can not conceive what series of event could bring it about the indian mahomedan certainly could not march into arabia themselves and conquer the arab for the sultan and no amount of agitation and trouble in indium would ever induce england to put back turkish rule in arabium in this matter it be not english imperialism which the indian mahomedan be up against but the mass of english liberal and humanitarian opinion the mass of the better opinion of england which want self-determination to go forward in indium suppose the indian mahomedan could stir up a agitation so violent in indium as to sever the connection between indium and the british crown still they would not be any nearer to they purpose for to-day they do have considerable influence on british world-policy even if in this matter of the turkish question they influence have not be sufficient to turn the scale against the very heavy weight on the other side it have weigh in the scale but apart from the british connection indian mahomedan would have no influence at all outside indium they would not count for more in world politics than the mahomedan of china i think it be likely -lrb- apart from the pressure of america on the other side i should say certain -rrb- that the influence of the indian mahomedan may at any rate avail to keep the sultan in constantinople but i doubt whether they will gain any advantage by do so for a turkey cut down to the turkish part of asia-minor constantinople would be a very inconvenient capital i think its inconvenience would more than outweigh the sentimental gratification of keep up a phantom of the old ottoman empire but if the indian mahomedan want the sultan to retain he place in constantinople i think the assurance give officially by the viceroy in indium now bind we to insist on he remain there and i think he will remain there in spite of america this be a extract from the letter of a englishman enjoy a position in great britain to a friend in indium it be a typical letter sober honest to the point and put in such graceful language that whilst it challenge you it command you respect by its very gracefulness but it be just this attitude base upon insufficient or false information which have ruin many a cause in the british isle the superficiality the one-sidedness the inaccuracy and often even dishonesty that have creep into modern journalism continuously mislead honest man who want to see nothing but justice do then there be always interested group whose business it be to serve they end by means of faul or food and the honest englishman wish to vote for justice but sway by conflict opinion and dominate by distorted version often end by become a instrument of injustice the writer of the letter quote above have build up convincing argument on imaginary datum he have successfully show that the mahomedan case as it have be present to he be a rotten case in indium where it be not quite easy to distort fact about the khilafat english friend admit the utter justice of the indian-mahomedan claim but they plead helplessness and tell we that the government of indium and mr montagu have do all it be humanly possible for they to do and if now the judgment go against islam indian mahomedan should resign themselves to it this extraordinary state of thing would not be possible except under this modern rush and preoccupation of all responsible people let we for a moment examine the case as it have be imagine by the writer he suggest that indian mahomedan want turkish rule in arabium in spite of the opposition of the arab themselves and that if the arab do not want turkish rule the writer argue no false religion sentiment can be permit to interfere with self-determination of the arab when indium herself have be plead for that very status now the fact be that the mahomedan as be know to everybody who have at all study the case have never ask for turkish rule in arabium in opposition to the arab on the contrary they have say that they have no intention of resist arabian self-government all they ask for be turkish suzerainty over arabium which would guarantee complete self-rule for the arab they want khalif 's control of the holy place of islam in other word they ask for nothing more than what be guarantee by mr lloyd george and on the strength of which guarantee mahomedan soldier split they blood on behalf of the ally power all the elaborate argument therefore and the cogent reasoning of the above extract fall to piece base as they be upon a case that have never exist i have throw myself heart and soul into this question because british pledge abstract justice and religious sentiment coincide i can conceive the possibility of a blind and fanatical religious sentiment exist in opposition to pure justice i should then resist the former and fight for the latter nor would i insist upon pledge give dishonestly to support a unjust cause as have happen with england in the case of the secret treaty resistance there become not only lawful but obligatory on the part of a nation that pride itself on its righteousness it be unnecessary for I to examine the position imagine by the english friend viz how indium would have fare have she be a independent power it be unnecessary because indian mahomedan and for that matter indium be fight for a cause that be admittedly just a cause in aid of which they be invoke the whole-hearted support of the british people i would however venture to suggest that this be a cause in which mere sympathy will not suffice it be a cause which demand support that be strong enough to bring about substantial justice further question answer i have be overwhelm with public criticism and private advice and even anonymous letter tell I exactly what i should do some be impatient that i do not advise immediate and extensive non-co-operation other tell I what harm i be do the country by throw it knowingly in a tempest of violence on either side it be difficult for I to deal with the whole of the criticism but i would summarize some of the objection and endeavor to answer they to the best of my ability these be in addition to those i have already answer : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- turkish claim be immoral or unjust and how can i a lover of truth and justice support it -lrb- 2 -rrb- even if the claim be just in theory the turk be hopelessly incapable weak and cruel he do not deserve any assistance -lrb- 3 -rrb- even if turkey deserve all that be claim for she why should i land indium in a international struggle -lrb- 4 -rrb- it be no part of the indian mahomedan ' business to meddle in this affair if they cherish any political ambition they have try they have fail and they should now sit still if it be a religious matter with they it can not appeal to the hindu reason in the manner it be put and in any case hindus ought not to identify themselves with mahomedan in they religious quarrel with christendom -lrb- 5 -rrb- in no case should i advocate non-co-operation which in its extreme sense be nothing but a rebellion no matter how peaceful it may be -lrb- 6 -rrb- moreover my experience of last year must show I that it be beyond the capacity of any single human be to control the force of violence that be lie dormant in the land -lrb- 7 -rrb- non-co-operation be futile because people will never respond in right earnest and reaction that might afterwards set in will be worse than the state of hopefulness we be now in -lrb- 8 -rrb- non-co-operation will bring about cessation of all other activity even work of the reform thus set back the clock of progress -lrb- 9 -rrb- however pure my motive may be those of the mussalman be obviously revengeful i shall now answer the objection in the order in which they be state -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- in my opinion the turkish claim be not only not immoral and unjust but it be highly equitable if only because turkey want to retain what be she own and the mahomedan manifesto have definitely declare that whatever guarantee may be necessary to be take for the protection of non-muslim and non-turkish race should be take so as to give the christian theirs and the arab they self-government under the turkish suzerainty -lrb- 2 -rrb- i do not believe the turk to be weak incapable or cruel he be certainly disorganised and probably without good generalship he have be oblige to fight against heavy odds the argument of weakness incapacity and cruelty one often hear quote in connection with those from whom power be seek to be take away about the alleged massacre a proper commission have be ask for but never grant and in any case security can be take against oppression -lrb- 3 -rrb- i have already state that if i be not interested in the indian mahomedan i would not interest myself in the welfare of the turk any more than i be in that of the austrian or the pole but i be bind as a indian to share the suffering and trial of fellow-indian if i deem the mahomedan to be my brother it be my duty to help he in he hour of peril to the best of my ability if he cause commend itself to I as just -lrb- 4 -rrb- the fourth refer to the extent hindu should join hand with the mahomedan it be therefore a matter of feeling and opinion it be expedient to suffer for my mahomedan brother to the utmost in a just cause and i should therefore travel with he along the whole road so long as the means employ by he be as honorable as he end i can not regulate the mahomedan feeling i must accept he statement that the khilafat be with he a religious question in the sense that it bind he to reach the goal even at the cost of he own life -lrb- 5 -rrb- i do not consider non-co-operation to be a rebellion because it be free from violence in a larger sense all opposition to a government measure be a rebellion in that sense rebellion in a just cause be a duty the extent of opposition be determine by the measure of the injustice do and feel -lrb- 6 -rrb- my experience of last year show I that in spite of aberration in some part of indium the country be entirely under control that the influence of satyagraha be profoundly for its good and that where violence do break out there be local cause that directly contribute to it at the same time i admit that even the violence that do take place on the part of the people and the spirit of lawlessness that be undoubtedly show in some part should have remain under check i have make ample acknowledgment of the miscalculation i then make but all the painful experience that i then gain do not any way shake my belief in satyagraha or in the possibility of that matchless force be utilise in indium ample provision be be make this time to avoid the mistake of the past but i must refuse to be deter from a clear course because it may be attend by violence totally unintended and in spite of extraordinary effort that be be make to prevent it at the same time i must make my position clear nothing can possibly prevent a satyagrahus from do he duty because of the frown of the authority i would risk if necessary a million life so long as they be voluntary sufferer and be innocent spotless victim it be the mistake of the people that matter in a satyagraha campaign mistake even insanity must be expect from the strong and the powerful and the moment of victory have come when there be no retort to the mad fury of the powerful but a voluntary dignified and quiet submission but not submission to the will of the authority that have put itself in the wrong the secret of success lie therefore in hold every english life and the life of every officer serve the government as sacred as those of we own dear one all the wonderful experience i have gain now during nearly 40 year of conscious existence have convince I that there be no gift so precious as that of life i make bold to say that the moment the englishman feel that although they be in indium in a hopeless minority they life be protect against harm not because of the matchless weapon of destruction which be at they disposal but because indian refuse to take the life even of those whom they may consider to be utterly in the wrong that moment will see a transformation in the english nature in its relation to indium and that moment will also be the moment when all the destructive cutlery that be to be have in indium will begin to rust i know that this be a far-off vision that can not matter to I it be enough for I to see the light and to act up to it and it be more than enough when i gain companion in the onward march i have claim in private conversation with english friend that it be because of my incessant preaching of the gospel of non-violence and my have successfully demonstrate its practical utility that so far the force of violence which be undoubtedly in existence in connection with the khilafat movement have remain under complete control -lrb- 7 -rrb- from a religious standpoint the seventh objection be hardly worth consider if people do not respond to the movement of non-co-operation it would be a pity but that can be no reason for a reformer not to try it would be to I a demonstration that the present position of hopefulness be not dependent on any inward strength or knowledge but it be hope bear of ignorance and superstition -lrb- 8 -rrb- if non-co-operation be take up in earnest it must bring about a cessation of all other activity include the reform but i decline to draw therefore the corollary that it will set back the clock of progress on the contrary i consider non-co-operation to be such a powerful and pure instrument that if it be enforce in a earnest spirit it will be like seek first the kingdom of god and everything else follow as a matter of course people will have then realize they true power they would have learn the value of discipline self-control joint action non-violence organization and everything else that go to make a nation great and good and not merely great -lrb- 9 -rrb- i do not know that i have a right to arrogate greater purity for myself than for we mussalman brethren but i do admit that they do not believe in my doctrine of non-violence to the full extent for they it be a weapon of the weak a expedient they consider non-co-operation without violence to be the only thing open to they in the war of direct action i know that if some of they could offer successful violence they would do to-day but they be convince that humanly speak it be a impossibility for they therefore non-co-operation be a matter not merely of duty but also of revenge whereas i take up non-co-operation against the government as i have actually take it up in practice against member of my own family i entertain very high regard for the british constitution i have not only no enmity against englishman but i regard much in english character as worthy of my emulation i count many as my friend it be against my religion to regard any one as a enemy i entertain similar sentiment with respect to mahomedan i find they cause to be just and pure although therefore they viewpoint be different from mine i do not hesitate to associate with they and invite they to give my method a trial for i believe that the use of a pure weapon even from a mistaken motive do not fail to produce some good even as the tell of truth if only because for the time be it be the best policy be at least so much to the good mr candler 's open letter mr candler have favor I with a open letter on this question of question the letter have already appear in the press i can appreciate mr candler 's position as i would like he and other englishman to appreciate mine and that of hundred of hindu who feel as i do mr candler 's letter be a attempt to show that mr lloyd george 's pledge be not in any way break by the peace term i quite agree with he that mr lloyd george 's word ought not to be tear from they context to support the mahomedan claim these be mr lloyd george 's word as quote in the recent viceregal message : nor be we fight to destroy austria-hungary or to deprive turkey of its capital or of the rich and renowned land of asia minor and thrace which be predominantly turkish in race mr candler seem to read ` which ' as if it mean ` if they ' whereas i give the pronoun its natural meaning namely that the prime minister know in 1918 that the land refer to by he be predominantly turkish in race and if this be the meaning i venture to suggest that the pledge have be break in a most barefaced manner for there be practically nothing leave to the turk of ` the rich and renowned land of asia minor and thrace ' i have already my view of the retention of the sultan in constantinople it be a insult to the intelligence of man to suggest that ` the maintenance of the turkish empire in the homeland of the turkish race with its capital at constantinople have be leave unimpaired by the term of peace this be the other passage from the speech which i presume mr candler want I to read together with the one already quote : -- while we do not challenge the maintenance of the turkish empire in the home-land of the turkish race with its capital at constantinople the passage between the mediterranean and the black sea be inter-nationalised armenia mesopotamium syrium and palestine be in we judgment entitle to a recognition of they separate national condition do that mean entire removal of turkish influence extinction of turkish suzerainty and the introduction of european-christian influence under the guise of mandate have the moslem of arabium armenia mesopotamium syrium and palestine be commit or be the new arrangement be superimpose upon they by power conscious of they own brute-strength rather than of justice of they action i for one would nurse by every legitimate mean the spirit of independence in the brave arab but i shudder to think what will happen to they under the scheme of exploitation of they country by the greedy capitalist protect as they will be by the mandatory power if the pledge be to be fulfil let these place have full self-government with suzerainty to be retain with turkey as have be suggest by the _ time of indium _ let there be all the necessary guarantee take from turkey about the internal independence of the arab but to remove that suzerainty to deprive the khalif of the wardenship of the holy place be to render khilafat a mockery which no mahomedan can possibly look upon with equanimity i be not alone in my interpretation of the pledge the right hon ` ble ameer ali call the peace term a breach of faith mr charle robert remind the british public that the indian mussalman sentiment regard the turkish treaty be base upon the prime minister 's pledge regard thrace constantinople and turkish land in asia minor repeat on February 26 last with deliberation by mr lloyd george mr robert hold that the pledge must be treat as a whole not as bind only regard constantinople but also bind as regard thrace and asia minor he describe the pledge as binding upon the nation as a whole and its breach in any part as a gross breach of faith on the part of the british empire he demand that if there be a unanswerable reply to the charge of breach of faith it ought to be give and add the prime minister may regard he own word lightly if he choose but he have no right to break a pledge give on behalf of the nation he conclude that it be incredible that such pledge should not have be keep in the letter and in the spirit he add : i have reason to believe that these view be fully share by prominent member of the cabinet i wonder if mr candler know what be go on to-day in england mr pickthall write in _ new age _ say : no impartial international enquiry into the whole question of the armenian massacre have be institute in the ample time which have elapse since the conclusion of armistice with turkey the turkish government have ask for such enquiry but the armenian organization and the armenian partisan refuse to hear of such a thing declare that the bryce and lepssen report be quite sufficient to condemn the turk in other word the judgment should be give on the case for prosecution alone the inter-allied commission which investigate the unfortunate event in smyrna last year make a report unfavourable to greek claim therefore that report have not be publish here in england though in other country it have long be public property he then go on to show how money be be scatter by armenian and greek emissary in order to popularize they cause and add : this conjunction of dense ignorance and cunning falsehood be fraught with instant danger to the british realm and conclude : a government and people which prefer propaganda to fact as the ground of policy -- and foreign policy at that -- be self-condemned i have reproduce the above extract in order to show that the present british policy have be affect by propaganda of a unscrupulous nature turkey which be dominant over two million square mile of asia africa and europe in the 17th century under the term of the treaty say the _ london chronicle _ have dwindle down to little more than 1000 square mile it say all european turkey could now be accommodate comfortably between the landsend and the tamar cornawal alone exceed its total area and but for its alliance with germany turkey could have be assure of retain at least sixty thousand square mile of the eastern balkan i do not know whether the _ chronicle _ view be generally share be it by way of punishment that turkey be to undergo such shrinkage or be it because justice demand it if turkey have not make the mistake of join germany would the principle of nationality have be still apply to armenia arabia mesopotamium and palestine let I now remind those who think with mr candler that the promise be not make by mr lloyd george to the people of indium in anticipation of the supply of recruit continue in defend he own statement mr lloyd george be report to have say : the effect of the statement in indium be that recruit go up appreciably from that very moment they be not all mahomedan but there be many mahomedan amongst they now we be tell that be a offer to turkey but they reject it and therefore we be absolutely free it be not it be too often forget that we be the greatest mahomedan power in the world and one-fourth of the population of the british empire be mahomedan there have be no more loyal adherent to the throne and no more effective and loyal supporter of the empire in its hour of trial _ we give a solemn pledge and they accept it _ they be disturb by the prospect of we not abide by it who shall interpret that pledge and how how do the government of indium itself interpret it do it or do it not energetically support the claim for the control of the holy place of islam vesting in the khalif do the government of indium suggest that the whole of jazirat-ul-arab could he take away consistently with that pledge from the sphere of influence of the khalif and give over to the ally as mandatory power why do the government of indium sympathise with the indian mussalman if the term be all they should be so much for the pledge i would like to guard myself against be understand that i stand or fall absolutely by mr lloyd george 's declaration i have advisedly use the adverb ` practically ' in connection with it it be a important qualification ' mr candler seem to suggest that my goal be something more than merely attain justice on the khilafat if so he be right attainment of justice be undoubtedly the corner-stone and if i find that i be wrong in my conception of justice on this question i hope i shall have the courage immediately to retrace my step but by help the mahomedan of indium at a critical moment in they history i want to buy they friendship moreover if i can carry the mahomedan with I i hope to wean great britain from the downward path along which the prime minister seem to I to be take she i hope also to show to indium and the empire at large that give a certain amount of capacity for self-sacrifice justice can be secure by peacefullest and cleanest means without sowing or increase bitterness between english and indian for whatever may be the temporary effect of my method i know enough of they to feel certain that they alone be immune from last bitterness they be untainted with hatred expedience or untruth in process of keep the writer of ` current topic ' in the time of indium have attempt to challenge the statement make in my khilafat article regard ministerial pledge and in do so cite mr asquith 's guild-hall speech of November 10 1914 when i write the article i have in mind mr asquith 's speech i be sorry that he ever make that speech for in my humble opinion it betray to say the least a confusion of thought could he think of the turkish people as apart from the ottoman government and what be the meaning of the death-knell of ottoman dominion in europe and asia if it be not the death knell of turkish people as a free and govern race be it again true historically that the turkish rule have always be a blight that ` have wither some of the fairest region of the earth ' and what be the meaning of he statement that follow viz nothing be further from we thought than to imitate or encourage a crusade against they belief if word have any mean the qualification that mr asquith introduce in he speech should have mean a scrupulous regard for indian muslim feeling and if that be the meaning of he speech without anything further to support I i would claim that even mr asquith 's assurance be in danger of be set at nought if the resolution of the san remo conference be to be crystallise into action but i base remark on a consider speech make by mr asquith 's successor two year later when thing have assume a more threatening shape than in 1914 and when the need for indian help be much greater than in 1914 he pledge would bear repetition till it be fulfil he say : nor be we fight to deprive turkey of its capital or of the rich and renowned land of asia minor and thrace which be predominantly turkish in race we do not challenge the maintenance of the turkish empire in the homeland of the turkish race with its capital at constantinople if only every word of this pledge be fulfil both in letter and in spirit there would be little left for quarrel about in so far as mr asquith 's declaration can be consider hostile to the indian muslim claim it its supersede by the later and more consider declaration of mr lloyd george -- a declaration make irrevocable by fulfilment of the consideration it expect viz the enlistment of the brave mahomedan soldiery which fight in the very place which be now be partition in spite of the pledge but the writer of ` current topic ' say mr lloyd george be now in process of keep he pledge i hope he be right but what have already happen give little ground for any such hope for imprisonment or internment of the khalif in he own capital will be not only a mockery of fulfilment but it would he add injury to insult either the turkish empire be to be maintain in the homeland of the turkish race with its capital at constantinople or it be not if it be let the indian mahomedan feel the full glow of it or if the empire be to be break up let the mask of hypocrisy be lift and indium see the truth in its nakedness to join the khilafat movement then mean to join a movement to keep inviolate the pledge of a british minister surely such a movement be worth much greater sacrifice than may be involve in non-co-operation appeal to the viceroy you excellency as one who have enjoy a certain measure of you excellency 's confidence and as one who claim to be a devoted well-wisher of the british empire i owe it to you excellency and through you excellency to he majesty 's minister to explain my connection with and my conduct in the khilafat question at the very earliest stage of the war even whilst i be in london organise the indian volunteer ambulance corps i begin to interest myself in the khilafat question i perceive how deeply move the little mussalman world in london be when turkey decide to throw in she lot with germany on my arrival in indium in the January of 1915 i find the same anxiousness and earnestness among the mussalman with whom i come in contact they anxiety become intense when the information about the secret treaty leak out distrust of british intention fill they mind and despair take possession of they even at that moment i advise my mussalman friend not to give way to despair but to express they fear and they hope in a disciplined manner it will be admit that the whole of mussalman indium have behave in a singularly restrained manner during the past five year and that the leader have be able to keep the turbulent section of they community under complete control the peace term and you excellency 's defense of they have give the mussalman of indium a shock from which it will be difficult for they to recover the term violate ministerial pledge and utterly disregard mussalman sentiment i consider that as a staunch hindu wish to live on term of the closest friendship with my mussalman countryman i should be a unworthy son of indium if i do not stand by they in they hour of trial in my humble opinion they cause be just they claim that turkey must be _ punish _ if they sentiment be to be respect muslim soldier do fight to inflict punishment on they own khalifa or to deprive he of he territory the mussalman attitude have be consistent throughout these five year my duty to the empire to which i owe my loyalty require I to resist the cruel violence that have be do to the mussalman sentiment so far as i be aware mussulman and hindu have as a whole lose faith in british justice and honor the report of the majority of the hunter committee you excellency 's despatch thereon and mr montagu 's reply have only aggravate the distrust in these circumstance the only course open to one like I be either in despair to sever all connection with british rule or if i still retain faith in the inherent superiority of the british constitution to all other at present in vogue to adopt such means as will rectify the wrong do and thus restore confidence i have not lose faith in such superiority and i be not without hope that somehow or other justice will yet be render if we show the requisite capacity for suffer indeed my conception of that constitution be that it help only those who be ready to help themselves i do not believe that it protect the weak it give free scope to the strong to maintain they strength and develop it the weak under it go to the wall it be then because i believe in the british constitution that i have advise my mussalman friend to withdraw they support from you excellency 's government and the hindu to join they should the peace term not be revise in accordance with the solemn pledge of minister and the muslim sentiment three course be open to the mahomedan in order to mark they emphatic disapproval of the utter injustice to which he majesty 's minister have become party if they have not actually be the prime perpetrator of it they be : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- to resort to violence -lrb- 2 -rrb- to advise emigration on a wholesale scale -lrb- 3 -rrb- not to be party to the injustice by cease to co-operate with the government you excellency must be aware that there be a time when the boldest though the most thoughtless among the mussulman favor violence and the hijrat -lrb- emigration -rrb- have not yet cease to be the battle-cry i venture to claim that i have succeed by patient reasoning in wean the party of violence from its way i confess that i do not -- i do not attempt to succeed in wean they from violence on moral grounds but purely on utilitarian grounds the result for the time be at any have however be to stop violence the school of hijrat have receive a check if it have not stop its activity entirely i hold that no repression could have prevent a violent eruption if the people have not have present to they a form of direct action involve considerable sacrifice and ensure success if such direct action be largely take up by the public non-co-operation be the only dignified and constitutional form of such direct action for it be the right recognize from time immemorial of the subject to refuse to assist a ruler who misrule at the same time i admit that non-co-operation practice by the mass of people be attend with grave risk but in a crisis such as have overtake the mussalman of indium no step that be unattended with large risk can possibly bring about the desire change not to run some risk now will be to court much greater risk if not virtual destruction of law and order but there be yet a escape from non-co-operation the mussalman representation have request you excellency to lead the agitation yourself as do you distinguish predecessor at the time of the south african trouble but if you can not see you way to do so and non-co-operation become a dire necessity i hope that you excellency will give those who have accept my advice and myself the credit for be actuate by nothing less than a stern sense of duty i have the honor to remain you excellency 's faithful servant -lrb- sd -rrb- mk gandhus laburnam road gamdevus bombay 22nd June 1920 the premier 's reply the english mail have bring we a full and official report of the premier 's speech which he recently make when he receive the khilafat deputation mr lloyd george 's speech be more definite and therefore more disappointing than he the viceroy 's reply to the deputation here he draw quite unwarranted deduction from the same high principle on which he have base he own pledge only two year ago he declare that turkey must pay the penalty of defeat this determination to punish turkey do not become one whose immediate predecessor have in order to appease muslim soldier promise that the british government have no design on turkey and that he majesty 's government would never think of punish the sultan for the misdeed of the turkish committee mr lloyd george have express he belief that the majority of the population of turkey do not really want to quarrel with great britain and that they ruler mislead the country in spite of this conviction and in spite of mr asquith 's promise he be out to punish turkey and punish it in the name of justice he expound the principle of self-determination and justify the scheme of deprive turkey of its territory one after another while justify this scheme he do not exclude even thrace and this strike the reader most because this very thrace he have mention in he pledge as predominantly turkish now we be tell by he that both the turkish census and the greek census agree in point out the mussulman population in thrace be in a considerable minority mr yakub hussain speak at the madras khilafat conference have challenge the truth of this statement the prime minister cite among other also the example of smyrna where he say we have a most careful investigation by a very impartial committee in the whole of the question of smyrna and it be find that considerable majority be non-turkish ' who will believe the one-sided impartial committee 's investigation until it be disprove that thousand of musselman have be murder and hundred of thousand have be drive away from they hearth and home strangely enough mr lloyd george believe in the necessity of fresh investigation by a purposely appoint committee in smyrna as the most authenticate and up-to-date report whereas he would not accept mr mahomed ali 's proposal for a impartial commission in regard to armenian massacre doubtful and one-sided fact and figure suffice for he even to conclude that the turkish government be incapable of protect its subject and he proceed to suggest foreign interference in ruling over asia minor in the interest of civilization here he cut at the root of the sultan 's independence this proposal of appropriate supervision be distinctly unlike the treatment mete out to other enemy power this detraction of the sultan 's suzerainty be only a corollary of the premier 's indifference towards the muslim idea of the caliphate the premier 's injustice in treat the turkish question become graver when he thus lightly handle the khilafat question there have be occasion when the british have use to they advantage the muslim idea of associate the caliph 's spiritual power with temporal power now this very association be treat as a controversial question by the great statesman will this raise the reputation of great britain or stain it can this be tolerate by those who fight against turkey with full faith in british honesty mere receipt of gratitude can not console the wounded mussalman there lie the alternative for england to choose between two mandate -- a mandate over some turkish territory which be sure to lead to chaos all over the world and a mandate over the heart of the muhomedan which will redeem the pledge honor of britain the prime minister have a unwise choice this narrow view register the latest temperature of british diplomacy the mussulman representation slowly but surely the mussulman be prepare for the battle before they they have to fight against odds that be undoubtedly heavy but not half as heavy as the prophet have against he how often do he not put he life in danger but he faith in god be unquenchable he go forward with a light heart for god be on he side for he represent truth if he follower have half the prophet 's faith and half he spirit of sacrifice the odds will be presently even and will in little while turn against the despoiler of turkey already the rapacity of the ally be tell against themselves france find she task difficult greece can not stomach she ill-gotten gain and england find mesopotamium a tough job the oil of mosul may feed the fire she have so wantonly light and burn she finger badly the newspaper say the arab do not like the presence of the indian soldiery in they midst i do not wonder they be a fierce and a brave people and do not understand why indian soldier should find themselves in mesopotamium whatever the fate of non-co-operation i wish that not a single indian will offer he service for mesopotamium whether for the civil or the military department we must learn to think for ourselves and before enter upon any employment find out whether thereby we may not make ourselves instrument of injustice apart from the question of khilafat and from the point of abstract justice the english have no right to hold mesopotamium it be no part of we loyalty to help the imperial government in what be in plain language daylight robbery if therefore we seek civil or military employment in mesopotamium we do so for the sake of earn a livelihood it be we duty to see that the source be not taint it surprise I to find so many people shirk over the mention of non-co-operation there be no instrument so clean so harmless and yet so effective as non-co-operation judiciously haul it need not produce any evil consequence and its intensity will depend purely on the capacity of the people for sacrifice the chief thing be to prepare the atmosphere of non-co-operation we be not go to co-operate with you in you injustice be surely the right and the duty of every intelligent subject to say be it not for we utter servility helplessness and want of confidence in ourselves we would certainly grasp this clean weapon and make the most effective use of it even the most despotic government can not stand except for the consent of the govern which consent be often forcibly procure by the despot immediately the subject cease to fear the despotic force he power be go but the british government be never and nowhere entirely or lay upon force it do make a honest attempt to secure the goodwill of the govern but it do not hesitate to adopt unscrupulous means to compel the consent of the govern it have not go beyond the ` honesty be the best policy ' idea it therefore bribe you into consent its will by award title medal and ribbon by give you employment by its superior financial ability to open for its employee avenue for enrich themselves and finally when these fail it resort to force that be what sir michael o'dwyer do and that be almost every british administrator will certainly do if he think it necessary if then we would not be greedy if we would not run after title and medal and honorary post which do the country no good half the battle be win my adviser be never tire of tell I that even if the turkish peace term be revise it will not be due to non-co-operation i venture to suggest to they that non-co-operation have a higher purpose than mere revision of the term if i can not compel revision i must at least cease to support a government that become party to the usurpation and if i succeed in push non-co-operation to the extreme limit i do compel the government to choose between indium and the usurpation i have faith enough in england to know that at that moment england will expel she present jade minister and put in other who will make a clean sweep of the term in consultation with a awaken indium draft term that will be honorable to she to turkey and acceptable to indium but i hear my critic say indium have not the strength of purpose and the capacity for the sacrifice to achieve such a noble end they be partly right indium have not these quality now because we have not -- shall we not evolve they and infect the nation with they be not the attempt worth make be my sacrifice too great to gain such a great purpose criticism of the muslim manifesto the khilafat representation address to the viceroy and my letter on the same subject have be severely criticise by the anglo-indian press _ the time of indium _ which generally adopt a impartial attitude have take strong exception to certain statement make in the muslim manifesto and have devote a paragraph of its article to a advance criticism of my suggestion that he excellency should resign if the peace term be not revise _ the time of indium _ except to the submission that the british empire may not treat turkey like a depart enemy the signatory have i think supply the best of reason they say we respectfully submit that in the treatment of turkey the british government be bind to respect indian muslim sentiment in so far as it be neither unjust nor unreasonable if the seven crore mussulman be partner in the empire i submit that they wish must be hold to be all sufficient for refrain from punish turkey it be beside the point to quote what turkey do during the war it have suffer for it _ the time _ inquire wherein turkey have be treat worse than the other power i think that the fact be self-evident neither germany nor austrium and hungary have be treat in the same way that turkey have be the whole of the empire have be reduce to the retention of a portion of its capital as it be to mock the sultan and that too have be do under term so humiliating that no self-respecting person much less a reign sovereign can possibly accept _ the time _ have endeavor to make capital out of the fact that the representation do not examine the reason for turkey not join the ally well there be no mystery about it the fact of russium be one of the ally be enough to warn turkey against join they with russium knock at the gate at the time of the war it be not a easy matter for turkey to join the ally but turkey have cause to suspect great britain herself she know that england have do no friendly turn to she during the bulgarian war she be hardly well serve at the time of the war with italy it be still no doubt a bad choice with the musssalman of indium awaken and ready to support she she statesman might have rely upon britain not be allow to damage turkey if she have remain with the ally but this be all wisdom after event turkey make a bad choice and she be punish for it to humiliate she now be to ignore the indian mussulman sentiment britain may not do it and retain the loyalty of the awaken mussulman of indium for the time to say that the peace term strictly follow the principle of self-determination be to throw dust in the eye of its reader be it the principle of self-determination that have cause the cessation of adrianople and thrace to greece by what principle of self-determination have smyrna be hand to greece have the inhabitant of thrace and smyrna ask for grecian tutelege i decline to believe that the arab like the disposition that have be make of they who be the king of hedjaj and who be emir feisul have the arab elect these king and chief do the arab like the mandate be take by england by the time the whole thing be finish the very name self-determination will stink in one 's nostril already sign be not want to show that the arab the thracian and the smyrnan be resent they disposal they may not like turkish rule but they like the present arrangement less they could have make they own honorable term with turkey but these self-determining people will now be hold down by the ` matchless might ' of the ally _ ie _ british force britain have the straight course open to she of keep the turkish empire intact and take sufficient guarantee for good government but she prime minister choose the crooked course of secret treaty duplicity and hypocritical subterfuge there be still a way out let she treat indium as a real partner let she call the true representative of the mussalman let they go to arabia and the other part of the turkish empire and let she devise a scheme that would not humiliate turkey that would satisfy the just muslim sentiment and that will secure honest self-determination for the race compose that empire if it be canada australium or south africa that have to be placate mr lloyd george would not have dare to ignore they they have the power to secede indium have not let he no more insult indium by call she a partner if she feeling count for naught i invite _ the time of indium _ to reconsider its position and join a honorable agitation in which a high-souled people be seek nothing but justice i do with all deference still suggest that the least that lord chelmsford can do be to resign if the sacred feeling of indium 's son be not to be consult and respect by the minister _ the time _ be over-tax the constitution when it suggest that as a constitutional viceroy it be not open to lord chelmsford to go against the decision of he majesty 's minister it be certainly not open to a viceroy to retain office and oppose ministerial decision but the constitution do allow a viceroy to resign he high office when he be call upon to carry out decision that be immoral as the peace term be or like these term be calculate to stir to they very depth the feeling of those whose affair he be administer for the time be the mahomedan decision the khilafat meeting at allahabad have unanimously reaffirm the principle of non-co-operation and appoint a executive committee to lay down and enforce a detailed program this meeting be precede by a joint hindu-mahomedan meeting at which hindu leader be invite to give they view mr beasant the hon ` ble pandit malaviyuji the hon ` ble dr sapru motilal nehru chintamanus and other be present at the meeting it be a wise step on the part of the khilafat committee to invite hindu represent all shades of think to give they the benefit of they advice mr besant and dr sapru strongly dissuade the mahomedan present from the policy of non-co-operation the other hindu speaker make non-committal speech whilst the other hindu speaker approve of the principle of non-co-operation in theory they see many practical difficulty and they fear also complication arise from mahomedan welcome a afghan invasion of indium the mahomedan speaker give the fullest and frankest assurance that they would fight to a man any invader who want to conquer indium but be equally frank in assert that any invasion from without undertake with a view to uphold the prestige of islam and to vindicate justice would have they full sympathy if not they actual support it be easy enough to understand and justify the hindu caution it be difficult to resist mahomedan position in my opinion the best way to prevent indium from become the battle ground between the force of islam and those of the english be for hindu to make non-co-operation a complete and immediate success and i have little doubt that if the mahomedan remain true to they declare intention and be able to exercise self-restraint and make sacrifice the hindu will play the game and join they in the campaign of non-co-operation i feel equally certain that the hindu will not assist mahomedan in promote or bring about a armed conflict between the british government and they ally and afghanistan british force be too well organise to admit of any successful invasion of the indian frontier the only way therefore the mahomedan can carry on a effective struggle on behalf of the honor of islam be to take up non-co-operation in real earnest it will not only be completely effective if it be adopt by the people on a extensive scale but it will also provide full scope for individual conscience if i can not bear a injustice do by a individual or a corporation and if i be directly or indirectly instrumental in uphold that individual or corporation i must answer for it before my maker but i have do all it be humanly possible for I to do consistently with the moral code that refuse to injure even the wrong-doer if i cease to support the injustice in the manner describe above in apply therefore such a great force there should be no haste there should be no temper show non-co-operation must be and remain absolutely a voluntary effort the whole thing then depend upon mahomedan themselves if they will but help themselves hindu help will come and the government great and mighty though it be will have to bend before this irresistible force no government can possibly withstand the bloodless opposition of a whole nation mr andrew ' difficulty mr andrew whose love for indium be equal only by he love for england and whose mission in life be to serve god ie humanity through indium have contribute remarkable article to the ` bombay chronicle ' on the khilafat movement he have not spare england france or italy he have show how turkey have be most unjustly deal with and how the prime minister 's pledge have be break he have devote the last article to a examination of mr mahome alus 's letter to the sultan and have come to the conclusion that mr mahome alus 's statement of claim be at variance with the claim set forth in the latest khilafat representation to the viceroy which he wholly approve mr andrew and i have discuss the question as fully as it be possible he ask I publicly to define my own position more fully than i have do he sole object in invite discussion be to give strength to a cause which he hold as intrinsically just and to gather round it the best opinion of europe so that the ally power and especially england may for very shame be oblige to revise the term i gladly respond to mr andrew 's invitation i should clear the ground by state that i reject any religious doctrine that do not appeal to reason and be in conflict with morality i tolerate unreasonable religious sentiment when it be not immoral i hold the khilafat claim to be both just and reasonable and therefore it derive greater force because it have behind it the religious sentiment of the mussalman world in my opinion mr mahome alus 's statement be unexceptionable it be no doubt clothe in diplomatic language but i be not prepare to quarrel with the language so long as it be sound in substance mr andrew consider that mr mahome alus 's language go to show that he would resist armenian independence against the armenian and the arabian against the arab i attach no such meaning to it what he the whole of mussalman and therefore i think also the hindu resist be the shameless attempt of england and the other power under cover of self-determination to emasculate and dismember turkey if i understand the spirit of islam properly it be essentially republican in the truest sense of the term therefore if armenia or arabium desire independence of turkey they should have it in the case of arabium complete arabian independence would mean transference of the khilafat to a arab chieftain arabium in that sense be a mussulman trust not purely arabian and the arab without cease to be mussulman could not hold arabium against muslim opinion the khalifa must be the custodian of the holy place and therefore also the route to they he must be able to defend they against the whole world and if a arab chief arise who could better satisfy that test than the sultan of turkey i have no doubt that he would be recognize as the khalifa i have thus discuss the question academically the fact be that neither the mussulman nor the hindu believe in the english ministerial word they do not believe that the arab or the armenian want complete independence of turkey that they want self-government be beyond doubt nobody dispute that claim but nobody have ever ascertain that either the arab or the armenian desire to do away with all connection even nominal with turkey the solution of the question lie not in we academic discussion of the ideal position it lie in a honest appointment of a mixed commission of absolutely independent indian mussulman and hindu and independent european to investigate the real wish of the armenian and the arab and then to come to a _ modus vivendus _ where by the claim of the nationality and those of islam may be adjust and satisfy it be common knowledge that smyrna and thrace include adrianople have be dishonestly take away from turkey and that mandate have be unscrupulously establish in syrium and mesopotamium and a british nominee have be set up in hedjaj under the protection of british gun this be a position that be intolerable and unjust apart therefore from the question of armenia and arabia the dishonesty and hypocrisy that pollute the peace term require to be instantaneously remove it pave the way to a equitable solution of the question of armenian and arabian independence which in theory no one deny and which in practice may be easily guarantee if only the wish of the people concern could with any degree of certainty be ascertain the khilafat agitation a friend who have be listen to my speech once ask I whether i do not come under the sedition section of the indian penal code though i have not fully consider it i tell he that very probably i do and that i could not plead ` not guilty ' if i be charge under it for i must admit that i can pretend to no ` affection ' for the present government and my speech be intend to create ` dis-affection ' such that the people might consider it a shame to assist or co-operate with a government that have forfeit all title to confidence respect or support i draw no distinction between the imperial and the indian government the latter have accept on the khilafat the policy impose upon it by the former and in the punjab case the former have endorse the policy of terrorism and emasculation of a brave people initiate by the latter british minister have break they pledge word and wantonly wound the feeling of the seventy million mussulman of indium innocent man and woman be insult by the insolent officer of the punjab government they wrong not only remain unrighted but the very officer who so cruelly subject they to barbarous humiliation retain office under the government when at amritsar last year i plead with all the earnestness i could command for co-operation with the government and for response to the wish express in the royal proclamation i do so because i honestly believe that a new era be about to begin and that the old spirit of fear distrust and consequent terrorism be about to give place to the new spirit of respect trust and goodwill i sincerely believe that the mussulman sentiment would be placate and that the officer that have misbehave during the martial law regime in the punjab would be at least dismiss and the people would be otherwise make to feel that a government that have always be find quick -lrb- and mighty -rrb- to punish popular excess would not fail to punish its agent ' misdeed but to my amazement and dismay i have discover that the present representative of the empire have become dishonest and unscrupulous they have no real regard for the wish of the people of indium and they count indian honor as of little consequence i can no longer retain affection for a government so evilly man as it be now-a-days and for I it be humiliating to retain my freedom and be witness to the continue wrong mr montagu however be certainly right in threaten I with deprivation of my liberty if i persist in endanger the existence of the government for that must be the result if my activity bear fruit my only regret be that inasmuch as mr montagu admit my past service he might have perceive that there must be something exceptionally bad in the government if a well-wisher like I could no longer give he affection to it it be simpler to insist on justice be do to the mussalman and to the punjab than to threaten I with punishment so that the injustice might be perpetuate indeed i fully expect it will be find that even in promote disaffection towards a unjust government i have render greater service to the empire than i be already credit with at the present moment however the duty of those who approve my activity be clear they ought on no account to resent the deprivation of my liberty should the government of indium deem it to be they duty to take it away a citizen have no right to resist such restriction impose in accordance with the law of the state to which he belong much less have those who sympathise with he in my case there can be no question of sympathy for i deliberately oppose the government to the extent of try to put its very existence in jeopardy for my supporter therefore it must be a moment of joy when i be imprison it mean the beginning of success if only the supporter continue the policy for which i stand if the government arrest I they would do so in order to stop the progress of non-co-operation which i preach it follow that if non-co-operation continue with unabated vigor even after my arrest the government must imprison other or grant the people 's wish in order to gain they co-operation any eruption of violence on the part of the people even under provocation would end in disaster whether therefore it be i or any one else who be arrest during the campaign the first condition of success be that there must be no resentment show against it we can not imperil the very existence of a government and quarrel with its attempt to save itself by punish those who place it in danger hijarat and its meaning indium be a continent its articulate thousand know what its inarticulate million be do or think the government and the educate indian may think that the khilafat movement be merely a pass phase the million of mussalman think otherwise the flight of the mussalman be grow apace the newspaper contain paragraph in out of the way corner inform the reader that a special train contain a barrister with sixty woman forty child include twenty suckling all tell 765 have leave for afghanistan they be cheer _ en route _ they be present with cash edibles and other thing and be join by more muhajarin on the way no fanatical preaching by shaukatalus can make people break up and leave they home for a unknown land there must be a abide faith in they that it be better for they to leave a state which have no regard for they religious sentiment and face a beggar 's life than to remain in it even though it may be in a princely manner nothing but pride of power can blind the government of indium to the scene that be be enact before it but there be yet another side to the movement here be the fact as state in the following government _ communique _ date 10th July 1920 : -- a unfortunate affair in connection with the mahajarin occur on the 8th instant at kacha garhi between peshawar and jamrud the follow be the fact as at present report two member of a party of the mahajarin proceed by train to jamrud be detect by the british military police travel without ticket altercation ensue at islamium college station but the train proceed to kacha garhi a attempt be make to evict these mahajarin whereupon the military police be attack by a crowd of some forty mahajarin and the british officer who intervene be seriously wound with a spade a detachment of indian troops at kacha garhus thereupon fire two or three shot at the mahajarin for make murderous assault on the british officer one mahajarin be kill and one wound and three arrest both the military and the police be injure the body of the mahajarin be despatch to peshawar and bury on the morning of the 9th this incident have cause considerable excitement in peshawar city and the khilafat hijrat committee be exercise restrain influence shop be close on the morning of the 9th a full enquiry have be institute now peshawar to jamrud be a matter of a few mile it be clearly the duty of the military not to attempt to pull out the ticketless mahajarin for the sake of a few anna but they actually attempt force intervention by the rest of the party be a foregone conclusion a altercation ensue a british officer be attack with a spade firing and a death of a mahajarin be the result have british prestige be enhance by the episode why have not the government put tactful officer in charge at the frontier whilst a great religious emigration be in progress the action of the military will pass from tongue to tongue throughout indium and the mussalman world around will not doubt be unconsciously and even consciously exaggerate in the passage and the feeling bitter as it already be will grow in bitterness the _ communique _ say that the government be make further inquiry let we hope that it will be full and that better arrangement will be make to prevent a repetition of what appear to have be a thoughtless act on the part of the military and may i draw the attention of those who be oppose non-co-operation that unless they find out a substitute they should either join the non-co-operation movement or prepare to face a disorganised subterranean upheaval whose effect no one can foresee and whose spread it would be impossible to check or regulate iii the punjab wrong political freemasonry freemasonry be a secret brotherhood which have more by its secret and iron rule than by its service to humanity obtain a hold upon some of the best mind similarly there seem to be some secret code of conduct govern the official class in indium before which the flower of the great british nation fall prostrate and unconsciously become instrument of injustice which as private individual they would be ashamed of perpetrate in no other way be it possible for one to understand the majority report of the hunter committee the despatch of the government of indium and the reply thereto of the secretary of state for indium in spite of the energetic protest of a section of the press to the personnel of the committee it might be say that on the whole the public be prepare to trust it especially as it contain three indian member who could fairly be claim to be independent the first rude shock to this confidence be deliver by the refusal of lord hunter 's committee to accept the very moderate and reasonable demand of the congress committee that the imprison punjab leader might be allow to appear before it to instruct counsel any doubt that might have be leave in the mind of any person have be dispel by the report of the majority of that committee the result have justify the attitude of the congress committee the evidence collect by it show what lord hunter 's committee purposely deny itself the minority report stand out like a oasis in a desert the indian member deserve the congratulation of they countryman for have dare to do they duty in the face of heavy odds i wish that they have refuse to associate themselves even in a modify manner with the condemnation of the civil disobedience form of satyagraha the defiant spirit of the delhus mob on the 30th march 1919 can hardly be use for condemn a great spiritual movement which be admittedly and manifestly intend to restrain the violent tendency of mob and to replace criminal lawlessness by civil disobedience of authority when it have forfeit all title to respect on the 30th march civil disobedience have not even be start almost every great popular demonstration have be hitherto attend all the world over by a certain amount of lawlessness the demonstration of 30th march and 6th April could have be hold under any other aegis we under that of satyagrah i hold that without the advent of the spirit of civility and orderliness the disobedience would have take a much more violent form than it do even at delhus it be only the wonderfully quick acceptance by the people of the principle of satyagrah that effectively check the spread of violence throughout the length and breadth of indium and even to-day it be not the memory of the black barbarity of general dyer that be keep the undoubted restlessness among the people from break forth into violence the hold that satyagrah have gain on the people -- it may be even against they will -- be curb the force of disorder and violence but i must not detain the reader on a defense of satyagrah against unjust attack if it have gain a foothold in indium it will survive much fiercer attack than the one make by the majority of the hunter committee and somewhat support by the minority have the majority report be defective only in this direction and correct in every other there would have be nothing but praise for it after all satyagrah be a new experiment in political field and a hasty attribute to it of any popular disorder would have be pardonable the universally pronounced adverse judgment upon the report and the despatch rest upon far more painful revelation look at the manifestly labored defense of every official act of inhumanity except where condemnation could not be avoid through the impudent admission make by the actor themselves look at the special plead introduce to defend general dyer even against himself look at the vain glorification of sir michael o'dwyer although it be he spirit that actuated every act of criminality on the part of the subordinate look at the deliberate refusal to examine he wild career before the event of April he act be a open book of which the committee ought to have take judicial notice instead of accept everything that the official have to say the committee 's obvious duty be to tax itself to find out the real cause of the disorder it ought to have go out of its way to search out the inwardness of the event instead of patiently go behind the hard crust of official document the committee allow itself to be guide with criminal laziness by mere official evidence the report and the despatch in my humble opinion constitute a attempt to condone official lawlessness the cautious and half-hearted condemnation pronounce upon general dyer 's massacre and the notorious crawl order only deepen the disappointment of the reader as he go through page after page of thinly disguise official whitewash i need however scarcely attempt any elaborate examination of the report or the despatch which have be so justly censure by the whole national press whether of the moderate or the extremist hue the point to consider be how to break down this secret -- be the secrecy over so unconscious -- conspiracy to uphold official iniquity a scandal of this magnitude can not be tolerate by the nation if it be to preserve its self-respect and become a free partner in the empire the all-india congress committee have resolve upon convene a special session of the congress for the purpose of consider among other thing the situation arise from the report in my opinion the time have arrive when we must cease to rely upon mere petition to parliament for effective action petition will have value when the nation have behind it the power to enforce its will what power then have we when we be firmly of opinion that grave wrong have be do we and when after a appeal to the highest authority we fail to secure redress there must be some power available to we for undoing the wrong it be true that in the vast majority of case it be the duty of a subject to submit to wrong on failure of the usual procedure so long as they do not affect he vital be but every nation and every individual have the right and it be they duty to rise against a intolerable wrong i do not believe in armed rising they be a remedy worse than the disease seek to be cure they be a token of the spirit of revenge and impatience and anger the method of violence can not do good in the long run witness the effect of the armed rising of the ally power against germany have they not become even like the german as the latter have be depict to we by they we have a better method unlike that of violence it certainly involve the exercise of restraint and patience : but it require also resoluteness of will this method be to refuse to be party to the wrong no tyrant have ever yet succeed in he purpose without carry the victim with he it may be as it often be by force most people choose rather to yield to the will of the tyrant than to suffer for the consequence of resistance hence do terrorism form part of the stock-in-trade of the tyrant but we have instance in history where terrorism have fail to impose the terrorist 's will upon he victim indium have the choice before she now if then the act of the punjab government be a insufferable wrong if the report of lord hunter 's committee and the two despatch be a greater wrong by reason of they grievous condonation of those act it be clear that we must refuse to submit to this official violence appeal the parliament by all means if necessary but if the parliament fail we and if we be worthy to call ourselves a nation we must refuse to uphold the government by withdraw co-operation from it the duty of the punjabee the allahabad _ leader _ deserve to be congratulate for publish the correspondence on mr bosworth smith who be one of the martial law officer against whom the complaint about persistent and continuous ill-treatment be among the bitterest it appear from the correspondence that mr bosworth smith have receive promotion instead of dismissal sometime before martial law mr smith appear to have be degrade he have since be restore say the _ leader _ correspondent to he position of a deputy commissioner of the second grade from which he be degrade and also be invest with power under section 30 of the criminal procedure code since he arrival the poor indian population of the town of amhalum cantonment have be live under a regime of horror and tyranny the correspondent add : i use both these word deliberately for convey precisely what they mean i cull a few passage from this illuminating letter to illustrate the meaning of horror and tyranny in private complaint he never take the statement of the complainant it be take down by the reader when the court rise and get sign by the magistrate the follow day whether the report receive -lrb- upon such complaint -rrb- be favourable to the complainant or unfavourable to he it be never ready by the magistrate and complaint be dismiss without proper trial this be the fate of private complaint now as regard police chellan pleader for the accuse be not allow to interview under trial prisoner in police custody they be not allow to cross-examine prosecution witness prosecution witness be examine with lead question thus a whole prosecution story be put into the mouth of police witness for the defense though call in be not allow to be examine by the defense counsel the accuse be silence if he pick up courage to say anything in defense any cantonment servant can write down the name of any citizen of the cantonment on a chit of paper and ask he to appear the next day in court this be a summons if any one do not appear in court who be thus order criminal warrant of arrest be issue against he there be much more of this style in the letter which be worth produce but i have give enough to illustrate the writer 's meaning let I turn for a while to this official 's record during martial law he be the official who try people in batch and convict they after a farcical trial witness have depose to he have assemble people have ask they to give false evidence have remove woman 's veil call they ` fly bitch she-ass ' and have spat upon they he it be who subject the innocent pleader of shokhupura indescribable persecution mr andrew personally investigate complaint against this official and come to the conclusion that no official have behave worse than mr smith he gather the people of shokhupura humiliate they in a variety of way call they ` suvarlog ' ` gandus mukkhus ' he evidence before the hunter commission betray he total disregard for truth and this be the officer who if the correspondent in question have give correct fact have be promote the question however be why he be at all in government service and why he have not be try for assault and abuse innocent man and woman i notice a desire for the impeachment of general dyer and sir michael o'dwyer i will not stop to examine whether the course be feasible i be sorry to find mr shastriar join this cry for the prosecution of general dyer if the english people will willingly do so i would welcome such prosecution as a sign of they strong disapproval of the jallianwallum bagh atrocity but i would certainly not spend a single farthing in a vain pursuit after the conviction of this man surely the public have receive sufficient experience of the english mind practically the whole english press have join the conspiracy to screen these offender against humanity i would not be party to make hero of they by join the cry for prosecution private or public if i can only persuade indium to insist upon they complete dismissal i should be satisfied but more than the dismissal of sir michael o'dwyer and general dyer be necessary the peremptory dismissal if not a trial of colonel o'brien mr bosworth smith raus shri ram and other mention in the congress sub-committee 's report bad as general dyer be i consider mr smith to be infinitely worse and he crime to be far more serious than the massacre of jallianwallum bugh general dyer sincerely believe that it be a soldierly act to terrorise people by shoot they but mr smith be wantonly cruel vulgar and debased if all the fact that have be depose to against he be true there be not a spark of humanity about he unlike general dyer he lack the courage to confirm what he have do and he wriggle when challenge this officer remain free to inflict himself upon people who have do no wrong to he and who be permit to disgrace the rule he represent for the time be what be the punjab do be it not the duty of the punjabi not to rest until they have secure the dismissal of mr smith and the like the punjab leader have be discharge in vain if they will not utilise the liberty they have receive in order to purge the administration of messr bosworth smith and company i be sure that if they will only begin a determine agitation they will have the whole indium by they side i venture to suggest to they that the best way to qualify for send general dyer to the gallows be to perform the easier and the more urgent duty of arrest the mischief still continue by the official against whom they have assist in collect overwhelming evidence general dyer the army council have find general dyer guilty of error of judgment and advise that he should not receive any office under the crown mr montagu have be unsparing in he criticism of general dyer 's conduct and yet somehow or other i can not help feeling that general dyer be by no mean the worst offender he brutality be unmistakable he abject and unsoldier-like cowardice be apparent in every line of he amazing defense before the army council he have call a unarmed crowd of man and child -- mostly holiday-maker -- ' a rebel army ' he believe himself to be the savior of the punjab in that he be able to shoot down like rabbit man who be pen in a inclosure such a man be unworthy of be consider a soldier there be no bravery in he action he run no risk he shoot without the slightest opposition and without warn this be not a ` error of judgement ' it be paralysis of it in the face of fancied danger it be proof of criminal incapacity and heartlessness but the fury that have be spend upon general dyer be i be sure largely misdirected no doubt the shooting be ` frightful ' the loss of innocent life deplorable but the slow torture degradation and emasculation that follow be much worse more calculated malicious and soul-killing and the actor who perform the deed deserve greater condemnation that general dyer for the jallianwallum bagh massacre the latter merely destroy a few body but the other try to kill the soul of a nation who ever talk of col frank johnson who be by far the worst offender he terrorise guiltless lahore and by he merciless order set the tone to the whole of the martial law officer but what i be concern with be not even col johnson the first business of the people of the punjab and of indium be to rid the service of col o'brien mr bosworth smith raus shri ram and mr malik khan they be still retain in the service they guilt be as much prove as that of general dyer we shall have fail in we duty if the condemnation pronounce upon general dyer produce a sense of satisfaction and the obvious duty of purge the administration in the punjab be neglect that task will not be perform by platform rhetoric or resolution merely stern action be require on out part if we be to make any headway with ourselves and make any impression upon the official that they be not to consider themselves as master of the people but as they trusty and servant who can not hold office if they misbehave themselves and prove unworthy of the trust repose in they the punjab sentence the commissioner appoint by the congress punjab sub committee have in they report accuse he excellency the viceroy of criminal want of imagination he excellency 's refusal to commute two death sentence out of five be a fine illustration of the accusation the rejection of the appeal by the privy council no more prove the guilt of the condemn than they innocence would have be prove by quash the proceedings before the martial law tribunal moreover these case clearly come under the royal proclamation in accordance with its interpretation by the punjab government the murder in amritsar be not due to any private quarrel between the murderer and they victim the offence grave though it be be purely political and commit under excitement more than full reparation have be take for the murder and arson in the circumstance commonsense dictate reduction of the death sentence the popular belief favor the view that the condemn man be innocent and have not have a fair trial the execution have be so long delay that hang at this stage would give a rude shock to indian society any viceroy with imagination would have at once announce commutation of the death sentence -- not so lord chelmsford in he estimation evidently the demand of justice will not be satisfy if at least some of the condemn man be not hang public feeling with he count for nothing we shall still hope that either the viceroy or mr montagu will commute the death sentence but if the government will grievously err if they carry out the sentence the people will equally err if they give way to anger or grief over the hang if it have unfortunately to take plane before we become a nation possess a effective voice in the council of nation we must be prepare to contemplate with equanimity not a thousand murder of innocent man and woman but many thousand before we attain a status in the world that shall not be surpass by any nation we hope therefore that all concern will take rather than lose heart and treat hang as a ordinary affair of life -lrb- since the above be in type we have receive cruel news at last he the viceroy have mercilessly give the rude shock to indian society it be now for the latter to take heart in spite of the unkindest cut -- ed yus -rrb- iv swaraj swaraj in one year much laughter have be indulge in at my expense for have tell the congress audience at calcutta that if there be sufficient response to my program of non-co-operation swaraj would be attain in one year some have ignore my condition and laugh because of the impossibility of get swaraj anyhow within one year other have spell the ` if ' in capital and suggest that if ` if ' be permissible in argument any absurdity could be prove to be a possibility my proposition however be base on a mathematical calculation and i venture to say that true swaraj be a practical impossibility without due fulfilment of my condition swaraj mean a state such that we can maintain we separate existence without the presence of the english if it be to be a partnership it must be partnership at will there can be no swaraj without we feeling and be the equal of englishman to-day we feel that we be dependent upon they for we internal and external security for a armed peace between the hindu and the mussulman for we education and for the supply of daily want nay even for the settlement of we religious squabble the raja be dependent upon the british for they power and the millionaire for they million the british know we helplessness and sir thoma holland crack joke quite legitimately at the expense of non-co-operationist to get swaraj then be to get rid of we helplessness the problem be no doubt stupendous even as it be for the fabled lion who have be bring up in the company of goat find it impossible to feel that he be a lion as tolstoy use to put it mankind often labor under hypnotism under its spell continuously we feel the feeling of helplessness the british themselves can not be expect to help we out of it on the contrary they din into we ear that we shall be fit to govern ourselves only by slow educative process the time suggest that if we boycott the council we shall lose the opportunity of a training in swaraj i have no doubt that there be many who believe what the time say it even resort to a falsehood it audaciously say that lord milner 's mission listen to the egyptian only when they be ready to lift the boycott of the egyptian council for I the only training in swaraj we need be the ability to defend ourselves against the whole world and to live we natural life in perfect freedom even though it may be full of defect good government be no substitute for self-government the afghan have a bad government but it be self-government i envy they the japanese learn the art through a sea of blood and if we to-day have the power to drive out the english by superior brute force we would be count they superior and in spite of we inexperience in debate at the council table or in hold executive office we would be hold fit to govern ourselves for brute force be the only test the west have hitherto recognize the german be defeat not because they be necessarily in the wrong but because the ally power be find to possess greater brute strength in the end therefore indium must either learn the art of war which the british will not teach she or she must follow she own way of discipline and self-sacrifice through non-co-operation it be as amazing as it be humiliating that less than one hundred-thousand white man should be able to rule three hundred and fifteen million indian they do so somewhat undoubtedly by force but more by secure we co-operation in a thousand way and make we more and more helpless and dependent on they as time go forward let we not mistake reform council more lawcourt and even governorship for real freedom or power they be but subtler method of emasculation the british can not rule we by mere force and so they resort to all means honorable and dishonourable in order to retain they hold on indium they want indium 's billion and they want indium 's man power for they imperialistic greed if we refuse to supply they with man and money we achieve we goal namely swaraj equality manliness the cup of we humiliation be fill during the closing scene in the viceregal council mr shustrus could not move he resolution on the punjab the indian victim of jullianwalum receive r 1250 the english victim of mob-frenzy receive lakh the official who be guilty of crime against those whose servant they be be reprimand and the councillor be satisfy if indium be powerful indium would not have stand this addition of insult to she injury i do not blame the british if we be weak in number as they be we too would perhaps have resort to the same method as they be now employ terrorism and deception be weapon not of the strong but of the weak the british be weak in number we be weak in spite of we number the result be that each be drag the other down it be common experience that englishmen lose in character after residence in indium and that indian lose in courage and manliness by contact with englishman this process of weakening be good neither for we two nation nor for the world but if we indian take care of ourselves the english and the rest of the world would take care of themselves we contribution to the world 's progress must therefore consist in set we own house in order training in arm for the present be out of the question i go a step further and believe that indium have a better mission for the world it be within she to show that she can achieve she destiny by pure self-sacrifice ie self-purification this can be do only by non-co-operation and non-co-operation be possible only when those who commence to co-operate be the process of withdrawal if we can but free ourselves from the threefold _ maya _ of government-controlled school government law-court and legislative council and truly control we own education regulate we dispute and be indifferent to they legislation we be ready to govern ourselves and we be only then ready to ask the government servant whether civil or military to resign and the tax-payer to suspend payment of tax and be it such a impracticable proposition to expect parent to withdraw they child from school and college and establish they own institution or to ask lawyer to suspend they practice and devote they whole time attention to national service against payment where necessary of they maintenance or to ask candidate for council not to enter council and lend they passive or active assistance to the legislative machinery through which all control be exercise the movement of non-co-operation be nothing but a attempt to isolate the brute force of the british from all the trappings under which it be hide and to show that brute force by itself can not for one single moment hold indium but i frankly confess that until the three condition mention by I be fulfil there be no swaraj we may not go on take we college degree take thousand of rupee monthly from client for case which can be finish in five minute and take the keenest delight in waste national time on the council floor and still expect to gain national self-respect the last though not the least important part of the maya still remain to be consider that be swadeshus have we not abandon swadeshus we need not have be in the present fallen state if we would get rid of the economic slavery we must manufacture we own cloth and at the present moment only by hand-spinning and hand weave all this mean discipline self-denial self-sacrifice organise ability confidence and courage if we show this in one year among the class that to-day count and make public opinion we certainly gain swaraj within one year if i be tell that even we who lead have not these quality in we there certainly will never be swaraj for indium but then we shall have no right to blame the english for what they be do we salvation and its time be solely dependent upon we british rule -- a evil the _ interpreter _ be however more to the point in ask do mr gandhus hold without hesitation or reserve that british rule in indium be altogether a evil and that the people of indium be to be teach so to regard it he must hold it to be so evil that the wrong it do outweigh the benefit it confer for only so be non-co-operation to be justify at the bar of conscience or of christ my answer be emphatically in the affirmative so long as i believe that the sum total of the energy of the british empire be good i clung to it despite what i use to regard as temporary aberration i be not sorry for have do so but have my eye open it would be sin for I to associate myself with the empire unless it purge itself of its evil character i write this with sorrow and i should be please if i discover that i be in error and that my present attitude be a reaction the continuous financial drain the emasculation of the punjab and the betrayal of the muslim sentiment constitute in my humble opinion a threefold robbery of indium ` the blessing of _ pax britanica _ ' i reckon therefore to be a curse we would have at least remain like the other nation brave man and woman instead of feeling as we do so utterly helpless if we have no british rule impose on we a armed peace ` the blessing ' of road and railway be a return no self-respecting nation would accept for its degradation ` the blessing ' of education be prove one of the greatest obstacle in we progress towards freedom a movement of purification the fact be that non-co-operation by reason of its non-violence have become a religious and purifying movement it be daily bring strength to the nation show it its weak spot and the remedy for remove they it be a movement of self-reliance it be the mightiest force for revolutionise opinion and stimulate think it be a movement of self-imposed suffering and therefore possess automatic check against extravagance or impatience the capacity of the nation for suffer regulate its advance towards freedom it isolate the force of evil by refrain from participation in it in any shape or form why be indium lose -lrb- a dialog between the reader and editor -- _ indian home rule _ -rrb- reader : you have say much about civilisation -- enough to make I ponder over it i do not know what i should adopt and what i should avoid from the nation of europe but one question come to my lip immediately if civilisation be a disease and if it have attack england why have she be able to take indium and why be she able to retain it editor : you question be not very difficult to answer and we shall presently be able to examine the true nature of swaraj for i be aware that i have still to answer that question i will however take up you previous question the english have not take indium we have give it to they they be not in indium because of they strength but because we keep they let we now see whether these position can be sustain they come to we country originally for the purpose of trade recall the company bahadur who make it bahadur they have not the slightest intention at the time of establish a kingdom who assist the company 's officer who be tempt at the sight of they silver who buy they goods history testify that we do all this in order to become rich all at once we welcome the company 's officer with open arm we assist they if i be in the habit of drinking bhang and a seller thereof sell it to I be i to blame he or myself by blame the seller shall i be able to avoid the habit and if a particular retailer be drive away will not another take he place a true servant of indium will have to go to the root of the matter if a excess of food have cause I indigestion i will certainly not avoid it by blame water he be a true physician who probe the cause of disease and if you pose as a physician for the disease of indium you will have to find out its true cause reader : you be right now i think you will not have to argue much with I to drive you conclusion home i be impatient to know you further view we be now on a most interesting topic i shall therefore endeavor to follow you thought and stop you when i be in doubt editor : i be afraid that in spite of you enthusiasm as we proceed further we shall have difference of opinion nevertheless i shall argue only when you will stop I we have already see that the english merchant be able to get a footing in indium because we encourage they when we prince fight among themselves they seek the assistance of company bahadar that corporation be verse alike in commerce and war it be unhamper by question of morality its object be to increase its commerce and to make money it accept we assistance and increase the number of its warehouse to protect the latter it employ a army which be utilise by we also be it not then useless to blame the english for what we do at that time the hindu and the mahomedan be at dagger draw this too give the company its opportunity and thus we create the circumstance that give the company its control over indium hence it be truer to say that we give indium to the english than that indium be lose reader : will you now tell I how they be able to retain indium editor : the cause that give they india enable they to retain it some englishmen state that they take and they hold indium by the sword both these statement be wrong the sword be entirely useless for hold indium we alone keep they napoleon be say to have describe the english as a nation of shop keeper it be a fitting description they hold whatever dominion they have for the sake of they commerce they army and they navy be intend to protect it when the transvaal offer no such attraction the late mr gladstone discover that it be no right for the english to hold it when it become a pay proposition resistance lead to war mr chamberlain soon discover that england enjoy a suzerainty over the transvaal it be related that some one ask the late president kruger whether there be gold in the moon he reply that it be highly unlikely because if there be the english would have annex it many problem can be solve by remember that money be they god then it follow that we keep the english in indium for we base self-interest we like they commerce they please we by they subtle method and get what they want from we to blame they for this be to perpetuate they power we further strengthen they hold by quarrel amongst ourselves if you accept the above statement it be prove that the english enter indium for the purpose of trade they remain in it for the same purpose and we help they to do so they arm and ammunition be perfectly useless in this connection i remind you that it be the british flag which be wave in japan and not the japanese the english have a treaty with japan for the sake of they commerce and you will see that if they can manage it they commerce will greatly expand in that country they wish to convert the whole word into a vast market for they goods that they can not do so be true but the blame will not be theirs they will leave no stone unturn to reach the goal swaraj my ideal the follow be a fairly full report of mr gandhus 's important speech at calcutta on the 13th December 1920 : -- the very fact that so many of you can not understand hindus which be bind to be the national medium of expression throughout hindustan in gathering of indian belong to different part of the land show the depth of the degradation to which we have sink and point to the supreme necessity of the non-co-operation movement which be intend to lift we out of that condition this government have be instrumental in degrade this great nation in various way and it be impossible to be free from it without co-operation amongst ourselves which be in turn impossible without a national medium of expression but i be not here to day to plead for the medium i be to plead for the acceptance by the country of the program of non-violent progressive non-co-operation now all the word that i have use here be absolutely necessary and the two adjective ` progressive ' and ` non-violent ' be integral part of a whole with I non-violence be part of my religion a matter of creed but with the great number of mussalman non-violence be a policy with thousand if not million of hindu it be equally a matter of policy but whether it be a creed or a policy it be utterly impossible for you to finish the program for the enfranchisement of the million of indium without recognize the necessity and the value of non-violence violence may for a moment avail to secure a certain measure of success but it could not in the long run achieve any appreciable result on the other hand all violence would prove destructive to the honor and self-respect of the nation the blue book issue by the government of indium show that inasmuch as we have use violence military expenditure have go up not proportionately but in geometrical progression the bond of we slavery have be forge all the stronger for we have offer violence and the whole history of british rule in indium be a demonstration of the fact that we have never be able to offer successful violence whilst therefore i say that rather than have the yoke of a government that have so emasculated we i would welcome violence i would urge with all the emphasis that i can command that indium will never be able to regain she own by method of violence lord ronaldshay who have do I the honor of read my booklet on home rule have warn my countryman against engage themselves in a struggle for a swaraj such as be describe in that booklet now though i do not want to withdraw a single word of it i would say to you on this occasion that i do not ask indium to follow out to-day the method prescribe in my booklet if they could do that they would have home rule not in a year but in a day and indium by realize that ideal want to acquire a ascendancy over the rest of the world but it must remain a day dream more or less for the time be what i be do to-day be that i be give the country a pardonable program not the abolition of law court post telegraph and of railway but for the attainment of parliamentary swarja i be tell you to do that so long as we do not isolate ourselves from this government we be co-operate with it through school law court and council through service civil and military and payment of tax and foreign trade the moment this fact be realize and non-co-operation be effect this government must totter to piece if i know that the mass be prepare for the whole program at once i would not delay in put it at once to work it be not possible at the present moment to prevent the mass from burst out into wrath against those who come to execute the law it be not possible that the military would lay down they arm without the slightest violence if that be possible to-day i would propose all the stage of non-co-operation to be work simultaneously but we have not secure that control over the mass we have uselessly fritter away precious year of the nation 's life in master a language which we need least for win we liberty we have fritter away all those year in learn liberty from milton and shakespeare in derive inspiration from the page of mill whilst liberty could be learn at we door we have thus succeed in isolate ourselves from the mass : we have be westernise we have fail these 35 year to utilise we education in order to permeate the mass we have sit upon the pedestal and from there deliver harangue to they in a language they do not understand and we see to-day that we be unable to conduct large gathering in a disciplined manner and discipline be the essence of success here be therefore one reason why i have introduce the word ` progressive ' in the non-co-operation resolution without any impertinence i may say that i understand the mass mind better than any one amongst the educate indian i contend that the mass be not ready for suspension of payment of tax they have not yet learn sufficient self-control if i be sure of non-violence on they part i would ask they to suspend payment to-day and not waste a single moment of the nation time with I the liberty of indium have become a passion liberty of islam be as dear to I i would not therefore delay a moment if i find that the whole of the program could be enforce at once it grieve I to miss the face of dear and revere leader in this assembly we miss here the trumpet voice of surendranath banorjus who have render inestimable service to the country and though we stand as pole asunder to-day though we may have sharp difference with he we must express they with become restraint i do not ask you to give up a single iota of principle i urge non-violence in language and in deed if non-violence be essential in we dealings with government it be more essential in we dealings with we leader and it grieve I deeply to hear of recent instance of violence report to have be use in east bongal against we own people i be pained to hear that the ear of a man who have vote at the recent election have be cut and night soil have be throw into the bed of a man who have stand as a candidate non-co-operation be never go to succeed in this way it will not succeed unless we create a atmosphere of perfect freedom unless we prize we opponent liberty as much as we own the liberty of faith conscience thought and action which we claim for ourselves must be concede equally to other non co-operation be a process of purification and we must continually try to touch the heart of those who differ from we they mind and they emotion but never they body discipline and restraint be the cardinal principle of we conduct and i warn you against any sort of tyrannical social ostracism i be deeply grieved therefore to hear of the insult offer to a dead body in delhus and feel that if it be the action of non-co-operator they have disgrace themselves and they creed i repeat we can not deliver we land through violence it be not a joke when i say on the congress platform that swaraj could be establish in one year if there be sufficient response from the nation three month of this year be go if we be true to we salt true to we nation true to the song we sing if we be true to the bhagwad gita and the koran we would finish the program in the remain nine month and deliver islam the punjab and indium i have propose a limited program workable within one year have a special regard to the educate class we seem to be labor under the illusion that we can not possibly live without council law court and school provide by the government the moment we be disillusion we have swaraj it be demoralise both for government and the govern that a hundred thousand pilgrim should dictate term to a nation compose of three hundred million and how be it they can thus dictate term it be because we have be divide and they have rule i have never forget hume ' frank confession that the british government be sustain by the policy of divide and rule therefore it be that i have lay stress upon hindu muslim unity as one of the important essential for the success of non-co-operation but it should be no lip unity nor bunium unity it should be a unity broad base on a recognition of the heart if we want to save hinduism i say for god sake do not seek to bargain with the mussalman i have be go about with maulana shaukat alus all these month but i have not so much as whisper anything about the protection of the cow my alliance with the alus brother be one of honor i feel that i be on my honor the whole of hinduism be on its honor and if it will not be find want it will do its duty towards the mussalman of indium any bargaining would be degrade to we light bring light not darkness and nobility do with a noble purpose will be twice reward it will be god alone who can protect the cow ask I not to-day -- ` what about the cow ' ask I after islam be vindicate through indium ask the raja what they do to entertain they english guest do they not provide beef and champagne for they guest persuade they first to stop cow killing and then think of bargaining with mussalman and how be we hindu behave ourselves towards the cow and she progeny do we treat she as we religion require we not till we have set we own house in order and save the cow from the englishman have we the right to plead on she behalf with the mussalman and the best way of save the cow from they be to give they unconditional help in they hour of trouble similarly what do we owe the punjab the whole of indium be make to crawl on she belly in as much as a single punjabus be make to crawl in that dirty lane in amritsar the whole womanhood of indium be unveil in as much as the innocent woman of manianwallum be unveil by a insolent office and indian childhood be dishonour in that that school child of tender age be make to walk four time a day to state place within the martial area in the punjab and to salute the union jack through the effect of which order two child seven year old die of sunstroke have be make to wait in the noonday sun in my opinion it be a sin to attend the school and college conduct under the aegis of this government so long as it have not purge itself of these crime by proper repentance we may not with any sense of self-respect plead before the court of the government when we remember that it be through the punjab court that innocent man be sentence to be imprison and hang we become participator in the crime of the government by voluntarily help it or be help by it the woman of indium have intuitively understand the spiritual nature of the struggle thousand have attend to listen to the message of non-violent non-co-operation and have give I they precious ornament for the purpose of advance the cause of swaraj be it any wonder if i believe the possibility of gain swaraj within a year after all these wonderful demonstration i would be guilty of want of faith in god if i under-rated the significance of the response from the woman of indium i hope that the student will do they duty the country certainly expect the lawyer who have hitherto lead public agitation to recognize the new awakening i have use strong language but i have do so with the greatest deliberation i be not actuate by any feeling of revenge i do not consider englishman as my enemy i recognize the worth of many i enjoy the privilege of have many english friend but i be a determine enemy of the english rule as be conduct at present and if the power -- tapasya -- of one man could destroy it i would certainly destroy it if it could not be mend a empire that stand for injustice and breach of faith do not deserve to stand if its custodian will not repent and non-co-operation have be devise in order to enable the nation to compel justice i hope that bengal will take she proper place in this movement of self-purification bengal begin swadeshus and national education when the rest of indium be sleep i hope that bengal will come to the front in this movement for gain swaraj and gain justice for the khilafat and the punjab through purification and self-sacrifice on the wrong track lord ronaldshay have be do I the favor of read my booklet on indian home rule which be a translation of hind swaraj he lordship tell he audience that if swaraj mean what i have describe it to be in the booklet the bengalis would have none of it i be sorry that swaraj of the congress resolution do not mean the swaraj depict in the booklet swaraj accord to the congress mean swaraj that the people of indium want not what the british government may condescend to give in so far as i can see swaraj will be a parliament choose by the people with the fullest power over the finance the police the military the navy the court and the educational institution i be free to confess that the swaraj i expect to gain within one year if indium respond will be such swaraj as will make practically impossible the repetition of the khilafat and the punjab wrong and will enable the nation to do good or evil as it choose and not he ` good ' at the dictation of a irresponsible insolent and godless bureaucracy under that swaraj the nation will have the power to impose a heavy protective tariff on such foreign goods as be capable of be manufacture in indium as also the power to refuse to send a single soldier outside indium for the purpose of enslave the surround or remote nationality the swaraj that i dream of will be a possibility only when the nation be free to make its choice both of good and evil \* \* \* \* \* i adhere to all i have say in that booklet and i would certainly recommend it to the reader government over self be the truest swaraj it be synonymous with _ moksha _ or salvation and i have see nothing to alter the view that doctor lawyer and railway be no help and be often a hindrance to the one thing worth strive after but i know that association a satanic activity such as the government be engage in make even a effort for such freedom a practical impossibility i can not tender allegiance to god and satan at the same time \* \* \* \* \* the surest sign of the satanic nature of the present system be that even a nobleman of the type of lord ronaldshay be oblige to put we off the track he will not deal with the one thing needful why be he silent about the punjab why do he evade the khilafat can ointment soothe a patient who be suffer from corrode consumption do he lordship not see that it be not the inadequacy of the reform that have set indium aflame but that it be the infliction of the two wrong and the wicked attempt to make we forget they do he not see that a complete change of heart be require before reconciliation \* \* \* \* \* but it have become the fashion nowadays to ascribe hatred to non-co-operationism and i regret to find that even col wedgewood have fall into the trap i make bold to say that the only way to remove hatred be to give it disciplined vent no man can -- i can not -- perform the impossible task of remove hatred so long as contempt and despise for the feeling of indium be sedulously nurse it be a mockery to ask indium not to hate when in the same breath indium 's most sacred feeling be contemptuously brush aside indium feel weak and helpless and so express she helplessness by hate the tyrant who despise she and make she crawl on the belly lift the veil of she innocent woman and compel she tender child to acknowledge he power by salute he flag four time a day the gospel of non-co-operation address itself to the task of make the people strong and self-reliant it be a attempt to transform hatred into pity a strong and self-reliant indium will cease to hate bosworth smith and frank johnson for she will have the power to punish they and therefore the power also to pity and forgive they to-day she can neither punish nor forgive and therefore helplessly nurse hatred if the mussalman be strong they would not hate the english but would fight and wrest from they the dearest possession of islam i know that the alus brother who live only for the honor and the prestige of islam and be prepare any moment to die for it will to-day make friend with the latter englishman if they be to do justice to the khilafat which it be in they power to do \* \* \* \* \* i be positively certain that there be no personal element in this fight both the hindu and the mahomedan would to-day invoke blessing on the english if they would but give proof positive of they goodness faithfulness and loyalty to india non-co-operation then be a godsend it will purify and strengthen indium and a strong indium will be a strength to the world as a indian weak and helpless be a curse to mankind indian soldier have involuntarily help to destroy turkey and be now destroy the flower of the arabian nation i can not recall a single campaign in which the indian soldier have be employ by the british government for the good of mankind and yet -lrb- oh the shame of it -rrb- indian maharaja be never tire of pride themselves on the loyal help they have render the english could degradation sink any lower the congress constitution the belated report of the congress constitution committee have now be publish for general information and opinion have be invite from all public body in order to assist the deliberation of the all indium congress committee it be a pity that small though the constitution committee be all the member never meet at any one time in spite of effort to have a meeting of they all it be perhaps no body 's fault that all the member could not meet at the same time the draft report have pass through the search examination of all but one member and the report represent the mature deliberation of four out of the five member it must be state at the same time that it do not pretend to be the unanimous opinion of the member rather than present a dissent minute a workable scheme have be bring out leave each member free to press he own view on the several matter in which they be not quite unanimous the most important part of the constitution however be the alteration of the creed so far as i be aware there be no fundamental difference of opinion between the member in my opinion the altered creed represent the exact feeling of the country at the present moment i know that the propose alteration have be subject to hostile criticism in several newspaper of note but the extraordinary situation that face the country be that popular opinion be far in advance of several newspaper which have hitherto command influence and have undoubtedly mould public opinion the fact be that the formation of opinion to-day be by no means confine to the educate class but the mass have take it upon themselves not only to formulate opinion but to enforce it it would be a mistake to belittle or ignore this opinion or to ascribe it to a temporary upheaval it would be equally a mistake to suppose that this awaken amongst the mass be due either to the activity of the alus brother or myself for the time be we have the ear of the mass because we voice they sentiment the mass be by no means so foolish or unintelligent as we sometimes imagine they often perceive thing with they intuition which we ourselves fail to see with we intellect but whilst the mass know what they want they often do not know how to express they want and less often how to get what they want herein come the use of leadership and disastrous result can easily follow a bad hasty or what be worse selfish lead the first part of the propose creed express the present desire of the nation and the second show the way that desire can be fulfil in my humble opinion the congress creed with the propose alteration be but a extension of the original and so long as no break with the british connection be attempt it be strictly within even the exist article that define the congress creed the extension lie in the contemplated possibility of a break with the british connection in my humble opinion if indium be to make unhampered progress we must make it clear to the british people that whilst we desire to retain the british connection if we can rise to we full height with it we be determine to dispense with and even to get rid of that connection if that be necessary for full national development i hold that it be not only derogatory to national dignity but it actually impede national progress superstitiously to believe that we progress towards we goal be impossible without british connection it be this superstition which make some of the best of we tolerate the punjab wrong and the khilafat insult this blind adherence to that connection make we feel helpless the propose alteration in the creed enable we to rid ourselves of we helpless condition i personally hold that it be perfectly constitutional openly to strive after independence but lest there may be dispute as to the constitutional character of any movement for complete independence the doubtful and highly technical adjective constitutional have be remove from the altered creed in the draft surely it should be enough to ensure that the method for achieve we end be legitimate honorable and peaceful i believe that this be the reasoning that guide my colleague in accept the propose creed in any case such be certainly my view of the whole alteration there be no desire on my part to adopt any means that be subversive of law and order i know however that i be tread on delicate ground when i write about law and order for to some of we distinguished leader even my present method appear to be lawless and conducive to disorder but even they will perhaps grant that the retention of the word ` constitutional ' can not protect the country against method such as i be employ it give rise no doubt to a luminous legal discussion but any such discussion be fruitless when the nation mean business the other important alteration refer to the limitation of the number of delegate i believe that the advantage of such a limitation be obvious we be fast reach a time when without any such limitation the congress will become a unwieldy body it be difficult even to have a unlimited number of visitor it be impossible to transact national business if we have a unlimited number of delegate the next important alteration be about the election of the member of the all-india congress committee make that committee practically the subject committee and the redistribution of indium for the purpose of the congress on a linguistic basis it be not necessary to comment on these alteration but i wish to add that if the congress accept the principle of limit the number of delegate it would be advisable to introduce the principle of proportional representation that would enable all party who wish to be represent at the congress i observe that _ the servant of indium _ see a inconsistency between my imply acceptance of the british committee so far as the publish draft constitution be concerned and my recent article in _ young indium _ on that committee and the newspaper _ indium _ but it be well know that for several year i have hold my present view about the existence of that body it would have be irrelevant for I perhaps to suggest to my colleague the extinction of that committee it be not we function to report on the usefulness or otherwise of the committee we be commission only for prepare a new constitution moreover i know that my colleague be not averse to the existence of the british committee and the draw up of a new constitution enable I to show that where there be no question of principle i be desirous of agree quickly with my opponent in opinion but i propose certainly to press for abolition of the committee as it be at present continued and the stop of its organ _ indium _ swaraj in nine month ask by the _ time _ representative as to he impression form as a result of he activity during the last three month mr gandhus say : -- my own impression of these three month ' extensive experience be that this movement of non-co-operation have come to stay and it be most decidedly a purify movement in spite of isolate instance of rowdyism as for instance at mr besant 's meeting in bombay at some place in delhus bengal and even in gujarat the people be assimilate day after day the spirit of non-violence not necessarily as a creed but as a inevitable policy i expect most startling result more startling than say the discovery of sir jc bose or the acceptance by the people of non-violence if the government could be assure beyond any possibility of doubt that no violence would ever be offer by we the government would from that moment alter its character unconsciously and involuntarily but nonetheless surely on that account alter its character -- in what direction ask the _ time _ representative certainly in the direction which we ask it should move -- that be in the direction of government become responsive to every call of the nation will you kindly explain further ask the representative by that i mean say mr gandhus people will be able by assert themselves through fix determination and self-sacrifice to gain the redress of the khilafat wrong the punjab wrong and attain the swaraj of they choice but what be you swaraj and where do the government come in there -- the government which you say will alter its character unconsciously my swaraj say mr gandhus be the parliamentary government of indium in the modern sense of the term for the time be and that government would be secure to we either through the friendly office of the british people or without they what do you mean by the phrase ` without they ' question the interviewer this movement continue mr gandhus be a endeavor to purge the present government of selfishness and greed which determine almost every one of they activity suppose that we have make it impossible by disassociation from they to feed they greed they might not wish to remain in indium as happen in the case of somaliland where the moment its administration cease to be a pay proposition they evacuate it how do you think query the representative in practice this will work out what i have sketch before you say mr gandhus be the final possibility what i expect be that nothing of that kind will happen in so far as i understand the british people i will recognize the force of public opinion when it have become real and patent then and only then will they realize the hideous injustice which in they name the imperial minister and they representative in indium have perpetrate they will therefore remedy the two wrong in accordance with the wish of the people and they will also offer a constitution exactly in accordance with the wish of the people of indium as represent by they choose leader suppose that the british government wish to retire because indium be not a pay concern what do you think will then be the position of indium mr gandhus answer : at that stage surely it be easy to understand that indium will then have evolve either outstanding spiritual height or the ability to offer violence against violence she will have evolve a organising ability of a high order and will therefore be in every way able to cope with any emergency that might arise in other word observe the _ time _ representative you expect the moment of the british evacuation if such a contingency arise will coincide with the moment of indium 's preparedness and ability and condition favourable for indium to take over the indian administration as a go concern and work it for the benefit and advancement of the nation mr gandhus answer the question with a emphatic affirmative my experience during the last month fill I with the hope continue mr gandhus that within the nine month that remain of the year in which i have expect swaraj for indium we shall redress the two wrong and we shall see swaraj establish in accordance with the wish of the people of indium where will the present government be at the end of the nine month ask the _ time _ representative mr gandhus with a significant smile say : the lion will then lie with the lamb _ young indium December 1920 _ the attainment of swaraj mr gandhus in move he resolution on the creed before the congress say the resolution which i have the honor to move be as follow : the object of the indian national congress be the attainment of swarajya by the people of indium by all legitimate and peaceful means there be only two kind of objection so far as i understand that will be advance from this platform one be that we may not to-day think of dissolve the british connection what i say be that it be derogatory to national dignity to think of permanence of british connection at any cost we be labor under a grievous wrong which it be the personal duty of every indian to get redress this british government not only refuse to redress the wrong but it refuse to acknowledge _ its _ mistake and so long as it retain its attitude it be not possible for we to say all that we want to be or all that we want to get retain british connection no matter what difficulty be in we path we must make the clearest possible declaration to the world and to the whole of indium that we may not possibly have british connection if the british people will not do this elementary justice i do not for one moment suggest that we want to end at the british connection at all cost unconditionally if the british connection be for the advancement of indium we do not want to destroy it but if it be inconsistent with we national self respect then it be we bounden duty to destroy it there be room in this resolution for both -- those who believe that by retain british connection we can purify ourselves and purify british people and those who have no belief as for instance take the extreme case of mr andrew he say all hope for indium be go for keep the british connection he say there must be complete severance -- complete independence there be room enough in this creed for a man like mr andrew also take another illustration a man like myself or my brother shaukat alus there be certainly no room for we if we have eternally to subscribe to the doctrine whether these wrong be redress or not we shall have to evolve ourselves within the british empire there be no room for I in that creed therefore this creed be elastic enough to take in both shades of opinion and the british people will have to beware that if they do not want to do justice it will be the bounden duty of every indian to destroy the empire i want just now to wind up my remark with a personal appeal draw you attention to a object lesson that be present in the bengal camp yesterday if you want swaraj you have get a demonstration of how to get swaraj there be a little bit of skirmish a little bit of squabble and a little bit of difference in the bengal camp as there will always be difference so long as the world last i have know difference between husband and wife because i be still a husband i have notice difference between parent and child because i be still a father of four boy and they be all strong enough to destroy they father so far as bodily struggle be concerned i possess that varied experience of husband and parent i know that we shall always have squabble we shall always have difference but the lesson that i want to draw you attention to be that i have the honor and privilege of address both the party they give I they undivided attention and what be more they show they attachment they affection and they fellowship for I by accept the humble advice that i have the honor of tender to they and i tell they i be not here to distribute justice that can be award only through we worthy president but i ask you not to go to the president you need not worry he if you be strong if you be brave if you be intent upon get swaraj and if you really want to revise the creed then you will bottle up you rage you will bottle up all the feeling of injustice that may rankle in you heart and forget these thing here under this very roof and i tell they to forget they difference to forget the wrong i do not want to tell you or go into the history of that incident probably most of you know i simply want to invite you attention to the fact i do not say they have settle up they difference i hope they have but i do know that they undertake to forget the difference they undertake not to worry the president they undertake not to make any demonstration here or in the subject committee all honor to those who listen to that advice i only want my bengali friend and all the other friend who have come to this great assembly with a fix determination to seek nothing but the settlement of they country to seek nothing but the advancement of they respective rights to seek nothing but the conservation of the national honor i appeal to every one of you to copy the example set by those who feel aggrieved and who feel that they head be break i know before we have do with this great battle on which we have embark at the special session of the congress we have to go probably possibly through a sea of blood but let it not be say of we or any one of we that we be guilty of shed blood but let it be say by generation yet to be bear that we suffer that we shed not somebody 's blood but we own and so i have no hesitation in say that i do not want to show much sympathy for those who have they head break or who be say to be even in danger of lose they life what do it matter it be much better to die at the hand at least of we own countryman what be there to revenge ourselves about or upon so i ask everyone of you that if at any time there be blood-boiling within you against some fellow countryman of yours even though he may be in the employ of government though he may be in the secret service you will take care not to be offend and not to return blow for blow understand that the very moment you return the blow from the detective you cause be lose this be you non-violent campaign and so i ask everyone of you not to retaliate but to bottle up all you rage to dismiss you rage from you and you will rise graver man i be here to congratulate those who have restrain themselves from go to the president and bring the dispute before he therefore i appeal to those who feel aggrieved to feel that they have do the right thing in forget it and if they have not forget i ask they to try to forget the thing and that be the object lesson to which i want to draw you attention if you want to carry this resolution do not carry this resolution only by a acclamation for this resolution but i want you to accompany the carry out of this resolution with a faith and resolve which nothing on earth can move that you be intent upon get swaraj at the earliest possible moment and that you be intent upon get swaraj by means that be legitimate that be honorable and by means that be non-violent that be peaceful you have resolve upon so far you can say to-day we can not give battle to this government by means of steel but we can give battle by exercise what i have so often call soul force and soul force be not the prerogative of one man of a sanyasus or even a so-called saint soul force be the prerogative of every human be female or male and therefore i ask my countryman if they want to accept this resolution to accept it with that firm determination and to understand that it be inaugurate under such good and favourable auspices as i have describe to you in my humble opinion the congress will have do the rightest thing if it unanimously adopt this resolution may god grant that you will pass this resolution unanimously may god grant that you will also have the courage and the ability to carry out the resolution and that within one year v hindu moslem unity -lrb- a dialogue between editor and reader on the hindu-moslem unity -- _ indian home rule _ -rrb- the hindu and the mahomedan editor : you last question be a serious one and yet on careful consideration it will be find to be easy of solution the question arise because of the presence of the railway of the lawyer and of the doctor we shall presently examine the last two we have already consider the railway i should however like to add that man be so make by nature as to require he to restrict he movement as far as he hand and foot will take he if we do not rush about from place to place by means of railway such other maddening convenience much of the confusion that arise would be obviate we difficulty be of we own creation god set a limit to a man 's locomotive ambition in the construction of he body man immediately proceed to discover means of override the limit god gifted man with intellect that he might know he maker man abuse it so that he might forget he maker i be so construct that i can only serve my immediate neighbor but in my conceit i pretend to have discover that i must with my body serve every individual in the universe in thus attempt the impossible man come in contact with different nature different religion and be utterly confound accord to this reasoning it must be apparent to you that railway be a most dangerous institution man have therefore go further away from he maker reader : but i be impatient to hear you answer to my question have the introduction of mahomedanism not unmake the nation editor : indium can not cease to be one nation because people belong to different religion live in it the introduction of foreigner do not necessarily destroy the nation they merge in it a country be one nation only when such a condition obtain in it that country must have a faculty for assimilation indium have ever be such a country in reality there be as many religion as there be individual but those who be conscious of the spirit of nationality do not interfere with one another 's religion if they do they be not fit to be consider a nation if the hindu believe that indium should be people only by hindu they be live in dreamland the hindu the mahomedan the parsee and the christian who have make indium they country be fellow countryman and they will have to live in unity if only for they own interest in no part of the world be one nationality and one religion synonymous term : nor have it ever be so in indium reader : but what about the inborn enmity between hindu and mahomedan editor : that phrase have be invent by we mutual enemy when the hindu and mahomedan fight against one another they certainly speak in that strain they have long since cease to fight how then can there be any inborn enmity pray remember this too that we do not cease to fight only after british occupation the hindu flourish under moslem sovereign and moslem under the hindu each party recognize that mutual fighting be suicidal and that neither party would abandon its religion by force of arm both party therefore decide to live in peace with the english advent the quarrel recommence the proverb you have quote be coin when both be fight to quote they now be obviously harmful should we not remember that many hindu and mahomedan own the same ancestor and the same blood run through they vein do people become enemy because they change they religion be the god of the mahomedan different from the god of the hindu religion be different road converge to the same point what do it matter that we take different road so long as we reach the same goal wherein be the cause for quarrel moreover there be deadly proverb as between the follower of shiva and those of vishnu yet nobody suggest that these two do not belong to the same nation it be say that the vedic religion be different from jainism but the follower of the respective faith be not different nation the fact be that we have become enslaved and therefore quarrel and like to have we quarrel decide by a third party there be hindu iconoclast as there be mahomedan the more we advance in true knowledge the better we shall understand that we need not be at war with those whose religion we may not follow reader : now i would like to know you view about cow protection editor : i myself respect the cow that be i look upon she with affectionate reverence the cow be the protector of indium because it be a agricultural country be dependent on the cow 's progeny she be a most useful animal in hundred of way we mahomedan brethren will admit this but just as i respect the cow so do i respect my fellow-man a man be just as useful as a cow no matter whether he be a mahomedan or a hindu be i then to fight with or kill a mahomedan in order to save a cow in do so i would become a enemy as well of the cow as of the mahomedan therefore the only method i know of protect the cow be that i should approach my mahomedan brother and urge he for the sake of the country to join I in protect she if he would not listen to I i should let the cow go for the simple reason that the matter be beyond my ability if i be over full of pity for the cow i should sacrifice my life to save she but not take my brother 's this i hold be the law of we religion when man become obstinate it be a difficult thing if i pull one way my moslem brother will pull another if i put on a superior air he will return the compliment if i bow to he gently he will do it much more so and if he do not i shall not be consider to have do wrong in have bow when the hindu become insistent the killing of cow increase in my opinion cow protection society may be consider cow kill society it be a disgrace to we that we should need such society when we forget how to protect cow i suppose we need such society what be i to do when a blood-brother be on the point of kill a cow be i to kill he or to fall down at he foot and implore he if you admit that i should adopt the latter course i must do the same to my moslem brother who protect the cow from destruction by hindu when they cruelly ill-treat she whoever reason with the hindu when they mercilessly belabor the progeny of the cow with they stick but this have not prevent we from remain one nation lastly if it be true that the hindu believe in the doctrine of non-killing and the mahomedan do not what i pray be the duty of the former it be not write that a follower of the religion of ahimsa -lrb- non-killing -rrb- may kill a fellow-man for he the way be straight in order to save one be he may not kill another he can only plead -- therein lie he sole duty but do every hindu believe in ahimsa go to the root of the matter not one man really practise such a religion because we do destroy life we be say to follow that religion because we want to obtain freedom from liability to kill any kind of life generally speak we may observe that many hindu partake of meat and be not therefore follower of ahimsa it be therefore preposterous to suggest that the two can not live together amicably because the hindu believe in ahimsa and the mahomedan do not these thought be put into we mind by selfish and false religious teacher the english put the finish touch they have a habit of write history they pretend to study the manners and custom of all people god have give we a limited mental capacity but they usurp the function of the godhead and indulge in novel experiment they write about they own research in most laudatory term and hypnotise we into believe they we in we ignorance then fall at they foot those who do not wish to misunderstand thing may read up the koran and will find therein hundred of passage acceptable to the hindu and the bhagavad gita contain passage to which not a mahomedan can take exception be i to dislike a mahomedan because there be passage in the koran i do not understand or like it take two to make a quarrel if i do not want to quarrel with a mahomedan the latter will be powerless to foist a quarrel on I and similarly i should be powerless if a mahomedan refuse he assistance to quarrel with I a arm strike the air will become disjointed if everyone will try to understand the core of he own religion and adhere to it and will not allow false teacher to dictate to he there will be no room leave for quarrel reader : but will the english ever allow the two body to join hand editor : this question arise out of you timidity it betray we shallowness if two brother want to live in peace be it possible for a third party to separate they if they be to listen to evil counsel we would consider they to be foolish similarly we hindu and mahomedan would have to blame we folly rather than the english if we allow they to put asunder a clay pot would break through impact if not with one stone thou with another the way to save the pot be not to keep it away from the danger point but to bake it so that no stone would break it we have then to make we heart of perfectly baked clay then we shall be steel against all danger this can be easily do by the hindu they be superior in number they pretend that they be more educate they be therefore better able to shield themselves from attack on they amicable relation with the mahomedan there be a mutual distrust between the two community the mahomedan therefore ask for certain concession from lord morley why should the hindu oppose this if the hindu desist the english would notice it the mahomedan would gradually begin to trust the hindu and brotherliness would be the outcome we should be ashamed to take we quarrel to the english everyone can find out for himself that the hindu can lose nothing be desist the man who have inspire confidence in another have never lose anything in this world i do not suggest that the hindu and the mahomedan will never fight two brother live together often do so we shall sometimes have we head break such a thing ought not to be necessary but all man be not equi-minded when people be in a rage they do many foolish thing these we have to put up with but when we do quarrel we certainly do not want to engage counsel and to resort to english or any law-courts two man fight both have they head break or one only how shall a third party distribute justice amongst they those who fight may expect to be injure hindu-mahomedan unity mr candler some time ago ask I in a imaginary interview whether if i be sincere in my profession of hindu-mahomedan unity i would eat and drink with a mahomedean and give my daughter in marriage to a mahomedan this question have be ask again by some friend in another form be it necessary for hindu mahomedan unity that there should he interdine and intermarry the questioner say that if the two be necessary real unity can never take place because crore of _ sanatani _ would never reconcile themselves to interdine much less to intermarriage i be one of those who do not consider caste to be a harmful institution in its origin caste be a wholesome custom and promote national well-being in my opinion the idea that interdine or intermarry be necessary for national growth be a superstition borrow from the west eating be a process just as vital as the other sanitary necessity of life and if mankind have not much to its harm make of eat a fetish and indulgence we would have perform the operation of eat in private even as one perform the other necessary function of life in private indeed the highest culture in hinduism regard eating in that light and there be thousand of hindu still live who will not eat they food in the presence of anybody i can recall the name of several culture man and woman who eat they food in entire privacy but who never have any illwill against anybody and who live on the friendliest term with all intermarriage be a still more difficult question if brother and sister can live on the friendliest footing without ever think of marry each other i can see no difficulty in my daughter regard every mahomedan brother and _ vice versa _ i hold strong view on religion and on marriage the greater the restraint we exercise with regard to we appetite whether about eat or marry the better we become from a religious standpoint i should despair of ever cultivate amicable relation with the world if i have to recognize the right or the propriety of any young man offer he hand in marriage to my daughter or to regard it as necessary for I to dine with anybody and everybody i claim that i be live on term of friendliness with the whole world i have never quarrel with a single mahomedan or christian but for year i have take nothing but fruit in mahomedan or christian household i would most certainly decline to eat food cook from the same plate with my son or to drink water out of a cup which he lip have touch and which have not be wash but the restraint or the exclusiveness exercise in these matter by I have never affect the closest companionship with the mahomedan or the christian friend or my son but interdine and intermarriage have never be a bar to disunion quarrel and worse the pandava and the kaurava fly at one another 's throat without compunction although they interdine and intermarry the bitterness between the english and the german have not yet die out the fact be that intermarriage and interdining be not necessary factor in friendship and unity though they be often emblem thereof but insistence on either the one or the other can easily become and be to-day a bar to hindu-mahomedan unity if we make ourselves believe that hindu and mahomedan can not be one unless they interdine or intermarry we would be create a artificial barrier between we which it might be almost impossible to remove and it would seriously interfere with the flow unity between hindu and mahomedan if for example mahomedan youth consider it lawful to court hindu girl the hindu parent will not even if they suspect any such thing freely admit mahomedan to they home as they have begin to do now in my opinion it be necessary for hindu and mahomedan young man to recognize this limitation i hold it to be utterly impossible for hindu and mahomedan to intermarry and yet retain intact each other 's religion and the true beauty of hindu-mahomedan unity lie in each remain true to he own religion and yet be true to each other for we be think of hindu and mahomedan even of the most orthodox type be able to regard one another as natural friend instead of regard one another as natural enemy as they have do hitherto what then do the hindu-mahomedan unity consist in and how can it be best promote the answer be simple it consist in we have a common purpose a common goal and common sorrow it be best promote by co-operate to reach the common goal by share one another 's sorrow and by mutual toleration a common goal we have we wish this great country of ours to be greater and self-governing -lrb- 4 -rrb- we have enough sorrow to share and to-day see that the mahomedan be deeply touch on the question of khilafat and they case be just nothing can be so powerful for win mahomedan friendship for the hindu as to give he whole-hearted support to the mahomedan claim no amount of drink out of the same cup or dining out of the same bowl can bind the two as this help in the khilafat question and mutual toleration be a necessity for all time and for all race we can not live in peace if the hindu will not tolerate the mahomedan form of worship of god and he manners and custom or if the mahomedan will be impatient of hindu idolatory cow-worship it be not necessary for toleration that i must approve of what i tolerate i heartily dislike drinking meat eating and smoking but i tolerate all these in hindu mahomedan and christian even as i expect they to tolerate my abstinence from all these although they may dislike it all the quarrel between the hindu and the mahomedan have arise from each want to _ force _ the other he view hindu-muslim unity there can be no doubt that successful non-co-operation depend as much on hindu-muslim unity as on non-violence greatest strain will be put upon both in the course of the struggle and if it survive that strain victory be a certainty a severe strain be put upon it in agra and it have be state that when either party go to the authority they be refer to maulana shaukat alus and I fortunately there be a far better man at hand hakimjus ajmal khan be a devout muslim who command the confidence and the respect of both the party he with he band of worker hasten to agra settle the dispute and the party become friend as they be never before a incident occur nearer delhus and the same influence work successfully to avoid what might have become a explosion but hakimjus ajmal khan can not be everywhere appear at the exact hour as a angel of peace nor can maulana shankat alus or i go everywhere and yet perfect peace must be observe between the two community in spite of attempt to divide they why be there any appeal make to the authority at all at agra if we be to work out non-co-operation with any degree of success we must be able to dispense with the protection of the government when we quarrel among ourselves the whole scheme of non-co-operation must break to piece if we final reliance be to be upon british intervention for the adjustment of we quarrel or the punishment of the guilty one in every village and hamlet there must be at least one hindu and one muslim whose primary business must be to prevent quarrel between the two some time however even blood-brother come to blow in the initial stage we be bind to do so here and there unfortunately we who be public worker have make little attempt to understand and influence the mass and least of all the most turbulent among they during the process of insinuate ourselves in the estimation of the mass and until we have gain control over the unruly there be bind to be exhibition of hasty temper now and then we must learn at such time to do without a appeal to the government hakimjus ajmal khan have show we how to do it the union that we want be not a patch up thing but a union of heart base upon a definite recognition of the indubitable proposition that swaraj for indium must be a impossible dream without a indissoluble union between the hindu and the muslim of indium it must not be a mere truce it can not be base upon mutual fear it must be a partnership between equal each respect the religion of the other i would frankly despair of reach such union if there be anything in the holy quran enjoin upon the follower of islam to treat hindu as they natural enemy or if there be anything in hinduism to warrant a belief in the eternal enmity between the two we would ill learn we history if we conclude that because we have quarrel in the past we be destine so to continue unless some such strong power like the british keep we by force of arm from fly at each other 's throat but i be convince that there be no warrant in islam or hinduism for any such belief true it be that interested fanatical priest in both religion have set the one against the other it be equally true that muslim ruler like christian ruler have use the sword for the propagation of they respective faith but in spite of many dark thing of the modern time the world 's opinion to-day will as little tolerate forcible conversion as it will tolerate forcible slavery that probably be the most effective contribution of the scientific spirit of the age that spirit have revolutionise many a false notion about christianity as it have about islam i do not know a single writer on islam who defend the use of force in the proselytising process the influence exert in we time be far more subtle than that of the sword i believe that in the midst of all the bloodshed chicane and fraud be resort to on a colossal scale in the west the whole humanity be silently but surely make progress towards a better age and indium by find true independence and self-expression through a imperishable hindu-muslim unity and through non-violent means ie unadulterated self sacrifice can point a way out of the prevail darkness vi treatment of the depressed class depress class vivekanand use to call the panchama ` suppress class ' there be no doubt that vivekanand 's be a more accurate adjective we have suppress they and have consequently become ourselves depress that we have become the ` pariah of the empire ' be in gokhale 's language the retributive justice mete out to we by a just god a correspondent indignantly ask I in a pathetic letter reproduce elsewhere what i be do for they i have give the letter with the correspondent 's own head should not we the hindu wash we bloodstained hand before we ask the english to wash theirs this be a proper question reasonably put and if a member of a slave nation could deliver the suppress class from they slavery without free myself from my own i would do so to day but it be a impossible task a slave have not the freedom even to do the right thing it be a right for I to prohibit the importation of foreign goods but i have no power to bring it about it be right for maulana mahome alus to go to turkey and to tell the turk personally that indium be with they in they righteous struggle he be not free to do so if i have a truly national legislative i would answer hindu insolence by create special and better well for the exclusive use of suppress class and by erect better and more numerous school for they so that there would be not a single member of the suppress class leave without a school to teach they child but i must wait for that better day meanwhile be the depressed class to be loft to they own resource nothing of the sort in my own humble manner i have do and be do all i can for my panchama brother there be three course open to those downtrodden member of the nation for they impatience they may call in the assistance of the slave owning government they will get it but they will fall from the frying pan into the fire to-day they be slave of slave by seek government aid they will be use for suppress they kith and kin instead of be sin against they will themselves be the sinner the mussalman try it and fail they find that they be worse off than before the sikh do it unwittingly and fail to-day there be no more discontented community in indium than the sikh government aid be therefore no solution the second be rejection of hinduism and wholesale conversion to islam or christianity and if a change of religion could be justified for worldly betterment i would advise it without hesitation but religion be a matter of the heart no physical inconvenience can warrant abandonment of one 's own religion if the inhuman treatment of the panchama be a part of hinduism its rejection would be a paramount duty both for they and for those like I who would not make a fetish even of religion and condone every evil in its sacred name but i believe that untouchability be no part of hinduism it be rather its excrescence to be remove by every effort and there be quite a army of hindu reformer who have set they heart upon rid hinduism of this blot conversion therefore i hold be no remedy whatsoever then there remain finally self-help and self-dependence with such aid as the non-panchama hindu will render of they own motion not as a matter of patronage but as a matter of duty and herein come the use of non-co-operation my correspondent be correctly inform by mr rajagopalucharus and mr hanumantarao that i would favor well-regulated non-co-operation for this acknowledge evil but non-co-operation means independence of outside help it mean effort from within it would not be non-co-operation to insist on visit prohibit area that may be civil disobedience if it be peacefully carry out but i have find to my cost that civil disobedience require far greater preliminary training and self-control all can non-co-operate but few only can offer civil disobedience therefore by way of protest against hinduism the panchama can certainly stop all contact and connection with the other hindu so long as special grievance be maintain but this mean organised intelligent effort and so far as i can see there be no leader among the panchama who can lead they to victory through non-co-operation the better way therefore perhaps be for the panchama heartily to join the great national movement that be now go on for throw off the slavery of the present government it be easy enough for the panchama friend to see that non-co-operation against this evil government presuppose co-operation between the different section form the indian nation the hindu must realize that if they wish to offer successful non-co-operation against the government they must make common cause with the panchama even as they have make common cause with the mussalman non-co-operation with it be free from violence be essentially a movement of intensive self-purification that process have commence and whether the panchama deliberately take part in it or not the rest of the hindu dare not neglect they without hamper they own progress hence though the panchama problem be as dear to I as life itself i rest satisfy with the exclusive attention to national non-co-operation i feel sure that the greater include the less closely ally to this question be the non-brahmin question i wish i have study it more closely than i have be able to a quotation from my speech deliver at a private meeting in madras have be tear from its context and misuse to further the antagonism between the so-called brahmin and the so-called non-brahmin i do not wish to retract a word of what i say at that meeting i be appeal to those who be accept as brahmin i tell they that in my opinion the treatment of non-brahmin by the brahmin be as satanic as the treatment of we by the british i add that the non-brahmin should be placate without any ado or bargaining but my remark be never intend to encourage the powerful non-brahmin of maharashira or madras or the mischievous element among they to overawe the so-called brahmin i use the word ` so-called ' advisedly for the brahmin who have free themselves from the thraldom of superstitious orthodoxy have not only no quarrel with non-brahmin as such but be in every way eager to advance non-brahmin wherever they be weak no lover of he country can possibly achieve its general advance if he dare to neglect the least of he countryman those non-brahmin therefore who be coquete with the government be sell themselves and the nation to which they belong by all mean let those who have faith in the government help to sustain it but let no indian worthy of he birth cut off he nose to spite the face amelioration of the depressed class the resolution of the senate of the gujarat national university in regard to mr andrew ' question about the admission of child of the ` depressed ' class to the school affiliate to that university be report to have raise a flutter in ahmedabad not only have the flutter give satisfaction to a ` time of indium ' correspondent but the occasion have lead to the discovery by he of another defect in the constitution of the senate in that it do not contain a single muslim member the discovery however i may inform the reader be no proof of the want of national character of the university the hindu-muslim unity be no mere lip expression it require no artificial proof the simple reason why there be no mussalman representative on the senate be that no higher educate mussalman able to give he time have be find to take sufficient interest in the national education movement i merely refer to this matter to show that we must reckon with attempt to discredit the movement even misinterpretation of motive that be a difficulty from without and easier to deal with the ` depressed ' class difficulty be internal and therefore far more serious because it may give rise to a split and weaken the cause -- no cause can survive internal difficulty if they be indefinitely multiply yet there can be no surrender in the matter of principle for the avoidance of split you can not promote a cause when you be undermine it by surrender its vital part the depressed class problem be a vital part of the cause _ swaraj _ be as inconceivable without full reparation to the ` depressed ' class as it be impossible without real hindu-muslim unity in my opinion we have become ` pariah of the empire ' because we have create ` pariah ' in we midst the slave owner be always more hurt than the slave we shall be unfit to gain swaraj so long as we would keep in bondage a fifth of the population of hindustan have we not make the ` pariah ' crawl on he belly have we not segregate he and if it be religion so to treat the ` pariah ' it be the religion of the white race to segregate we and if it be no argument for the white race to say that we be satisfy with the badge of we inferiority it be less for we to say that the ` pariah ' be satisfy with he we slavery be complete when we begin to hug it the gujarat senate therefore count the cost when it refuse to bend before the storm this non-co-operation be a process of self-purification we may not cling to putrid custom and claim the pure boon of _ swaraj _ untouchability i hold be a custom not a integral part of hinduism the world advance in think though it be still barbarous in action and no religion can stand that which be not base on fundamental truth any glorification of error will destroy a religion as surely as disregard of a disease be bind to destroy a body this government of ours be a unscrupulous corporation it have rule by divide mussalman from hindu it be quite capable of take advantage of the internal weakness of hinduism it will set the ` depressed ' class against the rest of the hindu non-brahmin against brahmin the gujarat senate resolution do not end the trouble it merely point out the difficulty the trouble will end only when the mass and class of hindu have rid themselves of the sin of untouchability a hindu lover of swaraj will as assiduously work for the amelioration of the lot of the ` depressed ' class as he work for hindu-muslim unity we must treat they as we brother and give they the same rights that we claim for ourselves the sin of untouchability it be worthy of note that the subject committee accept without any opposition the clause regard the sin of untouchability it be well that the national assembly pass the resolution state that the removal of this blot on hinduism be necessary for the attainment of swaraj the devil succeed only by receive help from he fellow he always take advantage of the weakest spot in we nature in order to gain mastery over we even so do the government retain its control over we through we weakness or vice and if we would render ourselves proof against its machination we must remove we weakness it be for that reason that i have call non-co-operation a process of purification as soon as that process be complete this government must fall to piece for want of the necessary environment just as mosquito cease to haunt a place whose cess-pool be fill up and dry have not a just nemesis overtaken we for the crime of untouchability have we not reap as we have sow have we not practice dwyerism and o'dwyerism on we own kith and kin we have segregate the ` pariah ' and we be in turn segregate in the british colony we deny he the use of public well we throw the leavings of we plate at he he very shadow pollute we indeed there be no charge that the ` pariah ' can not fling in we face and which we do not fling in the face of englishman how be this blot on hinduism to be remove ` do unto other as you would that other should do unto you ' i have often tell english official that if they be friend and servant of indium they should come down from they pedestal cease to be patron demonstrate by they loving deed that they be in every respect we friend and believe we to be equal in the same sense they believe fellow englishman to be they equal after the experience of the punjab and the khilafat i have go a step further and ask they to repent and to change they heart even so be it necessary for we hindu to repent of the wrong we have do to alter we behavior towards those whom we have ` suppress ' by a system as devilish as we believe the english system of the government of indium to be we must not throw a few miserable school at they we must not adopt the air of superiority towards they we must treat they as we blood brother as they be in fact we must return to they the inheritance of which we have rob they and this must not be the act of a few english-knowing reformer merely but it must be a conscious voluntary effort on the part of the mass we may not wait till eternity for this much belated reformation we must aim at bring it about within this year of grace probation preparation and _ tapasya _ it be a reform not to follow _ swaraj _ but to precede it untouchability be not a sanction of religion it be a devise of satan the devil have always quote scripture but scripture can not transcend reason and truth they be intend to purify reason and illuminate truth i be not go to burn a spotless horse because the veda be report to have advise tolerate or sanction the sacrifice for I the veda be divine and unwritten ` the letter killeth ' it be the spirit that giveth the light and the spirit of the veda be purity truth innocence chastity humility simplicity forgiveness godliness and all that make a man or woman noble and brave there be neither nobility nor bravery in treat the great and uncomplaining scavenger of the nation as worse than dog to be despise and spat upon would that god give we the strength and the wisdom to become voluntary scavenger of the nation as the ` suppress ' class be force to be there be augean stable enough and to spare for we to clean vii treatment of indian abroad indian abroad the prejudice against indian settler outside indium be show itself in a variety of way : under the impudent suggestion of sedition the fiji government have deport mr manilal doctor who with he brave and culture wife have be render assistance to the poor indentured indian of fijus in a variety of way the whole trouble have arise over the strike of the labourer in fijus indenture have be cancel but the spirit of slavery be by no means dead we do not know the genesis of the strike we do not know that the striker have do no wrong but we do know what be behind when a charge of sedition be bring against the striker and they friend the reader must remember that the government that have scented sedition in the recent upheaval in fijus be the government that have the hardihood to libel mr andrew 's character what can be the meaning of sedition in connection with the fijus striker and mr manilal doctor do they and he want to seize the rein of government do they want any power in that country they strike for elementary freedom and it be a prostitution of term to use the word sedition in such connection the striker may have be overhasty mr manilal doctor may have mislead they if he advice border on the criminal he should have be try the information in we possession go to show that he have be strictly constitutional we point however be that it be a abuse of power for the fiji government to have deport mr manilal doctor without a trial it be wrong in principle to deprive a person of he liberty on mere suspicion and without give he a opportunity of clear he character mr manilal doctor be it remember have for year past make fijus he home he have we believe buy property there he have child bear in fijus have the child no rights have the wife none may a promising career be ruin at the bidding of a lawless government have mr manilal doctor be compensate for the loss he must sustain we trust that the government of indium which have endeavor to protect the rights of indian settler abroad will take up the question of mr doctor 's deportation nor be fiji the only place where the spirit of lawlessness among the powerful have come to the surface indian of -lrb- the late -rrb- german east africa find themselves in a worse position than heretofore they state that even they property be not safe they have to pay all kind of due on passport they be hamper in they trade they be not able even to send money order in british east africa the cloud be perhaps the thickest the european settler there be do they utmost to deprive the indian settler of practically every right they have hitherto possess a attempt be be make to compass they ruin both by legislative enactment and administrative action in south africa every indian who have anything to do with that part of the british dominion be watch with bated breath the progress of commission that be now sit the government of indium have no easy job in protect the interest of indian settler in these various part of he majesty 's dominion they will be able to do so only by follow the firmest and the most consistent policy justice be admittedly on the side of the indian settler but they be the weak party a strong agitation in indium follow by strong action by the government of indium can alone save the situation indian overseas the meeting hold at the excelsior theater in bombay to pass resolution regard east africa and fijus and preside over by sir narayan chandavarkar be a impressive gather the theater be fill to overflow mr andrew ' speech make clear what be need both the political and the civil rights of indian of east africa be at stake mr anantanus himself a east african settler show in a forceful speech that the indian be the pioneer settler a indian sailor name kano direct the celebrated vasco de gama to indium he add amid applause that stanley 's expedition for the search and relief of dr livingstone be also fit out by indian indian workman have build the uganda railway at much peril to they life a indian contractor have take the contract indian artisan have supply the skill and now they countryman be in danger of be debar from its use the upland of east africa have be declare a colony and the lowland a protectorate there be a sinister significance attach to the declaration the colonial system give the european larger power it will tax all the resource of the government of indium to prevent the healthy upland from become a whiteman 's preserve and the indian from be relegate to the swampy lowland the question of franchise will soon become a burn one it will be suicidal to divide the electorate or to appoint indian by nomination there must be one general electoral roll apply the same qualification to all the voter this principle as mr andrew remind the meeting have work well at the cape the second part of the east african resolution show the condition of we countryman in the late german east africa indian soldier fight there and now the position of indian be worse than under german rule hh the agakhan suggest that german east africa should be administer from indium sir theodore morison would have coup up all indian in german east africa the result be that both the proposal go by the board and the expect have happen the greed of the english speculator have prevail and he be try to squeeze out the indian what will the government of indium protect have it the will to do so be not india itself be exploit mr jehangir petit recall the late mr gokhale 's view that we be not to expect a full satisfaction regard the status of we countryman across the sea until we have put we own house in order helot in we own country how could we do better outside mr petit want systematic and severe retaliation in my opinion retaliation be a double-edged weapon it do not fail to hurt the user if it also hurt the party against whom it be use and who be to give effect to retaliation it be too much to expect a english government to adopt effective retaliation against they own people they will expostulate they will remonstrate but they will not go to war with they own colony for the logical outcome of retaliation must mean war if retaliation will not answer let we face the fact frankly the problem be difficult alike for englishman and for we the englishman and indian do not agree in the colony the englishman do not want we where they can live they civilisation be different from ours the two can not coalesce until there be mutual respect the englishman consider himself to belong to the ruling race the indian struggle to think that he do not belong to the subject race and in the very act of think admit he subjection we must then attain equality at home before we can make any real impression abroad this be not to say that we must not strive to do better abroad whilst we be ill at ease in we own home we must preserve we must help we countryman who have settle outside indium only if we recognize the true situation we and we countryman abroad will learn to be patient and know that we chief energy must be concentrate on a betterment of we position at home if we can raise we status here to that of equal partner not in name but in reality so that every indian might feel it all else must follow as a matter of course pariah of the empire the memorable conference at gujrat in its resolution on the status of indian abroad have give it as its opinion that even this question may become one more reason for non-co-operation and so it may nowhere have there be such open defiance of every canon of justice and propriety as in the shameless decision of confiscation of indian rights in the kenia colony announce by its governor this decision have be support by lord milnor and mr montagu and he indian colleague be satisfy with the decision indian who have make east africa who out-number the english be deprive practically of the right of representation on the council they be to be segregate in part not habitable by the english they be to have neither the political nor the material comfort they be to become ` pariah ' in a country make by they own labor wealth and intelligence the viceroy be pleased to say that he do not like the outlook and be consider the step to be take to vindicate the justice he be not meet with a new situation the indian of east africa have warn he of the impending doom and if he excellency have not yet find the means of ensure redress he be not likely to do it in future i would respectfully ask he indian colleague whether they can stand this robbery of they countryman rights in south africa the situation be not less disquieting my misgiving seem to be prove true and repatriation be more likely to prove compulsory than voluntary it be a response to the anti-asiatic agitation not a measure of relief for indigent indian it look very like a trap lay for the unwary indian the union government appear to be take a unlawful advantage of a section of a relieve law design for a purpose totally different from the one now intend as for fijus the crime against humanity be evidently to be hush up i do hope that unless a inquiry be to be make into the fijus martial law doings no indian member will undertake to go to fiji the government of indium appear to have give a undertaking to send indian labor to fiji provide the commission that be to proceed there in order to investigate the condition on the spot return with a favourable report for british guiana i observe from the papers receive from that quarter that the mission that come here be already declare that indian labor will be forthcoming from indium there seem to I to be no real prospect for indian enterprise in that part of the world we be not want in any part of the british dominion except as pariah to do the scavenging for the european settler the situation be clear we be pariah in we own home we get only what government intend to give not what we demand and have a right to we may get the crumb never the loaf i have see large and tempting crumb from a lavish table and i have see the eye of we pariah -- the shame of hinduism -- brighten to see those heavy crumb fill they basket but the superior hindu who be fill the basket from a safe distance know that they be unfit for he own consumption and so we in we turn may receive even governorship which the real ruler no longer require or which they can not retain with safety for they material interest -- the political and material hold on indium it be time we realize we true status viii non-co-operation a writer in the time of indium the editor of that wonderful daily and mr besant have all in they own manner condemn non-co-operation conceive in connection with the khilafat movement all the three writings naturally discuss many side issue which i shall omit for the time be i propose to answer two serious objection raise by the writer the sobriety with which they be state entitle they to a greater consideration than if they have be give in violent language in non-co-operation the writer think it would be difficult if not impossible to avoid violence indeed violence the time of indium editorial say have already commence in that ostracism have be resort to in calcutta and delhus now i fear that ostracism to a certain extent be impossible to avoid i remember in south africa in the initial stage of the passive resistance campaign those who have fall away be ostracise ostracism be violent or peaceful in accord to the manner in which it be practice a congregation may well refuse to recite prayer after a priest who prize he title above he honor but the ostracism will become violent if the individual life of a person be make unbearable by insult innuendo or abuse the real danger of violence lie in the people resort to non-co-operation become impatient and revengeful this may happen if for instance payment of tax be suddenly withdraw or if pressure be put upon soldier to lay down they arm i however do not fear any evil consequence for the simple reason that every responsible mahomedan understand that non-co-operation to be successful must be totally unattended with violence the other objection raise be that those who may give up they service may have to starve that be just a possibility but a remote one for the committee will certainly make due provision for those who may suddenly find themselves out of employment i propose however to examine the whole of the difficult question much more fully in a future issue and hope to show that if indian-mahomedan feeling be to be respect there be nothing left but non-co-operation if the decision arrive at be adverse mr montagu on the khilafat agitation mr montagu do not like the khilafat agitation that be daily gathering force in answer to question put in the house of common he be report to have say that whilst he acknowledge that i have render distinguished service to the country in the past he could not look upon my present attitude with equanimity and that it be not to be expect that i could now be treat as leniently as i be during the rowlatt act agitation he add that he have every confidence in the central and the local government that they be carefully watch the movement and that they have full power to deal with the situation this statement of mr montagu have be regard in some quarter as a threat it have even be consider to be a blank cheque for the government of indium to re-establish the reign of terror if they choose it be certainly inconsistent with he desire to base the government on the goodwill of the people at the same time if the hunter committee 's finding be true and if i be the cause of the disturbance last year i be undoubtedly treat with exceptional leniency i admit too that my activity this year be fraught with greater peril to the empire as it be be conduct to-day than be last year 's activity non-co-operation in itself be more harmless than civil disobedience but in its effect it be far more dangerous for the government than civil disobedience non-co-operation be intend so far to paralyse the government as to compel justice from it if it be carry to the extreme point it can bring the government to a standstill a friend who have be listen to my speech once ask I whether i do not come under the sedition section of the indian penal code though i have not fully consider it i tell he that very probably i do and that i could not plead ` not guilty ' if i be charge under it for i must admit that i can pretend to no ` affection ' for the present government and my speech be intend to create ` disaffection ' such that the people might consider it a shame to assist or co-operate with a government that have forfeit all title to confidence respect or support i draw no distinction between the imperial and the indian government the latter have accept on the khilafat the policy impose upon it by the former and in the punjab case the former have endorse the policy of terrorism and emasculation of a brave people initiate by the latter british minister have break they pledge word and wantonly wound the feeling of the seventy million mussulman of indium innocent man and woman be insult by the insolent officer of the punjab government they wrong not only unrighted but the very officer who so cruelly subject they to barbarous humiliation retain office under the government when at amritsar last year i plead with all the earnestness i could command for co-operation with the government and for response to the wish express in the royal proclamation i do so because i honestly believe that a new era be about to begin and that the old spirit of fear distrust and consequent terrorism be about to give place to the new spirit of respect trust and good-will i sincerely believe that the mussalman sentiment would be placate and that the officer that have misbehave during the martial law regime in the punjab would be at least dismiss and the people would be otherwise make to feel that a government that have always be find quick -lrb- and rightly -rrb- to punish popular excess would not fail to punish its agent ' misdeed but to my amazement and dismay i have discover that the present representative of the empire have become dishonest and unscrupulous they have no real regard for the wish of the people of indium and they count indian honor as of little consequence i can no longer retain affection for a government so evilly man as it be now-a-days and for I it be humiliating to retain my freedom and be a witness to the continue wrong mr montagu however be certainly right in threaten I with deprivation of my liberty if i persist in endanger the existence of the government for that must be the result if my activity bear fruit my only regret be that inasmuch as mr montagu admit my past service he might have perceive that there must be something exceptionally bad in the government if a well-wisher like I could no longer give he affection to it it be simpler to insist on justice be do to the mussulman and to the punjab than to threaten I with punishment so that the injustice might be perpetuate indeed i fully expect it will be find that even in promote disaffection towards a unjust government i have render greater service to the empire than i be already credit with at the present moment however the duty of those who approve of my activity be clear they ought on no account to resent the deprivation of my liberty should the government of indium deem it to be they duty to take it away a citizen have no right to resist such restriction impose in accordance with the law of the state to which he belong much less have those who sympathize with he in my case there can be no question of sympathy for i deliberately oppose the government to the extent of try to put its very existence in jeopardy for my supporter therefore it must be a moment of joy when i be imprison it mean the beginning of success if only the supporter continue the policy for which i stand if the government arrest I they would do so in order to stop the progress of non-co-operation which i preach it follow that if non-co-operation continue with unabated vigor even after my arrest the government must imprison other or grant the people 's wish in order to gain they co-operation any eruption of violence on the part of the people even under provocation would end in disaster whether therefore it be i or any one else who be arrest during the campaign the first condition of success be that there must be no resentment show against it we can not imperil the very existence of a government and quarrel with its attempt to save itself by punish those who place it in danger at the call of the country dr sapru deliver before the khilafat conference at allahabad a impassioned address sympathise with the mussulman in they trouble but dissuade they from embark on non-co-operation he be frankly unable to suggest a substitute but be emphatically of opinion that whether there be a substitute or not non-co-operation be a remedy worse than the disease he say further that mussulman will be take upon they shoulder a serious responsibility if whilst they appeal to the ignorant mass to join they they could not appeal to the indian judge to resign and if they do they would not succeed i acknowledge the force of dr sapru 's last argument at the back of dr sapru 's mind be the fear that non-co-operation by the ignorant people would lead to distress and chaos and would do no good in my opinion any non-co-operation be bind to do some good even the viceragal door-keeper say ` please sir i can serve the government no longer because it have hurt my national honor ' and resign be a step mightier and more effective than the mightiest speech declaim against the government for its injustice nevertheless it would be wrong to appeal to the door-keeper until one have appeal to the highest in the land and as i propose if the necessity arise to ask the door-keeper of the government to dissociate themselves from a unjust government i propose now to address a appeal to the judge and the executive councillor to join the protest that be rise from all over indium against the double wrong do to india on the khilafat and the punjab question in both national honor be involve i take it that these gentleman have enter upon they high office not for the sake of emolument nor i hope for the sake of fame but for the sake of serve they country it be not for money for they be earn more than they do now it must not be for fame for they can not buy fame at the cost of national honor the only consideration that can at the present moment keep they in office must be service of the country when the people have faith in the government when it represent the popular will the judge and the executive official possibly serve the country but when that government do not represent the will of the people when it support dishonesty and terrorism the judge and the executive official by retain office become instrument of dishonesty and terrorism and the least therefore that these holder of high office can do be to cease to become agent of a dishonest and terrorising government for the judge the objection will be raise that they be above politics and so they be and should be but the doctrine be true only in so far we the government be on the whole for the benefit of the people and at least represent the will of the majority not to take part in politics mean not to take side but when a whole country have one mind one will when a whole country have be deny justice it be no longer a question of party politics it be a matter of life and death it then become the duty of every citizen to refuse to serve a government which misbehave and flout national wish the judge be at that moment bind to follow the nation if they be ultimately its servant there remain another argument to be examine it apply to both the judge and the member of the executive it will be urge that my appeal could only be mean for the indian and what good can it do by indian renounce office which have be win for the nation by hard struggle i wish that i could make a effective appeal to the english as well as the indian but i confess that i have write with the mental reservation that the appeal be address only to the indian i must therefore examine the argument just state whilst it be true that these office have be secure after a prolonged struggle they be of use not because of the struggle but because they be intend to serve the nation the moment they cease to possess that quality they become useless and as in the present case harmful no matter how hard-earned and therefore valuable they may have be at the outset i would submit too to we distinguished countryman who occupy high office that they give up will bring the struggle to a speedy end and would probably obviate the danger attendant upon the mass be call upon to signify they disapproval by withdraw co-operation if the titleholder give up they title if the holder of honorary office give up they appointment and if the high official give up they post and the would-be councillor boycott the council the government would quickly come to its sens and give effect to the people 's will for the alternative before the government then would be nothing but despotic rule pure and simple that would probably mean military dictatorship the world 's opinion have advance so far that britain dare not contemplate such dictatorship with equanimity the taking of the step suggest by I will constitute the peacefullest revolution the world have ever see once the infallibility of non-co-operation be realize there be a end to all bloodshed and violence in any shape or form undoubtedly a cause must be grave to warrant the drastic method of national non-co-operation i do say that the affront such as have be put upon islam can not be repeat for a century islam must rise now or ` be fall ' if not for ever certainly for a century and i can not imagine a graver wrong than the massacre of jallianwallum and the barbarity that follow it the whitewash by the hunter committee the dispatch of the government of indium mr montagu 's letter uphold the viceroy and the then lieutenant governor of the punjab the refusal to remove official who make of the life of the punjabi ' a hell ' during the martial law period these act constitute a complete series of continue wrong against indium which if indium have any sense of honor she must right at the sacrifice of all the material wealth she possess if she do not she will have barter she soul for a ` mess of pottage ' non-co-operation explain a representative of madras mail call on mr mk gandhus at he temporary residence in the pursewalkam high road for a interview on the subject of non-co-operation mr gandhus who have come to madra on a tour to some of the principal muslim centre in southern indium be busy with a number of worker discuss he program but he express he readiness to answer question on the chief topic which be agitating muslim and hindu after you experience of the satyagraha agitation last year mr gandhus be you still hopeful and convinced of the wisdom of advise non-co-operation -- certainly how do you consider condition have alter since the satyagraha movement of last year -- i consider that people be better discipline now than they be before in this i include even the mass who i have have opportunity of see in large number in various part of the country and you be satisfied that the mass understand the spirit of satyagraha -- yes and that be why you be press on with the program of non-co-operation -- yes moreover the danger that attend the civil disobedience part of satyagraha do not apply to non-co-operation because in non-co-operation we be not take up civil disobedience of law as a mass movement the result hitherto have be most encouraging for instance people in sindh and delhus in spite of the irritating restriction upon they liberty by the authority have carry out the committee 's instruction in regard to the seditious meeting proclamation and to the prohibition of post placard on the wall which we hold to be inoffensive but which the authority consider to be offensive what be the pressure which you expect to bring to bear on the authority if co-operation be withdraw -- i believe and everybody must grant that no government can exist for a single moment without the co-operation of the people willing or forced and if people suddenly withdraw they co-operation in every detail the government will come to a stand-still but be there not a big ` if ' in it -- certainly there be and how do you propose to succeed against the big ` if ' -- in my plan of campaign expediency have no room if the khilafat movement have really permeate the mass and the class there must be adequate response from the people but be you not beg the question -- i be not beg the question because so far as the datum before I go i believe that the muslim keenly feel the khilafat grievance it remain to be see whether they feeling be intense enough to evoke in they the measure of sacrifice adequate for successful non-co-operation that be you survey of the condition you think justify you advise non-co-operation in the full conviction that you have behind you the support of the vast mass of the mussalman population -- yes this non-co-operation you be satisfied will extend to complete severance of co-operation with the government -- no nor be it at the present moment my desire that it should i be simply practise non-co-operation to the extent that be necessary to make the government realize the depth of popular feeling in the matter and the dissatisfaction with the government that all that could be do have not be do either by the government of indium or by the imperial government whether on the khilafat question or on the punjab question do you mr gandhus realize that even amongst mahomedan there be section of people who be not enthusiastic over non-co-operation however much they may feel the wrong that have be do to they community -- yes but they number be smaller than those who be prepare to adopt non-co-operation and yet do not the fact that there have not be a adequate response to you appeal for resignation of title and office and for boycott of election of the council indicate that you may be place more faith in they strength of conviction than be warrant -- i think not for the reason that the stage have only just come into operation and we people be always most cautious and slow to move moreover the first stage largely affect the uppermost stratum of society who represent a microscopic minority though they be undoubtedly a influential body of people this upper class you think have sufficiently respond to you appeal -- i be unable to say either one way or the other at present i shall be able to give a definite answer at the end of this month do you think that without one 's loyalty to the king and the royal family be question one can advocate non-co-operation in connection with the royal visit most decidedly for the simple reason that if there be any disloyalty about the propose boycott of the prince 's visit it be disloyalty to the government of the day and not to the person of he royal highness what do you think be to be gain by promote this boycott in connection with the royal visit -- because i want to show that the people of indium be not in sympathy with the government of the day and that they strongly disapprove of the policy of the government in regard to the punjab and khilafat and even in respect of other important administrative measure i consider that the visit of the prince of wale be a singularly good opportunity to the people to show they disapproval of the present government after all the visit be calculate to have tremendous political result it be not to be a non-political event and see that the government of indium and the imperial government want to make the visit a political event of first class importance namely for the purpose of strengthen they hold upon indium i for one consider that it be the bounden duty of the people to boycott the visit which be be engineer by the two government in they own interest which at the present moment be totally antagonistic to the people do you mean that you want this boycott promote because you feel that the strengthening of the hold upon indium be not desirable in the best interest of the country -- yes the strengthening of the hold of a government so wicked we the present one be not desirable for the best interest of the people not that i want the bond between england and indium to become loosen for the sake of loosen it but i want that bond to become strengthened only in so far as it add to the welfare of indium do you think that non-co-operation and the non-boycott of the legislative council consistent -- no because a person who take up the program of non-co-operation can not consistently stand for council be non-co-operation in you opinion a end in itself or a means to a end and if so what be the end it be a means to a end the end be to make the present government just whereas it have become mostly unjust co-operation with a just government be a duty non-co-operation with a unjust government be equally a duty will you look with favor upon the proposal to enter the council and to carry on either obstructive tactic or to decline to take the oath of allegiance consistent with you non-co-operation -- no as a accurate student of non-co-operation i consider that such a proposal be inconsistent with the true spirit of non-co-operation i have often say that a government really thrive on obstruction and so far as the proposal not to take the oath of allegiance be concerned i can really see no meaning in it it amount to a useless waste of valuable time and money in other word obstruction be no stage in non-co-operation -- no be you satisfy that all effort at constitutional agitation have be exhaust and that non-co-operation be the only course leave we i do not consider non-co-operation to be unconstitutional remedy now leave open to we non-co-operation be the only one leave for we do you consider it constitutional to adopt it with a view merely to paralyse government -- certainly it be not unconstitutional but a prudent man will not take all the step that be constitutional if they be otherwise undesirable nor do i advise that course i be resort to non-co-operation in progressive stage because i want to evolve true order out of untrue order i be not go to take a single step in non-co-operation unless i be satisfied that the country be ready for that step namely non-co-operation will not be follow by anarchy or disorder how will you satisfy yourself anarchy will not follow for instance if i advise the police to lay down they arm i shall have satisfy myself that we be able by voluntary assistance to protect ourselves against thief and robber that be precisely what be do in lahore and amritsar last year by the citizen by means of volunteer when the military and the police have withdraw even where government have not take such measure in a place for want of adequate force i know people have successfully protect themselves you have advise lawyer to non-co-operate by suspend they practice what be you experience have the lawyer ' response to you appeal encourage you to hope that you will be able to carry through all stage of non-co-operation with the help of such people i can not say that a large number have yet respond to my appeal it be too early to say how many will respond but i may say that i do not rely merely upon the lawyer class or highly educate man to enable the committee to carry out all the stage of non-co-operation my hope lie more with the mass so far as the later stage of non-co-operation be concerned _ August 1920 _ religious authority for non-co-operation it be not without the greatest reluctance that i engage in a controversy with so learn a leader like sir narayan chandavarkar but in view of the fact that i be the author of the movement of non-co-operation it become my painful duty to state my view even though they be oppose to those of the leader whom i look upon with respect i have just read during my travels in malabar sir narayan 's rejoinder to my answer to the bombay manifesto against non-co-operation i regret to have to say that the rejoinder leave I unconvinced he and i seem to read the teaching of the bible the gita and the koran from different standpoint or we put different interpretation on they we seem to understand the word ahimsa politics and religion differently i shall try my best to make clear my meaning of the common term and my reading of the different religious at the outset let I assure sir narayan that i have not change my view on ahimsa i still believe that man not have be give the power of creation do not possess the right of destroy the meanest creature that live the prerogative of destruction belong solely to the creator of all that live i accept the interpretation of ahimsa namely that it be not merely a negative state of harmlessness but it be a positive state of love of do good even to the evil-doer but it do not mean help the evil-doer to continue the wrong or tolerate it by passive acquiescence on the contrary love the active state of ahimsa require you to resist the wrong-doer by dissociate yourself from he even though it may offend he or injure he physically thus if my son live a life of shame i may not help he to do so by continue to support he on the contrary my love for he require I to withdraw all support from he although it may mean even he death and the same love impose on I the obligation of welcome he to my bosom when he repent but i may not by physical force compel my son to become good that in my opinion be the moral of the story of the prodigal son non-co-operation be not a passive state it be a intensely active state -- more active than physical resistance or violence passive resistance be a misnomer non-co-operation in the sense use by I must be non-violent and therefore neither punitive nor vindictive nor base on malice ill-will or hatred it follow therefore that it would be sin for I to serve general dyer and co-operate with he to shoot innocent man but it will be a exercise of forgiveness or love for I to nurse he back to life if he be suffer from a physical malady i can not use in this context the word co-operation as sir narayan would perhaps use it i would co-operate a thousand time with this government to wean it from its career of crime but i will not for a single moment co-operate with it to continue that career and i would be guilty of wrong do if i retain a title from it or a service under it or support its law-court or school better for I a beggar 's bowl than the richest possession from hand stain with the blood of the innocent of jallianwalum better by far a warrant of imprisonment than honeyed word from those who have wantonly wound the religious sentiment of my seventy million brother my reading of the gita be diametrically oppose to sir narayan 's i do not believe that the gita teach violence for do good it be pre-eminently a description of the duel that go on in we own heart the divine author have use a historical incident for inculcate the lesson of do one 's duty even at the peril of one 's life it inculcate performance of duty irrespective of the consequence for we mortal limit by we physical frame be incapable of control action save we own the gita distinguish between the power of light and darkness and demonstrate they incompatibility jesus in my humble opinion be a prince among politician he do render unto caesar that which be caesar 's he give the devil he due he ever shun he and be report never once to have yield to he incantation the politics of he time consist in secure the welfare of the people by teach they not to be seduce by the trinket of the priest and the pharisee the latter then control and mould the life of the people to-day the system of government be so devise as to affect every department of we life it threaten we very existence if therefore we want to conserve the welfare of the nation we must religiously interest ourselves in the do of the governor and exert a moral influence on they by insist on they obey the law of morality general dyer do produce a ` moral effect ' by a act of butchery those who be engage in forwarding the movement of non-co-operation hope to produce a moral effect by a process of self-denial self-sacrifice and self-purification it surprise I that sir narayan should speak of general dyer 's massacre in the same breath as act of non-co-operation i have do my best to understand he meaning but i be sorry to confess that i have fail the inwardness of non-co-operation i commend to the attention of the reader the thoughtful letter receive from miss anne marie peterson miss peterson be a lady who have be in indium for some year and have closely follow indian affair she be about the sever she connection with she mission for the purpose of give herself to education that be truly national i have not give the letter in full i have omit all personal reference but she argument have be leave entirely untouch the letter be not mean to be print it be write just after my vellore speech but it be intrinsically important i ask the writer for she permission which she gladly give for print it i publish it all the more gladly in that it enable I to show that the movement of non-co-operation be neither anti-christian nor anti-english nor anti-european it be a struggle between religion and irreligion power of light and power of darkness it be my firm opinion that europe to-day represent not the spirit of god or christianity but the spirit of satan and satan 's success be the greatest when he appear with the name of god on he lip europe be to-day only nominally christian in reality it be worship mammon ` it be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom ' thus really speak jesus christ he so-called follower measure they moral progress by they material possession the very national anthem of england be anti-christian jesus who ask he follower to love they enemy even as themselves could not have sing of he enemy ` confound he enemy frustrate they knavish trick ' the last book that dr wallace write set forth he deliberate conviction that the much vaunted advance of science have add not a inch to the moral stature of europe the last war however have show as nothing else have the satanic nature of the civilization that dominate europe to day every canon of public morality have be break by the victor in the name of virtue no lie have be consider too foul to be utter the motive behind every crime be not religious or spiritual but grossly material but the mussalman and the hindu who be struggle against the government have religion and honor as they motive even the cruel assassination which have just shock the country be report to have a religious motive behind it it be certainly necessary to purge religion of its excrescence but it be equally necessary to expose the hollowness of moral pretension on the part of those who prefer material wealth to moral gain it be easier to wean a ignorant fanatic from he error than a confirm scoundrel from he scoundrelism this however be no indictment against individual or even nation thousand of individual european be rise above they environment i write of the tendency in europe as reflect in she present leader england through she leader be insolently crush indian religious and national sentiment under she heel england under the false plea of self-determination be try to exploit the oil field of mesopotamium which she be almost to leave because she have probably no choice france through she leader be lend she name to training cannibal as soldier and be shamelessly betray she trust as a mandatory power by try to kill the spirit of the syrian president wilson have throw on the scrap heap he precious fourteen point it be this combination of evil force which indium be really fight through non-violent non-cooperation and those like miss peterson whether christian or european who feel that this error must be dethrone can exercise the privilege of do so by join the non-co-operation movement with the honor of islam be bind up the safety of religion itself and with the honor of indium be bind up the honor of every nation know to be weak a missionary on non-co-operation the follow letter have be receive by mr gandhus from miss anne marie peterson of the danish mission in madra : -- dear mr gandhus i can not thank you enough for you kindness and the way in which you receive I and i feel that meet more or less decide my future i have throw myself at the foot of indium at the same time i know that in christ alone be my abode and i have no longing and no desire but to live he my crucified savior and reveal he for those with whom i come in contact i just cling to he foot and pray with tear that i may not disgrace he as we christian have be do by we behavior in indium we go on crucify christ while we long to proclaim the power of he resurrection by which he have conquer untruth and unrighteousness if we who bear he name be true to he we would never bow ourselves before the power of this world but we would always be on the side of the poor the suffering and the oppressed but we be not and therefore i feel myself under obligation and only to christ but to india for he sake at this time of momentous importance for she future truly it matter little what i a lonely and insignificant person may say or do what be my protest against the common current the race to which i belong be take and -lrb- what grieve I more -rrb- which the missionary society seem to follow even if a respectable number protest it would not be of any use yet be i alone against the whole world i must follow my conscience and my god i therefore can not but smile when i see people say you should have await the decision of the national congress before start the non-co-operation movement you have a message for the country and the congress be the voice of the nation -- its servant and not its master a majority have no right simply because it be a majority but we must try to win the majority and it be easy to see that now that congress be go to be with you would it have do so if you have keep quiet and not lend you voice to the feeling of the people would the congress have know its mind i think not i myself be in much doubt before i hear you but you convinced I not that i can feel much on the question of the khilafat i can not i can see what service you be do to india if you can prevent the mahomedan from use the sword in order to take revenge and get they rights i can see that if you unite the hindu and the mahomedan it will be a master stroke how i wish the christian would also come forward and unite with you for the sake of they country and the honor not only of they motherland but of christ i may not feel much for turkey but i feel for indium and i can see she -lrb- indium -rrb- have no other way to protest against be trample down and crushed than non-co-operation i also want you to know that many in denmark and all over the world yes i be sure every true christian will feel with and be in sympathy with indium in the struggle which be now go on god forbid that in the struggle between might and right truth and untruth the spirit and the flesh there should be a division of race there be not the same struggle be go on all over the world what do it matter then that we be a few god be on we side brute force often seem to get the upper hand but righteousness always have and always shall conquer be it even through much suffering and what may even appear to be a defeat christ conquer when the world crucify he bless be the meek they shall inherit the earth when i read you speech give at madras it strike I that it should be print as a pamphlet in english tamil hindustanus and all the most used language and then spread to every nook and corner of indium the non-co-operation movement once start must be work so as to become successful if it be not i dread to think of the consequence but you can not expect it to win in a day or two it must take time and you will not despair if you do not reach you goal in a hurry for those who have faith there be no haste now for the withdrawal of the child and student from government school i think it a most important step take the government help -lrb- even if it be you money they pay you back -rrb- we must submit to its scheme its rule and regulation indium and we who love she have come to the conclusion that the education the foreign government have give you be not healthy for indium and can certainly never make for she real growth this movement would lead to a spontaneous rise of national school let they be a few but let they spring up through self-sacrifice only by indigenous education can india be truly uplifted why this appeal so much to I be perhaps because i belong to the part of the danish people who start they own independent indigenous national school the danish free school and folk-high-school of which you may have hear be start against the opposition and persecution of the state the organiser win and thus have regenerate the nation with my truly heartfelt thanks and prayer for you i be you sincerely anne marie how to work non-co-operation perhaps the best way of answer the fear and criticism as to non-co-operation be to elaborate more fully the scheme of non-co-operation the critic seem to imagine that the organiser propose to give effect to the whole scheme at once the fact however be that the organiser have fix definite progressive four stage the first be the give up of title and resignation of honorary post if there be no response or if the response receive be not effective recourse will be have to the second stage the second stage involve much previous arrangement certainly not a single servant will be call out unless he be either capable of support himself and he dependent or the khilafat committee be able to bear the burden all the class of servant will not be call out at once and never will any pressure be put upon a single servant to withdraw himself from the government service nor will a single private employee be touch for the simple reason that the movement be not anti-english it be not even anti-government co-operation be to be withdraw because the people must not be party to a wrong -- a broken pledge -- a violation of deep religious sentiment naturally the movement will receive a check if there be any undue influence bring to bear upon any government servant or if any violence be use or countenance by any member of the khilafat committee the second stage must be entirely successful if the response be at all on a adequate scale for no government -- much less the indian government -- can subsist if the people cease to serve it the withdrawal therefore of the police and the military -- the third stage -- be a distant goal the organiser however want to be fair open and above suspicion they do not want to keep back from the government or the public a single step they have in contemplation even as a remote contingency the fourth _ ie _ suspension of tax be still more remote the organiser recognize that suspension of general taxation be fraught with the greatest danger it be likely to bring a sensitive class in conflict with the police they be therefore not likely to embark upon it unless they can do so with the assurance that there will be no violence offer by the people i admit as i have already do that non-co-operation be not unattended with risk but the risk of supineness in the face of a grave issue be infinitely greater than the danger of violence ensue form organize non-co-operation to do nothing be to invite violence for a certainty it be easy enough to pass resolution or write article condemn non-co-operation but it be no easy task to restrain the fury of a people incense by a deep sense of wrong i urge those who talk or work against non-co-operation to descend from they chair and go down to the people learn they feeling and write if they have the heart against non-co-operation they will find as i have find that the only way to avoid violence be to enable they to give such expression to they feeling as to compel redress i have find nothing save non-co-operation it be logical and harmless it be the inherent right of a subject to refuse to assist a government that will not listen to he non-co-operation as a voluntary movement can only succeed if the feeling be genuine and strong enough to make people suffer to the utmost if the religious sentiment of the mahomedan be deeply hurt and if the hindu entertain neighbourly regard towards they muslim brethren they will both count no cost too great for achieve the end non-co-operation will not only be a effective remedy but will also be a effective test of the sincerity of the muslim claim and the hindu profession of friendship there be however one formidable argument urge by friend against my join the khilafat movement they say that it ill-become I a friend of the english and a admirer of the british constitution to join hand with those who be to-day fill with nothing but ill-will against the english i be sorry to have to confess that the ordinary mahomedan entertain to-day no affection for englishman he consider not without some cause that they have not play the game but if i be friendly towards englishman i be no less so towards my countryman the mahomedan and as such they have a greater claim upon my attention than englishman my personal religion however enable I to serve my countryman without hurt englishman or for that matter anybody else what i be not prepare to do to my blood-brother i would not do to a englishman i would not injure he to gain a kingdom but i would withdraw co-operation from he if it become necessary as i have withdraw from my own brother -lrb- now decease -rrb- when it become necessary i serve the empire by refuse to partake in its wrong william stead offer public prayer for british reverse at the time of the boer war because he consider that the nation to which he belong be engage in a unrighteous war the present prime minister risk he life in oppose that war and do everything he could to obstruct he own government in its prosecution and to-day if i have throw in my lot with the mahomedan a large number of whom bear no friendly feeling towards the british i have do so frankly as a friend of the british and with the object of gain justice and of thereby show the capacity of the british constitution to respond to every honest determination when it be couple with suffer i hope by my ` alliance ' with the mahomedan to achieve a threefold end -- to obtain justice in the face of odds with the method of satyagrah and to show its efficacy over all other method to secure mahomedan friendship for the hindu and thereby internal peace also and last but not least to transform ill-will into affection for the british and they constitution which in spite of the imperfection weather many a storm i may fail in achieve any of the end i can but attempt god alone can grant success it will not be deny that the end be all worthy i invite hindu and englishman to join I in a full-hearted manner in shoulder the burden the mahomedan of indium be carry theirs be admittedly a just fight the viceroy the secretary of state the maharaja of bikuner and lord sinha have testify to it time have arrive to make good the testimony people with a just cause be never satisfy with a mere protest they have be know to die for it be a high-spirited people like the mahomedan expect to do less speech at madras address a huge concourse of people of the city of madras hindus and mahomedans numbering over 50000 assemble on the south beach opposite to the presidency college madra on the 12th August 1920 mahatma gandhus speak as follow : -- mr chairman and friend -- like last year i have to ask you forgiveness that i should have to speak be seat whilst my voice have become stronger than it be last year my body be still weak and if i be to attempt to speak to you stand i could not hold on for very many minute before the whole frame would shake i hope therefore that you will grant I permission to speak seat i have sit here to address you on a most important question probably a question whose importance we have not measure up to now lokamanya tilak but before i approach that question on this dear old beach of madras you will expect I -- you will want I -- to offer my tribute to the great depart lokamanya tilak maharaj -lrb- loud and prolonged cheer -rrb- i would ask this great assembly to listen to I in silence i have come to make a appeal to you heart and to you reason and i could not do so unless you be prepare to listen to whatever i have to say in absolute silence i wish to offer my tribute to the depart patriot and i think that i can not do better than say that he death as he life have pour new vigor into the country if you be present as i be present at that great funeral procession you would realize with I the meaning of my word mr tilak live for he country the inspiration of he life be freedom for he country which he call swaraj the inspiration of he death-bed be also freedom for he country and it be that which give he such marvellous hold upon he countryman it be that which command the adoration not of a few choose indian belong to the upper stratum of society but of million of he countryman he life be one long sustained piece of self-sacrifice he begin that life of discipline and self-sacrifice in 1879 and he continue that life up to the end of he day and that be the secret of he hold upon he country he not only know what he want for he country but also how to live for he country and how to die for he country i hope then that whatever i say this evening to this vast mass of people will bear fruit in that same sacrifice for which the life of lokamanya tilak maharaj stand he life if it teach we anything whatsoever teach one supreme lesson : that if we want to do anything whatsoever for we country we can do so not by speech however grand eloquent and convincing they may be but only by sacrifice at the back of every act if we life i have come to ask everyone of you whether you be ready and willing to give sufficiently for you country 's sake for country 's honor and for religion i have boundless faith in you the citizen of madra and the people of this great presidency a faith which i begin to cultivate in the year 1983 when i first make acquaintance with the tamil labourer in south africa and i hope that in these hour of we trial this province will not be second to any other in indium and that it will lead in this spirit of self-sacrifice and will translate every word into action need for non-co-operation what be this non-co-operation about which you have hear so much and why do we want to offer this non-co-operation i wish to go for the time be into the why here be two thing before this country : the first and the foremost be the khilafat question on this the heart of the mussalman of indium have become lascerated british pledge give after the greatest deliberation by the prime minister of england in the name of the english nation have be drag into the mire the promise give to moslem indium on the strength of which the consideration that be expect by the british nation be exact have be break and the great religion of islam have be place in danger the mussalman hold -- and i venture to think they rightly hold -- that so long as british promise remain unfulfilled so long be it impossible for they to tender whole-hearted fealty and loyalty to the british connection and if it be to be a choice for a devout mussalman between loyalty to the british connection and loyalty to he code and prophet he will not require a second to make he choice -- and he have declare he choice the mussalman say frankly openly and honourably to the whole world that if the british minister and the british nation do not fulfil the pledge give to they and do not wish to regard with respect the sentiment of 70 million of the inhabitant of indium who profess the faith of islam it will be impossible for they to retain islamic loyalty it be a question then for the rest of the indian population to consider whether they want to perform a neighbourly duty by they mussalman countryman and if they do they have a opportunity of a lifetime which will not occur for another hundred year to show they good-will fellowship and friendship and to prove what they have be say for all these long year that the mussalman be the brother of the hindu if the hindu regard that before the connection with the british nation come he natural connection with he moslem brother then i say to you that if you find that the moslem claim be just that it be base upon real sentiment and that at its back ground be this great religious feeling you can not do otherwise than help the mussalman through and through so long as they cause remain just and the means for attain the end remain equally just honorable and free from harm to india these be the plain condition which the indian mussalman have accept and it be when they see that they could accept the proferred aid of the hindu that they could always justify the cause and the means before the whole world that they decide to accept the proferred hand of fellowship it be then for the hindu and mahomedan to offer a unite front to the whole of the christian power of europe and tell they that weak as indium be indium have still get the capacity of preserve she self-respect she still know how to die for she religion and for she self-respect that be the khilafat in a nut-shell but you have also get the punjab the punjab have wound the heart of indium as no other question have for the past century i do not exclude from my calculation the mutiny of 1857 whatever hardship indium have to suffer during the mutiny the insult that be attempt to be offer to she during the passage of the rowlatt legislation and that which be offer after its passage be unparalleled in indian history it be because you want justice from the british nation in connection with the punjab atrocity : you have to devise way and mean as to how you can get this justice the house of common the house of lord mr montagu the viceroy of indium everyone of they know what the feeling of indium be on this khilafat question and on that of the punjab the debate in both the house of parliament the action of mr montagu and that of the viceroy have demonstrate to you completely that they be not willing to give the justice which be indium 's due and which she demand i suggest that we leader have get to find a way out of this great difficulty and unless we have make ourselves even with the british ruler in indium and unless we have gain a measure of self-respect at the hand of the british ruler in indium no connection and no friendly intercourse be possible between they and ourselves i therefore venture to suggest this beautiful and unanswerable method of non-co-operation be it unconstitutional i have be tell that non-co-operation be unconstitutional i venture to deny that it be unconstitutional on the contrary i hold that non-co-operation be a just and religious doctrine it be the inherent right of every human being and it be perfectly constitutional a great lover of the british empire have say that under the british constitution even a successful rebellion be perfectly constitutional and he quote historical instance which i can not deny in support of he claim i do not claim any constitutionality for a rebellion successful or otherwise so long as that rebellion mean in the ordinary sense of the term what it do mean namely wrest justice by violent means on the contrary i have say it repeatedly to my countryman that violence whatever end it may serve in europe will never serve we in indium my brother and friend shaukat alus believe in method of violence and if it be in he power to draw the sword against the british empire i know that he have get the courage of a man and he have get also the wisdom to see that he should offer that battle to the british empire but because he recognize as a true soldier that mean of violence be not open to india he side with I accept my humble assistance and pledge he word that so long as i be with he and so long as he believe in the doctrine so long will he not harbor even the idea of violence against any single englishman or any single man on earth i be here to tell you that he have be as true as he word and have keep it religiously i be here to bear witness that he have be follow out this plan of non-violent non-co-operation to the very letter and i be ask indium to follow this non-violent non-co-operation i tell you that there be not a better soldier living in we rank in british indium than shaukat alus when the time for the drawing of the sword come if it ever come you will find he draw that sword and you will find I retire to the jungle of hindustan as soon as indium accept the doctrine of the sword my life as a indian be finish it be because i believe in a mission special to indium and it be because i believe that the ancient of indium after century of experience have find out that the true thing for any human be on earth be not justice base on violence but justice base on sacrifice of self justice base on yagna and kurbanus -- i cling to that doctrine and i shall cling to it for ever -- it be for that reason i tell you that whilst my friend believe also in the doctrine of violence and have adopt the doctrine of non-violence as a weapon of the weak i believe in the doctrine of non-violence as a weapon of the strongest i believe that a man be the strongest soldier for daring to die unarmed with he breast bare before the enemy so much for the non-violent part of non-co-operation i therefore venture to suggest to my learn countryman that so long as the doctrine of non-co-operation remain non-violent so long there be nothing unconstitutional in that doctrine i ask further be it unconstitutional for I to say to the british government ' i refuse to serve you ' be it unconstitutional for we worthy chairman to return with every respect all the title that he have ever hold from the government be it unconstitutional for any parent to withdraw he child from a government or aid school be it unconstitutional for a lawyer to say ' i shall no longer support the arm of the law so long as that arm of law be use not to raise I but to debase I ' be it unconstitutional for a civil servant or for a judge to say ' i refuse to serve a government which do not wish to respect the wish of the whole people ' i ask be it unconstitutional for a policeman or for a soldier to tender he resignation when he know that he be call to serve a government which traduce he own countryman be it unconstitutional for I to go to the ` krishan ' to the agriculturist and say to he ` it be not wise for you to pay any tax if these tax be use by the government not to raise you but to weaken you ' i hold and i venture to submit that there be nothing unconstitutional in it what be more i have do every one of these thing in my life and nobody have question the constitutional character of it i be in kaira work in the midst of 7 lakh of agriculturist they have all suspend the payment of tax and the whole of indium be at one with I nobody consider that it be unconstitutional i submit that in the whole plan of non-co-operation there be nothing unconstitutional but i do venture to suggest that it will be highly unconstitutional in the midst of this unconstitutional government -- in the midst of a nation which have build up its magnificent constitution -- for the people of indium to become weak and to crawl on they belly -- it will be highly unconstitutional for the people of indium to pocket every insult that be offer to they it be highly unconstitutional for the 70 million of mohamedan of indium to submit to a violent wrong do to they religion it be highly unconstitutional for the whole of indium to sit still and co-operate with a unjust government which have trodden under its foot the honor of the punjab i say to my countryman so long as you have a sense of honor and so long as you wish to remain the descendant and defender of the noble tradition that have be hand to you for generation after generation it be unconstitutional for you not to non-co-operate and unconstitutional for you to co-operate with a government which have become so unjust as we government have become i be not anti-english i be not anti-british i be not anti any government but i be anti-untruth -- anti-humbug and anti-injustice so long as the government spell injustice it may regard I as its enemy implacable enemy i have hope at the congress at amritsar -- i be speak god 's truth before you -- when i plead on bended knee before some of you for co-operation with the government i have full hope that the british minister who be wise as a rule would placate the mussalman sentiment that they would do full justice in the matter of the punjab atrocity and therefore i say : -- let we return good-will to the hand of fellowship that have be extend to we which i then believe be extend to we through the royal proclamation it be on that account that i plead for co-operation but to-day that faith have go and obliterate by the act of the british minister i be here to plead not for futile obstruction in the legislative council but for real substantial non-co-operation which would paralyse the mightiest government on earth that be what i stand for to-day until we have wring justice and until we have wring we self-respect from unwilling hand and from unwilling pen there can be no co-operation we shastra say and i say so with the greatest deference to all the greatest religious preceptor of indium but without fear of contradiction that we shastra teach we that there shall be no co-operation between injustice and justice between a unjust man and a justice-loving man between truth and untruth co-operation be a duty only so long as government protect you honor and non-co-operation be a equal duty when the government instead of protect rob you of you honor that be the doctrine of non-co-operation non-co-operation and the special congress i have be tell that i should have wait for the declaration of the special congress which be the mouth piece of the whole nation i know that it be the mouthpiece of the whole nation if it be for I individual gandhus to wait i would have wait for eternity but i have in my hand a sacred trust i be advise my mussalman countryman and for the time be i hold they honor in my hand i dare not ask they to wait for any verdict but the verdict of they own conscience do you suppose that mussalman can eat they own word can withdraw from the honorable position they have take up if perchance -- and god forbid that it should happen -- the special congress decide against they i would still advise my countryman the mussalman to stand single handed and fight rather than yield to the attempt dishonor to they religion it be therefore give to the mussalman to go to the congress on bended knee and plead for support but support or no support it be not possible for they to wait for the congress to give they the lead they have to choose between futile violence drawing of the naked sword and peaceful non-violent but effective non-co-operation and they have make they choice i venture further to say to you that if there be any body of man who feel as i do the sacred character of non-co-operation it be for you and I not to wait for the congress but to act and to make it impossible for the congress to give any other verdict after all what be the congress the congress be the collect voice of individual who form it and if the individual go to the congress with a united voice that will be the verdict you will gain from the congress but if we go to the congress with no opinion because we have none or because we be afraid to express it then naturally we wait the verdict of the congress to those who be unable to make up they mind i say by all means wait but for those who have see the clear light as they see the light in front of they for they to wait be a sin the congress do not expect you to wait but it expect you to act so that the congress can gauge properly the national feeling so much for the congress boycott of the council among the detail of non-co-operation i have place in the foremost rank the boycott of the council friend have quarrel with I for the use of the word boycott because i have disapprove -- as i disapprove even now -- boycott of british goods or any goods for that matter but there boycott have its own meaning and here boycott have its own meaning i not only do not disapprove but approve of the boycott of the council that be go to be form next year and why do i do it the people -- the mass -- require from we the leader a clear lead they do not want any equivocation from we the suggestion that we should seek election and then refuse to take the oath of allegiance would only make the nation distrust the leader it be not a clear lead to the nation so i say to you my countryman not to fall into this trap we shall sell we country by adopt the method of seek election and then not take the oath of allegiance we may find it difficult and i frankly confess to you that i have not that trust in so many indian make that declaration and standing by it to-day i suggest to those who honestly hold the view -- _ viz _ that we should seek election and then refuse to take the oath of allegiance -- i suggest to they that they will fall into a trap which they be prepare for themselves and for the nation that be my view i hold that if we want to give the nation the clearest possible lead and if we want not to play with this great nation we must make it clear to this nation that we can not take any favor no matter how great they may be so long as those favor be accompany by a injustice a double wrong do to india not yet redress the first indispensable thing before we can receive any favor from they be that they should redress this double wrong there be a greek proverb which use to say beware of the greek but especially beware of they when they bring gift to you to-day from those minister who be bent upon perpetuate the wrong to islam and to the punjab i say we can not accept gift but we should be doubly careful lest we may not fall into the trap that they may have devise i therefore suggest that we must not coquet with the council and must not have anything whatsoever to do with they i be tell that if we who represent the national sentiment do not seek election the moderate who do not represent that sentiment will i do not agree i do not know what the moderate represent and i do not know what the nationalist represent i know that there be good sheep and black sheep amongst the moderate i know that there be good sheep and black sheep amongst the nationalist i know that many moderate hold honestly the view that it be a sin to resort to non-co-operation i respectfully agree to differ from they i do say to they also that they will fall into a trap which they will have devise if they seek election but that do not affect my situation if i feel in my heart of heart that i ought not to go to the council i ought at least to abide by this decision and it do not matter if ninety-nine other countryman seek election that be the only way in which public work can be do and public opinion can be build that be the only way in which reform can be achieve and religion can be conserve if it be a question of religious honor whether i be one or among many i must stand upon my doctrine even if i should die in the attempt it be worth die for than that i should live and deny my own doctrine i suggest that it will be wrong on the part of any one to seek election to these council if once we feel that we can not co-operate with this government we have to commence from the top we be the natural leader of the people and we have acquire the right and the power to go to the nation and speak to it with the voice of non-co-operation i therefore do suggest that it be inconsistent with non-co-operation to seek election to the council on any term whatsoever lawyer and non-co-operation i have suggest another difficult matter _ viz _ that the lawyer should suspend they practice how should i do otherwise know so well how the government have always be able to retain this power through the instrumentality of lawyer it be perfectly true that it be the lawyer of to-day who be lead we who be fight the country 's battle but when it come to a matter of action against the government when it come to a matter of paralyse the activity of the government i know that the government always look to the lawyer however fine fighter they may have be to preserve they dignity and they self-respect i therefore suggest to my lawyer friend that it be they duty to suspend they practice and to show to the government that they will no longer retain they office because lawyer be consider to be honorary officer of the court and therefore subject to they disciplinary jurisdiction they must no longer retain these honorary office if they want to withdraw on operation from government but what will happen to law and order we shall evolve law and order through the instrumentality of these very lawyer we shall promote arbitration court and dispense justice pure simple home-made justice swadeshus justice to we countryman that be what suspension of practice mean parent and non-co-operation i have suggest yet another difficulty -- to withdraw we child from the government school and to ask collegiate student to withdraw from the college and to empty government aid school how could i do otherwise i want to gauge the national sentiment i want to know whether the mahomodan feel deeply if they feel deeply they will understand in the twinkling of a eye that it be not right for they to receive schooling from a government in which they have lose all faith and which they do not trust at all how can i if i do not want to help this government receive any help from that government i think that the school and college be factory for make clerk and government servant i would not help this great factory for manufacture clerk and servant if i want to withdraw co-operation from that government look at it from any point of view you like it be not possible for you to send you child to the school and still believe in the doctrine of non-co-operation the duty of title holder i have go further i have suggest that we title holder should give up they title how can they hold on to the title and honor bestow by the government they be at one time badge of honor when we believe that national honor be safe in they hand but now they be no longer badge of honor but badge of dishonor and disgrace when we really believe that we can not get justice from this government every title holder hold he title and honor as trustee for the nation and in this first step in the withdrawal of co-operation from the government they should surrender they title without a moment 's consideration i suggest to my mahomedan countryman that if they fail in this primary duty they will certainly fail in non-co-operation unless the mass themselves reject the class and take up non-co-operation in they own hand and be able to fight that battle even as the man of the french revolution be able to take the rein of government in they own hand leave aside the leader and march to the banner of victory i want no revolution i want order progress i want no disorder order i want no chaos i want real order to be evolve out of this chaos which be misrepresent to I as order if it be order establish by a tyrant in order to get hold of the tyrannical rein of government i say that it be no order for I but it be disorder i want to evolve justice out of this injustice therefore i suggest to you the passive non-co-operation if we would only realize the secret of this peaceful and infallible doctrine you will know and you will find that you will not want to use even a angry word when they lift the sword at you and you will not want even to lift you little finger let alone a stick or a sword non-co-operation -- service to the empire you may consider that i have speak these word in anger because i have consider the way of this government immoral unjust debasing and untruthful i use these adjective with the greatest deliberation i have use they for my own true brother with whom i be engage in battle of non-co-operation for full 13 year and although the ash cover the remains of my brother i tell you that i use to tell he that he be unjust when he plan be base upon immoral foundation i use to tell he that he do not stand for truth there be no anger in I i tell he this home truth because i love he in the same manner i tell the british people that i love they and that i want they association but i want that association on condition well define i want my self-respect and i want my absolute equality with they if i can not gain that equality from the british people i do not want that british connection if i have to let the british people go and import temporary disorder and dislocation of national business i will favor that disorder and dislocation than that i should have injustice from the hand of a great nation such as the british nation you will find that by the time the whole chapter be close that the successor of mr montagu will give I the credit for have render the most distinguished service that i have yet render to the empire in have offer this non-co-operation and in have suggest the boycott not of he royal highness the principle of wale but of boycott of a visit engineer by government in order to tighten its hold on the national neck i will not allow it even if i stand alone if i can not persuade this nation not to welcome that visit but will boycott that visit with all the power at my command it be for that reason i stand before you and implore you to offer this religious battle but it be not a battle offer to you by a visionary or a saint i deny be a visionary i do not accept the claim of saintliness i be of the earth earthy a common gardener man as much as any one of you probably much more than you be i be prone to as many weakness as you be but i have see the world i have live in the world with my eye open i have go through the most fiery ordeal that have fall to the lot of man i have go through this discipline i have understand the secret of my own sacred hinduism i have learn the lesson that non-co-operation be the duty not merely of the saint but it be the duty of every ordinary citizen who not know much not care to know much but want to perform he ordinary household function the people of europe touch even they mass the poor people the doctrine of the sword but the rishi of indium those who have hold the tradition of indium have preach to the mass of indium this doctrine not of the sword not of violence but of suffering of self-suffering and unless you and i be prepare to go through this primary lesson we be not ready even to offer the sword and that be the lesson my brother shaukal alus have imbibe to teach and that be why he to-day accept my advice tender to he in all prayerfulness and in all humility and say ` long live non-co-operation ' please remember that even in england the little child be withdraw from the school and college in cambridge and oxford be close lawyer have leave they desk and be fight in the trench i do not present to you the trench but i do ask you to go through the sacrifice that the man woman and the brave lad of england go through remember that you be offer battle to a nation which be saturate with they spirit of sacrifice whenever the occasion arise remember that the little band of boer offer stubborn resistance to a mighty nation but they lawyer have leave they desk they mother have withdraw they child from the school and college and the child have become the volunteer of the nation i have see they with these naked eye of mine i be ask my countryman in indium to follow no other gospel than the gospel of self-sacrifice which precede every battle whether you belong to the school of violence or non-violence you will still have to go through the fire of sacrifice and of discipline may god grant you may god grant we leader the wisdom the courage and the true knowledge to lead the nation to its cherish goal may god grant the people of indium the right path the true vision and the ability and the courage to follow this path difficult and yet easy of sacrifice speech at trichinopoly mahatma gandhus make the follow speech at trichinopoly on the 18th August 1920 : -- i think you on behalf of my brother shaukat alus and myself for the magnificent reception that the citizen of trichinopoly have give to we i thank you also for the many address that you have be good enough to present to we but i must come to business it be a great pleasure to I to renew you acquaintance for reason that i need not give you i expect great thing from trichinopoly madura and a few place i could name i take it that you have read my address on the madras beach on non-co-operation without take up you time in this great assembly i wish to deal with one or two matter that arise out of mr s kasturiranga iyongar 's speech he say in effect that i should have wait for the congress mandate on non-co-operation that be impossible because the mussulman have and still have a duty irrespective of the hindu to perform in reference to they own religion it be impossible for they to wait for any mandate save the mandate of they own religion in a matter that vitally concern the honor of islam it be therefore possible for they only to go to the congress on bended knee with a clear cut program of they own and ask the congress to pronounce its blessing upon that program and if they be not so fortunate as to secure the blessing of the national assembly without mean any disrespect to that assembly it be they bounden duty to go on with they program and so it be the duty of every hindu who consider he mussalman brother as a brother who have a just cause which he wish to vindicate to throw in he lot with he mussalman brother we leader do not quarrel with the principle of non-co-operation by itself but he object to the three principal detail of non-co-operation council election he consider that it be we duty to seek election to the council and fight we battle on the floor of the council hall i do not deny the possibility of a fight and a royal fight on the council floor we have do it for the last 35 year but i venture to suggest to you and to he with all due respect that it be not non-co-operation and it be not half as successful as non-co-operation can be you can not go to a class of people with a view to convince they by any fight -- call it even obstruction -- who have get a settle conviction and a settle policy to follow it be in medical language a incompatible mixture out of which you can gain nothing but if you totally boycott the council you create a public opinion in the country with reference to the khilafat wrong and the punjab wrong which will become totally irresistible the first advantage of go to the council must be good-will on the part of the ruler it be absolutely lack in the place of good-will you have get nothing but injustice but i must move on lawyer ' practice i come now to the second objection of mr kasturiranga iyengar with reference to the suspension by lawyer of they practice milk be good in itself but it come absolutely poisonous immediately a little bit of arsenic be add to it law court be similarly good when justice be distil through they on behalf of a sovereign power which want to do justice to its people law court be one of the greatest symbol of power and in the battle of non-co-operation you may not leave law court untouched and claim to offer non-co-operation but if you will read that objection carefully you will find in that objection the great fear that the lawyer will not respond to the call that the country make upon they and it be just there that the beauty of non-co-operation come in if one lawyer alone suspend practice it be so much to the good of the country and so if we be sure to deprive the government of the power that it possess through its law court whether one lawyer take it up or many we must adopt that step government school he object also to the plan of boycott government school i can only say what i have say with reference to lawyer that if we mean non-co-operation we may not receive any favor from the government no matter how advantageous by themselves they may be in a great struggle like this it be not open to we to count how many school will respond and how many parent will respond and just as a geometrical problem be difficult because it do not admit of easy proof so also because a certain stage in national evolution be difficult you may not avoid that step without make the whole of the evolution a farce \* \* \* \* \* we have have a great lesson in non-co-operation and co-operation we have a lesson in non-co-operation when some young man begin to fight there and it be a dangerous weapon i have not the slightest doubt about it one man with a determine will to non-co-operate can disturb a whole meeting and we have a physical demonstration of it to night but ours be non-violent non-co-operation in which there can be no mistake whatsoever in the fundamental condition be observe if non-co-operation fail it will not be for want of any inherent strength in it but it will fall because there be no response to it or because people have not sufficiently grasp its simple principle you have also a practical demonstration of co-operation just now that heavy chair go over the head of so many people because all want to lift they little hand to move that chair away from they and so be that heavier dome also remove from we sight by co-operation of man woman and child everybody believe and know that this government of we exist only by the co-operation of the people and not by the force of arm it can wield and everyman with a sense of logic will tell you that the converse of that also be equally true that government can not stand if this co-operation on which it exist be withdraw difficulty undoubtedly there be we have hitherto learn how to sacrifice we voice and make speech we must also learn to sacrifice ease money comfort and that we may learn form the englishman themselves every one who have study english history know that we be now engage in a battle with a nation which be capable of great sacrifice and the three hundred million of indium can not make they mark upon the world or gain they self-respect without a adequate measure of sacrifice boycott of british goods we friend have suggest the boycott of british or foreign goods boycott of all foreign goods be another name for swadeshus he think that there will be a greater response in the boycott of all foreign goods with the experience of year behind I and with a intimate knowledge of the mercantile class i venture to tell you that boycott of foreign goods or boycott of merely british goods be more impracticable than any of the stop i have suggest whereas in all the step that i have venture to suggest there be practically no sacrifice of money involve in the boycott of british or foreign goods you be invite you merchant prince to sacrifice they million it have get to be do but it be a exceedingly low process the same may be say of the step that i have venture to suggest i know but boycott of goods in conceive as a punishment and the punishment be only effective when it be inflict what i have venture to suggest be not a punishment but the performance of a sacred duty a measure of self-denial from ourselves and therefore it be effective from its very inception when it be undertake even by one man and a substantial duty perform even by one single man lay the foundation of nation liberty conclusion i be most anxious for my nation for my mussalman brethren also to understand that if they want to vindicate national honor or the honor of islam it will be vindicate without a shadow of doubt not be conceive a punishment or a series of punishment but by a adequate measure of self-sacrifice i wish to speak of all we leader in term of the greatest respect but whatever respect we wish to pay they may not stop or arrest the progress of the country and i be most anxious that the country at this very critical period of its history should make its choice the choice clearly do not lie before you and I in wrest by force of arm the sceptre form the british nation but the choice lie in suffer this double wrong of the khilafat and the punjab in pocket humiliation and in accept national emasculation or vindication of indium 's honor by sacrifice to-day by every man woman and child and those who feel convinced of the rightness of thing we should make that choice to-night so citizen of trichinopoly you may not wait for the whole of indium but you can enforce the first step of non-co-operation and begin you operation even from to-morrow if you have not do so already you can surrender all you title to-morrow all the lawyer may surrender they practice to-morrow those who can not sustain body and soul by any other means can be easily support by the khilafat committee if they will give they whole time and attention to the work of that committee and if the layer will kindly do that you will find that there be no difficulty in settle you dispute by private arbitration you can nationalise you school from to-morrow if you have get the will and the determination it be difficult i know when only a few of you think these thing it be as easy as we be sit here when the whole of this vast audience be of one mind and as it be easy for you to carry that chair so be it easy for you to enforce this program from to-morrow if you have one will one determination and love for you country love for the honor of you country and religion -lrb- loud and prolonged cheer -rrb- speech at calicut mr chairman and friend -- on behalf of my brother shaukut alus and myself i wish to thank you most sincerely for the warm welcome you have extend to we before i begin to explain the purpose of we mission i have to give you the information that pir mahboob shah who be be try in sindh for sedition have be sentence to two year ' simple imprisonment i do not know exactly what the offence be with which the pir be charge i do not know whether the word attribute to he be ever speak by he but i do know that the pirsaheb decline to offer any defense and with perfect resignation he have accept he penalty for I it be a matter of sincere pleasure that the pirsaheb who exercise great influence over he follower have understand the spirit of the struggle upon which we have embark it be not by resist the authority of government that we expect to succeed in the great task before we but i do expect that we shall succeed if we understand the spirit of non-co-operation the lieutenant-governor of burma himself have tell we that the british retain they hold on indium not by the force of arm but by the force of co-operation of the people thus he have give we the remedy for any wrong that the government may do to the people whether knowingly or unknowingly and so long as we co-operate with the government so long as we support that government we become to that extent sharer in the wrong i admit that in ordinary circumstance a wise subject will tolerate the wrong of a government but a wise subject never tolerate a wrong that a government impose on the declare will of a people and i venture to submit to this great meeting that the government of indium and the imperial government have do a double wrong to indium and if we be a nation of self-respecting people conscious of its dignity conscious of its right it be not just and proper that we should stand the double humiliation that the government have heap upon we by shape and by become a predominant partner in the peace term impose on the helpless sultan of turkey the imperial government have intentionally flout the cherish sentiment of the mussalman subject of the empire the present prime minister give a deliberate pledge after consultation with he colleague when it be necessary for he to conciliate the mussalman of indium i claim to have study this khilafat question in a special manner i claim to understand the mussalman feeling on the khilafat question and i be here to declare for the tenth time that on the khilafat matter the government have wound the mussalman sentiment as they have never do before and i say without fear of contradiction that if the mussalman of indium have not exercise great self-restraint and if there be not the gospel of non-co-operation preach to they and if they have not accept it there would have be bloodsh in indium by this time i be free to confess that spilling of blood would not have avail they cause but a man who be in a state of rage whose heart have become lacerated do not count the cost of he action so much for the khilafat wrong i propose to take you for a minute to the punjab the northern end of indium and what have both government do for the punjab i be free to confess again that the crowd in amritsar go mad for a moment they be goad to madness by a wicked administration but no madness on the part of a people can justify the shed of innocent blood and what have they pay for it i venture to submit that no civilised government could ever have make the people pay the penalty and retribution that they have pay innocent man be try through mock-tribunal and imprison for life amnesty grant to they after i count of no consequence innocent unarmed man who know nothing of what be to happen be butcher in cold blood without the slightest notice modesty of woman in manianwallum woman who have do no wrong to any individual be outrage by insolent officer i want you to understand what i mean by outrage of they modesty they veil be open with he stick by a officer man who be declare to be utterly innocent by the hunter committee be make to crawl on they belly and all these wrong totally undeserved remain unavenged if it be the duty of the government of indium to punish those who be guilty of incendiarism and murder as i hold it be they duty it be doubly they duty to punish officer who insult and oppress innocent people but in the face of these official wrong we have the debate in the house of lord support official terrorism it be this double wrong the affront to islam and the injury to the manhood of the punjab that we feel bind to wipe out by non-co-operation we have pray petition agitate we have pass resolution mr mahome alus support by he friend be now wait on the british public he have plead the cause of islam in a most manful manner but he plead have fall on deaf ear and we have he word for it that whilst france and italy have show great sympathy for the cause of islam it be the british minister who have show no sympathy this show which way the british minister and the present holder of office in india mean to deal by the people there be no goodwill there be no desire to placate the people of indium the people of indium must therefore have a remedy to redress the double wrong the method of the west be violence wherever the people of the west have feel a wrong either justly or unjustly they have rebel and shed blood as i have say in my letter to the viceroy of indium half of indium do not believe in the remedy of violence the other half be too weak to offer it but the whole of indium be deeply hurt and stir by this wrong and it be for that reason that i have suggest to the people of indium the remedy of non-co-operation i consider it perfectly harmless absolutely constitutional and yet perfectly efficacious it be a remedy in which if it be properly adopt victory be certain and it be the age-old remedy of self-sacrifice be the mussalman of indium who feel the great wrong do to islam ready to make a adequate self-sacrifice all the scripture of the world teach we that there can be no compromise between justice and injustice co-operation on the part of a justice-loving man with a unjust man be a crime and if we desire to compel this great government to the will of the people as we must we must adopt this great remedy of non-co-operation and if the mussalman of indium offer non-co-operation to government in order to secure justice in the khilafat matter i believe it be duty of the hindu to help they so long as they moan be just i consider the eternal friendship between the hindu and mussalman be more important than the british connection i would prefer any day anarchy and chaos in indium to a armed peace bring about by the bayonet between the hindu and mussalman i have therefore venture to suggest to my hindu brethren that if they want to live at peace with mussalman there be a opportunity which be not go to recur for the next hundred year and i venture to assure you that if the government of indium and the imperial government come to know that there be a determination on the part of the people to redress this double wrong they would not hesitate to do what be need but in the mussalman of indium will have to take the lead in the matter you will have to commence the first stage of non-co-operation in right earnest and if you may not help this government you may not receive help from it title which be the other day title of honor be to-day in my opinion badge of we disgrace we must therefore surrender all title of honor all honorary office it will constitute a emphatic demonstration of the disapproval by the leader of the people of the act of the government lawyer must suspend they practice and must resist the power of the government which have choose to flout public opinion nor may we receive instruction from school control by government and aid by it empty of the school will constitute a demonstration of the will of the middle class of indium it be far better for the nation even to neglect the literary instruction of the child than to co-operate with a government that have strive to maintain a injustice and untruth on the khilafat and punjab matter similarly have i venture to suggest a complete boycott of reform council that will be a emphatic declaration of the part of the representative of the people that they do not desire to associate with the government so long as the two wrong continue we must equally decline to offer ourselves as recruit for the police or the military it be impossible for we to go to mesopotamium or to offer to police that country or to offer military assistance and to help the government in that blood guiltiness the last plank in the first stage be swadeshi swadeshus be intend not so much to bring pressure upon the government as to demonstrate the capacity for sacrifice on the part of the man and woman of indium when one-fourth of indium have its religion at stake and when the whole of indium have its honor at stake we can be in no mood to bedeck ourselves with french calico or silk from japan we must resolve to be satisfy with cloth weave by the humble weaver of indium in they own cottage out of yarn spin by they sister in they own home when a hundred year ago we taste be not debase and we be not lure by all the finery from the foreign country we be satisfy with the cloth produce by the man and woman in indium and if i could but in a moment revolutionize the taste of indium and make it return to its original simplicity i assure you that the god would descent to rejoice at the great act of renunciation that be the first stage in non-co-operation i hope it be as easy for you as it be easy for I to see that if indium be capable of take the first step in anything like a full measure that step will bring the redress we want i therefore do not intend to take you to the other stage of non-co-operation i would like you to rivet you attention upon the plan in the first stage you will have notice that but two thing be necessary in go through the first stage : -lrb- 1 -rrb- prefect spirit of non-violence be indispensable for non-co-operation -lrb- 2 -rrb- only a little self-sacrifice i pray to god that he will give the people of indium sufficient courage and wisdom and patience to go through this experiment of non-co-operation i think you for the great reception that you have give we and i also thank you for the great patience and exemplary silence with which you have listen to my remark _ August _ 1920 speech at mangalore mr chairman and friend -- to my brother shaukat alus and I it be a pleasure to go through this beautiful garden of indium the great reception that you give we this afternoon and this great assembly be most welcome to we if they be a demonstration of you sympathy with the cause which you have the honor to represent i assure you that we have not undertake this incessant travel in order to have reception and address no matter how cordial they may be but we have undertake this travel throughout the length and breadth of this dear motherland to place before you the position that face we to-day it be we privilege as it be we duty to place that position before the country and let she make the choice throughout we tour we have receive many address but in my humble opinion no address be more truly word than the address that be present to we at kasargod it address both of we as ` dear revered brother ' i be unable to accept the second adjective ` revere ' the word ` dear ' be dear to I i must confess but dearer than that be the expression ` brother ' the signatory to that address recognize the true significance of this travel no blood brother can possibly be more intimately relate can possibly be more unite in one purpose one aim than my brother shaukat alus and i and i consider it a proud privilege and honor to be address as blood brother to shaukat ali the contents of that address be as equally significant it state that in we unite work be represent the essence of the unity between the mussalman and hindu in indium if we two can not represent that very desirable unity if we two can not cement the relation between the two community i do not know who can then without any rhetoric and without any flowery language the address go on to describe the inwardness of the punjab and the khilafat struggle and then in simple and beautiful language it describe the spiritual significance of satyagrah and non-co-operation this be follow by a frank and simple promise although the signatory to the address realize the momentous nature of the struggle on which we have embark and although they sympathise with the struggle with they whole heart they wind up by say that even if they could not follow non-co-operation in all its detail they would do as much as they could to help the struggle and lastly in eloquent and true language they say ` if we can not rise equal to the occasion it will not be due to want of effort but to want of ability ' i can desire no better address no better promise and if you the citizen of mangalore can come up to the level of the signatory and give we just the assurance that you consider the struggle to be right and that it command you entire approval i be certain you will make all sacrifice that lie in you power for we be face to face with a peril greater than plague greater than influenza greater than earthquake and mighty flood which sometimes overwhelm this land these physical calamity can rob we of so many indian body but the calamity that have at the present moment overtaken indium touch the religious honor of a fourth of she child and the self-respect of the whole nation the khilafat wrong affect the mussalman of indium and the punjab calamity very nearly overwhelm the manhood of indium shall we in the face of this danger be weak or rise to we full height the remedy for both the wrong be the spiritual solvent of non-co-operation i call it a spiritual weapon because it demand discipline and sacrifice from we it demand sacrifice from every individual irrespective of the rest and the promise that be behind this performance of duty the promise give by every religion that i have study be sure and certain it be that there be no spotless sacrifice that have be yet offer on earth which have not carry with it its absolute adequate reward it be a spiritual weapon because it wait for no mandate from anybody except one 's own conscience it be a spiritual weapon because it bring out the best in the nation and it absolutely satisfy individual honor if a single individual take it and it will satisfy national honor if the whole nation take it up and therefore it be that i have call non-co-operation in opposition to the opinion of many of my distinguished countryman and leader -- a weapon that be infallible and absolutely practicable it be infallible and practicable because it satisfy the demand of individual conscience god above can not will not expect maulana shaukat alus to do more than he have be do for he have surrender and place at the disposal of god whom he believe to be the almighty ruler of everyone he have deliver all in the service of god and we stand before the citizen of mangalore and ask they to make they choice either to accept this precious gift that we lay at they foot or to reject it and after have listen to my message if you come to the come to the conclusion that you have no other remedy than non-co-operation for the conservation of islam and the honor of indium you will accept that remedy i ask you not to be confuse by so many bewildering issue that be place before you nor to be shake from you purpose because you see divide counsel amongst you leader this be one of the necessary limitation of any spiritual or any other struggle that have ever be fight on this earth it be because it come so suddenly that it confuse the mind if the heart be not tune properly and we would be perfect human being on this earth if in all of we be find absolutely perfect correspondence between the mind and the heart but those of you who have be follow the newspaper controversy will find that no matter what division of opinion exist amongst we journal and leader there be unanimity that the remedy be efficacious if it can be keep free from violence and if it be adopt on a large scale i admit the difficulty the virtue however lie in surmount it we can not possibly combine violence with a spiritual weapon like non-co-operation we do not offer spotless sacrifice if we take the life of other in offer we own absolute freedom from violence be therefore it condition precedent to non-co-operation but i have faith in my country to know that when it have assimilate the principle of the doctrine in the fullest extent it will respond to it and in no case will india make any headway whatsoever until she have learn the lesson of self-sacrifice even if this country be to take up the doctrine of the sword which god forbid it will have to learn the lesson of self-sacrifice the second difficulty suggest be the want of solidarity of the nation i accept it too but that difficulty i have already answer by say that it be a remedy that can be take up by individual for individual and by the nation for national satisfaction and therefore even if the whole nation do not take up non-co-operation the individual success which may be obtain by individual take up non-co-operation will stand to they own credit as of the nation to which they belong the first stage in my humble opinion be incredibly easy inasmuch as it do not involve any very great sacrifice if you khan bahadur and other title-holder be to renounce they title i venture to submit that whilst the renunciation will stand to the credit and honor of the nation it will involve a little or no sacrifice on the contrary they will not only have surrender no earthly riches but they will have gain the applause of the nation let we see what it mean this first step the able editor of _ hindu _ mr kastariranga iyengar and almost every journalist in the country be agree that the renunciation of title be a necessary and a desirable step and if these choose people of the government be without exception to surrender they title to government give notice that the heart of indium be doubly wound in that the honor of indium and of muslim religion be at stake and that therefore they can no longer retain they title i venture to suggest that this they step which cost not a single penny either to they or to the nation will be a effective demonstration of the national will take the second step or the second item of non-co-operation i know there be strong opposition to the boycott of council the opposition when you begin to analyze it mean not that the step be faulty or that it be not likely to succeed but it be due to the belief that the whole country will not respond to it and that the moderate will steal into the council i ask the citizen of mangalore to dispel that fear from you heart unite the voter of mangalore can make it impossible for either a moderate or a extremist or any other form of leader to enter the council as you representative this step involve no sacrifice of money no sacrifice of honor but the gain of prestige for the whole nation and i venture to suggest to you that this one step alone if it be take with any degree of unanimity even by the extremist can bring about the desire relief but if all do not respond the individual need not be afraid he at least will have lay the foundation for true self progress let he have the comfort that he at least have wash he hand clean of the guilt of the government then i come to the member of the profession which one time i use to carry on i have venture to ask the lawyer of indium to suspend they practice and withdraw they support from a government which no longer stand for justice pure and unadulterated for the nation and the step be good for the individual lawyer who take it and be good for the nation if all the lawyer take it and so for the government and the government aid school i must confess that i can not reconcile my conscience to my child go to government school and to the program of non-co-operation be intend to withdraw all support from government and to decline all help from it i will not tax you patience by take you through the other item of non-co-operation important as they be but i have venture to place before you four very important and forcible step any one of which if fully take up contain in it possibility of success swadeshus be preach as a item of non-co-operation as a demonstration of the spirit of sacrifice and it be a item which every man woman and child can take up _ August _ 1920 speech at bezwada as i say this morning one essential condition for the progress of indium be hindu-muslim unity i understand that there be a little bit of bicker between hindu and mussalman to-day in bezwada my brother maulana shaukat alus adjust the dispute between the two community and he illustrate in he own person the entire efficacy of one item in the first stage of non-co-operation he sit without any vakil appear before he for either party to arbitrate on the dispute between they he require no postponement for the consideration of the question from time to time he fee consist in a broken lead pencil that be what we should do if all the lawyer suspend practice and set up arbitration for the settlement of private dispute but why be there any quarrel at all it be laughable in the extreme when you come to think of it because the hindu seem to have play music whilst pass the mosque i think it be improper for they to do so hindu moslem unity do not mean that hindu should cease to respect the prejudice and sentiment cherish by mussalman and as this question of music have give rise to many a quarrel between the two community it behove the hindu if they want to cultivate true hindu-moslem unity to refrain from act which they know injure the sentiment of they mussalman brethren we may not take undue advantage of the great spirit of toleration that be develop in mussalman and do thing likely to irritate they it be never a matter of principle for a hindu procession to continue play music before mosque and now that we desire voluntarily to respect mussalman sentiment we should be doubly careful at a time when hindu be offer assistance to mussalman in they trouble that assistance should be give in all humility and without any arrogation of rights to my mussalman brethren i would say that it would become they dignity to restrain themselves and not feel irritated when any hindu have do anything to irritate they religious sentiment but in any event you have today present to you a remedy for the settlement of any such issue we must settle we dispute by arbitration as be do this after-noon you can not always get a moulana shankat alus exercise unrivalled influence on the community but we can always get people enough in we own village town and district who exercise influence over such village and town and command the confidence of both the community the offended party should consider it its duty to approach they and not to take the law in its own hand it give I much pleasure to announce to you that mr kaleswar rao have consent to refrain from stand for election to the new legislative council you will be also please to know that mr gulam nohiuddin have resign he honorary magistrateship i hope that both these patriot will not consider that they have do they last duty by they act of renunciation but i hope they will regard they act as a prelude to act of greater purpose and greater energy and i hope they will take in hand the work of educate the electorate in they district regard boycott of council i have say elsewhere that never for another century will india be face with a conjunction of event that face it to-day the cloud that have descend upon islam have solidify the moslem world as nothing else could have it have awaken the man and woman of mussulman indium from they deep sleep inasmuch as a single panjabus be make to crawl on he belly in the famous street of amitsar i hold that the whole of be make to crawl on its belly and if we want to straighten up ourselves from that crawl position and stand erect before the whole world it require a tremendous effort he the viceroy in he viceregal pronouncement at the opening of the council be please to say that he do not desire to make any remark on the punjab event he treat they as a closed chapter and refer we to the future verdict of history i venture to tell you the citizen of bezwada that indium will have deserve to crawl in that lane if she accept this pronouncement as the final answer and if we want to stand erect before the whole world it be impossible for a single child man or woman in indium to rest until fullest reparation have be do for the punjab wrong similarly with reference to the khilafat grievance the mussalman of indium in my humble opinion will forfeit all title to consider themselves the follower of the great prophet in whose name they recite the kalama day in and day out they will forfeit they title if they do not put they shoulder to the wheel and lift this cloud that be hang on they but we shall make a serious blunder indium will commit suicide if we do not understand and appreciate the force that be array against we we have get to face a mighty government with all its power range against we this compose of man who be able courageous capable of make sacrifice it be a government which do not scruple to use means fair or foul in order to gain its end no craft be above that government it resort to frightfulness terrorism it resort to bribery in the shape of title honor and high office it administer opiate in the shape of reform in essence then it be a autocracy double distil in the guise of democracy the greatest gift of a crafty cunning man be worthless so long as cunning reside in he heart it be a government represent a civilisation which be purely material and godless i have give to you these quality of this government in order not to excite you angry passion but in order that you may appreciate the force that be match against you anger will serve no purpose we shall have to meet ungodliness by godliness we shall have to meet they untruth by truth we shall have to meet they cunning and they craft by openness and simplicity we shall have to meet they terrorism and frightfulness by bravery and it be a unbending bravery which be demand of every man woman and child we must meet they organization by greater organising ability we must meet they discipline by grater discipline and we must meet they sacrifice by infinitely greater sacrifice and if we be in a position to show these quality in a full measure i have not the slightest doubt that we shall win this battle if really we have fear of god in we we prayer will give we the strength to secure victory god have always come to the help of the helpless and we need not go before any earthly power for help you hear this morning of the bravery of the sword and the bravery of suffer for I personally i have forever reject the bravery of the sword but to-day it be not my purpose to demonstrate to you the final ineffectiveness of the sword but he who run may see that before indium possess itself a sword which will be more than a match for the force of europe it will he generation indium may resort to the destruction of life and property here and there but such destructive case serve no purpose i have therefore present to you a weapon call the bravery of suffer otherwise call non-co-operation it be a bravery which be open to the weakest among the weak it be open to woman and child the power of suffering be the prerogative of nobody and if only 300 million of indian could show the power of suffer in order to redress a grievous wrong do to the nation or to its religion i make bold to say that indium will never require to draw the sword and unless we be able to show a adequate measure of sacrifice we shall lose this battle no one need tell I that indium have not get this power of suffer every father and mother be witness to what i be about to say viz that every father and mother have show in the domestic affair matchless power of suffering and if we have only developed national consciousness if we have develop sufficient regard for we religion we shall have develop power of suffer in the national and religious field consider in these term the first stage in non-co-operation be the simplest and the easiest state if the title-holder of indium consider that indium be suffer from a grievous wrong both as regard the punjab and the khilafat be it any suffer on they part to renounce they title to-day what be the measure of the suffering await the lawyer who be call upon to suspend practice when compare to the great benefit which be in store for the nation and if thy parent of indium will summon up courage to sacrifice secular education they will have give they child the real education of a life-time for they will have learn the value of religion and national honor and i ask you the citizen of bezwada to think well before you accept the loaf and fish in the form of government office set they on one side and set national honor on the other and make you service what sacrifice be there involve in the individual renounce he candidature for legislative council the council be a tempting bait all kind of argument be be advance in favor of join the council indium will sacrifice the opportunity of gain she liberty if she touch they it pass comprehension how we who have know this government who have read the viceregal pronouncement how we who have know they determination not to give justice in the punjab and the khilafat matter can gain any benefit by co-operation constructive or obstructive with this government but the nationalist belong to a great popular party tell we that if they do not contest these scat the moderate will get in surely it be nothing but a exhibition of want of courage and faith in we own cause to feel that we must enter the council lest moderate should get in moderate believe in the possibility of obtain justice at the hand of the government nationalist have on the other hand fill the platform with denunciation of the government and its measure how can the nationalist ever hope to gain anything by enter the council hold the belief that they do they will better represent the popular will if they wring justice from the government by means of non-co-operation a calculate spirit at the present moment in the history of indium will prove its ruin i therefore tender my hearty congratulation to those who have announce they resignation of candidature or honorary office and i hope that they example will prove infectious i have be tell and i believe it myself from what i have see that the andhrus be a brave courageous and spiritually-inclined people i venture therefore to ask my andhra brethren whether they have understand the spirituality of this beautiful doctrine of non-co-operation if they have i hope they will not wait for a single moment for a mandate from the congress or the moslem league they will understand that a spiritual weapon be god whether it be wield by one or many i therefore invite you to go to calcutta with a unite will and a unite purpose sanctify by a spirit of sacrifice with a will of you own to convert those who be still undecided about the spirituality or the practicability of the weapon i thank you for the attention and patience with which you have listen to I i pray to the almighty that he may give you wisdom and courage that be so necessary at the present moment -- _ August 1920 _ the congress the largest and the most important congress ever hold have come and go it be the biggest demonstration ever hold against the present system of government the president utter the whole truth when he say that it be a congress in which instead of the president and the leader drive the people the people drive he and the latter it be clear to every one on the platform that the people have take the rein in they own hand the platform would gladly have move at a slower pace the congress give one day to a full discussion of the creed and vote solidly for it with but two dissentient after two night ' sleep over the discussion it give one day to a discussion of non-co-operation resolution and vote for it with unparalleled enthusiasm it give the last day to listen to the whole of the remain thirty-two article of the constitution which be read and translate word for word by maulana mahome alus in a loud and clear voice it show that it be intelligently follow the reading of it for there be dissent when article eight be reach it refer to non-interference by the congress in the internal affair of the native state the congress would not have pass the proviso if it have mean that it could even voice the feeling of the people reside in the territory rule by the prince happily it resolution suggest the advisability of establish responsible government in they territory enable I to illustrate to the audience that the proviso do not preclude the congress from ventilate the grievance and aspiration of the subject of these state whilst it clearly prevent the congress from take any executive action in connection with they as for instance hold a hostile demonstration in the native state against any action of theirs the congress claim to dictate to the government but it can not do so by the very nature of its constitution in respect of the native state thus the congress have take three important step after the greatest deliberation it have express its determination in the clearest possible term to attain complete null-government if possible still in association with the british people but even without if necessary it propose to do so only by means that be honorable and non-violent it have introduce fundamental change in the constitution regulate its activity and have perform a act of self-denial in voluntarily restrict the number of delegate to one for every fifty thousand of the population of indium and have insist upon the delegate be the real representative of those who want to take any part in the political life of the country and with a view to ensure the representation of all political party it have accept the principle of single transferable vote it have reaffirm the non-co-operation resolution of the special session and amplify it in every respect it have emphasise the necessity of non-violence and lay down that the attainment of swaraj be conditional upon the complete harmony between the component part of indium and have therefore inculcate hindu-muslim unity the hindu delegate have call upon they leader to settle dispute between brahmin and non-brahmin and have urge upon the religious head the necessity of get rid of the poison of untouchability the congress have tell the parent of school-going child and the lawyer that they have not respond sufficiently to the call of the nation and and that they must make greater effort in do so it therefore follow that the lawyer who do not respond quickly to the call for suspension and the parent who persist in keep they child in government and aid institution must find themselves drop out from the public life of the country the country call upon every man and woman in indium to do they full share but of the detail of the non-co-operation resolution i must write later who be disloyal mr montagu have discover a new definition of disloyalty he consider my suggestion to boycott the visit of the prince of wale to be disloyal and some newspaper take the cue from he have call person who have make the suggestion ` unmannerly ' they have even attribute to these ` unmannerly ' person the suggestion of boycott the prince i draw a sharp and fundamental distinction between boycott the prince and boycott any welcome arrange for he personally i would extend the heartiest welcome to he royal highness if he come or could come without official patronage and the protect wing of the government of the day be the heir to a constitutional monarch the prince 's movement be regulate and dictate by the minister no matter how much the dictation may be conceal beneath diplomatically polite language in suggest the boycott therefore the promoter have suggest boycott of a insolent bureaucracy and dishonest minister of he majesty you can not have it both way it be true that under a constitutional monarchy the royalty be above politics but you can not send the prince on a political visit for the purpose of make political capital out of he and then complain that those who will not play you game and in order to checkmate you proclaim boycott of the royal visit do not know constitutional usage for the prince 's visit be not for pleasure he royal highness be to come in mr lloyd george 's word as the ambassador of the british nation in other word he own ambassador in order to issue a certificate of merit to he and possibly to give the minister a new lease of life the wish be design to consolidate and strengthen a power that spell mischief for indium even we it be mr montagu have foresee that the welcome will probably be excel by any hitherto extend to royalty meaning that the people be not really and deeply affect and stir by the official atrocity in the punjab and the manifestly dishonest breach of official declaration on the khilafat with the knowledge that indium be bleed at heart the government of indium should have tell he majesty 's minister that the moment be inopportune for send the prince i venture to submit that it be add insult to injury to bring the prince and through he visit to steal honor and further prestige for a government that deserve to be dismiss with disgrace i claim that i prove my loyalty by say that indium be in no mood be too deeply in mourning to take part in and to welcome he royal highness and that the minister and the indian government show they disloyalty by make the prince a catspaw of they deep political game if they persist it be the clear duty of indium to have nothing to do with the visit crusade against non-co-operation i have most carefully read the manifesto address by sir narayan chandavarkar and other dissuade the people from join the non co-operation movement i have expect to find some solid argument against non-co-operation but to my great regret i have find in it nothing but distortion -lrb- no doubt unconscious -rrb- of the great religion and history the manifesto say that ` non-co-operation be deprecate by the religious tenet and tradition of we motherland nay of all the religion that have save and elevate the human race ' i venture to submit that the bhagwad gita be a gospel of non-co-operation between force of darkness and those of light if it be to be literally interpret arjun represent a just cause be enjoin to engage in bloody warfare with the unjust kaurava tulsida advise the sant -lrb- the good -rrb- to shun the asant -lrb- the evil-doer -rrb- the zendavesta represent a perpetual dual between ormuzd and ahriman between whom there be no compromise to say of the bible that it taboo non-co-operation be not to know jesus a prince among passive resister who uncompromisingly challenge the might of the sadducee and the pharisee and for the sake of truth do not hesitate to divide son from they parent and what do the prophet of islam do he non-co-operated in mecca in a most active manner so long as he life be not in danger and wipe the dust of mecca off he foot when he find that he and he follower might have uselessly to perish and flee to medina and return when he be strong enough to give battle to he opponent the duty of non-co-operation with unjust man and king be as strictly enjoin by all the religion as be the duty of co-operation with just man and king indeed most of the scripture of the world seem even to go beyond non-co-operation and prefer a violence to effeminate submission to a wrong the hindu religious tradition of which the manifesto speak clearly prove the duty of non-co-operation prahlad dissociate himself from he father meerabaus from she husband bibhishan from he brutal brother the manifesto speaking of the secular aspect say ` the history of nation afford no instance to show that it -lrb- mean non-co-operation -rrb- have when employ succeed and do good ' one most recent instance of brilliant success of non-co-operation be that of general botha who boycott lord milner 's reform council and thereby procure a perfect constitution for he country the dukhobor of russium offer non-co-operation and a handful though they be they grievance so deeply move the civilized world that canada offer they a home where they form a prosperous community in indium instance can be give by the dozen in which in little principality the raiyat when deeply grieve by they chief have cut off all connection with they and bent they to they will i know of no instance in history where well-managed non-co-operation have fail hitherto i have give historical instance of bloodless non-co-operation i will not insult the intelligence of the reader by cite historical instance of non-co-operation combine with violence but i be free to confess that there be on record as many success as failure in violent non-co-operation and it be because i know this fact that i have place before the country a non-violent scheme in which if at all work satisfactorily success be a certainty and in which non-response means no harm for if even one man non-co-operate say by resign some office he have gain not lose that be its ethical or religious aspect for its political result naturally it require polymerous support i fear therefore no disastrous result from non-co-operation save for a outbreak of violence on the part of the people whether under provocation or otherwise i would risk violence a thousand time than risk the emasculation of a whole race speech at muzaffarabad before a crowded meeting of mussalman in the muzaffarabad bombay hold on the 29th July 1920 speak on the impending non-co-operation which commence on the 1st of August mr gandhus say : the time for speech on non-co-operation be past and the time for practice have arrive but two thing be needful for complete success a environment free from any violence on the part of the people and a spirit of self-sacrifice non-co-operation as the speaker have conceive it be a impossibility in a atmosphere surcharge with the spirit of violence violence be a exhibition of anger and any such exhibition be dissipation of valuable energy subduing of one 's anger be a store up of national energy which when set free in a order manner would produce astounding result he conception of non-co-operation do not involve rapine plunder incendiarism and all the concomitant of mass madness he scheme presuppose ability on they part to control all the force of evil if therefore any disorderliness be find on the part of the people which they could not control he for one would certainly help the government to control they in the presence of disorder it would be for he a choice of evil and evil through he consider the present government to be he would not hesitate for the time be to help the government to control disorder but he have faith in the people he believe that they know that the cause could only be win by non-violent method to put it at the lowest the people have not the power even if they have the will to resist with brute strength the unjust government of europe who have in the intoxication of they success disregard every canon of justice deal so cruelly by the only islamic power in europe in non-co-operation they have a matchless and powerful weapon it be a sign of religious atrophy to sustain a unjust government that support a injustice by resort to untruth and camouflage so long therefore as the government do not purge itself of the canker of injustice and untruth it be they duty to withdraw all help from it consistently with they ability to preserve order in the social structure the first stage of non-co-operation be therefore arrange so as to involve minimum of danger to public peace and minimum of sacrifice on the part of those who participate in the movement and if they might not help a evil government nor receive any favor from it it follow that they must give up all title of honor which be no longer a proud possession lawyer who be in reality honorary officer of the court should cease to support court that uphold the prestige of a unjust government and the people must be able to settle they dispute and quarrel by private arbitration similarly parent should withdraw they child from the public school and they must evolve a system of national education or private education totally independent of the government a insolent government conscious of its brute strength might laugh at such withdrawal by the people especially as the law court and school be suppose to help the people but he have not a shadow of doubt that the moral effect of such a step could not possibly be lose even upon a government whose conscience have become stifle by the intoxication of power he have hesitation in accept swadeshus as a plank in non-co-operation to he swadeshus be as dear as life itself but he have no desire to smuggle in swadeshus through the khilafat movement if it could not legitimately help that movement but conceive as non-co-operation be in a spirit of self-sacrifice swadeshus have a legitimate place in the movement pure swadeshus mean sacrifice of the liking for finery he ask the nation to sacrifice its liking for the finery of europe and japan and be satisfy with the coarse but beautiful fabric weave on they handloom out of yarn spin by million of they sister if the nation have become really awaken to a sense of the danger to its religion and its self-respect it could not but perceive the absolute and immediate necessity of the adoption of swadeshus in its intense form and if the people of indium adopt swadeshus with the religious zeal he beg to assure they that its adoption would arm they with a new power and would produce a unmistakable impression throughout the whole world he therefore expect the mussalman to give the lead by give up all the finery they be so fond of and adopt the simple cloth that could be produce by the manual labor of they sister and brethren in they own cottage and he hope that the hindu would follow suit it be a sacrifice in which the whole nation every man woman and child could take part ridicule replace repression have he excellency the viceroy not make it impossible by he defiant attitude on the punjab and the khilafat i would have tender he hearty congratulation for substitute ridicule for repression in order to kill a movement distasteful to he for tear from its context and read by itself he excellency 's discourse on non-co-operation be unexceptionable it be a symptom of translation from savagery to civilization pour ridicule on one 's opponent be a approve method in civilised politics and if the method be consistently continue it will mark a important improvement upon the official barbarity of the punjab he interpretation of mr montagu 's statement about the movement be also not open to any objection whatsoever without doubt a government have the right to use sufficient force to put down a actual outbreak of violence but i regret to have to confess that this attempt to pour ridicule on the movement read in conjunction with the sentiment on the punjab and the khilafat precede the ridicule seem to show that he excellency have make it a virtue of necessity he have not finally abandon the method of terrorism and frightfulness but he find the movement be conduct in such a open and truthful manner that any attempt to kill it by violent repression would not expose he not only to ridicule but contempt of all right-thinking man let we however examine the adjective use by he excellency to kill the movement by laugh at it it be ` futile ' ` ill-advised ' ` intrinsically insane ' ` unpractical ' ` visionary ' he have round off the adjective by describe the movement as ` most foolish of all foolish scheme ' he excellency have become so impatient of it that he have use all he vocabulary for show the magnitude of the ridiculous nature of non-co-operation unfortunately for he excellency the movement be likely to grow with ridicule as it be certain to flourish on repression no vital movement can be kill except by the impatience ignorance or laziness of its author a movement can not be ` insane ' that be conduct by man of action as i claim the member of the non-co-operation committee be it be hardly ` unpractical ' see that if the people respond every one admit that it will achieve the end at the same time it be perfectly true that if there be no response from the people the movement will be popularly describe as ` visionary ' it be for the nation to return a effective answer by organise non-co-operation and change ridicule into respect ridicule be like repression both give place to respect when they fail to produce the intended effect the viceregal pronouncement it may be that have lose faith in he excellency 's probity and capacity to hold the high office of viceroy of indium i now read he speech with a bias mind but the speech he excellency deliver at the time of opening of the council show to I a mental attitude which make association with he or he government impossible for self-respecting man the remark on the punjab mean a flat refusal to grant redress he would have we to ` concentrate on the problem of the immediate future ' the immediate future be to compel repentance on the part of the government on the punjab matter of this there be no sign on the contrary he excellency resist the temptation to reply to he critic mean thereby that he have not change he opinion on the many vital matter affect the honor of indium he be ` content to leave the issue to the verdict of history ' now this kind of language in my opinion be calculate further to inflame the indian mind of what use can a favourable verdict of history be to man who have be wrong and who be still under the heel of officer who have show themselves utterly unfit to hold office of trust and responsibility the plea for co-operation be to say the least hypocritical in the face of the determination to refuse justice to the punjab can a patient who be suffer from a intolerable ache be soothe by the most tempting dish place before he will he not consider it mockery on the part of the physician who so tempt he without cure he of he pain he excellency be if possible even less happy on the khilafat so far as any government could say this trustee for the nation we press upon the peace conference the view of indian moslem but notwithstanding we effort on they behalf we be threaten with a campaign of non-co-operation because forsooth the ally power find themselves unable to accept the contention advance by indian moslem this be most misleading if not untruthful he excellency know that the peace term be not the work of the ally power he know that mr lloyd george be the prime author of term and that the latter have never repudiate he responsibility for they he have with amazing audacity justify they in spite of he consider pledge to the moslem of indium regard constantinople thrace and the rich and renowned land of asia minor it be not truthful to saddle responsibility for the term on the ally power when great britain alone have promote they the offence of the viceroy become greater when we remember that he admit the justness of the muslim claim he could not have ` press ' it if he do not admit its justice i venture to think that he excellency by he pronouncement on the punjab have strengthen the nation in its effort to seek a remedy to compel redress of the two wrong before it can make anything of the so-called reform from ridicule to -- it will be admit that non-co-operation have pass the stage ridicule whether it will now be meet by repression or respect remain to be see opinion have already be express in these column that ridicule be a approve and civilized method of opposition the viceregal ridicule though express in unnecessarily impolite term be not open to exception but the testing time have now arrive in a civilized country when ridicule fail to kill a movement it begin to command respect opponent meet it by respectful and cogent argument and the mutual behavior of rival party never become violent each party seek to convert the other or draw the uncertain element towards its side by pure argument and reasoning there be little doubt now that the boycott of the council will be extensive if it be not complete the student have become disturbed important institution may any day become truly national pandit motilal nehru 's great renunciation of a legal practice which be probably second to nobody 's be by itself a event calculate to change ridicule into respect it ought to set people think seriously about they own attitude there must be something very wrong about we government -- to warrant the step pundit motilal nehru have take post graduate student have give up they fellowship medical student have refuse to appear for they final examination non-co-operation in these circumstance can not be call a inane movement either the government must bend to the will of the people which be be express in no unmistakable term through non-co-operation or it must attempt to crush the movement by repression any force use by a government under any circumstance be not repression a open trial of a person accuse of have advocate method of violence be not repression every state have the right to put down or prevent violence by force but the trial of mr zafar alus khan and two moulvi of panipat show that the government be seek not to put down or prevent violence but to suppress expression of opinion to prevent the spread of disaffection this be repression the trial be the beginning of it it have not still assume a virulent form but if these trial do not result in still the propaganda it be highly likely that severe repression will be resort to by the government the only other way to prevent the spread of disaffection be to remove the cause thereof and that would be to respect the grow response of the country to the program of non-co-operation it be too much to expect repentance and humility from a government intoxicate with success and power we must therefore assume that the second stage in the government program will be repression grow in violence in the same ratio as the progress of non-co-operation and if the movement survive repression the day of victory of truth be near we must then be prepare for prosecution punishment even up to deportation we must evolve the capacity for go on with we program without the leader that mean capacity for self-government and as no government in the world can possibly put a whole nation in prison it must yield to its demand or abdication in favor of a government suit to that nation it be clear that abstention from violence and persistence in the program be we only and surest chance of attain we end the government have its choice either to respect the movement or to try to repress it by barbarous method we choice be either to succumb to repression or to continue in spite of repression to every englishman in indium dear friend i wish that every englishman will see this appeal and give thoughtful attention to it let I introduce myself to you in my humble opinion no indian have co-operate with the british government more than i have for a unbroken period of twenty-nine year of public life in the face of circumstance that might well have turn any other man into a rebel i ask you to believe I when i tell you that my co-operation be not base on the fear of the punishment provide by you law or any other selfish motive it be free and voluntary co-operation base on the belief that the sum total of the activity of the british government be for the benefit of indium i put my life in peril four time for the sake of the empire -- at the time of the boer war when i be in charge of the ambulance corps whose work be mention in general buller 's dispatch at the time of the zulu revolt in natal when i be in charge of a similar corps at the time of the commencement of the late war when i raise a ambulance corps and as a result of the strenuous training have a severe attack of pleurisy and lastly in fulfilment of my promise to lord chelmsford at the war conference in delhus i throw myself in such a active recruiting campaign in kuira district involve long and try march that i have a attack of dysentry which prove almost fatal i do all this in the full belief that act such as mine must gain for my country a equal status in the empire so late as last December i plead hard for a trustful co-operation i fully believe that mr lloyd george would redeem he promise to the mussalman and that the revelation of the official atrocity in the punjab would secure full reparation for the punjabi but the treachery of mr lloyd george and its appreciation by you and the condonation of the punjab atrocity have completely shatter my faith in the good intention of the government and the nation which be support it but though my faith in you good intention be go i recognize you bravery and i know that what you will not yield to justice and reason you will gladly yield to bravery _ see what this empire mean to india _ exploitation of indium 's resource for the benefit of great britain a ever-increasing military expenditure and a civil service the most expensive in the world extravagant working of every department in utter disregard of indium 's poverty disarmament and consequent emasculation of a whole nation lest a armed nation might imperil the life of a handful of you in we midst traffic in intoxicate liquor and drug for the purpose of sustain a top heavy administration progressively representative legislation in order to suppress a evergrowing agitation seek to give expression to a nation 's agony degrading treatment of indian reside in you dominion and you have show total disregard of we feeling by glorify the punjab administration and flout the mosulman sentiment i know you would not mind if we could fight and wrest the sceptre form you hand you know that we be powerless to do that for you have ensure we incapacity to fight in open and honorable battle bravery on the battlefield be thus impossible for we bravery of the soul still remain open to we i know you will respond to that also i be engage in evoke that bravery non-co-operation means nothing less than training in self-sacrifice why should we co-operate with you when we know that by you administration of this great country we be lift daily enslave in a increase degree this response of the people to my appeal be not due to my personality i would like you to dismiss I and for that matter the alus brother too from you consideration my personality will fail to evoke any response to anti-muslim cry if i be foolish enough to rise it as the magic name of the alus brother would fail to inspire the mussalman with enthusiasm if they be madly to raise in anti-hindu cry people flock in they thousand to listen to we because we to-day represent the voice of a nation groan under iron heel the alus brother be you friend as i be and still be my religion forbid I to bear any ill-will towards you i would not raise my hand against you even if i have the power i expect to conquer you only by my suffer the alus brother will certainly draw the sword if they could in defense of they religion and they country but they and i have make common cause with the people of indium in they attempt to voice they feeling and to find a remedy for they distress you be in search of a remedy to suppress this rise ebullition of national feeling i venture to suggest to you that the only way to suppress it be to remove the cause you have yet the power you can repent of the wrong do to indian you can compel mr lloyd george to redeem he promise i assure you he have keep many escape door you can compel the viceroy to retire in favor of a better one you can revise you idea about sir michael o'dwyer and general dyer you can compel the government to summon a conference of the recognize lender of the people duly elect by they and represent all shades of opinion so as to devise means for grant _ swaraj _ in accordance with the wish of the people of indium but this you can not do unless you consider every indian to be in reality you equal and brother i ask for no patronage i merely point out to you as a friend as honorable solution of a grave problem the other solution namely repression be open to you i prophesy that it will fail it have begin already the government have already imprison two brave man of panipat for hold and express they opinion freely another be on he trial in lahore for have express similar opinion one in the oudh district be already imprison another await judgment you should know what be go on in you midst we propaganda be be carry on in anticipation of repression i invite you respectfully to choose the better way and make common cause with the people of indium whose salt you be eat to seek to thwart they inspiration be disloyalty to the country i be you faithful friend m k gandhus one step enough for I mr stoke be a christian who want to follow the light that god give he he have adopt indium as he home he be watch the non-co-operation movement from the kotgarh hill where he be live in isolation from the indium of the plain and serve the hillman he have contribute three article on non-co-operation to the column of the servant of calcutta and other papers i have the pleasure of read they during my bengal tour mr stoke approve of non-co-operation but dread the consequence that may follow complete success _ ie _ evacuation of indium by the british he conjure up before he mind a picture of indium invade by the afghan from the north-west plunder by the gurkha from the hill for I i say with cardinal newman : ' i do not ask to see the distant scene one step enough for I ' the movement be essentially religious the business of every god-fearing man be to dissociate himself from evil in total disregard of consequence he must have faith in a good deed produce only a good result : that in my opinion be the gita doctrine of work without attachment god do not permit he to peep into the future he follow truth although the following of it may endanger he very life he know that it be better to die in the way of god than to live in the way of satan therefore who ever be satisfied that this government represent the activity of satan have no choice leave to he but to dissociate himself from it however let we consider the worst that can happen to india on a sudden evacuation of indium by the british what do it matter that the gurkha and the pathan attack we surely we would be better able to deal with they violence than we be with the continue violence moral and physical perpetrate by the present government mr stoke do not seem to eschew the use of physical force surely the combine labor of the rajput the sikh and the mussalman warrior in a unite indium may be trust to deal with plunderer from any or all the side imagine however the worst : japan overwhelming we from the bay of bengal the gurkha from the hill and the pathan from the north-west if we not succeed in drive they out we make term with they and drive they at the first opportunity this will be a more manly course than a hopeless submission to a admittedly wrongful state but i refuse to contemplate the dismal out-look if the movement succeed through non-violent non-co-operation and that be the supposition mr stoke have start with the english whether they remain or retire they will do so as friend and under a well-ordered agreement as between partner i still believe in the goodness of human nature whether it be english or any other i therefore do not believe that the english will leave in a night and do i consider the gurkha and the afghan be incorrigible thief and robber without ability to respond to purify influence i do not if indium return to she spirituality it will react upon the neighbouring tribe she will interest herself in the welfare of these hardy but poor people and even support they if necessary not out of fear but as a matter of neighbourly duty she will have deal with japan simultaneously with the british japan will not want to invade indium if indium have learn to consider it a sin to use a single foreign article that she can manufacture within she own border she produce enough to eat and she man and woman can without difficulty manufacture enough to clothe to cover they nakedness and protect themselves from heat and cold we become prey to invasion if we excite the greed of foreign nation by deal with they under a feeling dependence on they we must learn to be independent of every one of they whether therefore we finally succeed through violence or non-violence in my opinion the prospect be by no means so gloomy as mr stoke have imagine any conceivable prospect be in my opinion less black than the present unmanly and helpless condition and we can not do better than follow out fearlessly and with confidence the open and honorable program of non-violence and sacrifice that we have map for ourselves the need for humility the spirit of non-violence necessarily lead to humility non-violence mean reliance on god the rock of age if we would seek he aid we must approach he with a humble and a contrite heart non-co-operationist may not trade upon they amazing success at the congress we must act even as the mango tree which drop as it bear fruit its grandeur lie in its majestic lowliness but one hear of non-co-operationist be insolent and intolerant in they behavior towards those who differ from they i know that they will lose all they majesty and glory if they betray any inflation whilst we may not be dissatisfy with the progress make so far we have little to we credit to make we feel proud we have to sacrifice much more than we have do to justify pride much less elation thousand who flock to the congress pandal have undoubtedly give they intellectual assent to the doctrine but few have follow it out in practice leave aside the pleader how many parent have withdraw they child from school how many of those who register they vote in favor of non-co-operation have take to hand-spinning or discard the use of all foreign cloth non-co-operation be not a movement of brag bluster or bluff it be a test of we sincerity it require solid and silent self-sacrifice it challenge we honesty and we capacity for national work it be a movement that aim at translate idea into action and the more we do the more we find that much more must be do than we have expect and this thought of we imperfection must make we humble a non-co-operationist strive to compel attention and to set a example not by he violence but by he unobtrusive humility he allow he solid action to speak for he creed he strength lie in he reliance upon the correctness of he position and the conviction of it grow most in he opponent when he least interpose he speech between he action and he opponent speech especially when it be haughty betray want of confidence and it make one 's opponent sceptical about the reality of the act itself humility therefore be the key to quick success i hope that every non-co-operationist will recognize the necessity of be humble and self-restrained it be because so little be really require to be do because all of that little depend entirely upon ourselves that i have venture the belief that swaraj be attainable in less than one year some question answer i write to thank you for yours of the 7th instant and especially for you request that i should after read you writings in young indium on non-co-operation give a full and frank criticism of they i know that you sole desire be to find out the truth and to act accordingly and hence i venture to make the follow remark in the issue of may 5th you say that non-co-operation be not even anti-government but surely to refuse to have anything to do with the government to the extent of not serve it and of not pay its tax be actually if not theoretically anti-government and such a course must ultimately make all government impossible again you say it be the inherent right of a subject to refuse to assist a government that will not listen to he leave aside the question of the ethical soundness of this proposition may i ask which government in the present case have not the indian government do all it possibly can in the matter then if its attempt to voice the request of indium should fail would it be fair and just to do anything against it would not the proper course be non-co-operation with the supreme council of the ally include great britain if it be find that the latter have fail properly to support the demand of the indian government and people it seem to I that in all you writings and speech you forget that in the present question both government and people be as one and if they fail to get what they justly want how do the question of non-co-operation arise hindu and englishman and the government be all at present shoulder in a full-hearted manner the burden that muhomedan of indium be carry etc etc but suppose we fail of we object -- what then be we all to refuse to co-operate and with whom might i recommend the consideration of the follow course of conduct -lrb- 1 -rrb- wait and see what the actual term of the treaty with turkey be -lrb- 2 -rrb- if they be not in accordance with the aspiration and recommendation of the government and the people of indium the every legitimate effort should be make to have the term revise -lrb- 3 -rrb- to the bitter end co-operate with a government that co-operate with we and only when it refuse co-operation go in for non-co-operation so far i personally see no reason whatsoever for non-co-operation with the indian government and till it fail to voice the need and demand of indium as a whole there can be no reason the indian government do some time make mistake but in the khilafat matter it be sound and therefore deserve or ought to have the sympathetic and whole-hearted co-operation of every one in indium i hope that you will kindly consider the above and perhaps you will be able to find time for a reply in _ young indium _ i gladly make room for the above letter and respond to the suggestion to give a public reply as no doubt the difficulty experience by the english friend be experience by many cause be generally lose not owe to the determine opposition of man who will not see the truth as they want to perpetuate a injustice but because they be able to enlist in they favor the allegiance of those who be anxious to understand a particular cause and take side after mature judgment it be only by patient argument with such honest man that one be able to check oneself correct one 's own error of judgment and at time to wean they from they error and bring they over to one 's side this khilafat question be specially difficult because there be so many side-issue it be therefore no wonder that many have more or less difficulty in make up they mind it be further complicated because the painful necessity for some direct action have arise in connection with it but whatever the difficulty i be convince that there be no question so important as this one if we want harmony and peace in indium my friend object to my statement that non-co-operation be not anti-government because he consider that refusal to serve it and pay its tax be actually anti-government i respectfully dissent from the view if a brother have fundamental difference with he brother and association with the latter involve he partaking of what in he opinion be a injustice i hold that it be brotherly duty to refrain from serve he brother and share he earnings with he this happen in everyday life prahalad do not act against he father when he decline to associate himself with the latter 's blasphemy nor be jesus anti-jewish when he declaim against the pharisee and the hypocrite and would have none of they in such matter be it not intention that determine the character of a particular act it be hardly correct as the friend suggest that withdrawal of association under general circumstance would make all government impossible but it be true that such withdrawal would make all injustice impossible my correspondent consider that the government of indium have do all it possibly could non-co-operation could not be applicable to that government in my opinion whilst it be true that the government of indium have do a great deal it have not do half as much as it might have do and might even now do no government can absolve itself from further action beyond protest when it realize that the people whom it represent feel as keenly as do lakh of indian mussalman in the khilafat question no amount of sympathy with a starve man can possibly avail he must have bread or he die and what be want at that critical moment be some exertion to fetch the wherewithal to feed the die man the government of indium can to-day heed the agitation and ask to the point of insistence for full vindication of the pledge word of a british minister have the government of indium resign by way of protest against the threaten shameful betrayal of trust on the part of mr lloyd george why do the government of indium hide itself behind secret despatch at a less critical moment lord hardiage commit a constitutional indiscretion openly sympathise with south african passive resistance movement and stem the surge tide of public indignation in indium though at the same time he incur the wrath of the then south african cabinet and some public man in great britain after all the utmost that the government of indium have do be on its own show to transmit and press the mahomedan claim be that not the least it could have do could it have do anything less without cover itself with disgrace what indian mahomedan and the indian public expect the government of indium to do at this critical juncture be not the least but the utmost that it could do viceroy have be know to tender resignation for much smaller cause wound pride bring forth not very long ago the resignation of a lieutenant governor on the khilafat question a sacred cause dear to the heart of several million mahomedan be in danger of be wound i would therefore invite the english friend and every englishman in indium and every hindu be he moderate or extremist to make common cause with the mahomedan and thereby compel the government of indium to do its duty and thereby compel he majesty 's minister to do theirs there have be much talk of violence ensue from active non-co-operation i venture to suggest that the mussalman of indium if they have nothing in the shape of non-co-operation in view would have long ago yield to counsel of despair i admit that non-co-operation be not unattended with danger but violence be a certainty without violence be only a possibility with non-co-operation and it will he a greater possibility if all the important man english hindu and other of the country discountenance it i think that the recommendation make by the friend be be literally follow by the mahomedan although they practically know the fate they be wait for the actual term of the treaty with turkey they be certainly go to try every means at they disposal to have the term revise before begin non-co-operation and there will certainly be no non-co-operation commence so long as there be even hope of active co-operation on the part of the government of indium with the mahomedan that be co-operation strong enough to secure a revision of the term should they be find to be in conflict with the pledge of british statesman but if all these thing fail can mahomedan as man of honor who hold they religion dearer than they life do anything less than wash they hand clean of the guilt of british minister and the government of indium by refuse to co-operate with they and can hindu and englishman if they value mahomedan friendship and if they admit then full justice of the mahomaden friendship and if they admit the full justice of the mahomedan claim do otherwise than heartily support the mahomedan by word and deed pledge break after the forgo be print the long-expected peace term regard turkey be receive in my humble opinion they be humiliating to the supreme council to the british minister and if as a hindu with deep reverence for christianity i may say so a denial of christ 's teaching turkey break down and tear with dissention within may submit to the arrogant disposal of herself and indian mahomedan may out of fear do likewise hindus out of fear apathy or want of appreciation of the situation may refuse to help they mahomedan brethren in they hour of peril the fact remain that a solemn promise of the prime minister of england have be wantonly break i will say nothing about president wilson 's fourteen point for they seem now to be entirely forget as a day 's wonder it be a matter of deep sorrow that the government of indium _ communique _ offer a defense of the term call they a fulfilment of mr lloyd george 's pledge of 5th January 1918 and yet apologise for they defective nature and appeal to the mahomedan of indium as if to mock they that they would accept the term with quiet resignation the mask that veil the hypocrisy be too thin to deceive anybody it would have be dignified if the _ communique _ have boldly admit mr lloyd george 's mistake in have make the promise refer to as it be the claim of fulfilment of the promise only add to the irritation cause by its glaring breach what be the use of the viceroy say the question of the khilafat be one for the mahomedan and mahomedan only and that with they free choice in the matter government have no desire to interfere while the khalif 's dominion be ruthlessly dismember he control of the holy place of islam shamelessly take away from he and he himself reduce to utter impotence in he own palace which can no longer be call a palace but which can he more fitly describe we a prison no wonder he excellency fear that the peace include term which must be painful to all moslem why should he insult muslim intelligence by send the mussalman of indium a of encouragement and sympathy be they expect to find encouragement in the cruel recital of the arrogant term or in a remembrance of ` the splendid response ' make by they to the call of the king ` in the day of the empire 's need ' it ill become he excellency to talk of the triumph of those ideal of justice and humanity for which the ally fight indeed the term of the so call peace with turkey if they be to last will be a monument of human arrogance and man-made injustice to attempt to crush the spirit of a brave and gallant race because it have lose in the fortune of war be a triumph not of humanity but a demonstration of inhumanity and if turkey enjoy the closest tie of friendship with great britain before the war great britain have certainly make ample reparation for she mistake by have make the largest contribution to the humiliation of turkey it be insufferable therefore when the viceroy feel confident that with the conclusion of this new treaty that friendship will quickly take life again and a turkey regenerate full of hope and strength will stand forth in the future as in the past a pillar of the islamic faith the viceregal message audaciously conclude this thought will i trust strengthen you to accept the peace term with resignation courage and fortitude and to keep you loyalty towards the crown bright and untarnished as it have be for so many generation if muslim loyalty remain untarnished it will certainly not be for want of effort on the part of the government of indium to put the heaviest strain upon it but it will remain so because the mahomedan realize they own strength -- the strength in the knowledge that they cause be just and that they have get the power to vindicate justice in spite of the aberration suffer by great britain under a prime minister whom continue power have make as reckless in make promise as in break they whilst therefore i admit that there be nothing either in the peace term or in the viceregal message cover they to inspire the mahomedan and indian in general with confidence or hope i venture to suggest that there be no cause for despair and anger now be the time for mahomedan to retain absolute self-control to unite they force and weak though they be with firm faith in god to carry on the struggle with redoubled vigor till justice be do if indium -- both hindu and mahomedan -- can act as one man and can withdraw she partnership in this crime against humanity which the peace term represent she will soon secure a revision of the treaty and give herself and the empire at least if not the world a lasting peace there be no doubt that the struggle would be bitter sharp and possibly prolonged but it be worth all the sacrifice that it be likely to call forth both the mussalman and the hindu be on they trial be the humiliation of the khilafat a matter of concern to the former and if it be be they prepare to exercise restraint religiously refrain from violence and practice non-co-operation without count the material loss it may entail upon the community do the hindu honestly feel for they mahomedan brethren to the extent of share they suffering to the fullest extent the answer to these question and not the peace term will finally decide the fate of the khilafat more objection answer _ swadeshmitran _ be one of the most influential tamil daily of madras it be widely read everything appear in its column be entitle to respect the editor have suggest some practical difficulty in the way of non-co-operation i would therefore like to the best of my ability to deal with they i do not know where the information have be derive from that i have give up the last two stage of non-co-operation what i have say be that they be a distant goal i abide by it i admit that all the stage be fraught with some danger but the last two be fraught with the greatest -- the last most of all the stage have be fix with a view to run the least possible risk the last two stage will not be take up unless the committee have attain sufficient control over the people to warrant the belief that the lay down of arm or suspension of tax will humanly speak be free from a outbreak of violence on the part of the people i do entertain the belief that it be possible for the people to attain the discipline necessary for take the two step when once they realize that violence be totally unnecessary to bend a unwilling government to they will and that the result can be obtain with certainty by dignified non-co-operation they will cease to think of violence even by way of retaliation the fact be that hitherto we have not attempt to take concerted and disciplined action from the mass some day if we be to become truly a self-governing nation that attempt have to be make the present in my opinion be a propitious movement every indian feel the insult to the punjab as a personal wrong every mussalman resent the wrong do to the khilafat there be therefore a favourable atmosphere for expect cohesive and restrained movement on the part of the mass so far as response be concerned i agree with the editor that the quickest and the largest response be to be expect in the matter of suspension of payment of tax but as i have say so long as the mass be not educate to appreciate the value of non-violence even whilst they holding be be sell so long must it be difficult to take up the last stage into any appreciable extent i agree too that a sudden withdrawal of the military and the police will be a disaster if we have not acquire the ability to protect ourselves against robber and thief but i suggest that when we be ready to call out the military and the police on a extensive scale we would find ourselves in a position to defend ourselves if the police and the military resign from patriotic motive i would certainly expect they to perform the same duty as national volunteer not have hireling but as willing protector of the life and liberty of they countryman the movement of non-co-operation be one of automatic adjustment if the government school be empty i would certainly expect national school to come into be if the lawyer as a whole suspend practice they would devise arbitration court and the nation will have expedition and cheaper method of set private dispute and award punishment to the wrong-doer i may add that the khilafat committee be fully alive to the difficulty of the task and be take all the necessary step to meet the contingency as they arise regard the leaving of civil employment no danger be fear because no one will leave he employment unless he be in a position to find support for himself and family either through friend or otherwise disapproval of the propose withdrawal of student betray in my humble opinion lack of appreciation of the true nature of non-co-operation it be true enough that we pay the money wherewith we child be educate but when the agency impart the education have become corrupt we may not employ it without partaking of the agent corruption when student leave school or college i hardly imagine that the teacher will fail to perceive the advisability of themselves resign but even if they do not money can hardly be allow to count where honor or religion be at the stake as to the boycott of the council it be not the entry of the moderate or any other person that matter so much as the entry of those who believe in non-co-operation you may not co-operate at the top and non-co-operate at the bottom a councillor can not remain in the council and ask the _ gumasta _ who clean the council-table to resign mr pennington 's objection answer i gladly publish mr pennington 's letter with its enclosure just as i have receive they evidently mr pennington be not a regular reader of ` young indium ' or he would have notice that no one have condemn mob outrage more than i have he seem to think that the article he have object to be the only thing i have ever write on general dyer he do not seem to know that i have endeavor with the utmost impartiality to examine the jallianwalum massacre and he can see any day all the proof adduce by my fellow-commissioner and myself in support of we finding on the massacre the ordinary reader of ` young indium ' know all the fact and therefore it be unnecessary for I to support my assertion otherwise but unfortunately mr pennington represent the typical englishman he do not want to be unjust nevertheless he be rarely just in he appreciation of world event because he have no time to study they except cursorily and that through a press whose business be to air only party view the average englishman therefore except in parochial matter be perhaps the least inform though he claim to be well-informed about every variety of interest mr pennington 's ignorance be thus typical of the other and afford the best reason for secure control of we own affair in we own hand ability will come with use and not by wait to be train by those whose natural interest be to prolong the period of tutelage as much as possible but to return to mr pennington 's letter he complain that there have be no ` proper trial of any one ' the fault be not ours indium have consistently and insistently demand a trial of all the officer concern in the crime against the punjab he next object to be ` violence ' of my language if truth be violent i plead guilty to the charge of violence of language but i could not without do violence to truth refrain from use the language i have regard general dyer 's action it have be prove out of he own mouth or hostile witness : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the crowd be unarmed -lrb- 2 -rrb- that it contain child -lrb- 3 -rrb- that the 13th be the day of vaisakhus fair -lrb- 4 -rrb- that thousand have come to the fair -lrb- 5 -rrb- that there be no rebellion -lrb- 6 -rrb- that during the intervene two day before the ` massacre ' there be peace in amritsar -lrb- 7 -rrb- that the proclamation of the meeting be make the same day as general dyer 's proclamation -lrb- 8 -rrb- that general dyer 's proclamation prohibit not meeting but procession or gathering of four man on the street and not in private or public place -lrb- 9 -rrb- that general dyer run no risk whether outside or inside the city -lrb- 10 -rrb- that he admit himself that many in the crowd do not know anything of he proclamation -lrb- 11 -rrb- that he fire without warn the crowd and even after it have begin to disperse he fire on the back of the people who be in flight -lrb- 12 -rrb- that the man be practically pen in a enclosure in the face of these admit fact i do call the deed a ` massacre ' the action amount not to ` a error of judgment ' but its ` paralysis in the face of fancied danger ' i be sorry to have to say that mr pennington 's note which too the reader will find publish elsewhere betray as much ignorance as he letter whatever be adopt on paper in the day of canning be certainly not translate into action in its full sense ` promise make to the ear be break to the hope ' be say by a reactionary viceroy military expenditure have grow enormously since the day of can the demonstration in favor of general dyer be practically a myth no trace be find of the so-called danda fauj dignified by the name of bludgeon-army by mr pennington there be no rebel army in amritsar the crown that commit the horrible murder and incendiarism contain no one community exclusively the sheet be find post only in lahore and not in amritsar mr pennington should moreover have know by this time that the meeting hold on the 13th be hold among other thing for the purpose of condemn mob excess this be bring out at the amritsar trial those who surround he could not stop general dyer he say he make up he mind to shoot in a moment he consult nobody when the correspondent say that the troops would have object to be concern in ` what might in that case be not unfairly call a ` massacre ' he write as if he have never live in indium i wish the indian troops have the moral courage to refuse to shoot innocent unarmed man in full flight but the indian troops have be bring in too slavish a atmosphere to dare do any such correct act i hope mr pennington will not accuse I again of make unverified assertion because i have not quote from the book the evidence be there for he to use i can only assure he that the assertion be base on positive proof mostly obtain from official source mr pennington want I to publish a exact account of what happen on the 10th April he can find it in the report and if he will patiently go through they he will discover that sir michael o'dwyer and he official goad the people into frenzied fury -- a fury which nobody as i have already say have condemn more than i have the account of the following day be sum up in one word _ viz _ ` peace ' on the part of the crowd disturb by indiscriminate arrest the massacre and the series of official crime that follow i be prepare to give mr pennington credit for seek after the truth but he have go about it in the wrong manner i suggest he read the evidence before the hunter committee and the congress committee he need not read the report but the evidence will convince he that i have understate the case against general dyer when however i read he description of himself as for 12 year chief magistrate of district in the south of indium before reform by assassination and otherwise become so fashionable i despair of he be able to find the truth a angry or a bias man render himself incapable of find it and mr pennington be evidently both angry and bias what do he mean by say before reform by assassination and otherwise become so fashionable it ill become he to talk of assassination when the school of assassination seem happily to have become extinct englishman will never see the truth so long as they permit they vision to be blind by arrogant assumption of superiority or ignorant assumption of infallibility mr pennington 's letter to mr gandhus dear sir i do not like you scheme for boycott the government of indium under what seem to be the somewhat less offensive -lrb- though more cumbrous -rrb- name of non-co-operation but have always give you credit for a genuine desire to carry out revolution by peaceful means and be astonish at the violence of the language you use in describe general dyer on page 4 of you issue of the 14th July last you begin by say that he be by no mean the worst offender and so far i be incline to agree though as there have be no proper trial of anyone it be impossible to apportion they guilt but then you say he brutality be unmistakable he abject and unsoldierlike cowardice be apparent he have call a _ unarmed crowd _ of man and child -- mostly holiday maker -- a rebel army he believe himself to be the savior of the punjab in that he be able to shoot down like rabbit man who be _ pen _ in a enclosure such a man be unworthy to be consider a soldier there be no bravery in he action he run no risk he shoot without the slightest opposition and without warn this be not a error of judgement it be paralysis of it in the face of _ fancy _ danger it be proof of criminal incapacity and heartlessness etc you must excuse I for say that all this be mere rhetoric unsupported by any proof even where proof be possible to begin with neither you nor i be present at the jallianwallum bagh on that dreadful day -- dreadful especially for general dyer for whom you show no sympathy -- and therefore can not know for certain whether the crowd be or be not unarmed ' that it be a ` illegal ' because a ` prohibit ' assembly be evident for it be absurd to suppose that general dyer 's 4-1\/2 hour march through the city that very morning during the whole of which he be warn the inhabitant against the danger of any sort of gathering be not thoroughly well-known you say they be ` mostly holiday maker ' but you give nor proof and the idea of holiday gathering in amritsar just then in incredible i can not understand you make such a suggestion general dyer be not the only officer present on the occasion and it be impossible to suppose that he would have be allow to go on shooting into a innocent body of holiday-maker even the troops would have refuse to carry out what might then have be not unfairly call a massacre i notice that you never even allude to the frightful brutality of the mob which be immediately responsible for the punitive measure reluctantly adopt by general dyer you sympathy seem to be only with the murderer and i be not sanguine enough to suppose that my view of the case will have much influence with you still i be bind to do what i can to get at the truth and enclose a copy of some note i have have occasion to make if you can publish a _ exact _ account of what happen at amritsar on the 10th of April 1919 and the following day especially on the 13th include the demonstration in favor of general dyer -lrb- if there be one -rrb- i for one as a mere seeker after the truth should be very much oblige to you mere abuse be not convincing as you so often observe in you generally reasonable paper yours faithfully j r pennington io -lrb- retd -rrb- 35 victorium road worthing sussex 27th aug 1920 for 12 year chief magistrate of district in the south of indium before reform by assassination and otherwise become so fashionable p let we get the case in this way general dyer act as the only representative of government on the spot shoot some hundred of people -lrb- some of they _ perhaps _ innocently mix up in a illegal assembly -rrb- in the _ bona fide _ belief that he be deal with the remains of a very dangerous rebellion and be thereby save the life of very many thousand and in the opinion of a great many people do actually save the city from fall in the hand of a dangerous mob some doubt babu janakdhari prasad be a staunch coworker with I in champaran he have write a long letter set forth he reason for he belief that indium have a great mission before she and that she can achieve she purpose only by non-violent non-co-operation but he have doubt which he would have I answer publicly the letter be long i be withholding but the doubt be entitle to respect and i must endeavor to answer they here they be we frame by bubu janakdhari prasad -lrb- a -rrb- be not the non-co-operation movement create a sort of race-hatred between englishman and indian and be it in accordance with the divine plan of universal love and brotherhood -lrb- b -rrb- do not the use of word devilish satanic etc savor of unbrotherly sentiment and incite feeling of hatred -lrb- c -rrb- should not the non-co-operation movement be conduct on strictly non-violent and non-emotional line both in speech and action -lrb- d -rrb- be there no danger of the movement go out of control and lending to violence as to -lrb- a -rrb- i must say that the movement be not ` create ' race-hatred it certainly give as i have already say disciplined expression to it you can not eradicate evil by ignore it it be because i want to promote universal brotherhood that i have take up non-co-operation so that by self-purification indium may make the world better than it be as to -lrb- b -rrb- i know that the word ` satanic ' and ` devilish ' be strong but they relate the exact truth they describe a system not person : we be bind to hate evil if we would shun it but by means of non-co-operation we be able to distinguish between the evil and the evil-doer i have find no difficulty in describe a particular activity of a brother of mine to be devilish but i be not aware of have harbour any hatred about he non-co-operation teach we to love we fellowman in spite of they fault not by ignore or over-look they as to -lrb- c -rrb- the movement be certainly be conduct on strictly non-violent line that all non-co-operator have not yet thoroughly imbibe the doctrine be true but that just show what a evil legacy we have inherit emotion there be in the movement and it will remain a man without emotion be a man without feeling as to -lrb- d -rrb- there certainly be danger of the movement become violent but we may no more drop non-violent non-co-operation because of its danger than we may stop freedom because of the danger of its abuse rejoinder messr popley and philip have be good enough to reply to my letter to every englishman in indium i recognize and appreciate the friendly spirit of they letter but i see that there be fundamental difference which must for the time be divide they and I so long as i feel that in spite of grievous lapse the british empire represent a activity for the world and indium 's good i clung to it like a child to its mother 's breast but that faith be go the british nation have endorse the punjab and khilsfat crime the be no doubt a dissent minority but a dissent minority that satisfy itself with a mere expression of its opinion and continue to help the wrong-doer partake in wrong-doing and when the sum total of he energy represent a minus quantity one may not pick out the plus quantity hold they up for admiration and ask a admiring public to help regard they it be a favorite design of satan to temper evil with a show of good and thus lure the unwary into the trap the only way the world have know of defeat satan be by shun he i invite englishman who could work out the ideal the believe in to join the rank of the non-co-operationists wt stead pray for the reverse of the british arm during the boer war miss hobbhouse invite the boer to keep up the fight the betrayal of indium be much worse than the injustice do to the boer the boer fight and bleed for they rights when therefore we be prepare to bleed the right will have become embody and idolatrous world will perceive it and do homage to it but messer popley and phillip object that i have ally myself with those who would draw the sword if they could i see nothing wrong in it they represent the right no less than i do and be it not worth while try to prevent a unsheathing of the sword by help to win the bloodless battle those who recognize the truth of the indian position can only do god 's work by assist this non-violent campaign the second objection raise by these english friend be more to the point i would be guilty of wrong-doing myself if the muslim cause be not just the fact be that the muslim claim be not to perpetuate foreign domination of non-muslim or turkish race the indian mussalman do not resist self-determination but they would fight to the last the nefarious plan of exploit mesopotamium under the plea of self-determination they must resist the study attempt to humiliate turkey and therefore islam under the false pretext of ensure armenian independence the third objection have reference to school i do object to missionary or any school be carry on with government money it be true that it be at one time we money will these good missionary be justify in educate I with fund give to they by a robber who have rob I of my money religion and honor because the money be originally mine i personally tolerate the financial robbery of indium but it would have be a sin to have tolerate the robbery of honor through the punjab and of religion through turkey this be strong language but nothing less would truly describe my deep conviction needless to add that the emptying of government aid or affiliate school do not mean starve the young mind national school be come into be as fast as the other be empty messr popley and phillip think that my sense of justice have be blur by the knowledge of the punjab and the khilafat wrong i hope not i have ask friend to show I some good fruit -lrb- intended and deliberately produce -rrb- of the british occupation of indium and i assure they that i shall make the amplest amends if i find that i have err in my eagerness about the khilafat and the punjab wrong two englishman reply dear mr gandhus thank you for you letter to every englishman in indium with its hard-hitting and its generous tone something within we respond to the note which you have strike we be not representative of any corporate body but we think that million of we countryman in england and not a few in indium feel as we do the reading of you letter convince we that you and we can not be real enemy may we say at once that in so far as the british empire stand for the domination and exploitation of other race for britain 's benefit for degrading treatment of any for traffic in intoxicate liquor for repressive legislation for administration such as that which to the amritsar incident we desire the end of it as much as you do we quite understand that in the excitement of the present crisis owe to certain act of the british administration which we join with you in condemn the empire present itself to you under this aspect along but from personal contact with we countryman we know that work like leaven in the midst of such tendency as you and we deplore be the faith in a better ideal -- the ideal of a commonwealth of free people voluntarily link together by the tie of common experience in the past and common aspiration for the future a commonwealth which may hope to spread liberty and progress through the whole earth with vast number of we countryman we value the british empire mainly as afford the possibility of the realization of such a idea and on the ground give it we loyal allegiance meanwhile we do repent of that arrogant attitude to indian which have be all too common among we countryman we do hold indian to be we brother and equal many of they we superior and we would rather be servant than ruler of indium we desire a administration which can not he intimate either by the selfish element in anglo-indian political opinion or by any other sectional interest and which shall govern in accordance with the best democratic principle we should welcome the convene of a national assembly of recognize leader of the people represent all shades of political opinion of every caste race and creed to frame a constitution for swaraj in all the thing that matter most we be with you surely you and we can co-operate in the service of indium in such matter for example as education it seem to we nothing short of a tragedy that you should be rally indian patriotism to inaugurate a new era of good will under a watchword that divide instead of unite all we have speak of the large amount of common ground upon which you and we can stand but frankness demand that we express we anxiety about some item in you program leave aside smaller question on which you letter seem to we to do the british side less than justice may we mention three main point you insistence on spiritual force alone we deeply respect and desire to emulate but we can not understand you combine into it with a close alliance with those who as you frankly say would draw the sword as soon as they could you desire for a education truly national command we whole-hearted approval but instead of indianize the present system as you could begin to do from the beginning of next year or instead of create a hundred institution such as that at bolpur and turn into they the stream of indium 's young intellectual life you appear to be turn that stream out of its present channel into open sand where it may dry up in other word you seem to we to be risk the complete cessation for a period possibly of year of all education for a large number of boy and young man be it best for those young man or for indium that the present imperfect education should cease before a better education be ready to take its place you desire to unite mohammedan and hindu and to share with you mohammedan brethren in seek the satisfaction of mohammedan aspiration we can understand and sympathize with but be there no danger in the course which some of you party have urge upon the government that certain race in the former ottoman empire might be fix under a foreign yoke for worse than that which you hold the english yoke to be you could not wish to purchase freedom in indium at the price of enslavement in the middle east to sum up we thank you for the spirit of you letter to which we have try to respond in the same spirit we be with you in the desire for a indium genuinely free to develop the best that be in she and in the belief that best be something wonderful of which the world to-day stand in need we be ready to co-operate with you and with every other man of any race or nationality who will help indium to realize she best be you go to insist that you can have nothing to do with we if we receive a government grant -lrb- ie indian money -rrb- for a indian school surely some more inspiring battle cry than non-co-operation can be discover we have venture quite frankly to point out three item in you present program which seem to we likely to hinder the attainment of you true ideal for indian greatness but those ideal themselves command we warm sympathy and we desire to work so far as we have opportunity for they attainment in fact it be only thus that we can interpret we british citizenship yours sincerely -lrb- sd -rrb- ha popley -lrb- sd -rrb- ge phillip bangalore November 15 1920 renunciation of medal mr gandhus have address the follow letter to the viceroy : -- it be not without a pang that i return the kaisar-i-hind gold medal grant to I by you predecessor for my humanitarian work in south africa the zulu war medal grant in south africa for my service as officer in charge of the indian volunteer ambulance corps in 1906 and the boer war medal fur my service as assistant superintendent of the indian volunteer stretcher bearer corps during the boer war of 1899-1900 i venture to return these medal in pursuance of the scheme of non-co-operation inaugurate to-day in connection with the khilafat movement valuable as those honor have be to I i can not wear they with a easy conscience so long as my mussalman countryman have to labor under a wrong do to they religious sentiment event that have happen during the past month have confirm I in the opinion that the imperial government have act in the khilafat matter in a unscrupulous immoral and unjust manner and have be move from wrong to wrong in order to defend they immorality i can retain neither respect nor affection for such a government the attitude of the imperial and you excellency 's government on the punjab question have give I additional cause for grave dissatisfaction i have the honor as you excellency be aware as one of the congress commissioner to investigate the cause of the disorder in the punjab during the April of 1919 and it be my deliberate conviction that sir michael o'dwyer be totally unfit to hold the office of lieutenant governor of punjab and that he policy be primarily responsible for infuriate the mob at amritsar do doubt the mob excess be unpardonable incendiarism murder of five innocent englishman and the cowardly assault on miss sherwood be most deplorable and uncalled for but the punitive measure take by general dyer col frank johnson col o'brien mr bosworth smith raus shri ram sud mr malik khan and other officer be out of all proportional to the crime of the people and amount to wanton cruelty and inhumanity and almost unparalleled in modern time you excellency 's light-hearted treatment of the official crime you exoneration of sir michael o'dwyer mr montagu 's dispatch and above all the shameful ignorance of the punjab event and callous disregard of the feeling of indian betray by the house of lord have fill I with the gravest misgiving regard the future of the empire have estrange I completely from the present government and have disabled I from tender as i have hitherto whole-heartedly tender my loyal co-operation in my humble opinion the ordinary method of agitating by way of petition deputation and the like be no remedy for move to repentence a government so hopelessly indifferent to the welfare of its charge as the government of indium have prove to I in european country condonation of such grievous wrong as the khilafat and the punjab would have result in a bloody revolution by the people they would have resist at all cost national emasculation such as the say wrong imply but half of indium be to weak to offer violent resistance and the other half be unwilling to do so i have therefore venture to suggest the remedy of non-co-operation which enable those who wish to dissociate themselves from the government and which if it be unattended by violence and undertake in a order manner must compel it to retrace its step and undo the wrong commit but whilst i shall pursue the policy of non-co-operation in so far as i can carry the people with I i shall not lose hope that you will yet see you way to do justice i therefore respectfully ask you excellency to summon a conference of the recognize leader of the people and in consultation with they find a way that would placate the mussalman and do reparation to the unhappy punjab _ August 4 1920 _ mahatma gandhus 's letter to hrh the duke of connaught the follow letter have be address by mr gandhus to he royal highness the duke of connaught -- sir you royal highness must have hear a great deal about non-co-operation non-co-operationist and they method and incidentally of I its humble author i fear that the information give to you royal highness must have be in its nature one-sided i owe it to you and to my friend and myself that i should place before you what i conceive to be the scope of non-co-operation as follow not only be I but my closest associate such as messr shaukat alus and mahome alus for I it be no joy and pleasure to be actively associate in the boycott of you royal highness ' visit -- i have tender loyal and voluntary association to the government for a unbroken period of nearly 30 year in the full belief that through that way lay the path of freedom for my country it be therefore no slight thing for I to suggest to my countryman that we should take no part in welcome you royal highness not one among we have anything against you as a english gentleman we hold you person as sacred as that of a dearest friend i do not know any of my friend who would not guard it with he life if he find it in danger we be not at war with individual englishman we seek not to destroy english life we do desire to destroy a system that have emasculate we country in body mind and soul we be determine to battle with all we might against that in the english nature which have make o'dwyerism and dyerism possible in the punjab and have result in a wanton affront upon islam a faith profess by seven crore of we countryman the affront have be put in breach of the letter and the spirit of the solemn declaration of the prime minister we consider it to be inconsistent with we self respect any longer to brook the spirit of superiority and dominance which have systematically ignore and disregard the sentiment of thirty crore of the innocent people of indium on many a vital matter it be humiliating to we it can not be a matter of pride to you that thirty crore of indian should live day in and day out in the fear of they life from one hundred thousand englishman and therefore be under subjection to they you royal highness have come not to end the system i have describe but to sustain it by uphold its prestige you first pronouncement be a laudation of lord wellingdon i have the privilege of know he i believe he to be a honest and amiable gentleman who will not willingly hurt even a fly but he have certainly fail as a ruler he allow himself to be guide by those whose interest it be to support they power he be read the mind of the dravidian province here in bengal you be issue a certificate of merit to a governor who be again from all i have hear a estimable gentleman but he know nothing of the heart of bengal and its yearning bengal be not calcutta fort william and the palace of calcutta represent a insolent exploitation of the unmurmuring and highly culture peasantry of this fair province non-co-operationist have come to the conclusion that they must not be deceive by the reform that tinker with the problem of indium 's distress and humiliation nor must they be impatient and angry we must not in we impatient anger resort to stupid violence we freely admit that we must take we due share of the blame for the exist state it be not so much the british gun that be responsible fur we subjection as we voluntary co-operation we non-participation in a hearty welcome to you royal highness be thus in no sense a demonstration against you high personage but it be against the system you have come to uphold i know that individual englishman can not even if they will alter the english nature all of a sudden if we would be equal of englishman we must cast off fear we must learn to be self-reliant and independent of the school court protection and patronage of a government we seek to end if it will not mend hence this non-violent non-co-operation i know that we have not all yet become non-violent in speech and deed but the result so far achieve have i assure you royal highness be amazing the people have understand the secret and the value of non-violence as they have never do before he who run may see that this a religious purify movement we be leave off drink we be try to rid indium of the curse of untouchability we be try to throw off foreign tinsel splendor and by revert to the spin wheel revive the ancient and the poetic simplicity of life we hope thereby to sterilize the exist harmful institution i ask you royal highness as a englishman to study this movement and its possibility for the empire and the world we be at war with nothing that be good in the world in protect islam in the manner we be we be protect all religion in protect the honor of indium we be protect the honor of humanity for we means be hurtful to none we desire to live on term of friendship with englishman but that friendship must be friendship of equal in both theory and practice and we must continue to non-co-operate ie to purify ourselves till the goal be achieve i ask you royal highness and through you every englishman to appreciate the view-point of the non-co-operationists i beg to remain you royal highness 's faithful servant -lrb- sd -rrb- mk gandhus _ February _ 1921 the greatest thing it be to be wish that non-co-operationist will clearly recognize that nothing can stop the onward march of the nation as violence ireland may gain its freedom by violence turkey may regain she lose possession by violence within measurable distance of time but indium can not win she freedom by violence for a century because she people be not build in the manner of other nation they have be nurture in the tradition of suffer rightly or wrongly for good or ill islam too have evolve along peaceful line in indium and i make bold to say that if the honor of islam be to be vindicate through its follower in indium it will only be by method of peaceful silent dignified conscious and courageous suffer the more i study that wonderful faith the more convinced i become that the glory of islam be due not to the sword but to the suffering the renunciation and the nobility of its early caliph islam decay when its follower mistake the evil for the good dangle the sword in the face of man and lose sight of the godliness the humility and austerity of its founder and he disciple but i be not at the present moment concern with show that the basis of islam as of all religion be not violence but suffer not the taking of life but the give of it what i be anxious to show be that non-co-operationist must be true as well to the spirit as to the letter of they vow if they would gain swaraj within one year they may forget non-co-operation but they dare not forget non-violence indeed non-co-operation be non-violence we be violent when we sustain a government whose creed be violence it base itself finally not on right but on might its last appeal be not to reason nor the heart but to the sword we be tire of this creed and we have rise against it let we not ourselves belie we profession by be violent though the english be very few they be organise for violence though we be many we can not be organise for violence for a long time to come violence for we be a gospel or despair i have see a pathetic letter from a god-fearing english woman who defend dyerism for she think that if general dyer have not enact jallianwalum woman and child would have be murder by we if we be such brute as to desire the blood of innocent woman and child we deserve to be blot out from the face of the earth there be the other side it do not strike this good lady that if we be friend the price that she countryman pay at jallianwalum for buy they safety be too great they gain they safety at the cost of they humanity general dyer have be haltingly blame and he evil genius sir michael o'dwyer entirely exonerate because englishman do not want to leave this country of field even if everyone of we have to be kill if we go mad again as we do at amritsar let there be no mistake that a blacker jallianwalum will be enact shall we copy dyerism and o'dwyerism even whilst we be condemn it let not we rock be violence and devilry we rock must be non-violence and godliness let we worker be clear as to what we be about _ swaraj depend upon we ability to control all the force of violence on we side _ therefore there be no swaraj within one year if there be violence on the part of the people we must then refrain from sit _ dhurna _ we must refrain from cry ` shame shame ' to anybody we must not use any coercion to persuade we people to adopt we way we must guarantee to they the same freedom we claim for ourselves we must not tamper with the mass it be dangerous to make political use of factory labourer or the peasantry -- not that we be not entitle to do so but we be not ready for it we have neglect they political -lrb- as distinguish from literary -rrb- education all these long year we have not get enough honest intelligent reliable and brave worker to enable we to act upon these countryman of ours

mahatma gandhus speak a few word as introductory remark to the whole statement he say : before i read this statement i would like to state that i entirely endorse the learn advocate-general 's remark in connection with my humble self i think that he be entirely fair to I in all the statement that he have make because it be very true and i have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the exist system of government have become almost a passion with I and the learn advocate-general be also entirely in the right when he say that my preaching of disaffection do not commence with my connection with young indium but that it commence much earlier and in the statement that i be about to read it will be my painful duty to admit before this court that it commence much earlier than the period state by the advocate-general it be the most painful duty with I but i have to discharge that duty know the responsibility that rest upon my shoulder and i wish to endorse all the blame that the advocate-general have throw on my shoulder in connection with the bombay occurrence madras occurrence and the chourus choura occurrence think over these thing deeply and sleep over they night after night and examine my heart i have come to the conclusion that it be impossible for I to dissociate myself from the diabolical crime of chourus choura or the mad outrage of bombay he be quite right when he say that as a man of responsibility a man have receive a fair share of education have have a fair share of experience of this world i should know they i know that i be play with fire i run the risk and if i be set free i would still do the same i would be fail in my duty if i do not do so i have feel it this morning that i would have fail in my duty if i do not say all what i say here just now i want to avoid violence non-violence be the first article of my faith it be the last article of my faith but i have to make my choice i have either to submit to a system which i consider have do a irreparable harm to my country or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people burst forth when they understand the truth from my lip i know that my people have sometimes go mad i be deeply sorry for it and i be therefore here to submit not to a light penalty but to the highest penalty i do not ask for mercy i do not plead any extenuating act i be here therefore to invite and submit to the highest penalty that can be inflict upon I for what in law be a deliberate crime and what appear to I to be the highest duty of a citizen the only course open to you mr judge be as i be just go to say in my statement either to resign you post or inflict on I the severest penalty if you believe that the system and law you be assist to administer be good for the people i do not expect that kind of conversion but by the time i have finish with my statement you will perhaps have a glimpse of what be rage within my breast to run this maddest risk which a sane man can run write statement i owe it perhaps to the indian public and to the public in england to placate which this prosecution be mainly take up that i should explain why from a staunch loyalist and co-operator i have become a uncompromising disaffectionist and non-co-operator to the court too i should say why i plead guilty to the charge of promote disaffection towards the government establish by law in indium my public life begin in 1893 in south africa in troubled weather my first contact with british authority in that country be not of a happy character i discover that as a man and as a indian i have no rights on the contrary i discover that i have no rights as a man because i be a indian but i be not baffle i think that this treatment of indian be a excrescence upon a system that be intrinsically and mainly good i give the government my voluntary and hearty co-operation criticise it fully where i feel it be faulty but never wish its destruction consequently when the existence of the empire be threaten in 1899 by the boer challenge i offer my service to it raise a volunteer ambulance corps and serve at several action that take place for the relief of ladysmith similarly in 1906 at the time of the zulu revolt i raise a stretcher-bearer party and serve till the end of the ` rebellion ' on both these occasion i receive medal and be even mention in despatch for my work in south africa i be give by lord hardinge a kaiser-i-hind gold medal when the war break out in 1914 between england and germany i raise a volunteer ambulance corps in london consist of the then resident indian in london chiefly student its work be acknowledge by the authority to be valuable lastly in indium when a special appeal be make at the war conference in delhus in 1917 by lord chelmsford for recruit i struggle at the cost of my health to raise a corps in kheda and the response be be make when the hostility cease and order be receive that no more recruit be want in all those effort at service i be actuate by the belief that it be possible by such service to gain a status of full equality in the empire for my countryman the first shock come in the shape of the rowlalt act a law design to rob the people of all real freedom i feel call upon to lead a intensive agitation against it then follow the punjab horror begin with the massacre at jallianwalum bagh and culminate in brawl order public flogging and other indescribable humiliation i discover too that the plighted word of the prime minister to the mussalman of indium regard the integrity of turkey and the holy place of islam be not likely to be fulfil but in spite of the foreboding and the grave warning of friend at the amritsar congress in 1919 i fight for co-operation and work the montagu-chelmsford reform hope that the prime minister would redeem he promise to the indian mussalman that the punjab wound would be heal and that the reform inadequate and unsatisfactory though they be mark a new era of hope in the life of indium but all that hope be shatter the khilafat promise be not to be redeem the punjab crime be white-washed and most culprit go not only unpunished but remain in service and some continue to draw pension from the indian revenue and in some case be even reward i see too that not only do the reform not mark a change of heart but they be only a method of further drain indium of she wealth and of prolong she servitude i come reluctantly to the conclusion that the british connection have make indium more helpless than she ever be before politically and economically a disarm indium have no power of resistance against any aggressor if she want to engage in a armed conflict with he so much be this the case that some of we best man consider that indium must take generation before she can achieve the dominion status she have become so poor that she have little power of resist famine before the british advent indium spin and weave in she million of cottage just the supplement she need for add to she meager agricultural resource the cottage industry so vital for indium 's existence have be ruin by incredibly heartless and inhuman process as describe by english witness little do town-dweller know how the semi-starved mass of indian be slowly sink to lifelessness little do they know that they miserable comfort represent the brokerage they get for the work they do for the foreign exploiter that the profit and the brokerage be suck from the mass little do they realize that the government establish by law in british indium be carry on for this exploitation of the mass no sophistry no jugglery in figure can explain away the evidence the skeleton in many village present to the naked eye i have no doubt whatsoever that both england and the town dweller of indium will have to answer if there be a god above for this crime against humanity which be perhaps unequalled in history the law itself in this country have be use to serve the foreign exploiter my unbiased examination of the punjab martial law case have lead I to believe that at least ninety-five per cent of conviction be wholly bad my experience of political case in indium lead I to the conclusion that in nine out of every ten the condemn man be totally innocent they crime consist in love of they country in ninety-nine case out of hundred justice have be deny to indian as against european in the court of indium this be not a exaggerated picture it be the experience of almost every indian who have have anything to do such case in my opinion the administration of the law be thus prostitute consciously or unconsciously for the benefit of the exploiter the greatest misfortune be that englishman and they indian associate in the administration of the country do not know that they be engage in the crime i have attempt to describe i be satisfied that many english and indian official honestly believe that they be administer one of the best system devise in the world and that indium be make steady though slow progress they do not know that a subtle but effective system of terrorism and a organise display of force on the one hand and the deprivation of all power of retaliation of self-defence on the other have emasculate the people and induce in they the habit of simulation this awful habit have add to the ignorance and the self-deception of the administrator section 124-a under which i be happily charge be perhaps the prince among the political section of the indian penal code design to suppress the liberty of the citizen affection can not be manufacture or regulate by law if one have no affection for a person or thing one should be free to give the fullest expression to he disaffection so long as he do not contemplate promote or incite to violence but the section under which mere promotion of disaffection be a crime i have study some of the case try under it and i know that some of the most love of indium 's patriot have be convict under it i consider it a privilege therefore to be charge under it i have endeavor to give in they briefest outline the reason for my disaffection i have no personal ill-will against any single administrator much less can i have any disaffection towards the king 's person but i hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected towards a government which in its totality have do more harm to indium than any previous system indium be less manly under the british rule than she ever be before hold such a belief i consider it to be a sin to have affection for the system and it have be a precious privilege for I to be able to write what i have in the various article tender in evidence against I in fact i believe that i have render a service to indium and england by show in non-co-operation the way out of the unnatural state in which both be live in my humble opinion non-co-operation with evil be as much a duty as be co-operation with good but in the past non-co-operation have be deliberately express in violence to the evil doer i be endeavor to show to my countryman that violent non-co-operation only multiply evil and that as evil can only be sustain by violence withdrawal of support of evil require complete abstention from violence non-violent imply voluntary submission to the penalty for non-co-operation with evil i be here therefore to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can he inflict upon I for what in law be a deliberate crime and what appear to I to be the highest duty of a citizen the only course open to you the judge and the assessor be either to resign you post and thus dissociate yourselve from evil if you feel that the law you be call upon to administer be a evil and that in reality i be innocent or to inflict on I the severest penalty if you believe that the system and the law you be assist to administer be good for the people of this country and that my activity be therefore injurious to the public weal m k ghandus end of the project gutenberg ebook of freedom 's battle by mahatma gandhus
