produce by jonathan ingram carol david and pg distribute proofreader dr johnson 's work life poem and tale the work of samuel johnson lld in nine volume volume the first mdcccxxv advertisement it may be assert without a partial panegyric of the object of we praise that the work of no single author in the wide range of british literature not except perhaps even addison contain a richer and more varied fund of rational entertainment and sound instruction than those of dr johnson a correct edition of he work must therefore be a acceptable contribution to the mass of national literature that the present edition have perhaps fairer claim on public approbation than most preceding one we feel ourselves justify in assert without envious detraction of those who have go before we it have be we wish and diligent endeavor to give as accurate a text as possible to which we have subjoin note where elucidation seem to be require they have be collect with care and will prove we impartiality by they occasional censure of the fault and failing of the writer whose work it be we office to illustrate and we more common and more grateful task to praise though be diffuse over a wide space they appear less numerous than they really be it have be we incessant care to abstain from that method of redundant annotation which tend to display the ingenuity or mental resource of a editor much more than to illustrate the original writer note have be chiefly introduce for the purpose of guard we reader against some political sophism or to correct some hasty error but happily in the writings to which we have devote we time and attention the chaff and dross lie so open to view and be so easily separate from purer matter that a hint be sufficient to protect the most incautious from harm accordingly in we note and preface we have confine ourselves to simple and succinct history of the respective work under consideration and have avoid as much as might be a burdensome repetition of criticism or anecdote in almost every person 's possession or a idle point out of beauty which none could fail to recognize the length of time that have elapse since the writings of johnson be first publish have amply develop they intrinsic merit and destroy the personal and party prejudice which assail a living author : but the year have be too few to render the custom and manners allude to so obsolete as to require much illustrative research -lrb- a -rrb- it may be satisfactory to subjoin that care have be exercise in every thing that we have advance and that when we have err it have be on the side of caution all the usually receive work of dr johnson together with murphy 's essay on he life and genius be comprise in this edition in pursuance of we plan of brevity we shall not here give a list of he minor and unacknowledged production but refer we reader to boswell a new amend and enlarged edition of whose interesting and picturesque memoirs we purpose speedily to present to the public after the style and manner of the present work one very important addition however we conceive that we have make in publish the whole of he sermon it have be hitherto the practice to give one or two with a cursory notice that johnson 's theological knowledge be scanty or unworthy of he general fame we have act under a very different impression for though johnson be not nor pretend to be a polemical or controversial divine he well know how to apply to the right regulation of we moral conduct the lesson of that christianity which be not promulge for a sect but for mankind which seek not a distinctive garb in the philosopher 's grove nor secluded itself in the hermit 's cell but enter without reserve every walk of life and sympathize with all the instinctive feeling of we common nature this high privilege of we religion johnson feel and to the diffusion of its practical not of its theoretical advantage he apply the energy of he heart and mind and with what success we leave to every candid reader to pronounce in conclusion we would express a hope that we shall not inaptly commence a series of oxford english classic with the work of one whose writings have so enlarged and embellish the science of moral evidence which have long constitute a characteristic feature in the literary discipline of this university the science of mind and its progress as record by history or unfold by biography be johnson 's favorite study and be still the main object of pursuit in the place whose system and institution he so warmly praise and to which he ever profess himself so deeply indebted if the terseness of attic simplicity have be desiderate by some in the page of johnson they undeniably display the depth of think the weight of argument the insight into mind and moral which be to be find in they native dignity only in the composition of those older writer with whose spirit he be so richly imbue in this place then where those model which johnson admire and imitate be still uphold as the only sure guide to sound learn he writings can never be lay aside unread and neglect oxford June 23 1825 -lrb- a -rrb- see a remark on this subject make by johnson with reference

great writer who have bequeath to posterity a lasting legacy be present to the world it be naturally expect that some account of he life should accompany the edition the reader wish to know as much as possible of the author the circumstance that attend he the feature of he private character he conversation and the means by which he arise to eminence become the favorite object of inquiry curiosity be excite and the admirer of he work be eager to know he private opinion he course of study the particularity of he conduct and above all whether he pursue the wisdom which he recommend and practice the virtue which he writings inspire a principle of gratitude be awaken in every generous mind for the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have provide for the world man of refine and sensible temper be ready to pay they tribute of praise and even to form a posthumous friendship with the author in review the life of such a writer there be besides a rule of justice to which the public have a undoubted claim fond admiration and partial friendship should not be suffer to represent he virtue with exaggeration nor should malignity be allow under a specious disguise to magnify mere defect the usual failing of human nature into vice or gross deformity the light and shades of the character should be give and if this be do with a strict regard to truth a just estimate of dr johnson will afford a lesson perhaps as valuable as the moral doctrine that speak with energy in every page of he work the present writer enjoy the conversation and friendship of that excellent man more than thirty year he think it a honor to be so connected and to this hour he reflect on he loss with regret but regret he know have secret bribe by which the judgment may be influence and partial affection may be carry beyond the bound of truth in the present case however nothing need to be disguise and exaggerate praise be unnecessary it be a observation of the younger pliny in he epistle to he friend tacitus that history ought never to magnify matter of fact because worthy action require nothing but the truth : nam nec historium debet egredus veritatem et honeste factis veritas sufficit this rule the present biographer promise shall guide he pen throughout the follow narrative it may be say the death of dr johnson keep the public mind in agitation beyond all former example no literary character ever excite so much attention and when the press have teem with anecdote apophthegm essay and publication of every kind what occasion now for a new tract on the same thread-bare subject the plain truth shall be the answer the proprietor of johnson 's work think the life which they prefix to they former edition too unwieldy for republication the prodigious variety of foreign matter introduce into that performance seem to overload the memory of dr johnson and in the account of he own life to leave he hardly visible they wish to have a more concise and for that reason perhaps a more satisfactory account such as may exhibit a just picture of the man and keep he the principal figure in the foreground of he own picture to comply with that request be the design of this essay which the writer undertake with a tremble hand he have no discovery no secret anecdote no occasional controversy no sudden flash of wit and humor no private conversation and no new fact to embellish he work every thing have be glean dr johnson say of himself i be not uncandid nor severe : i sometimes say more than i mean in jest and people be apt to think I serious -lrb- a -rrb- the exercise of that privilege which be enjoy by every man in society have not be allow to he he fame have give importance even to trifle and the zeal of he friend have bring every thing to light what should be related and what should not have be publish without distinction : dicenda tacenda locutus every thing that fall from he have be catch with eagerness by he admirer who as he say in one of he letter have act with the diligence of spy upon he conduct to some of they the follow line in mallet 's poem on verbal criticism be not inapplicable : such that grave bird in northern sea be find whose

behind with those choice cate he palate to regale and be the careful tibbald of a whale after so many essay and volume of johnsoniana what remain for the present writer perhaps what have not be attempt a short yet full a faithful yet temperate history of dr johnson samuel johnson be bear at lichfield September 7 1709 o s -lrb- b -rrb- he father michael johnson be a bookseller in that city a man of large athletic make and violent passion wrong-headed positive and at time afflict with a degree of melancholy little short of madness he mother be sister to dr ford a practise physician and father of cornelius ford generally know by the name of parson ford the same who be represent near the punch-bowl in hogarth 's midnight modern conversation in the life of fenton johnson say that he ability instead of furnish convivial merriment to the voluptuous and dissolute might have enable he to excel among the virtuous and the wise be chaplain to the earl of chesterfield he wish to attend that nobleman on he embassy to the hague colley cibber have record the anecdote you should go say the witty peer if to you many vice you would add one more pray my lord what be that hypocrisy my dear doctor johnson have a younger brother name nathaniel who die at the age of twenty-seven or twenty-eight michael johnson the father be choose in the year 1718 under bailiff of lichfield and in the year 1725 he serve the office of the senior bailiff he have a brother of the name of andrew who for some year keep the ring at smithfield appropriate to wrestler and boxer we author use to say that he be never throw or conquer michael the father die December 1731 at the age of seventy-six : he mother at eighty-nine of a gradual decay in the year 1759 of the family nothing more can be related worthy of notice johnson do not delight in talking of he relation there be little pleasure he say to mr piozzus in relate the anecdote of beggary johnson derive from he parent or from a unwholesome nurse the distemper call the king 's evil the jacobite at that time believe in the efficacy of the royal touch and accordingly mr johnson present she son when two year old before queen anne who for the first time perform that office and communicate to she young patient all the healing virtue in she power -lrb- c -rrb- he be afterwards cut for that scrophulous humor and the under part of he face be seam and disfigure by the operation it be suppose that this disease deprive he of the sight of he left eye and also impair he hearing at eight year old he be place under mr hawkin at the free school in lichfield where he be not remarkable for diligence or regular application whatever he read he tenacious memory make he own in the field with he schoolfellow he talk more to himself than with he companion in 1725 when he be about sixteen year old he go on a visit to he cousin cornelius ford who detain he for some month and in the mean time assist he in the classic the general direction for he study which he then receive he relate to mr piozzus obtain say ford some general principle of every science : he who can talk only on one subject or act only in one department be seldom wanted and perhaps never wish for while the man of general knowledge can often benefit and always please this advice johnson seem to have pursue with a good inclination he reading be always desultory seldom rest on any particular author but ramble from one book to another and by hasty snatch hoard up a variety of knowledge it may be proper in this place to mention another general rule lay down by ford for johnson 's future conduct : you will make you way the more easily in the world as you be contented to dispute no man 's claim to conversation excellence : they will therefore more willingly allow you pretension as a writer but say mr piozzi the feature of peculiarity which mark a character to all succeed generation be slow in come to they growth that ingenious lady add with she usual vivacity can one on such a occasion forbear recollect the prediction of boileau 's father who say stroke the head of the young satirist ` this little man have too much wit but he will never speak ill of any one ' on johnson 's return from cornelius ford mr hunter then master of the free school at lichfield refuse to receive he again on that foundation at this distance of time what he reason be it be vain to inquire but to refuse assistance to a lad of promising genius must be pronounced harsh and illiberal it do not however stop the progress of the young student 's education he be place at another school at stourbridge in worcestershire under the care of mr wentworth have go through the rudiment of classic literature he return to he father 's house and be probably intend for the trade of a bookseller he have be hear to say that he could bind a book at the end of two year be then about nineteen he go to assist the study of a young gentleman of the name of corbet to the university of oxford and on the 31st of October 1728 both be enter of pembroke college corbet as a gentleman-commoner and johnson as a commoner the college tutor mr jordan be a man of no genius and johnson it seem shew a early contempt of mean ability in one or two instance behave with insolence to that gentleman of he general conduct at the university there be no particulars that merit attention except the translation of pope 's messiah which be a college exercise impose upon he as a task by mr jordan corbet leave the university in about two year and johnson 's salary cease he be by consequence straiten in he circumstance but he still remain at college mr jordan the tutor go off to a living and be succeed by dr adam who afterwards become head of the college and be esteem through life for he learn he talent and he amiable character johnson grow more regular in he attendance ethic theology and classic literature be he favorite study he discover notwithstanding early symptom of that wander disposition of mind which adhere to he to the end of he life he reading be by fit and start undirected to any particular science general philology agreeably to he cousin ford 's advice be the object of he ambition he receive at that time a early impression of piety and a taste for the best author ancient and modern it may notwithstanding be question whether except he bible he ever read a book entirely through late in life if any man praise a book in he presence he be sure to ask do you read it through if the answer be in the affirmative he do not seem willing to believe it he continue at the university till the want of pecuniary supplies oblige he to quit the place he obtain however the assistance of a friend and return in a short time be able to complete a residence of three year the history of he exploit at oxford he use to say be best know to dr taylor and dr adam wonder be tell of he memory and indeed all who know he late in life can witness that he retain that faculty in the greatest vigor from the university johnson return to lichfield he father die soon after December 1731 and the whole receipt out of he effect as appear by a memorandum in the son 's handwriting date 15th of June 1732 be no more than twenty pound -lrb- d -rrb- in this exigence determine that poverty should neither depress he spirit nor warp he integrity he become under-master of a grammar school at market bosworth in leicestershire that resource however do not last long disgusted by the pride of sir wolstan dixie the patron of that little seminary he leave the place in discontent and ever after speak of it with abhorrence in 1733 he go on a visit to mr hector who have be he schoolfellow and be then a surgeon at birmingham lodging at the house of warren a bookseller at that place johnson translate a voyage to abyssinium write by jerome lobo a portuguese missionary this be the first literary work from the pen of dr johnson he friend hector be occasionally he amanuensis the work be probably undertake at the desire of warren the bookseller and be print at birmingham but it appear in the literary magazine or history of the work of the learn for march 1735 that it be publish by bettesworth and hitch paternoster row it contain a narrative of the endeavor of a company of missionary to convert the people of abyssinium to the church of rome in the preface to this work johnson observe that the portuguese traveller contrary to the general view of he countryman have amuse he reader with no romantick absurdity or incredible fiction he appear by he modest and unaffected narration to have describe thing as he see they to have copy nature from the life and to have consult he sens not he imagination he meet with no basilisk that destroy with they eye he crocodile devour they prey without tear and he cataract fall from the rock without deafen the neighbouring inhabitant the reader will here find no region curse with irremediable barrenness or bless with spontaneous fecundity no perpetual gloom or unceasing sunshine nor be the nation here describe either void of all sense of humanity or consummate in all private and social virtue here be no hottentot without religion polity or articulate language no chinese perfectly polite and completely skilled in all science he will discover what will always be discover by a diligent and impartial inquirer that wherever human nature be to be find there be a mixture of vice and virtue a contest of passion and reason and that the creator doth not appear partial in he distribution but have balance in most country they particular inconveniency by particular favor -- we have here a early specimen of johnson 's manner the vein of thinking and the frame of the sentence be manifestly he : we see the infant hercule the translation of lobo 's narrative have be reprint lately in a separate volume with some other tract of dr johnson 's and therefore form no part of this edition but a compendious account of so interesting a work as father lobo 's discovery of the head of the nile will not it be imagine be unacceptable to the reader father lobo the portuguese missionary embark in 1622 in the same fleet with the count vidigueira who be appoint by the king of portugal viceroy of the indy they arrive at goa and in January 1624 father lobo set out on the mission to abyssinia two of the jesuit send on the same commission be murder in they attempt to penetrate into that empire lobo have better success he surmount all difficulty and make he way into the heart of the country then follow a description of abyssinium formerly the largest empire of which we have a account in history it extend from the red sea to the kingdom of congo and from egypt to the indian sea contain no less than forty province at the time of lobo 's mission it be not much larger than spain consist then but of five kingdom of which part be entirely subject to the emperor and part pay he a tribute as a acknowledgment the province be inhabit by moor pagan jew and christian the last be in lobo 's time the established and reign religion the diversity of people and religion be the reason why the kingdom be under different form of government with law and custom extremely various some of the people neither sow they land nor improve they by any kind of culture living upon milk and flesh and like the arab encamp without any settle habitation in some place they practice no rite of worship though they believe that in the region above there dwell a be that govern the world this deity they call in they language oul the christianity profess by the people in some part be so corrupt with superstition error and heresy and so mingled with ceremony borrow from the jew that little besides the name of christianity be to be find among they the abyssin can not properly be say to have either city or house they live in tent or cottage make of straw or clay very rarely build with stone they village or town consist of these hut yet even of such village they have but few because the grandee the viceroy and the emperor himself be always in camp that they may be prepare upon the most sudden alarm to meet every emergence in a country which be engage every year either in foreign war or intestine commotion aethiopium produce very near the same kind of provision as portugal though by the extreme laziness of the inhabitant in a much less quantity what the ancient imagine of the torrid zone be a part of the world uninhabitable be so far from be true that the climate be very temperate the black have better feature than in other country and be not without wit and ingenuity they apprehension be quick and they judgment sound there be in this climate two harvest in the year one in winter which last through the month of July August and September the other in the spring they have in the greatest plenty raisin peach pomegranate sugar-cane and some fig most of these be ripe about lend which the abyssin keep with great strictness the animal of the country be the lion the elephant the rhinoceros the unicorn horse mule ox and cow without number they have a very particular custom which oblige every man that have a thousand cow to save every year one day 's milk of all he herd and make a bath with it for he relation this they do so many day in each year as they have thousand of cattle so that to express how rich a man be they tell you ` he bathe so many time ' of the river nile which have furnish so much controversy we have a full and clear description it be call by the native abavi the father of water it rise in sacala a province of the kingdom of goiama the most fertile and agreeable part of the abyssinian dominion on the eastern side of the country on the declivity of a mountain whose descent be so easy that it seem a beautiful plain be that source of the nile which have be seek after at so much expense and labor this spring or rather these two spring be two hole each about two foot diameter a stone 's cast distant from each other one of they be about five foot and a half in depth lobo be not able to sink he plummet lower perhaps because it be stop by root the whole place be full of tree a line of ten foot do not reach the bottom of the other these spring be suppose by the abyssin to be the vent of a great subterraneous lake at a small distance to the south be a village call guix through which you ascend to the top of the mountain where there be a little hill which the idolatrous agacus hold in great veneration they priest call they together to this place once a year and every one sacrifice a cow or more accord to the different degree of wealth and devotion hence we have sufficient proof that these nation always pay adoration to the deity of this famous river as to the course of the nile its water after they first rise run towards the east about the length of a musket-shot then turn northward continue hide in the grass and weed for about a quarter of a league when they reappear amongst a quantity of rock the nile from its source proceed with so inconsiderable a current that it be in danger of be dry up by the hot season but soon receive a increase from the gemma the keltu the bransa and the other smaller river it expand to such a breadth in the plain of boad which be not above three day ' journey from its source that a musket-ball will scarcely fly from one bank to the other here it begin to run northward wind however a little to the east for the space of nine or ten league and then enter the so-much-talked-of lake of dambium flow with such violent rapidity that its water may be distinguish through the whole passage which be no less than six league here begin the greatness of the nile fifteen mile farther in the land of alata it rush precipitately from the top of a high rock and form one of the most beautiful waterfall in the world lobo say he pass under it without be wet and rest himself for the sake of the coolness be charm with a thousand delightful rainbow which the sunbeam paint on the water in all they shine and lively color -lrb- e -rrb- the fall of this mighty stream from so great a height make a noise that may be hear at a considerable distance : but it be not find that the neighbouring inhabitant be deaf after the cataract the nile collect its scattered stream among the rock which be so near each other that in lobo 's time a bridge of beam on which the whole imperial army pass be lay over they sultan sequed have since build a stone bridge of one arch in the same place for which purpose he procure mason from indium here the river alter its course and pass through various kingdom such as amhara olaca choaa damot and the kingdom of goiama and after various winding return within a short day 's journey of its spring to pursue it through all its maze and accompany it round the kingdom of goiama be a journey of twenty-nine day from abyssinia the river pass into the country of fazulo and ombarca two vast region little known inhabit by nation entirely different from the abyssin they hair like that of the other black in those region be short and curl in the year 1615 rasselum christo lieutenant-general to sultan seque enter those kingdom in a hostile manner but not be able to get intelligence return without attempt any thing as the empire of abyssinium terminate at these descent lobo follow the course of the nile no farther leave it to rage over barbarous kingdom and convey wealth and plenty into aegypt which owe to the annual inundation of this river its envied fertility -lrb- f -rrb- lobo know nothing of the nile in the rest of its passage except that it receive great increase from many other river have several cataract like that already describe and that few fish be to be find in it : that scarcity be to be attribute to the river-horse and the crocodile which destroy the weaker inhabitant of the river something likewise must be imputed to the cataract where fish can not fall without be kill lobo add that neither he nor any with whom he converse about the crocodile ever see he weep and therefore all that have be say about he tear must be rank among the fable invent for the amusement of child as to the cause of the inundation of the nile lobo observe that many a idle hypothesis have be frame some theorist ascribe it to the high wind that stop the current and force the water above its bank other pretend a subterraneous communication between the ocean and the nile and that the sea when violently agitate swell the river many be of opinion that this mighty flood proceeds from the melting of the snow on the mountain of aethiopium but so much snow and such prodigious heat be never meet with in the same region lobo never see snow in abyssinium except on mount semen in the kingdom of tigre very remote from the nile and on namara which be indeed nor far distant but where there never fall snow enough to wet when dissolve the foot of the mountain to the immense labor of the portuguese mankind be indebted for the knowledge of the real cause of these inundation so great and so regular by they we be inform that abyssinium where the nile rise be full of mountain and in its natural situation be much higher than aegypt that in the winter from June to September no day be without rain that the nile receive in its course all the river brook and torrent that fall from those mountain and by necessary consequence swell above its bank fill the plain of aegypt with inundation which come regularly about the month of July or three week after the beginning of the rainy season in aethiopium the different degree of this flood be such certain indication of the fruitfulness or sterility of the ensue year that it be publickly proclaim at cairo how much the water have gain during the night such be the account of the nile and its inundation which it be hope will not be deem a improper or tedious digression especially as the whole be a extract from johnson 's translation he be all the time the actor in the scene and in he own word relate the story have finish this work he return in February 1734 to he native city and in the month of August follow publish proposal for printing by subscription the latin poem of politian with the history of latin poetry from the aera of petrarch to the time of politian and also the life of politian to be add by the editor samuel johnson the book to be print in thirty octavo sheet price five shilling it be to be regret that this project fail for want of encouragement johnson it seem differ from boileau voltaire and d'alembert who have take upon they to proscribe all modern effort to write with elegance in a dead language for a decision pronounce in so high a tone no good reason can be assign the interest of learn require that the diction of greece and rome should be cultivate with care and he who can write a language with correctness will be most likely to understand its idiom its grammar and its peculiar grace of style what man of taste would willingly forego the pleasure of read vida fracastorius sannazaro strada and other down to the late elegant production of bishop lowth the history which johnson propose to himself would beyond all question have be a valuable addition to the history of letter but he project fail he next expedient be to offer he assistance to cave the original projector of the gentleman 's magazine for this purpose he send he proposal in a letter offer on reasonable term occasionally to fill some page with poem and inscription never print before with fugitive piece that deserve to be revive and critical remark on author ancient and modern cave agree to retain he as a correspondent and contributor to the magazine what the condition be can not now be know but certainly they be not sufficient to hinder johnson from cast he eye about he in quest of other employment accordingly in 1735 he make overture to the reverend mr budworth master of a grammar school at brerewood in staffordshire to become he assistant this proposition do not succeed mr budworth apprehend that the involuntary motion to which johnson 's nerve be subject might make he a object of ridicule with he scholar and by consequence lessen they respect for they master another mode of advance himself present itself about this time mr porter the widow of a mercer in birmingham admire he talent it be say that she have about eight hundred pound and that sum to a person in johnson 's circumstance be a affluent fortune a marriage take place and to turn he wife 's money to the best advantage he project the scheme of a academy for education gilbert walmsley at that time registrar of the ecclesiastical court of the bishop of lichfield be distinguish by he erudition and the politeness of he manners he be the friend of johnson and by he weight and influence endeavor to promote he interest the celebrated garrick whose father captain garrick live at lichfield be place in the new seminary of education by that gentleman 's advice -- garrick be then about eighteen year old a accession of seven or eight pupil be the most that could be obtain though notice be give by a public advertisement -lrb- g -rrb- that at edial near lichfield in staffordshire young gentleman be board and teach the latin and greek language by samuel johnson the undertaking prove abortive johnson have now abandon all hope of promote he fortune in the country determine to become a adventurer in the world at large he young pupil garrick have form the same resolution and accordingly in march 1737 they arrive in london together two such candidate for fame perhaps never before that day enter the metropolis together they stock of money be soon exhaust in he visionary project of a academy johnson have probably waste he wife 's substance and garrick 's father have little more than he half-pay -- the two fellow-traveller have the world before they and each be to choose he road to fortune and to fame they bring with they genius and power of mind peculiarly form by nature for the different vocation to which each of they feel himself inclined they act from the impulse of young mind even then meditate great thing and with courage anticipate success they friend mr walmsley by a letter to the reverend mr colson who it seem be a great mathematician exert he good office in they favor he give notice of they intended journey : davy garrick he say will be with you next week and johnson to try he fate with a tragedy and to get himself employ in some translation either from the latin or french johnson be a very good scholar and a poet and i have great hope will turn out a fine tragedy-writer if it should be in you way i doubt not but you will be ready to recommend and assist you countryman of mr walmsley 's merit and the excellence of he character johnson have leave a beautiful testimonial at the end of the life of edmund smith it be reasonable to conclude that a mathematician absorb in abstract speculation be not able to find a sphere of action for two man who be to be the architect of they own fortune in three or four year afterwards garrick come forth with talent that astonish the public he begin he career at goodman 's field and there monstratus fatis vespasianus he choose a lucrative profession and consequently soon emerge from all he difficulty johnson be leave to toil in the humble walk of literature a tragedy as appear by walmsley 's letter be the whole of he stock this most probably be irene but if then finish it be doom to wait for a more happy period it be offer to fleetwood and reject johnson look round he for employment have while he remain in the country correspond with cave under a feigned name he now think it time to make himself know to a man whom he consider as a patron of literature cave have announce by public advertisement a prize of fifty pound for the best poem on life death judgment heaven and hell and this circumstance diffuse a idea of he liberality johnson become connect with he in business and in a close and intimate acquaintance of cave 's character it be unnecessary to say any thing in this place as johnson be afterwards the biographer of he first and most useful patron to be engage in the translation of some important book be still the object which johnson have in view for this purpose he propose to give the history of the council of trent with copious note then lately add to a french edition twelve sheet of this work be print for which johnson receive forty-nine pound as appear by he receipt in the possession of mr nichol the compiler of that entertaining and useful work the gentleman 's magazine johnson 's translation be never complete : a like design be offer to the public under the patronage of dr zachary pearce and by that contention both attempt be frustrated johnson have be commend by pope for the translation of the messiah into latin verse but he know no approach to so eminent a man with one however who be connect with pope he become acquaint at st john 's gate and that person be no other than the well-known richard savage whose life be afterwards write by johnson with great elegance and a depth of moral reflection savage be a man of considerable talent he address he various accomplishment and above all the peculiarity of he misfortune recommend he to johnson 's notice they become unite in the closest intimacy both have great part and they be equally under the pressure of want sympathy join they in a league of friendship johnson have be often hear to relate that he and savage walk round grosvenor square till four in the morning in the course of they conversation reform the world dethrone prince establish new form of government and give law to the several state of europe till fatigue at length with they legislative office they begin to feel the want of refreshment but could not muster up more than four-pence-halfpenny savage it be true have many vice but vice could never strike its root in a mind like johnson 's seasoned early with religion and the principle of moral rectitude he first prayer be compose in the year 1738 he have not at that time renounce the use of wine and no doubt occasionally enjoy he friend and he bottle the love of late hour which follow he through life be perhaps originally contract in company with savage however that may be they connexion be not of long duration in the year 1738 savage be reduce to the last distress mr pope in a letter to he express he concern for the miserable withdraw of he pension after the death of the queen and give he hope that in a short time he should find himself supply with a competence without any dependance on those little creature whom we be pleased to call the great the scheme propose to he be that he should retire to swansea in wale and receive a allowance of fifty pound a year to be raise by subscription : pope be to pay twenty pound this plan though finally establish take more than a year before it be carry into execution in the mean time the intended retreat of savage call to johnson 's mind the third satire of juvenal in which that poet take leave of a friend who be withdraw himself from all the vice of rome strike with this idea he write that well-known poem call london the first line manifestly point to savage though grief and fondness in my breast rebel when injur would thale bid the town farewell yet still my calmer thought he choice commend i praise the hermit but regret the friend : resolv would at length from vice and london far to breathe in distant field a purer air and fix would on cambrium 's solitary shore give to st david one true briton more johnson at that time lodge at greenwich he there fix the scene and take leave of he friend who he say in he life part from he with tear in he eye the poem when finish be offer to cave it happen however that the late mr dodsley be the purchaser at the price of ten guinea it be publish in 1738 and pope we be tell say the author whoever he be will not be long conceal allude to the passage in terence ubus ubus est diu celarus non potest notwithstanding that prediction it do not appear that besides the copy-money any advantage accrue to the author of a poem write with the elegance and energy of pope johnson in August 1738 go with all the fame of he poetry to offer himself a candidate for the mastership of the school at appleby in leicestershire the statute of the place require that the person choose should be a master of art to remove this objection the then lord gower be induce to write to a friend in order to obtain for johnson a master 's degree in the university of dublin by the recommendation of dr swift the letter be print in one of the magazine and be as follow : sir -- mr samuel johnson author of london a satire and some other poetical piece be a native of this county and much respect by some worthy gentleman in the neighborhood who be trustee of a charity-school now vacant the certain salary of which be sixty pound per year of which they be desirous to make he master but unfortunately he be not capable of receive they bounty which would make he happy for life by not be a master of art which by the statute of the school the master of it must be now these gentleman do I the honor to think that i have interest enough in you to prevail upon you to write to dean swift to persuade the university of dublin to send a diploma to I constitute this poor man master of art in they university they highly extol the man 's learning and probity and will not be persuade that the university will make any difficulty of confer such a favor upon a stranger if he be recommend by the dean they say he be not afraid of the strictest examination though he be of so long a journey and yet he will venture it if the dean think it necessary choosing rather to die upon the road than to be starve to death in translate for bookseller which have be he only subsistence for some time past i fear there be more difficulty in this affair than these good-natured gentleman apprehend especially as they election can not be delay longer than the eleventh of next month if you see this matter in the same light that it appear to I i hope you will burn this and pardon I for give you so much trouble about a impracticable thing but if you think there be a probability of obtain the favor ask i be sure you humanity and propensity to relieve merit in distress will incline you to serve the poor man without my add any more to the trouble i have already give you than assure you that i be with great truth sir you faithful humble servant trentham aug 1st gower this scheme miscarry there be reason to think that swift decline to meddle in the business and to that circumstance johnson 's known dislike of swift have be often imputed it be mortify to pursue a man of merit through all he difficulty and yet this narrative must be through many follow year the history of genius and virtue struggle with adversity have lose the school at appleby johnson be throw back on the metropolis breed to no profession without relation friend or interest he be condemn to drudgery in the service of cave he only patron in November 1738 be publish a translation of crousaz 's examan of pope 's essay on man contain a succinct view of the system of the fatalist and a confutation of they opinion with a illustration of the doctrine of free will and a enquiry what view mr pope might have in touch upon the leibnitzian philosophy and fatalism : by mr crousaz professor of philosophy and mathematics at lausanne this translation have be generally think a production of johnson 's pen but it be now know that mr elizabeth carter have acknowledge it to be one of she early performance it be certain however that johnson be eager to promote the publication he consider the foreign philosopher as a man zealous in the cause of religion and with he he be willing to join against the system of the fatalist and the doctrine of leibnitz it be well know that warburton write a vindication of mr pope but there be reason to think that johnson conceive a early prejudice against the essay on man and what once take root in a mind like he be not easily eradicate he letter to cave on this subject be still extant and may well justify sir john hawkin who infer that johnson be the translator of crousaz the conclusion of the letter be remarkable : i be yours impransus if by that latin word be mean that he have not dine because he want the means who can read it even at this hour without a ache heart with a mind naturally vigorous and quicken by necessity johnson form a multiplicity of project but most of they prove abortive a number of small tract issue from he pen with wonderful rapidity such as marmor norfolciense or a essay on a ancient prophetical inscription in monkish rhyme discover at lynn in norfolk by probus britannicus this be a pamphlet against sir robert walpole accord to sir john hawkin a warrant be issue to apprehend the author who retire with he wife to a obscure lodging near lambeth marsh and there elude the search of the messenger but this story have no foundation in truth johnson be never know to mention such a incident in he life and mr steele late of the treasury cause diligent search to be make at the proper office and no trace of such a proceeding could be find in the same year -lrb- 1739 -rrb- the lord chamberlain prohibit the representation of a tragedy call gustavus vas by henry brooke under the mask of irony johnson publish a vindication of the licenser from the malicious and scandalous aspersion of mr brooke of these two piece sir john hawkin say they have neither learn nor wit nor a single ray of that genius which have since blaze forth but as they have be lately reprint the reader who wish to gratify he curiosity be refer to the fourteenth volume of johnson 's work publish by stockdale -lrb- h -rrb- the life of boerhaave blake barratier father paul and other be about that time print in the gentleman 's magazine the subscription of fifty pound a year for savage be complete and in July 1739 johnson part with the companion of he midnight hour never to see he more the separation be perhaps a advantage to he who want to make a right use of he time and even then behold with self-reproach the waste occasion by dissipation he abstinence from wine and strong liquor begin soon after the departure of savage what habit he contract in the course of that acquaintance can not now be know the ambition of excel in conversation and that pride of victory which at time disgrace a man of johnson 's genius be perhaps native blemish a fierce spirit of independence even in the midst of poverty may be see in savage and if not thence transfuse by johnson into he own manners it may at least be suppose to have gain strength from the example before he during that connexion there be if we believe sir john hawkin a short separation between we author and he wife but a reconciliation soon take place johnson love she and show he affection in various mode of gallantry which garrick use to render ridiculous by he mimicry the affectation of soft and fashionable air do not become a unwieldy figure : he admiration be receive by the wife with the flutter of a antiquated coquette and both it be well know furnished matter for the lively genius of garrick it be a mortifying reflection that johnson with a store of learning and extraordinary talent be not able at the age of thirty to force he way to the favor of the public : slow rise worth by poverty depress would he be still as he say himself to provide for the day that be pass over he he see cave involve in a state of warfare with the numerous competitor at that time struggle with the gentleman 's magazine and gratitude for such supplies as johnson receive dictate a latin ode on the subject of that contention the first line urbane nulli fesse laboribus urbane nulli victe calumnii put one in mind of casimir 's ode to pope urban : urbane regum maxime maxime urbane vatum -- the polish poet be probably at that time in the hand of a man who have meditate the history of the latin poet guthrie the historian have from July 1736 compose the parliamentary speech for the magazine but from the beginning of the session which open on the 19th of November 1740 johnson succeed to that department and continue it from that time to the debate on spirituous liquor which happen in the house of lord in February 1742-3 the eloquence the force of argument and the splendor of language display in the several speech be well know and universally admire that johnson be the author of the debate during that period be not generally know but the secret transpired several year afterwards and be avow by himself on the follow occasion mr wedderburne now lord loughborough -lrb- i -rrb- dr johnson dr franci the translator of horace the present writer and other dine with the late mr foote a important debate towards the end of sir robert walpole 's administration be mention dr franci observe that mr pitt 's speech on that occasion be the best he have ever read he add that he have employ eight year of he life in the study of demosthene and finish a translation of that celebrated orator with all the decoration of style and language within the reach of he capacity but he have meet with nothing equal to the speech above mention many of the company remember the debate and some passage be cite with the approbation and applause of all present during the ardor of conversation johnson remain silent as soon as the warmth of praise subside he open with these word : that speech i write in a garret in exeter street the company be strike with astonishment after stare at each other in silent amaze dr franci ask how that speech could be write by he sir say johnson i write it in exeter street i never have be in the gallery of the house of common but once cave have interest with the door-keeper he and the person employ under he gain admittance they bring away the subject of discussion the name of the speaker the side they take and the order in which they rise together with note of the argument advance in the course of the debate the whole be afterwards communicate to I and i compose the speech in the form which they now have in the parliamentary debate to this discovery dr franci make answer : then sir you have exceed demosthene himself for to say that you have exceed franci 's demosthene would be say nothing the rest of the company bestow lavish encomium on johnson : one in particular praise he impartiality observe that he deal out reason and eloquence with a equal hand to both party that be not quite true say johnson i save appearance tolerably well but i take care that the whig dog should not have the best of it the sale of the magazine be greatly increase by the parliamentary debate which be continue by johnson till the month of march 1742-3 from that time the magazine be conduct by dr hawkesworth in 1743-4 osborne the bookseller who keep a shop in gray 's inn purchase the earl of oxford 's library at the price of thirteen thousand pound he project a catalogue in five octavo volume at five shilling each johnson be employ in that painful drudgery he be likewise to collect all such small tract as be in any degree worth preserve in order to reprint and publish the whole in a collection call the harleian miscellany the catalogue be complete and the miscellany in 1749 be publish in eight quarto volume in this business johnson be a day-labourer for immediate subsistence not unlike gustavus vas work in the mine of dalecarlium what wilcox a bookseller of eminence in the strand say to johnson on he first arrival in town be now almost confirm he lend we author five guinea and then ask he how do you mean to earn you livelihood in this town by my literary labor be the answer wilcox stare at he shake he head : by you literary labor you have better buy a porter 's knot johnson use to tell this anecdote to mr nichol : but he say wilcox be one of my best friend and he mean well in fact johnson while employ in gray 's inn may be say to have carry a porter 's knot he pause occasionally to peruse the book that come to he hand osborne think that such curiosity tend to nothing but delay and object to it with all the pride and insolence of a man who know that he pay daily wages in the dispute that of course ensue osborne with that roughness which be natural to he enforce he argument by give the lie johnson seize a folio and knock the bookseller down this story have be relate as a instance of johnson 's ferocity but merit can not always take the spurn of the unworthy with a patient spirit -lrb- k -rrb- that the history of a author must be find in he work be in general a true observation and be never more apparent than in the present narrative every aera of johnson 's life be fix by he writings in 1744 he publish the life of savage and then project a new edition of shakespeare as a prelude to that design he publish in 1745 miscellaneous observation on the tragedy of macbeth with remark on sir thoma hanmer 's edition to which be prefixed proposal for a new edition of shakespeare with a specimen of this pamphlet warburton in the preface to shakespeare have give he opinion : as to all those thing which have be publish under the title of essay remark observation & c on shakespeare if you except some critical note on macbeth give as a specimen of a project edition and write as appear by a man of part and genius the rest be absolutely below a serious notice but the attention of the public be not excite there be no friend to promote a subscription and the project die to revive at a future day a new undertaking however be soon after propose namely a english dictionary upon a enlarged plan several of the most opulent bookseller have meditate a work of this kind and the agreement be soon adjust between the party embolden by this connexion johnson thought of a better habitation than he have hitherto know he have lodge with he wife in court and alley about the strand but now for the purpose of carry on he arduous undertaking and to be nearer he printer and friend mr strahan he venture to take a house in gough square fleet street he be tell that the earl of chesterfield be a friend to he undertaking and in consequence of that intelligence he publish in 1747 the plan of a dictionary of the english language address to the right honorable philip dormer earl of chesterfield one of he majesty 's principal secretary of state mr whitehead afterwards poet laureate undertake to convey the manuscript to he lordship : the consequence be a invitation from lord chesterfield to the author a stronger contrast of character could not be bring together the nobleman celebrate for he wit and all the grace of polite behavior the author conscious of he own merit towering in idea above all competition verse in scholastic logic but a stranger to the art of polite conversation uncouth vehement and vociferous the coalition be too unnatural johnson expect a maecena and be disappointed no patronage no assistance follow visit be repeat but the reception be not cordial johnson one day be leave a full hour wait in a antichamber till a gentleman should retire and leave he lordship at leisure this be the famous colley cibber johnson see he go and fire with indignation rush out of the house -lrb- l -rrb- what lord chesterfield thought of he visitor may be see in a passage in one of that nobleman 's letter to he son -lrb- m -rrb- there be a man whose moral character deep learning and superior part i acknowledge admire and respect but whom it be so impossible for I to love that i be almost in a fever whenever i be in he company he figure -lrb- without be deform -rrb- seem make to disgrace or ridicule the common structure of the human body he leg and arm be never in the position which accord to the situation of he body they ought to be in but constantly employ in commit act of hostility upon the grace he throw any where but down he throat whatever he mean to drink and mangle what he mean to carve inattentive to all the regard of social life he mistime and misplace every thing he dispute with heat indiscriminately mindless of the rank character and situation of those with whom he dispute absolutely ignorant of the several gradation of familiarity and respect he be exactly the same to he superior he equal and he inferior and therefore by a necessary consequence be absurd to two of the three be it possible to love such a man no the utmost i can do for he be to consider he a respectable hottentot such be the idea entertain by lord chesterfield after the incident of colley cibber johnson never repeat he visit in he high and decisive tone he have be often hear to say lord chesterfield be a wit among lord and a lord among wit in the course of the year 1747 garrick in conjunction with lacy become patentee of drury lane playhouse for the opening of the theater at the usual time johnson write for he friend the well-known prologue which to say no more of it may at least be place on a level with pope 's to the tragedy of cato the playhouse be now under garrick 's direction johnson think the opportunity fair to think of he tragedy of irene which be he whole stock on he first arrival in town in the year 1737 that play be accordingly put into rehearsal in January 1749 as a precursor to prepare the way and to awaken the public attention the vanity of human wish a poem in imitation of the tenth satire of juvenal by the author of london be publish in the same month in the gentleman 's magazine for February 1749 we find that the tragedy of irene be act at drury lane on Monday February the 6th and from that time without interruption to Monday February the 20th be in all thirteen night since that time it have not be exhibit on any stage irene may be add to some other play in we language which have lose they place in the theater but continue to please in the closet during the representation of this piece johnson attend every night behind the scene conceive that he character as a author require some ornament for he person he choose upon that occasion to decorate himself with a handsome waistcoat and a gold-laced hat the late mr topham beauclerc who have a great deal of that humor which please the more for seem undesigned use to give a pleasant description of this green-room finery as relate by the author himself but say johnson with great gravity i soon lay aside my gold-laced hat lest it should make I proud the amount of the three benefit night for the tragedy of irene it be to be fear be not very considerable as the profit that stimulate motive never invite the author to another dramatic attempt some year afterwards when the present writer be intimate with garrick and know johnson to be in distress he ask the manager why he do not produce another tragedy for he lichfield friend garrick 's answer be remarkable : when johnson write tragedy ` declamation roar and passion sleep : ' when shakespeare write he dip he pen in he own heart there may perhaps be a degree of sameness in this regular way of trace a author from one work to another and the reader may feel the effect of a tedious monotony but in the life of johnson there be no other landmark he be now forty year old and have mixed but little with the world he follow no profession transact no business and be a stranger to what be call a town life we be now arrive at the brightest period he have hitherto know he name break out upon mankind with a degree of lustre that promise a triumph over all he difficulty the life of savage be admire as a beautiful and instructive piece of biography the two imitation of juvenal be think to rival even the excellence of pope and the tragedy of irene though uninteresting on the stage be universally admire in the closet for the propriety of the sentiment the richness of the language and the general harmony of the whole composition he fame be widely diffused and he have make he agreement with the bookseller for he english dictionary at the sum of fifteen hundred guinea a part of which be to be from time to time advance in proportion to the progress of the work this be a certain fund for he support without be oblige to write fugitive piece for the petty supplies of the day accordingly we find that in 1749 he establish a club consist of ten in number at horseman 's in ivy lane on every Tuesday evening this be the first scene of social life to which johnson can be trace out of he own house the member of this little society be samuel johnson dr salter father of the late master of the charter house dr hawkesworth mr ryland a merchant mr payne a bookseller in paternoster row mr samuel dyer a learn young man dr william m ` ghie a scotch physician dr edmund barker a young physician dr bathurst another young physician and sir john hawkin this list be give by sir john as it should seem with no other view than to draw a spiteful and malevolent character of almost every one of they mr dyer whom sir john say he love with the affection of a brother meet with the harshest treatment because it be he maxim that to live in peace with mankind and in a temper to do good office be the most essential part of we duty that notion of moral goodness give umbrage to sir john hawkin and draw down upon the memory of he friend the bitterest imputation mr dyer however be admire and love through life he be a man of literature johnson love to enter with he into a discussion of metaphysical moral and critical subject in those conflict exercise he talent and accord to he custom always contend for victory dr bathurst be the person on whom johnson fix he affection he hardly ever speak of he without tear in he eye it be from he who be a native of jamaica that johnson receive into he service frank -lrb- n -rrb- the black servant whom on account of he master he value to the end of he life at the time of institute the club in ivy lane johnson have project the rambler the title be most probably suggest by the wanderer a poem which he mention with the warmest praise in the life of savage with the same spirit of independence with which he wish to live it be now he pride to write he communicate he plan to none of he friend : he desire no assistance rely entirely on he own fund and the protection of the divine be which he implore in a solemn form of prayer compose by himself for the occasion have form a resolution to undertake a work that might be of use and honor to he country he think with milton that this be not to be obtain but by devout prayer to that eternal spirit that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and send out he seraph with the hallowed fire of he altar to touch and purify the lip of whom he please have invoke the special protection of heaven and by that act of piety fortify he mind he begin the great work of the rambler the first number be publish on Tuesday march the 20th 1750 and from that time be continue regularly every Tuesday and Saturday for the space of two year when it finally close on Saturday march 14 1752 as it begin with motive of piety so it appear that the same religious spirit glow with unabating ardor to the last he conclusion be : the essay professedly serious if i have be able to execute my own intention will be find exactly conformable to the precept of christianity without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity of the present age i therefore look back on this part of my work with pleasure which no man shall diminish or augment i shall never envy the honor which wit and learn obtain in any other cause if i can be number among the writer who have give ardor to virtue and confidence to truth the whole number of essay amount to two hundred and eight addison be in the spectator be more in number but not half in point of quantity : addison be not bind to publish on state day he could watch the ebb and flow of he genius and send he paper to the press when he own taste be satisfied johnson 's case be very different he write singly and alone in the whole progress of the work he do not receive more than ten essay this be a scanty contribution for the rest the author have describe he situation : he that condemn himself to compose on a state day will often bring to he task a attention dissipate a memory embarrass a imagination overwhelm a mind distract with anxiety a body languish with disease : he will labor on a barren topick till it be too late to change it or in the ardor of invention diffuse he thought into wild exuberance which the press hour of publication can not suffer judgment to examine or reduce of this excellent production the number sell on each day do not amount to five hundred : of course the bookseller who pay the author four guinea a week do not carry on a successful trade he generosity and perseverance deserve to be commend and happily when the collection appear in volume be amply reward johnson live to see he labor nourish in a tenth edition he posterity as a ingenious french writer have say on a similar occasion begin in he life-time in the beginning of 1750 soon after the rambler be set on foot johnson be induce by the art of a vile impostor to lend he assistance during a temporary delusion to a fraud not to be parallel in the annals of literature -lrb- o -rrb- one lauder a native of scotland who have be a teacher in the university of edinburgh have conceive a mortal antipathy to the name and character of milton he reason be because the prayer of pamelum in sir philip sidney 's arcadium be as he suppose maliciously insert by the great poet in a edition of the eikôn basilike in order to fix a imputation of impiety on the memory of the murder king fire with resentment and willing to reap the profit of a gross imposition this man collect from several latin poet such as masenius the jesuit staphorstius a dutch divine beza and other all such passage as bear any kind of resemblance to different place in the paradise lose and these he publish from time to time in the gentleman 's magazine with occasional interpolation of line which he himself translate from milton the public credulity swallow all with eagerness and milton be suppose to be guilty of plagiarism from inferior modern writer the fraud succeed so well that lauder collect the whole into a volume and advertise it under the title of a essay on milton 's use and imitation of the modern in he paradise lose dedicate to the university of oxford and cambridge while the book be in the press the proof-sheet be show to johnson at the ivy lane club by payne the bookseller who be one of the member no man in that society be in possession of the author from whom lauder profess to make he extract the charge be believe and the contriver of it find he way to johnson who be represent by sir john hawkin not indeed as a accomplice in the fraud but through motive of malignity to milton delighting in the detection and exult that the poet 's reputation would suffer by the discovery more malice to a deceased friend can not well be imagine hawkin add that he wish well to the argument must be infer from the preface which indubitably be write by he the preface it be well know be write by johnson and for that reason be insert in this edition but if johnson approve of the argument it be no longer than while he believe it found in truth let we advert to he own word in that very preface among the inquiry to which the ardor of criticism have naturally give occasion none be more obscure in itself or more worthy of rational curiosity than a retrospection of the progress of this mighty genius in the construction of he work a view of the fabrick gradually rise perhaps from small beginning till its foundation rest in the center and its turret sparkle in the sky to trace back the structure through all its variety to the simplicity of the first plan to find what be project whence the scheme be take how it be improve by what assistance it be execute and from what store the material be collect whether its founder dig they from the quarry of nature or demolish other building to embellish he own these be the motive that induce johnson to assist lauder with a preface and be not these the motive of a critic and a scholar what reader of taste what man of real knowledge would not think he time well employ in a enquiry so curious so interesting and instructive if lauder 's fact be really true who would not be glad without the smallest tincture of malevolence to receive real information it be painful to be thus oblige to vindicate a man who in he heart tower above the petty art of fraud and imposition against a injudicious biographer who undertake to be he editor and the protector of he memory another writer dr tower in a essay on the life and character of dr johnson seem to countenance this calumny he say : it can hardly be doubt but that johnson 's aversion to milton 's politics be the cause of that alacrity with which he join with lauder in he infamous attack on we great epic poet and which induce he to assist in that transaction these word would seem to describe a accomplice be they not immediately follow by a express declaration that johnson be unacquainted with the imposture dr tower add it seem to have be by way of make some compensation to the memory of milton for the share he have in the attack of lauder that johnson write the prologue speak by garrick at drury lane theater 1750 on the performance of the masque of comus for the benefit of milton 's granddaughter dr tower be not free from prejudice but as shakespeare have it he beget a temperance to give it smoothness he be therefore entitle to a dispassionate answer when johnson write the prologue it do appear that he be aware of the malignant artifice practice by lauder in the postscript to johnson 's preface a subscription be propose for relieve the granddaughter of the author of paradise lose dr tower will agree that this show johnson 's alacrity in do good that alacrity show itself again in the letter print in the european magazine January 1785 and there say to have appear originally in the general advertiser 4th April 1750 by which the public be invite to embrace the opportunity of pay a just regard to the illustrious dead unite with the pleasure of do good to the live the letter add to assist industrious indigence struggle with distress and debilitate by age be a display of virtue and a acquisition of happiness and honor whoever therefore would be think capable of pleasure in read the work of we incomparable milton and not so destitute of gratitude as to refuse to lay out a trifle in a rational and elegant entertainment for the benefit of he living remain for the exercise of they own virtue the increase of they reputation and the consciousness of do good should appear at drury lane theater to-morrow April 5 when comus will be perform for the benefit of mr elizabeth foster granddaughter to the author and the only survive branch of he family _ nota bene _ there will be a new prologue on the occasion write by the author of irene and speak by mr garrick the man who have thus exert himself to serve the granddaughter can not be suppose to have entertain personal malice to the grandfather it be true that the malevolence of lauder as well as the imposture of archibald bower be fully detect by the labor in the cause of truth of the reverend dr dougla the late lord bishop of salisbury -- diram quus contudit hydram notaque fatalus portenta labore subegit but the pamphlet entitle milton vindicate from the charge of plagiarism bring against he by mr lauder and lauder himself convict of several forgery and gross imposition on the public by john douglas ma rector of eaton constantine salop be not publish till the year 1751 in that work p 77 dr dougla say it be to be hope nay it be expect that the elegant and nervous writer whose judicious sentiment and inimitable style point out the author of lauder 's preface and postcript will no longer allow a man to plume himself with he feather who appear so little to have deserve he assistance a assistance which i be persuade would never have be communicate have there be the least suspicion of those fact which i have be the instrument of convey to the world we have here a contemporary testimony to the integrity of dr johnson throughout the whole of that vile transaction what be the consequence of the requisition make by dr dougla johnson whose ruling passion may be say to be the love of truth convinced lauder that it would be more for he interest to make a full confession of he guilt than to stand forth the convict champion of a lie and for this purpose he draw up in the strongest term a recantation in a letter to the reverend mr dougla which lauder sign and publish in the year 1751 that piece will remain a lasting memorial of the abhorrence with which johnson behold a violation of truth mr nichol whose attachment to he illustrious friend be unwearied show he in 1780 a book call remark on johnson 's life of milton in which the affair of lauder be renew with virulence and a poetical scale in the literary magazine 1758 -lrb- when johnson have cease to write in that collection -rrb- be urge as a additional proof of deliberate malice he read the libellous passage with attention and instantly write on the margin : in the business of lauder i be deceive partly by think the man too frantick to be fraudulent of the poetical scale quote from the magazine i be not the author i fancy it be put in after i have quit that work for i not only do not write it but i do not remember it as a critic and a scholar johnson be willing to receive what number at the time believe to be true information : when he find that the whole be a forgery he renounce all connexion with the author in march 1752 he feel a severe stroke of affliction in the death of he wife the last number of the rambler as already mention be on the 14th of that month the loss of mr johnson be then approach and probably be the cause that put a end to those admirable periodical essay it appear that she die on the 28th of march in a memorandum at the foot of the prayer and meditation that be call she die day she be bury at bromley under the care of dr hawkesworth johnson place a latin inscription on she tomb in which he celebrate she beauty with the singularity of he prayer for he deceased wife from that time to the end of he day the world be sufficiently acquaint on easter day 22nd April 1764 he memorandum say : think on tetty poor dear tetty with my eye full go to church after sermon i recommend tetty in a prayer by herself and my father mother brother and bathurst in another i do it only once so far as it might be lawful for I in a prayer January 23 1759 the day on which he mother be bury he commend as far as may be lawful she soul to god implore for she whatever be most beneficial to she in she present state in this habit he persevere to the end of he day the reverend mr strahan the editor of the prayer and meditation observe that johnson on some occasion pray that the almighty _ may have have mercy _ on he wife and mr thrale evidently suppose they sentence to have be already pass in the divine mind and by consequence prove that he have no belief in a state of purgatory and no reason for pray for the dead that could impeach the sincerity of he profession as a protestant mr strahan add that in pray for the regret tenant of the grave johnson conform to a practice which have be retain by many learn member of the established church though the liturgy no longer admit it if _ where the tree falleth there it shall be _ if we state at the close of life be to be the measure of we final sentence then prayer for the dead be visibly fruitless can be regard only as the vain oblation of superstition but of all superstition this perhaps be one of the least unamiable and most incident to a good mind if we sensation of kindness be intense those whom we have revere and love death can not wholly seclude from we concern it be true for the reason just mention such evidence of we survive affection may be think ill judge but surely they be generous and some natural tenderness be due even to a superstition which thus originate in piety and benevolence these sentence extract from the reverend mr strahan 's preface if they be not a full justification be at least a beautiful apology it will not be improper to add what johnson himself have say on the subject be ask by mr boswell -lrb- p -rrb- what he think of purgatory as believe by the roman catholick he answer be it be a very harmless doctrine they be of opinion that the generality of mankind be neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment nor so good as to merit be admit into the society of bless spirit and therefore that god be graciously pleased to allow a middle state where they may be purify by certain degree of suffer you see there be nothing unreasonable in this and if it be once establish that there be soul in purgatory it be as proper to pray for they as for we brethren of mankind who be yet in this life this be dr johnson 's guess into futurity and to guess be the utmost that man can do : shadow cloud and darkness rest upon it mr johnson leave a daughter lucy porter by she first husband she have contract a friendship with mr anne william the daughter of zachary william a physician of eminence in south wale who have devote more than thirty year of a long life to the study of the longitude and be think to have make great advance towards that important discovery he letter to lord halifax and the lord of the admiralty partly correct and partly write by dr johnson be still extant in the hand of mr nichol -lrb- q -rrb- we there find dr william in the eighty-third year of he age state that he have prepare a instrument which might be call a epitome or miniature of the terraqueous globe show with the assistance of table construct by himself the variation of the magnetic needle and ascertain the longitude for the safety of navigation it appear that this scheme have be refer to sir isaac newton but that great philosopher excuse himself on account of he advanced age all application be useless till 1751 when the subject be refer by order of lord anson to dr bradley the celebrated professor of astronomy he report be unfavourable -lrb- r -rrb- though it allow that a considerable progress have be make dr william after all he labor and expense die in a short time after a melancholy instance of unrewarded merit he daughter possess uncommon talent and though blind have a alacrity of mind that make she conversation agreeable and even desirable to relieve and appease melancholy reflexion johnson take she home to he house in gough square in 1755 garrick give she a benefit play which produce two hundred pound in 1766 she publish by subscription a quarto volume of miscellany and increase she little stock to three hundred pound that fund with johnson 's protection support she through the remainder of she life during the two year in which the rambler be carry on the dictionary proceed by slow degree in may 1752 have compose a prayer preparatory to he return from tear and sorrow to the duty of life he resume he grand design and go on with vigor give however occasional assistance to he friend dr hawkesworth in the adventurer which begin soon after the rambler be lay aside some of the most valuable essay in that collection be from the pen of johnson the dictionary be complete towards the end of 1754 and cave be then no more it be a mortification to the author of that noble addition to we language that he old friend do not live to see the triumph of he labor in may 1755 that great work be publish johnson be desirous that it should come from one who have obtain academical honor and for that purpose he friend the rev tho warton obtain for he in the precede month of February a diploma for a master 's degree from the university of oxford -- garrick on the publication of the dictionary write the follow line : talk of war with a briton he 'll boldly advance that one english soldier can beat ten of france would we alter the boast from the sword to the pen we odds be still greater still greater we man in the deep mine of science though frenchman may toil can they strength be compar have to locke newton or boyle let they rally they hero send forth all they power they verseman and proseman then match they with ours first shakespeare and milton like god in the fight have put they whole drama and epic to flight in satire epistle and ode would they cope they number retreat before dryden and pope and johnson well arm would like a hero of yore have beat forty french and will beat forty more it be perhaps needless to mention that forty be the number of the french academy at the time when they dictionary be publish to settle they language in the course of the winter precede this grand publication the late earl of chesterfield give two essay in the periodical paper call the world date November 28 and December 5 1754 to prepare the public for so important a work the original plan address to he lordship in the year 1747 be there mention in term of the highest praise and this be understand at the time to be a courtly way of solicit a dedication of the dictionary to himself johnson treat this civility with disdain he say to garrick and other : i have sail a long and painful voyage round the world of the english language and do he now send out two cockboat to tow I into harbor he have say in the last number of the rambler that have labor to maintain the dignity of virtue i will not now degrade it by the meanness of dedication such a man when he have finish he dictionary not as he say himself in the soft obscurity of retirement or under the shelter of academick bower but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow and without the patronage of the great be not likely to be catch by the lure throw out by lord chesterfield he have in vain seek the patronage of that nobleman and he pride exasperate by disappointment draw from he the follow letter date in the month of February 1755 to the right honorable the earl of chesterfield my lord -- i have be lately inform by the proprietor of the world that two papers in which my dictionary be recommend to the publick be write by you lordship to be so distinguished be a honor which be very little accustomed to favor from the great i know not well how to receive or in what term to acknowledge when upon some slight encouragement i first visit you lordship i be overpower like the rest of mankind by the enchantment of you address and could not forbear to wish that i might boast myself le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre that i might obtain that regard for which i see the world contend but i find my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would suffer I to continue it when i have once address you lordship in publick i have exhaust all the art of please which a retire and uncourtly scholar can possess i have do all that i could and no man be well pleased to have he all neglect be it ever so little seven year my lord have now pass since i wait in you outward room or be repulse from you door during which time i have be push on my work through difficulty of which it be useless to complain and have bring it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance one word of encouragement or one smile of favor such treatment i do not expect for i never have a patron before the shepherd in virgil grow acquaint with love and find he a native of the rock be not a patron my lord one who look with unconcern on a man struggle for life in the water and when he have reach ground encumber he with help the notice which you have be please to take of my labor have it be early have be kind but it have be delay till i be indifferent and can not enjoy it till i be solitary and can not impart it till i be know and do not want it i hope it be no very cynical asperity not to confess obligation where no benefit have be receive or to be unwilling that the publick should consider I as owe that to a patron which providence have enable I to do for myself have carry on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learn i shall not be disappoint though i should conclude it if less be possible with less for i have be long waken from that dream of hope in which i once boast myself with so much exultation my lord you lordship 's most humble and most obedient servant samuel johnson it be say upon good authority that johnson once receive from lord chesterfield the sum of ten pound it be to be wish that the secret have never transpire it be mean to receive it and meaner to give it it may be imagine that for johnson 's ferocity as it have be call there be some foundation in he finances and as he dictionary be bring to a conclusion that money be now to flow in upon he the reverse be the case for he subsistence during the progress of the work he have receive at different time the amount of he contract and when he receipt be produce to he at a tavern dinner give by the bookseller it appear that he have be pay a hundred pound and upward more than he due the author of a book call lexiphane -lrb- s -rrb- write by a mr campbell a scotchman and purser of a man of war endeavor to blast he laurel but in vain the world applaud and johnson never reply abuse he say be often of service : there be nothing so dangerous to a author as silence he name like a shittlecock -lrb- transcriber 's note : sic -rrb- must be beat backward and forward or it fall to the ground lexiphane profess to be a imitation of the pleasant manner of lucian but humor be not the talent of the writer of lexiphane as dryden say he have too much horse-play in he raillery it be in the summer 1754 that the present writer become acquaint with dr johnson the cause of he first visit be relate by mr piozzi nearly in the follow manner : -- mr murphy be engage in a periodical paper the gray 's inn journal be at a friend 's house in the country and not be dispose to lose pleasure for business wish to content he bookseller by some unstudied essay he therefore take up a french journal littéraire and translate something he like send it away to town time however discover that he translate from the french a rambler which have be take from the english without acknowledgment upon this discovery mr murphy think it right to make he excuse to dr johnson he go next day and find he cover with soot like a chimney-sweeper in a little room as if he have be act lung in the alchemist make ether this be tell by mr murphy in company come come say dr johnson the story be black enough but it be a happy day that bring you first to my house after this first visit the author of this narrative by degree grow intimate with dr johnson the first striking sentence that he hear from he be in a few day after the publication of lord bolingbroke 's posthumous work mr garrick ask he if he have see they yes i have see they what do you think of they think of they he make a long pause and then reply : think of they a scoundrel and a coward a scoundrel who spend he life in charge a gun against christianity and a coward who be afraid of hear the report of he own gun but leave half a crown to a hungry scotchman to draw the trigger after he death he mind at this time strained and over-laboured by constant exertion call for a interval of repose and indolence but indolence be the time of danger : it be then that he spirit not employ abroad turn with inward hostility against himself he reflection on he own life and conduct be always severe and wish to be immaculate he destroy he own peace by unnecessary scruple he tell we that when he survey he past life he discover nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorder of body and disturbance of mind very near to madness he life he say from he earliest year be waste in a morning bed and he reign sin be a general sluggishness to which he be always inclined and in part of he life almost compel by morbid melancholy and weariness of mind this be he constitutional malady derive perhaps from he father who be at time overcast with a gloom that border on insanity when to this it be add that johnson about the age of twenty draw up a description of he infirmity for dr swinfen at that time a eminent physician in staffordshire and receive a answer to he letter import that the symptom indicate a future privation of reason who can wonder that he be trouble with melancholy and dejection of spirit a apprehension of the worst calamity that can befall human nature hang over he all the rest of he life like the sword of the tyrant suspend over he guest in he sixtieth year he have a mind to write the history of he melancholy but he desist not know whether it would not too much disturb he in a latin poem however to which he have prefix as a title -lrb- greek : gnothus seauton -rrb- he have leave a picture of himself draw with as much truth and as firm a hand as can be see in the portrait of hogarth or sir joshua reynold the learn reader will find the original poem in this volume and it be hope that a translation or rather imitation of so curious a piece will not be improper in this place know yourself -lrb- after revise and enlarge the english lexicon or dictionary -rrb- when scaliger whole year of labor past behold he lexicon complete at last and weary of he task with wond ` ring eye see from word pil would on word a fabric rise he cur would the industry inertly strong in creep toil that could persist so long and if enrag would he cry heav

in my breast attempt some arduous task or be it best brooding o'er lexicon to pass the day and in that labor drudge my life away such be the picture for which dr johnson sit to himself he give the prominent feature of he character he lassitude he morbid melancholy he love of fame he dejection he tavern-party and he wander reverie vacuae mala somnia mentis about which so much have be write all be paint in miniature but in vivid color by he own hand he idea of write more dictionary be not merely say in verse mr hamilton who be at that time a eminent printer and well acquaint with dr johnson remember that he engage in a commercial dictionary and as appear by the receipt in he possession be pay he price for several sheet but he soon relinquish the undertaking it be probable that he find himself not sufficiently verse in that branch of knowledge he be again reduce to the expedient of short composition for the supply of the day the writer of this narrative have now before he a letter in dr johnson 's handwriting which show the distress and melancholy situation of the man who have write the rambler and finish the great work of he dictionary the letter be direct to mr richardson the author of clarissa and be as follow : sir -- i be oblige to entreat you assistance i be now under a arrest for five pound eighteen shilling mr strahan from whom i should have receive the necessary help in this case be not at home and i be afraid of not find mr millar if you will be so good as to send I this sum i will very gratefully repay you and add it to all former obligation i be sir you most obedient and most humble servant samuel johnson gough square 16 march in the margin of this letter there be a memorandum in these word : march 16 1756 send six guinea witness wm richardson for the honor of a admire writer it be to be regret that we do not find a more liberal entry to he friend in distress he send eight shilling more than be want have a incident of this kind occur in one of he romance richardson would have know how to grace he hero but in fictitious scene generosity cost the writer nothing about this time johnson contribute several papers to a periodical miscellany call the visiter from motive which be highly honorable to he a compassionate regard for the late mr christopher smart the criticism on pope 's epitaph appear in that work in a short time after he become a reviewer in the literary magazine under the auspices of the late mr newbery a man of a project head good taste and great industry this employment engross but little of johnson 's time he resign himself to indolence take no exercise rise about two and then receive the visit of he friend author long since forget wait on he as they oracle and he give response in the chair of criticism he listen to the complaint the scheme and the hope and fear of a crowd of inferior writer who he say in the word of roger ascham live _ man know not how and die obscure man mark not when _ he believe that he could give a better history of grub street than any man live he house be fill with a succession of visitor till four or five in the evening during the whole time he preside at he tea-table tea be he favorite beverage and when the late jona hanway pronounce he anathema against the use of tea johnson rise in defense of he habitual practice declare himself in that article a hardened sinner who have for year dilute he meal with the infusion of that fascinating plant whose tea-kettle have no time to cool who with tea solaced the midnight hour and with tea welcome the morning the proposal for a new edition of shakespeare which have formerly miscarry be resume in the year 1756 the bookseller readily agree to he term : and subscription-ticket be issue out for undertake this work money he confess be the incite motive he friend exert themselves to promote he interest and in the mean time he engage in a new periodical production call the idler the first number appear on Saturday April 15 1758 and the last April 5 1760 the profit of this work and the subscription for the new edition of shakespeare be the means by which he support himself for four or five year in 1759 be publish rassela prince of abissinium he translation of lobo 's voyage to abissinium seem to have point out that country for the scene of action and rasselum christo the general of sultan seque mention in that work most probably suggest the name of the prince the author want to set out on a journey to lichfield in order to pay the last office of filial piety to he mother who at the age of ninety be then near she dissolution but money be necessary mr johnston a bookseller who have long since leave off business give one hundred pound for the copy with this supply johnson set out for lichfield but do not arrive in time to close the eye of a parent whom he love he attend the funeral which as appear among he memorandum be on the 23rd of January 1759 johnson now find it necessary to retrench he expense he give up he house in gough square mr william go into lodgings he retire to gray 's inn and soon remove to chamber in the inner temple lane where he live in poverty total idleness and the pride of literature : magnus stat nominis umbra mr fitzherbert the father of lord st helen the present minister at madrid a man distinguish through life for he benevolence and other amiable quality use to say that he pay a morning visit to johnson intend from he chamber to send a letter into the city but to he great surprise he find a author by profession without pen ink or paper the present bishop of salisbury be also among those who endeavor by constant attention to sooth the care of a mind which he know to be afflict with gloomy apprehension at one of the party make at he house boscovich the jesuit who have then lately introduce the newtonian philosophy at rome and after publish a elegant latin poem on the subject be make a fellow of the royal society be one of the company invite to meet dr johnson the conversation at first be mostly in french johnson though thoroughly verse in that language and a profess admirer of boileau and la bruyère do not understand its pronunciation nor could he speak it himself with propriety for the rest of the evening the talk be in latin boscovich have a ready current flow of that flimsy phraseology with which a priest may travel through italy spain and germany johnson scorn what he call colloquial barbarism it be he pride to speak he best he go on after a little practice with as much facility as if it be he native tongue one sentence this writer well remember observe that fontenelle at first oppose the newtonian philosophy and embrace it afterwards he word be : fontinellus nus fallor in extrema senectute fuit transfuga ad castra newtoniana we have now travel through that part of dr johnson 's life which be a perpetual struggle with difficulty halcyon day be now to open upon he in the month of may 1762 he majesty to reward literary merit signify he pleasure to grant to johnson a pension of three hundred pound a year the earl of bute be minister lord loughborough who perhaps be originally a mover in the business have authority to mention it he be well acquaint with johnson but have hear much of he independent spirit and of the downfal of osborne the bookseller he do not know but he benevolence might be reward with a folio on he head he desire the author of these memoirs to undertake the task this writer think the opportunity of do so much good the most happy incident in he life he go without delay to the chamber in the inner temple lane which in fact be the abode of wretchedness by slow and study approach the message be disclose johnson make a long pause : he ask if it be seriously intended : he fall into a profound meditation and he own definition of a pensioner occur to he he be tell that he at least do not come within the definition he desire to meet next day and dine at the mitre tavern at that meeting he give up all he scruple on the follow day lord loughborough conduct he to the earl of bute the conversation that pass be in the evening related to this writer by dr johnson he express he sense of he majesty 's bounty and think himself the more highly honor as the favor be not bestow on he for have dip he pen in faction no sir say lord bute it be not offer to you for have dip you pen in faction nor with a design that you ever should sir john hawkin will have it that after this interview johnson be often press to wait on lord bute but with a sullen spirit refuse to comply however that be johnson be never hear to utter a disrespectful word of that nobleman the writer of this essay remember a circumstance which may throw some light on this subject the late dr rise of chiswick whom johnson loved and respect contend for the pre-eminence of the scotch writer and ferguson 's book on civil society then on the eve of publication he say would give the laurel to north britain alas what can he do upon that subject say johnson : aristotle polybius grotius puffendorf and burlemaquus have reap in that field before he he will treat it say dr rise in a new manner a new manner buckinger have no hand and he write he name with he toe at chare cross for half a crown a piece that be a new manner of write dr rise reply : if that will not satisfy you i will name a writer whom you must allow to be the best in the kingdom who be that the earl of bute when he write a order for you pension there sir say johnson you have I in the toil : to lord bute i must allow whatever praise you claim for he ingratitude be no part of johnson 's character be now in the possession of a regular income johnson leave he chamber in the temple and once more become master of a house in johnson 's court fleet street dr levet he friend and physician in ordinary -lrb- u -rrb- pay he daily visit with assiduity make tea all the morning talk what he have to say and do not expect a answer mr william have she apartment in the house and entertain she benefactor with more enlarged conversation chymistry be a part of johnson 's amusement for this love of experimental philosophy sir john hawkin think a apology necessary he tell we with great gravity that curiosity be the only object in view not a intention to grow suddenly rich by the philosopher 's stone or the transmutation of metal to enlarge this circle johnson once more have recourse to a literary club this be at the turk 's head in gerard street soho on every Tuesday evening through the year the member be besides himself the right honorable edmund burke sir joshua reynold dr nugent dr goldsmith the late mr topham beauclerc mr langton mr chamier sir j hawkin and some other johnson 's affection for sir joshua be found on a long acquaintance and a thorough knowledge of the virtuous and amiable quality of that excellent artist he delight in the conversation of mr burke he meet he for the first time at mr garrick 's several year ago on the next day he say : i suppose murphy you be proud of you countryman : ` cum talis sit utinam noster esset ' from that time he constant observation be that a man of sense could not meet mr burke by accident under a gateway to avoid a shower without be convince that he be the first man in england johnson feel not only kindness but zeal and ardor for he friend he do every thing in he power to advance the reputation of dr goldsmith he love he though he know he failing and particularly the leaven of envy which corrode the mind of that elegant writer and make he impatient without disguise of the praise bestow on any person whatever of this infirmity which mark goldsmith 's character johnson give a remarkable instance it happen that he go with sir joshua reynold and goldsmith to see the fantoccinus which be exhibit some year ago in or near the haymarket they admire the curious mechanism by which the puppet be make to walk the stage draw a chair to the table sit down write a letter and perform a variety of other action with such dexterity that though nature 's journeyman make the man they imitate humanity to the astonishment of the spectator the entertainment be over the three friend retire to a tavern johnson and sir joshua talk with pleasure of what they have see and say johnson in a tone of admiration : how the little fellow brandish he spontoon there be nothing in it reply goldsmith start up with impatience give I a spontoon i can do it as well myself enjoy he amusement at he weekly club and happy in a state of independence johnson gain in the year 1765 another resource which contribute more than any thing else to exempt he from the solicitude of life he be introduce to the late mr thrale and he family mr piozzus have relate the fact and it be therefore needless to repeat it in this place the author of this narrative look back to the share he have in that business with self-congratulation since he know the tenderness which from that time soothe johnson 's care at streatham and prolong a valuable life the subscriber to shakespeare begin to despair of ever see the promise edition to acquit himself of this obligation he go to work unwillingly but proceed with vigor in the month of October 1765 shakespeare be publish and in a short time after the university of dublin send over a diploma in honorable term create he a doctor of law oxford in eight or ten year afterwards follow the example and till then johnson never assume the title of doctor in 1766 he constitution seem to be in a rapid decline and that morbid melancholy which often cloud he understanding come upon he with a deeper gloom than ever mr and mr thrale pay he a visit in this situation and find he on he knee with dr delap the rector of lewe in sussex beseech god to continue to he the use of he understanding mr thrale take he to he house at streatham and johnson from that time become a constant resident in the family he go occasionally to the club in gerard street but he headquarters be fix at streatham a apartment be fit up for he and the library be greatly enlarged party be constantly invite from town and johnson be every day at a elegant table with select and polished company whatever could be devise by mr and mr thrale to promote the happiness and establish the health of they guest be studiously perform from that time to the end of mr thrale 's life johnson accompany the family in all they summer excursion to brighthelmstone to wale and to pari it be but justice to mr thrale to say that a more ingenuous frame of mind no man possess he education at oxford give he the habit of a gentleman he amiable temper recommend he conversation and the goodness of he heart make he a sincere friend that he be the patron of johnson be a honor to he memory in petty dispute with contemporary writer or the wit of the age johnson be seldom entangled a single incident of that kind may not be unworthy of notice since it happen with a man of great celebrity in he time a number of friend dine with garrick on a christmas day foote be then in ireland it be say at table that the modern aristophane -lrb- so foote be call -rrb- have be horsewhip by a dublin apothecary for mimic he on the stage i wonder say garrick that any man should show so much resentment to foote he have a patent for such liberty nobody ever think it worth he while to quarrel with he in london i be glad say johnson to find that the man be rise in the world the expression be afterwards repeat to foote who in return give out that he would produce the caliban of literature on the stage be inform of this design johnson send word to foote : that the theater be intend for the reformation of vice he would step from the box on the stage and correct he before the audience foote know the intrepidity of he antagonist and abandon the design no ill will ensue johnson use to say : that for broad-faced mirth foote have not he equal dr johnson 's fame excite the curiosity of the king he majesty express a desire to see a man of whom extraordinary thing be say accordingly the librarian at buckingham house invite johnson to see that elegant collection of book at the same time give a hint of what be intend he majesty enter the room and among other thing ask the author if he mean to give the world any more of he composition johnson answer : that he think he have write enough and i should think so too reply he majesty if you have not write so well though johnson think he have write enough he genius even in spite of bodily sluggishness could not lie still in 1770 we find he enter the list as a political writer the flame of discord that blaze throughout the nation on the expulsion of mr wilke and the final determination of the house of common that mr luttrell be duly elect by two hundred and six vote against eleven hundred and forty-three spread a general spirit of discontent to allay the tumult dr johnson publish the false alarm mr piozzi inform we that this pamphlet be write at she house between eight o'clock on Wednesday night and twelve on Thursday night this celerity have appear wonderful to many and some have doubt the truth it may however be place within the bound of probability johnson have observe that there be different method of composition virgil be use to pour out a great number of verse in the morning and pass the day in retrench the exuberance and correct inaccuracy and it be pope 's custom to write he first thought in he first word and gradually to amplify decorate rectify and refine they other employ at once memory and invention and with little intermediate use of the pen form and polish large mass by continue meditation and write they production only when in they opinion they have complete they this last be johnson 's method he never take he pen in hand till he have well weigh he subject and grasp in he mind the sentiment the train of argument and the arrangement of the whole as he often think aloud he have perhaps talk it over to himself this may account for that rapidity with which in general he despatch he sheet to the press without be at the trouble of a fair copy whatever may be the logic or eloquence of the false alarm the house of common have since erase the resolution from the journal but whether they have not leave material for a future controversy may be make a question in 1771 he publish another tract on the subject of falkland island the design be to show the impropriety of go to war with spain for a island throw aside from human use stormy in winter and barren in summer for this work it be apparent that material be furnish by direction of the minister at the approach of the general election in 1774 he write a short discourse call the patriot not with any visible application to mr wilke but to teach the people to reject the leader of opposition who call themselves patriot in 1775 he undertake a pamphlet of more importance namely taxation no tyranny in answer to the resolution and address of the american congress the scope of the argument be that distant colony which have in they assembly a legislature of they own be notwithstanding liable to be tax in a british parliament where they have neither peer in one house nor representative in the other he be of opinion that this country be strong enough to enforce obedience when a englishman he say be tell that the american shoot up like the hydra he naturally consider how the hydra be destroy the event have show how much he and the minister of that day be mistake the account of the tour to the western island of scotland which be undertake in the autumn of 1773 in company with mr boswell be not publish till some time in the year 1775 this book have be variously receive by some extol for the elegance of the narrative and the depth of observation on life and manners by other as much condemn as a work of avowed hostility to the scotch nation the praise be beyond all question fairly deserve and the censure on due examination will appear hasty and ill found that johnson entertain some prejudice against the scotch must not be dissemble it be true as mr boswell say that he think they success in england exceed they proportion of real merit and he could not but see in they that nationality which no liberal-minded scotsman will deny the author of these memoirs well remember that johnson one day ask he have you observe the difference between you own country impudence and scotch impudence the answer be in the negative : then i will tell you say johnson the impudence of a irishman be the impudence of a fly that buzz about you and you put it away but it return again and flutter and tease you the impudence of a scotsman be the impudence of a leech that fix and suck you blood upon another occasion this writer go with he into the shop of davy the bookseller in russell street covent garden davy come run to he almost out of breath with joy : the scot gentleman be come sir he principal wish be to see you he be now in the back parlor well well i 'll see the gentleman say johnson he walk towards the room mr boswell be the person this writer follow with no small curiosity i find say mr boswell that i be come to london at a bad time when great popular prejudice have go forth against we north briton but when i be talk to you i be talk to a large and liberal mind and you know that i can not help come from scotland sir say johnson no more can the rest of you countryman -lrb- x -rrb- he have other reason that help to alienate he from the native of scotland be a cordial well-wisher to the constitution in church and state he do not think that calvin and john knox be proper founder of a national religion he make however a wide distinction between the dissenter of scotland and the separatist of england to the former he imputed no disaffection no want of loyalty they soldier and they officer have shed they blood with zeal and courage in the service of great britain and the people he use to say be content with they own established mode of worship without wish in the present age to give any disturbance to the church of england this he be at all time ready to admit and therefore declare that whenever he find a scotchman to whom a englishman be as a scotchman that scotchman should be as a englishman to he in this surely there be no rancor no malevolence the dissenter on this side the tweed appear to he in a different light they religion he frequently say be too worldly too political too restless and ambitious the doctrine of cashier king and erect on the ruin of the constitution a new form of government which lately issue from they pulpit he always think be under a calm disguise the principle that lay lurk in they heart he know that a wild democracy have overturn king lord and common and that a set of republican fanatic who would not bow at the name of jesus have take possession of all the living and all the parish in the kingdom that those scene of horror might never be renew be the ardent wish of dr johnson and though he apprehend no danger from scotland it be probable that he dislike of calvinism mingled sometimes with he reflection on the native of that country the association of idea could not be easily break but it be well know that he love and respect many gentleman from that part of the island dr robertson 's history of scotland and dr beattie 's essay be subject of he constant praise mr boswell dr rise of chiswick andrew millar mr hamilton the printer and the late mr strahan be among he most intimate friend many other might be add to the list he scorn to enter scotland as a spy though hawkin he biographer and the profess defender of he fame allow himself leave to represent he in that ignoble character he go into scotland to survey man and manners antiquity fossil and mineral be not within he province he do not visit that country to settle the station of roman camp or the spot where galgacus fight the last battle for public liberty the people they custom and the progress of literature be he object the civility which he receive in the course of he tour have be repay with grateful acknowledgment and generally with great elegance of expression he crime be that he find the country bare of tree and he have state the fact this mr boswell in he tour to the hebride have tell we be resent by he countryman with anger inflamed to rancor but he admit that there be few tree on the east side of scotland mr pennant in he tour say that in some part of the eastern side of the country he see several large plantation of pine plant by gentleman near they seat and in this respect such a laudable spirit prevail that in another half-century it never shall be say to spy the nakedness of the land be you come johnson could not wait for that half-century and therefore mention thing as he find they if in any thing he have be mistake he have make a fair apology in the last paragraph of he book avow with candor : that he may have be surprise by mode of life and appearance of nature that be familiar to man of wider survey and more vary conversation novelty and ignorance must always be reciprocal : and he be conscious that he thought on national manners be the thought of one who have see but little the poem of ossian make a part of johnson 's inquiry during he residence in scotland and the hebride on he return to england November 1773 a storm seem to be gather over he head but the cloud never burst and the thunder never fall -- ossian it be well know be present to the public as a translation from the erse but that this be a fraud johnson declare without hesitation the erse he say be always oral only and never a write language the welsh and the irish be more cultivate in erse there be not in the world a single manuscript a hundred year old martin who in the last century publish a account of the western island mention irish but never erse manuscript to be find in the island in he time the bard could not read if they could they might probably have write but the bard be a barbarian among barbarian and know nothing himself live with other that know no more if there be a manuscript from which the translation be make in what age be it written and where be it if it be collect from oral recitation it could only be in detach part and scatter fragment : the whole be too long to be remember who put it together in its present form for these and such like reason johnson call the whole a imposture he add the editor or author never could show the original nor can it be show by any other to revenge reasonable incredulity by refuse evidence be a degree of insolence with which the world be not yet acquaint and stubborn audacity be the last refuge of guilt this reasoning carry with it great weight it rouse the resentment of mr macpherson he send a threatening letter to the author and johnson answer he in the rough phrase of stern defiance the two hero frown at a distance but never come to action in the year 1777 the misfortune of dr dodd excite he compassion he write a speech for that unhappy man when call up to receive judgment of death besides two petition one to the king and another to the queen and a sermon to be preach by dodd to the convict in newgate it may appear trifling to add that about the same time he write a prologue to the comedy of a word to the wise write by hugh kelly the play some year before have be damned by a party on the first night it be revive for the benefit of the author 's widow mr piozzus relate that when johnson be rally for these exertion so close to one another he answer be when they come to I with a die parson and a dead stay-maker what can a man do we come now to the last of he literary labor at the request of the bookseller he undertake the life of the poet the first publication be in 1779 and the whole be complete in 1781 in a memorandum of that year he say some time in march he finish the life of the poet which he write in he usual way dilatorily and hastily unwilling to work yet work with vigor and haste in another place he hope they be write in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety that the history of so many man who in they different degree make themselves conspicuous in they time be not write recently after they death seem to be a omission that do no honor to the republic of letter they contemporary in general look on with calm indifference and suffer wit and genius to vanish out of the world in total silence unregarded and unlamented be there no friend to pay the tribute of a tear no just observer of life to record the virtue of the decease be even envy silent it seem to have be agree that if a author 's work survive the history of the man be to give no moral lesson to after-age if tradition tell we that ben jonson go to the devil tavern that shakespeare steal deer and hold the stirrup at play-house door that dryden frequented button 's coffee-house curiosity be lull asleep and biography forget the best part of she function which be to instruct mankind by example take from the school of life this task remain for dr johnson when year have roll away when the channel of information be for the most part choke up and little remain besides doubtful anecdote uncertain tradition and vague report nunc situs informi premit et deserta vetustas the value of biography have be better understand in other age and in other country tacitus inform we that to record the life and character of illustrious man be the practice of the roman author in the early period of the republic in france the example have be follow fontenelle d'alembert and monsieur thoma have leave model in this kind of composition they have embalm the dead but it be true that they have incitement and advantage even at a distant day which could not by any diligence be obtain by dr johnson the wit of france have ample material they live in a nation of critic who have at heart the honor do to they country by they poet they hero and they philosopher they have besides a academy of belles-lettres where genius be cultivate refine and encourage they have the tract the essay and dissertation which remain in the memoirs of the academy and they have the speech of the several member deliver at they first admission to a seat in that learn assembly in those speech the new academician do ample justice to the memory of he predecessor and though he harangue be decorate with the color of eloquence and be for that reason call panegyric yet be pronounce before qualify judge who know the talent the conduct and moral of the decease the speaker could not with propriety wander into the region of fiction the truth be know before it be adorn the academy see the marble before the artist polish it but this country have have no academy of literature the public mind for century have be engross by party and faction by the madness of many for the gain of a few by civil war religious dissension trade and commerce and the art of accumulate wealth amidst such attention who can wonder that cold praise have be often the only reward of merit in this country dr nathaniel hodge who like the good bishop of marseille draw purer breath amidst the contagion of the plague in london and during the whole time continue in the city administer medical assistance be suffer as johnson use to relate with tear in he eye to die for debt in a gaol in this country the man who bring the new river to london be ruin by that noble project and in this country otway die for want on tower hill butler the great author of hudibras whose name can only die with the english language be leave to languish in poverty the particulars of he life almost unknown and scarce a vestige of he leave except he immortal poem have there be a academy of literature the life at least of those celebrated person would have be write for the benefit of posterity swift it seem have the idea of such a institution and propose it to lord oxford but whig and tory be more important object it be needless to dissemble that dr johnson in the life of roscommon talk of the inutility of such a project in this country he say a academy could be expect to do but little if a academician 's place be profitable it would be give by interest if attendance be gratuitous it would be rarely pay and no man would endure the least disgust unanimity be impossible and debate would separate the assembly to this it may be sufficient to answer that the royal society have not be dissolve by sullen disgust and the modern academy at somerset house have already perform much and promise more unanimity be not necessary to such a assembly on the contrary by difference of opinion and collision of sentiment the cause of literature would thrive and flourish the true principle of criticism the secret of fine write the investigation of antiquity and other interesting subject might occasion a clash of opinion but in that contention truth would receive illustration and the essay of the several member would supply the memoirs of the academy but say dr johnson suppose the philological decree make and promulgate what would be its authority in absolute government there be sometimes a general reverence pay to all that have the sanction of power the countenance of greatness -- how little this be the state of we country need not to be tell the edict of a english academy would probably be read by many only that they may be sure to disobey they the present manners of the nation would deride authority and therefore nothing be leave but that every writer should criticise himself this surely be not conclusive it be by the standard of the best writer that every man settle for himself he plan of legitimate composition and since the authority of superior genius be acknowledge that authority which the individual obtain would not be lessen by a association with other of distinguish ability it may therefore be infer that a academy of literature would be a establishment highly useful and a honor to literature in such a institution profitable place would not be want vati avarus haud facile est animus and the minister who shall find leisure from party and faction to carry such a scheme into execution will in all probability be respect by posterity as the maecena of letter we now take leave of dr johnson as a author four volume of he life of the poet be publish in 1778 and the work be complete in 1781 should biography fall again into disuse there will not always be a johnson to look back through a century and give a body of critical and moral instruction in April 1781 he lose he friend mr thrale he own word in he diary will best tell that melancholy event on Wednesday the 11th of April be bury my dear friend mr thrale who die on Wednesday the 4th and with he be bury many of my hope and pleasure about five i think on Wednesday morning he expire i feel almost the last flutter of he pulse and look for the last time upon the face that for fifteen year before have never be turn upon I but with respect and benignity farewell : may god that delighteth in mercy have have mercy on thee i have constantly pray for he before he death the decease of he from whose friendship i have obtain many opportunity of amusement and to whom i turn my thought as to a refuge from misfortune have leave I heavy but my business be with myself -- from the close of he last work the malady that persecute he through life come upon he with alarming severity and he constitution decline apace in 1782 he old friend levet expire without warning and without a groan event like these remind johnson of he own mortality he continue he visit to mr thrale at streatham to the 7th day of October 1782 when have first compose a prayer for the happiness of a family with whom he have for many year enjoy the pleasure and comfort of life he remove to he own house in town he say he be up early in the morning and read fortuitously in the gospel which be he parting use of the library the merit of the family be manifest by the sense he have of it and we see he heart overflow with gratitude he leave the place with regret and cast a linger look behind the few remain occurrence may be soon despatch in the month of June 1783 johnson have a paralytic stroke which affect he speech only he write to dr taylor of westminster and to he friend mr allen the printer who live at the next door dr brocklesby arrive in a short time and by he care and that of dr heberden johnson soon recover during he illness the writer of this narrative visit he and find he read dr watson 's chymistry articulate with difficulty he say from this book he who know nothing may learn a great deal and he who know will be please to find he knowledge recall to he mind in a manner highly please in the month of August he set out for lichfield on a visit to mr lucy porter the daughter of he wife by she first husband and in he way back pay he respects to dr adam at oxford mr william die at he house in bolt court in the month of September during he absence this be another shock to a mind like he ever agitate by the thought of futurity the contemplation of he own approach end be constantly before he eye and the prospect of death he declare be terrible for many year when he be not dispose to enter into the conversation go forward whoever sit near he chair might hear he repeat from shakespeare aye but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a knead clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery flood -- and from milton -- who would lose for fear of pain this intellectual be by the death of mr william he be leave in a state of destitution with nobody but frank he black servant to sooth he anxious moment in November 1783 he be swell from head to foot with a dropsy dr brocklesby with that benevolence with which he always assist he friend pay he visit with assiduity the medicine prescribe be so efficacious that in a few day johnson while he be offer up he prayer be suddenly oblige to rise and in the course of the day discharge twenty pint of water johnson be ease of he dropsy begin to entertain hope that the vigor of he constitution be not entirely break for the sake of converse with he friend he establish a conversation club to meet on every Wednesday evening and to serve a man whom he have know in mr thrale 's household for many year the place be fix at he house in essex street near the temple to answer the malignant remark of sir john hawkin on this subject be a wretched waste of time profess to be johnson 's friend that biographer have raise more objection to he character than all the enemy to that excellent man sir john have a root of bitterness that put rancor in the vessel of he peace fielding he say be the inventor of a cant phrase goodness of heart which mean little more than the virtue of a horse or a dog he should have know that kind affection be the essence of virtue : they be the will of god implant in we nature to aid and strengthen moral obligation they incite to action : a sense of benevolence be no less necessary than a sense of duty good affection be a ornament not only to a author but to he writings he who show himself upon a cold scent for opportunity to bark and snarl throughout a volume of six hundred page may if he will pretend to moralise but goodness of heart or to use that politer phrase the virtue of a horse or a dog would redound more to he honor but sir john be no more : we business be with johnson the member of he club be respectable for they rank they talent and they literature they attend with punctuality till about midsummer 1784 when with some appearance of health johnson go into derbyshire and thence to lichfield while he be in that part of the world he friend in town be labor for he benefit the air of a more southern climate they think might prolong a valuable life but a pension of three hundred pound a year be a slender fund for a travel valetudinarian and it be not then know that he have save a moderate sum of money mr boswell and sir joshua reynold undertake to solicit the patronage of the chancellor with lord thurlow while he be at the bar johnson be well acquaint he be often hear to say thurlow be a man of such vigor of mind that i never know i be to meet he but -- i be go to say i be afraid but that would not be true for i never be afraid of any man but i never know that i be to meet thurlow but i know i have something to encounter the chancellor undertake to recommend johnson 's case but without success to protract if possible the day of a man whom he respect he offer to advance the sum of five hundred pound be inform of this at lichfield johnson write the following letter : my lord -- after a long and not inattentive observation of mankind the generosity of you lordship 's offer raise in I not less wonder than gratitude bounty so liberally bestow i should gladly receive if my condition make it necessary for to such a mind who would not be proud to own he obligation but it have please god to restore I to so great a measure of health that if i should now appropriate so much of a fortune destine to do good i could not escape from myself the charge of advance a false claim my journey to the continent though i once think it necessary be never much encourage by my physician and i be very desirous that you lordship should be tell it by sir joshua reynold as a event very uncertain for if i grow much better i should not be willing if much worse i should not be able to migrate you lordship be first solicit without my knowledge but when i be tell that you be please to honor I with you patronage i do not expect to hear of a refusal yet as i have have no long time to brood hope and have not riot in imaginary opulence this cold reception have be scarce a disappointment and from you lordship 's kindness i have receive a benefit which only man like you be able to bestow i shall now live _ mihi carior _ with a higher opinion of my own merit i be my lord you lordship 's most oblige most grateful and most humble servant samuel johnson September 1784 we have in this instance the exertion of two congenial mind one with a generous impulse relieve merit in distress and the other by gratitude and dignity of sentiment rise to a equal elevation it seem however that greatness of mind be not confine to greatness of rank dr brocklesby be not content to assist with he medical art he resolve to minister to he patient 's mind and pluck from he memory the sorrow which the late refusal from a high quarter might occasion to enable he to visit the south of france in pursuit of health he offer from he own fund a annuity of one hundred pound payable quarterly this be a sweet oblivious antidote but it be not accept for the reason assign to the chancellor the proposal however will do honor to dr brocklesby as long as liberal sentiment shall be rank among the social virtue in the month of October 1784 we find dr johnson correspond with mr nichol the intelligent compiler of the gentleman 's magazine and in the languor of sickness still desirous to contribute all in he power to the advancement of science and useful knowledge he say in a letter to that gentleman date lichfield October 20 that he should be glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquity any information he add at ashbourne where i have very little company i have the luck to borrow mr bowyer 's life a book so full of contemporary history that a literary man must find some of he old friend i think that i could now and then have tell you some hint worth you notice : we perhaps may talk a life over i hope we shall be much together you must now be to I what you be before and what dear mr allen be besides he be take unexpectedly away but i think he be a very good man i have make very little progress in recovery i be very weak and very sleepless but i live on and hope in that languid condition he arrive on the 16th of November at he house in bolt court there to end he day he labor with the dropsy and a asthma he be attend by dr heberden dr warren dr brocklesby dr butter and mr cruikshank the eminent surgeon eternity present to he mind a awful prospect and with as much virtue as perhaps ever be the lot of man he shudder at the thought of he dissolution he friend awaken the comfortable reflection of a well-spent life and as he end draw near they have the satisfaction of see he compose and even cheerful insomuch that he be able in the course of he restless night to make translation of greek epigram from the anthologium and to compose a latin epitaph for he father he mother and he brother nathaniel he meditate at the same time a latin inscription to the memory of garrick but he vigor be exhaust he love of literature be a passion that stick to he last sand seven day before he death he write the following letter to he friend mr nichol : sir -- the late learn mr swinton of oxford have one day remark that one man meaning i suppose no man but himself could assign all the part of the ancient universal history to they proper author at the request of sir robert chamber or myself give the account which i now transmit to you in he own hand be willing that of so great a work the history should be know and that each writer should receive he due proportion of praise from posterity i recommend to you to preserve this scrap of literary intelligence in mr swinton 's own hand or to deposit it in the museum -lrb- y -rrb- that the veracity of this account may never be doubt i be sir you most humble servant sam johnson dec 6 1784 mr swinton the history of the carthaginian -- numidian -- mauritanian -- gaetulian -- garamante

's retreat by the same history of the persian and the constantinopolitan empire by dr campbell history of the roman by mr bower -lrb- z -rrb- on the morning of December 7 dr johnson request to see mr nichol a few day before he have borrow some of the early volume of the magazine with a profess intention to point out the piece which he have write in that collection the book lay on the table with many leaf double down and in particular those which contain he share in the parliamentary debate such be the goodness of johnson 's heart that he then declare that those debate be the only part of he writings which give he any compunction : but that at the time he write they he have no conception that he be impose upon the world though they be frequently write from very slender material and often from none at all the mere coinage of he own imagination he add that he never write any part of he work with equal velocity three column of the magazine in a hour he say be no uncommon effort which be faster than most person could have transcribe that quantity in one day in particular and that not a very long one he write twelve page more in quantity than ever he write at any other time except in the life of savage of which forty-eight page in octavo be the production of one long day include a part of the night in the course of the conversation he ask whether any of the family of faden the printer be live be tell that the geographer near charing cross be faden 's son he say after a short pause i borrow a guinea of he father near thirty year ago be so good as to take this and pay it for I wish to discharge every duty and every obligation johnson recollect another debt of ten pound which he have borrow from he friend mr hamilton the printer about twenty year before he send the money to mr hamilton at he house in bedford row with a apology for the length of time the reverend mr strahan be the bearer of the message about four or five day before johnson breathe he last mr sastre whom dr johnson esteem and mention in he will enter the room during he illness dr johnson as soon as he see he stretch forth he hand and in a tone of lamentation call out jam moriturus but the love of life be still a active principle feeling himself swell with the dropsy he conceive that by incision in he leg the water might be discharge mr cruikshank apprehend that a mortification might be the consequence but to appease a distempered fancy he gently lance the surface johnson cry out deeper deeper i want length of life and you be afraid of give I pain which i do not value on the 8th of December the reverend mr strahan draw he will by which after a few legacy the residue amounting to about fifteen hundred pound be bequeath to frank the black servant formerly consign to the testator by he friend dr bathurst the history of a death-bed be painful mr strahan inform we that the strength of religion prevail against the infirmity of nature and he foreboding dread of the divine justice subside into a pious trust and humble hope of mercy at the throne of grace on Monday the 13th day of December the last of he existence on this side the grave the desire of life return with all its former vehemence he still imagine that by puncture he leg relief might be obtain at eight in the morning he try the experiment but no water follow in a hour or two after he fall into a doze and about seven in the evening expire without a groan on the 20th of the month he remains with due solemnity and a numerous attendance of he friend be bury in westminster abbey near the foot of shakespeare 's monument and close to the grave of the late mr garrick the funeral service be read by he friend dr taylor a black marble over he grave have the follow inscription : samuel johnson lld obiit xiii die decembris anno domini mdcclxxxiv aetatis suae lxxv if we now look back as from a eminence to view the scene of life and the literary labor in which dr johnson be engage we may be able to delineate the feature of the man and to form a estimate of he genius as a man dr johnson stand display in open daylight nothing remain undiscovered whatever he say be know and without allow he the usual privilege of hazard sentiment and advance position for mere amusement or the pleasure of discussion criticism have endeavor to make he answerable for what perhaps he never seriously think he diary which have be print discover still more we have before we the very heart of the man with all he inward consciousness and yet neither in the open path of life nor in he secret recess have any one vice be discover we see he review every year of he life and severely censure himself for not keep resolution which morbid melancholy and other bodily infirmity render impracticable we see he for every little defect impose on himself voluntary penance go through the day with only one cup of tea without milk and to the last amidst paroxysm and remission of illness form plan of study and resolution to amend he life -lrb- aa -rrb- many of he scruple may be call weakness but they be the weakness of a good a pious and most excellent man he person it be well know be large and unwieldy he nerve be affect by that disorder for which at two year of age he be present to the royal touch he head shake and involuntary motion make it uncertain that he leg and arm would even at a tea-table remain in they proper place a person of lord chesterfield 's delicacy might in he company be in a fever he would sometimes of he own accord do thing inconsistent with the established mode of behavior sit at table with the celebrated mr cholmondeley who exert herself to circulate the subscription for shakespeare he take hold of she hand in the middle of dinner and hold it close to he eye wonder at the delicacy and whiteness till with a smile she ask will he give it to I again when he have do with it the exterior of politeness do not belong to johnson even that civility which proceed or ought to proceed from the mind be sometimes violate he morbid melancholy have a effect on he temper he passion be irritable and the pride of science as well as of a fierce independent spirit inflamed he on some occasion above all bound of moderation though not in the shade of academic bower he lead a scholastic life and the habit of pronounce decision to he friend and visitor give he a dictatorial manner which be much enforce by a voice naturally loud and often overstretched metaphysical discussion moral theory system of religion and anecdote of literature be he favorite topic general history have little of he regard biography be he delight the proper study of mankind be man sooner than hear of the punic war he would be rude to the person that introduce the subject johnson be bear a logician one of those to whom only book of logic be say to be of use in consequence of he skill in that art he love argumentation no man think more profoundly nor with such acute discernment a fallacy could not stand before he it be sure to be refute by strength of reasoning and a precision both in idea and expression almost unequalled when he choose by apt illustration to place the argument of he adversary in a ludicrous light one be almost incline to think ridicule the test of truth he be surprise to be tell but it be certainly true that with great power of mind wit and humor be he shine talent that he often argue for the sake of triumph over he adversary can not be dissemble dr rise of chiswick have be hear to tell of a friend of he who thank he for introduce he to dr johnson as he have be convince in the course of a long dispute that a opinion which he have embrace as a settle truth be no better than a vulgar error this be report to johnson nay say he do not let he be thankful for he be right and i be wrong like he uncle andrew in the ring at smithfield johnson in a circle of disputant be determine neither to be throw nor conquer notwithstanding all he piety self-government or the command of he passion in conversation do not seem to have be among he attainment whenever he think the contention be for superiority he have be know to break out with violence and even ferocity when the fray be over he generally soften into repentance and by conciliate measure take care that no animosity should be leave rankle in the breast of he antagonist of this defect he seem to have be conscious in a letter to mr thrale he say poor barettus do not quarrel with he to neglect he a little will be sufficient he mean only to be frank and manly and independent and perhaps as you say a little wise to be frank he think be to be cynical and to be independent be to be rude forgive he dearest lady the rather because of he misbehavior i be afraid he learn part of I i hope to set he hereafter a better example for he own intolerant and over-bearing spirit he apologize by observe that it have do some good obscenity and impiety be repress in he company it be late in life before he have the habit of mix otherwise than occasionally with polite company at mr thrale 's he see a constant succession of well-accomplished visiter in that society he begin to wear off the rugged point of he own character he see the advantage of mutual civility and endeavor to profit by the model before he he aim at what have be call by swift the lesser moral and by cicero minore virtute he endeavor though new and late give pleasure to all he acquaintance man be glad to see that he be willing to be communicative on equal term and reciprocal complacence the time be then expect when he be to cease be what george garrick brother to the celebrated actor call he the first time he hear he converse a tremendous companion he certainly wish to be polite and even think himself so but he civility still retain something uncouth and harsh he manners take a milder tone but the endeavor be too palpably see he labor even in trifle he be a giant gain a purchase to lift a feather it be observe by the younger pliny that in the confines of virtue and great quality there be generally vice of a opposite nature in dr johnson not one ingredient can take the name of vice from he attainment in literature grow the pride of knowledge and from he power of reasoning the love of disputation and the vain glory of superior vigor -- he piety in some instance border on superstition he be willing to believe in preternatural agency and think it not more strange that there should be evil spirit than evil man even the question about second sight hold he in suspense second sight mr pennant tell we be a power of see image impress on the organ of sight by the power of fancy or on the fancy by the disorder spirit operate on the mind it be the faculty of see spectre or vision which represent a event actually pass at a distance or likely to happen at a future day in 1771 a gentleman the last who be suppose to be possess of this faculty have a boat at sea in a tempestuous night and be anxious for he freight suddenly start up and say he man would be drown for he have see they pass before he with wet garment and drop lock the event correspond with he disorder fancy and thus continue mr pennant a distempered imagination cloud with anxiety may make a impression on the spirit as person restless and troubled with indignation see various form and figure while they lie awake in bed this be what dr johnson be not willing to reject he wish for some positive proof of communication with another world he benevolence embrace the whole race of man and yet be tincture with particular prejudice he be please with the minister in the isle of skie and love he so much that he begin to wish he not a presbyterian to that body of dissenter he zeal for the established church make he in some degree a adversary and he attachment to a mixed and limited monarchy lead he to declare open war against what he call a sullen republican he would rather praise a man of oxford than of cambridge he dislike a whig and love a tory these be the shades of he character which it have be the business of certain party-writer to represent in the darkest color since virtue or moral goodness consist in a just conformity of we action to the relation in which we stand to the supreme be and to we fellow-creature where shall we find a man who have be or endeavor to be more diligent in the discharge of those essential duty he first prayer be compose in 1738 he continue those fervent ejaculation of piety to the end of he life in he meditation we see he scrutinize himself with severity and aim at perfection unattainable by man he duty to he neighbor consist in universal benevolence and a constant aim at the production of happiness who be more sincere and steady in he friendship it have be say that there be no real affection between he and garrick on the part of the latter there might be some corrosion of jealousy the character of prospero in the rambler no 200 be beyond all question occasion by garrick 's ostentatious display of furniture and dresden china it be surely fair to take from this incident a hint for a moral essay and though no more be intend garrick we be tell remember it with uneasiness he be also hurt that he lichfield friend do not think so highly of he dramatic art as the rest of the world the fact be johnson could not see the passion as they rise and chase one another in the varied feature of that expressive face and by he own manner of recite verse which be wonderfully impressive he plainly show that he think there be too much of artificial tone and measure cadence in the declamation of the theater the present writer well remember be in conversation with dr johnson near the side of the scene during the tragedy of king lear : when garrick come off the stage he say you two talk so loud you destroy all my feeling prithee reply johnson do not talk of feeling punch have no feeling this seem to have be he settled opinion admirable as garrick 's imitation of nature always be johnson think it no better than mere mimickry yet it be certain that he esteem and love garrick that he dwell with pleasure on he praise and use to declare that he deserve he great success because on all application for charity he give more than be ask after garrick 's death he never talk of he without a tear in he eye he offer if mr garrick would desire it of he to be the editor of he work and the historian of he life -lrb- bb -rrb- it have be mention that on he death-bed he think of write a latin inscription to the memory of he friend number be still live who know these fact and still remember with gratitude the friendship which he show to they with unaltered affection for a number of year he humanity and generosity in proportion to he slender income be unbounded it have be truly say that the lame the blind and the sorrowful find in he house a sure retreat a strict adherence to truth he consider as a sacred obligation insomuch that in relate the most minute anecdote he would not allow himself the smallest addition to embellish he story the late mr tyer who know dr johnson intimately observe that he always talk as if he be talk upon oath after a long acquaintance with this excellent man and a attentive retrospect to he whole conduct such be the light in which he appear to the writer of this essay the follow line of horace may be deem he picture in miniature : iracundior est paulo minus aptus acuti naribus horum hominum riderus possit eo quod rusticius tonso toga defluit et male laxus in pede calceus haeret at est bonus ut melior vir non alius quisquam : at tibus amicus : at ingenium ingen inculto latet hoc sub corpore you friend be passionate perhaps unfit for the brisk petulance of modern wit he hair ill-cut he robe that awkward flow or he large shoe to raillery expose the man you love yet be he not possess would of virtue with which very few be blest while underneath this rude uncouth disguise a genius of extensive knowledge lie franci 's hor book i sit 3 it remain to give a review of johnson 's work and this it be imagine will not be unwelcome to the reader like milton and addison he seem to have be fond of he latin poetry those composition show that he be a early scholar but he verse have not the graceful ease that give so much suavity to the poem of addison the translation of the messiah labor under two disadvantage : it be first to be compare with pope 's inimitable performance and afterwards with the pollio of virgil it may appear trifling to remark that he have make the letter _ o _ in the word _ virgo _ long and short in the same line : virgo virgo parit but the translation have great merit and some admirable line in the ode there be a sweet flexibility particularly -- to he worthy friend dr lawrence on himself at the theater march 8 1771 the ode in the isle of skie and that to mr thrale from the same place he english poetry be such as leaf room to think if he have devote himself to the muse that he would have be the rival of pope he first production in this kind be london a poem in imitation of the third satire of juvenal the vice of the metropolis be place in the room of ancient manners the author have heat he mind with the ardor of juvenal and have the skill to polish he number he become a sharp accuser of the time the vanity of human wish be a imitation of the tenth satire of the same author though it be translate by dryden johnson 's imitation approach nearest to the spirit of the original the subject be take from the alcibiade of plato and have a intermixture of the sentiment of socrate concern the object of prayer offer up to the deity the general proposition be that good and evil be so little understand by mankind that they wish when grant be always destructive this be exemplify in a variety of instance such as riches state-preferment eloquence military glory long life and the advantage of form and beauty juvenal 's conclusion be worthy of a christian poet and such a pen as johnson 's let we he say leave it to the god to judge what be fittest for we man be dearer to he creator than to himself if we must pray for special favor let it be for a sound mind in a sound body let we pray for fortitude that we may think the labor of hercule and all he suffering preferable to a life of luxury and the soft repose of sardanapalus this be a blessing within the reach of every man this we can give ourselves it be virtue and virtue only that can make we happy in the translation the zeal of the christian conspire with the warmth and energy of the poet but juvenal be not eclipse for the various character in the original the reader be please in the english poem to meet with cardinal wolsey buckingham stab by felton lord strafford clarendon charle the twelfth of sweden and for tully and demosthene lydiat galileo and archbishop laud it be owe to johnson 's delight in biography that the name of lydiat be call forth from obscurity it may therefore not be useless to tell that lydiat be a learn divine and mathematician in the beginning of the last century he attack the doctrine of aristotle and scaliger and write a number of sermon on the harmony of the evangelist with all he merit he lay in the prison of bocardo at oxford till bishop usher laud and other pay he debt he petition charle the first to be send to ethiopium to procure manuscript have speak in favor of monarchy and bishop he be plunder by the puritan and twice carry away a prisoner from he rectory he die very poor in 1646 the tragedy of irene be found on a passage in knolle 's history of the turk a author highly commend in the rambler no 122 a incident in the life of mahomet the great first emperor of the turk be the hinge on which the fable be make to move the substance of the story be shortly this : in 1453 mahomet lay siege to constantinople and have reduce the place become enamoured of a fair greek whose name be irene the sultan invite she to embrace the law of the prophet and to grace he throne enrage at this intended marriage the janizary form a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor to avert the impending danger mahomet in a full assembly of the grandee catch with one hand as knolle relate it the fair greek by the hair of she head and draw he falchion with the other he at one blow strike off she head to the great terror of they all and have so do say unto they : ` now by this judge whether you emperor be able to bridle he affection or not ' the story be simple and it remain for the author to amplify it with proper episode and give it complication and variety the catastrophe be change and horror give place to terror and pity but after all the fable be cold and languid there be not throughout the piece a single situation to excite curiosity and raise a conflict of passion the diction be nervous rich and elegant but splendid language and melodious number will make a fine poem -- not a tragedy the sentiment be beautiful always happily express but seldom appropriate to the character and generally too philosophic what johnson have say of the tragedy of cato may be apply to irene : it be rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiment in elegant language than a representation of natural affection nothing excite or assuage emotion the event be expect without solicitude and be remember without joy or sorrow of the agent we have no care we consider not what they be do nor what they be suffer we wish only to know what they have to say it be unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy the follow speech in the mouth of a turk who be suppose to have hear of the british constitution have be often select from the numberless beauty with which irene abound : if there be any land as fame report where common law restrain the prince and subject a happy land where circulate power flow through each member of th ' embody state sure not unconscious of the mighty blessing she grateful son shine bright with ev'ry virtue untainted with the lust of innovation sure all unite to hold she league of rule unbroken as the sacred chain of nature that link the jarring element in peace these be british sentiment above forty year ago they find a echo in the breast of applaud audience and to this hour they be the voice of the people in defiance of the metaphysics and the new light of certain politician who would gladly find they private advantage in the disaster of they country a race of man quibus nulla ex honesto spe the prologue to irene be write with elegance and in a peculiar style show the literary pride and lofty spirit of the author the epilogue we be tell in a late publication be write by sir william yonge this be a new discovery but by no means probable when the appendage to a dramatic performance be not assign to a friend or a unknown hand or a person of fashion they be always suppose to be write by the author of the play it be to be wish however that the epilogue in question could be transfer to any other writer it be the worst jeu d'esprit that ever fall from johnson 's pen -lrb- cc -rrb- a account of the various piece contain in this edition such as miscellaneous tract and philological dissertation would lead beyond the intended limit of this essay it will suffice to say that they be the production of a man who never want decoration of language and always teach he reader to think the life of the late king of prussium as far as it extend be a model of the biographical style the review of the origin of evil be perhaps write with asperity but the angry epitaph which it provoke from soame jenyn be a ill-timed resentment unworthy of the genius of that amiable author the rambler may be consider as johnson 's great work it be the basis of that high reputation which go on increase to the end of he day the circulation of those periodical essay be not at first equal to they merit they have not like the spectator the art of charming by variety and indeed how could it be expect the wit of queen anne 's reign send they contribution to the spectator and johnson stand alone a stagecoach say sir richard steele must go forward on state day whether there be passenger or not so it be with the rambler every Tuesday and Saturday for two year in this collection johnson be the great moral teacher of he countryman he essay form a body of ethic the observation on life and manners be acute and instructive and the papers professedly critical serve to promote the cause of literature it must however be acknowledge that a settle gloom hang over the author 's mind and all the essay except eight or ten come from the same fountain-head no wonder that they have the raciness of the soil from which they spring of this uniformity johnson be sensible he use to say that if he have join a friend or two who would have be able to intermix papers of a sprightly turn the collection would have be more miscellaneous and by consequence more agreeable to the generality of reader this he use to illustrate by repeat two beautiful stanza from he own ode to cave or sylvanus urban : non ullum musis pagina gratior quam quae severis ludicra jungere novit fatigatamque nugi utilibus recreare mentem texente nymphi serta lycoride rosa ruborem sic viola adjuvat iramista sic iris refulget aetherei varia fuci it be remarkable that the pomp of diction which have be object to johnson be first assume in the rambler he dictionary be go on at the same time and in the course of that work as he grow familiar with technical and scholastic word he think that the bulk of he reader be equally learn or at least would admire the splendor and dignity of the style and yet it be well know that he praise in cowley the ease and unaffected structure of the sentence cowley may be place at the head of those who cultivate a clear and natural style dryden tillotson and sir william temple follow addison swift and pope with more correctness carry we language well nigh to perfection of addison johnson be use to say he be the raphael of essay writer how he differ so widely from such elegant model be a problem not to be solve unless it be true that he take a early tincture from the writer of the last century particularly sir thoma browne hence the peculiarity of he style new combination sentence of a unusual structure and word derive from the learn language he own account of the matter be : when common word be less please to the ear or less distinct in they signification i familiarize the term of philosophy by apply they to popular idea but he forget the observation of dryden : if too many foreign word be pour in upon we it look as if they be design not to assist the native but to conquer they there be it must be admit a swell of language often out of all proportion to the sentiment but there be in general a fulness of mind and the thought seem to expand with the sound of the word determine to discard colloquial barbarism and licentious idiom he forget the elegant simplicity that distinguish the writings of addison he have what locke call a round-about view of he subject and though he never be taint like many modern wit with the ambition of shine in paradox he may be fairly call a original thinker he reading be extensive he treasured in he mind whatever be worthy of notice but he add to it from he own meditation he collect quae reconderet auetaque promeret addison be not so profound a thinker he be bear to write converse and live with ease and he find a early patron in lord somer he depend however more upon a fine taste than the vigor of he mind he latin poetry show that he relish with a just selection all the refine and delicate beauty of the roman classic and when he cultivate he native language no wonder that he form that graceful style which have be so justly admire simple yet elegant adorn yet never over-wrought rich in allusion yet pure and perspicuous correct without labor and though sometimes deficient in strength yet always musical he essay in general be on the surface of life if ever original it be in piece of humor sir roger de coverly and the tory fox-hunter need not to be mention johnson have a fund of humor but he do not know it nor be he willing to descend to the familiar idiom and the variety of diction which that mode of composition require the letter in the rambler no 12 from a young girl that want a place will illustrate this observation addison possess a unclouded imagination alive to the first object of nature and of art he reach the sublime without any apparent effort when he tell we if we consider the fix star as so many ocean of flame that be each of they attend with a different set of planet if we still discover new firmament and new light that be sink further in those unfathomable depths of ether we be lose in a labyrinth of sun and world and confound with the magnificence and immensity of nature the ease with which this passage rise to unaffected grandeur be the secret charm that captivate the reader johnson be always lofty he seem to use dryden 's phrase to be o'erinform would with meaning and he word do not appear to himself adequate to he conception he move in state and he period be always harmonious he oriental tale be in the true style of eastern magnificence and yet none of they be so much admire as the vision of mirza in matter of criticism johnson be never the echo of precede writer he think and decide for himself if we except the essay on the pleasure of imagination addison can not be call a philosophical critic he moral essay be beautiful but in that province nothing can exceed the rambler though johnson use to say that the essay on the burthen of mankind -lrb- in the spectator no 558 -rrb- be the most exquisite he have ever read talking of himself johnson say topham beauclerk have wit and every thing come from he with ease but when i say a good thing i seem to labor when we compare he with addison the contrast be still stronger : addison lend grace and ornament to truth johnson give it force and energy addison make virtue amiable johnson represent it as a awful duty : addison insinuate himself with a air of modesty johnson command like a dictator but a dictator in he splendid robe not labor at the plough : addison be the jupiter of virgil with placid serenity talk to venus vultu quo coelum tempestatesque serenat johnson be jupiter tonan : he dart he lightning and roll he thunder in the cause of virtue and piety the language seem to fall short of he idea he pour along familiarize the term of philosophy with bold inversion and sonorous period but we may apply to he what pope have say of homer : it be the sentiment that swell and fill out the diction which rise with it and form itself about it : like glass in the furnace which grow to a greater magnitude as the breath within be more powerful and the heat more intense it be not the design of this comparison to decide between these two eminent writer in matter of taste every reader will choose for himself johnson be always profound and of course give the fatigue of think addison charm while he instruct and write as he always do a pure a elegant and idiomatic style he may be pronounce the safest model for imitation the essay write by johnson in the adventurer may be call a continuation of the rambler the idler in order to be consistent with the assume character be write with abate vigor in a style of ease and unlaboured elegance it be the odyssey after the iliad intense thinking would not become the idler the first number present a well-drawn portrait of a idler and from that character no deviation could be make accordingly johnson forget he austere manner and play we into sense he still continue he lecture on human life but he advert to common occurrence and be often content with the topic of the day a advertisement in the beginning of the first volume inform we that twelve entire essay be a contribution from different hand one of these no 33 be the journal of a senior fellow at cambridge but as johnson be himself a original thinker always revolt from servile imitation he have print the piece with a apology import that the journal of a citizen in the spectator almost preclude the attempt of any subsequent writer this account of the idler may be close after observe that the author 's mother be bury on the 23rd of January 1759 there be a admirable paper occasion by that event on Saturday the 27th of the same month no 41 the reader if he please may compare it with another fine paper in the rambler no 54 on the conviction that rush on the mind at the bed of a die friend rassela say sir john hawkin be a specimen of we language scarcely to be parallel it be write in a style refine to a degree of immaculate purity and display the whole force of turgid eloquence one can not but smile at this encomium rassela be undoubtedly both elegant and sublime it be a view of human life display it must be own in gloomy color the author 's natural melancholy depressed at the time by the approach dissolution of he mother darken the picture a tale that should keep curiosity awake by the artifice of unexpected incident be not the design of a mind pregnant with better thing he who read the head of the chapter will find that it be not a course of adventure that invite he forward but a discussion of interesting question reflection on human life the history of imlac the man of learn a dissertation upon poetry the character of a wise and happy man who discourse with energy on the government of the passion and on a sudden when death deprive he of he daughter forget all he maxim of wisdom and the eloquence that adorn they yield to the stroke of affliction with all the vehemence of the bitterest anguish it be by picture of life and profound moral reflection that expectation be engage and gratify throughout the work the history of the mad astronomer who imagine that for five year he possess the regulation of the weather and that the sun pass from tropic to tropic by he direction represent in striking color the sad effect of a distempered imagination it become the more affect when we recollect that it proceed from one who live in fear of the same dreadful visitation from one who say emphatically : of the uncertainty in we present state the most dreadful and alarming be the uncertain continuance of reason the inquiry into the cause of madness and the dangerous prevalence of imagination till in time some particular train of idea fix the attention and the mind recur constantly to the favorite conception be carry on in a strain of acute observation but it leave we room to think that the author be transcribe from he own apprehension the discourse on the nature of the soul give we all that philosophy know not without a tincture of superstition it be remarkable that the vanity of human pursuit be about the same time the subject that employ both johnson and voltaire but candide be the work of a lively imagination and rassela with all its splendor of eloquence exhibit a gloomy picture it should however be remember that the world have know the weep as well as the laughing philosopher the dictionary do not properly fall within the province of this essay the preface however will be find in this edition he who read the close of it without acknowledge the force of the pathethic and sublime must have more insensibility in he composition than usually fall to the share of a man the work itself though in some instance abuse have be loud and in other malice have endeavor to undermine its fame still remain the mount atla of english literature though storm and tempest thunder on its brow and ocean break they billow at its foot it stand unmov would and glory in its height that johnson be eminently qualify for the office of a commentator on shakespeare no man can doubt but it be a office which he never cordially embrace the public expect more than he have diligence to perform and yet he edition have be the ground on which every subsequent commentator have choose to build one note for its singularity may be think worthy of notice in this place hamlet say for if the sun breed maggot in a dead dog be a god-kissing carrion in this warburton discover the origin of evil hamlet he say break off in the middle of the sentence but the learn commentator know what he be go to say and be unwilling to keep the secret he go on in a train of philosophical reasoning that leave the reader in astonishment johnson with true piety adopt the fanciful hypothesis declare it to be a noble emendation which almost set the critic on a level with the author the general observation at the end of the several play and the preface will be find in this edition the former with great elegance and precision give a summary view of each drama the preface be a tract of great erudition and philosophical criticism johnson 's political pamphlet whatever be he motive for write they whether gratitude for he pension or the solicitation of man in power do not support the cause for which they be undertake they be write in a style truly harmonious and with he usual dignity of language when it be say that he advance position repugnant to the common rights of mankind the virulence of party may be suspect it be perhaps true that in the clamor raise throughout the kingdom johnson overheate he mind but he be a friend to the rights of man and he be greatly superior to the littleness of spirit that might incline he to advance what he do not think and firmly believe in the false alarm though many of the most eminent man in the kingdom concur in petition to the throne yet johnson have well survey the mass of the people have give with great humor and no less truth what may be call the birth parentage and education of a remonstrance on the subject of falkland 's island the fine dissuasive from too hastily involve the world in the calamity of war must extort applause even from the party that wish at that time for scene of tumult and commotion it be in the same pamphlet that johnson offer battle to junius a writer who by the uncommon elegance of he style charm every reader though he object be to inflame the nation in favor of a faction junius fight in the dark he see he enemy and have he full blow while he himself remain safe in obscurity but let we not say johnson mistake the venom of the shaft for the vigor of the bow the keen invective which he publish on that occasion promise a paper war between two combatant who know the use of they weapon a battle between they be as eagerly expect as between mendoza and big ben but junius whatever be he reason never return to the field he lay down he arm and have ever since remain as secret as the man in the mask in voltaire 's history the account of he journey to the hebride or western isle of scotland be a model for such as shall hereafter relate they travels the author do not visit that part of the world in the character of a antiquary to amuse we with wonder take from the dark and fabulous age nor as a mathematician to measure a degree and settle the longitude and latitude of the several island those who expect such information expect what be never intend in every work regard the writer 's end johnson go to see man and manners mode of life and the progress of civilization he remark be so artfully blended with the rapidity and elegance of he narrative that the reader be incline to wish as johnson do with regard to gray that to travel and to tell he travels have be more of he employment as to johnson 's parliamentary debate nothing with propriety can be say in this place they be collect in two volume by mr stockdale and the flow of eloquence which run through the several speech be sufficiently know it will not be useless to mention two more volume which may form a proper supplement to this edition they contain a set of sermon leave for publication by john taylor lld the reverend mr haye who usher these discourse into the world have not give they as the composition of dr taylor all he could say for he depart friend be that he leave they in silence among he papers mr haye know they to be the production of a superior mind and the writer of these memoirs owe it to the candor of that elegant scholar that he be now warrant to give a additional proof of johnson 's ardor in the cause of piety and every moral duty the last discourse in the collection be intend to be deliver by dr taylor at the funeral of johnson 's wife but that reverend gentleman decline the office because as he tell mr haye the praise of the decease be too much amplify he who read the piece will find it a beautiful moral lesson write with temper and nowhere overcharge with ambitious ornament the rest of the discourse be the fund which dr taylor from time to time carry with he to he pulpit he have the _ largest bull _ -lrb- dd -rrb- in england and some of the best sermon we come now to the life of the poet a work undertake at the age of seventy yet the most brilliant and certainly the most popular of all we author 's writings for this performance he need little preparation attentive always to the history of letter and by he own natural bias fond of biography he be the more willing to embrace the proposition of the bookseller he be verse in the whole body of english poetry and he rule of criticism be settle with precision the dissertation in the life of cowley on the metaphysical poet of the last century have the attraction of novelty as well as sound observation the writer who follow dr donne go in quest of something better than truth and nature as sancho say in don quixote they want better bread than be make with wheat they take pain to bewilder themselves and be ingenious for no other purpose than to err in johnson 's review of cowley 's work false wit be detect in all its shape and the gothic taste for glitter conceit and far-fetched allusion be explode never it be hope to revive again a author who have publish he observation on the life and writings of dr johnson speaking of the life of the poet say these composition abound in strong and acute remark and with many fine and even sublime passage have unquestionably great merit but if they be regard merely as contain narration of the life delineation of the character and stricture of the several author they be far from be always to be depend on he add : the character be sometimes partial and there be sometimes too much malignity of misrepresentation to which perhaps may be join no inconsiderable portion of erroneous criticism the several clause of this censure deserve to be answer as fully as the limit of this essay will permit in the first place the fact be relate upon the best intelligence and the best voucher that could be glean after a great lapse of time probability be to be infer from such material as could be procure and no man better understand the nature of historical evidence than dr johnson no man be more religiously a observer of truth if he history be any where defective it must be imputed to the want of better information and the error of uncertain tradition ad no vix tenuis fama perlabitur aura if the stricture on the work of the various author be not always satisfactory and if erroneous criticism may sometimes be suspect who can hope that in matter of taste all shall agree the instance in which the public mind have differ from the position advance by the author be few in number it have be say that justice have not be do to swift that gay and prior be undervalue and that gray have be harshly treat this charge perhaps ought not to be dispute johnson it be well know have conceive a prejudice against swift he friend tremble for he when he be write that life but be please at last to see it execute with temper and moderation as to prior it be probable that he give he real opinion but a opinion that will not be adopt by man of lively fancy with regard to gray when he condemn the apostrophe in which father thame be desire to tell who drive the hoop or toss the ball and then add that father thame have no better mean of know than himself when he compare the abrupt beginning of the first stanza of the bard to the ballad of johnny armstrong be there ever a man in all scotland there be perhaps few friend of johnson who would not wish to blot out both the passage it may be question whether the remark on pope 's essay on man can be receive without great caution it have be already mention that crousaz a professor in switzerland eminent for he treatise of logic start up a profess enemy to that poem johnson say he mind be one of those in which philosophy and piety be happily unite he look with distrust upon all metaphysical system of theology and be persuade that the position of pope be intend to draw mankind away from revelation and to represent the whole course of thing as a necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality this be not the place fur a controversy about the leibnitzian system warburton with all the power of he large and comprehensive mind publish a vindication of pope and yet johnson say that in many passage a religious eye may easily discover expression not very favourable to moral or to liberty this sentence be severe and perhaps dogmatical crousaz write a examan of the essay on man and afterwards a commentary on every remarkable passage and though it now appear that mr elizabeth carter translate the foreign critic yet it be certain that johnson encourage the work and perhaps imbibe those early prejudice which adhere to he to the end of he life he shudder at the idea of irreligion hence we be tell in the life of pope never be penury of knowledge and vulgarity of sentiment so happily disguise pope in the chair of wisdom tell much that every man know and much that he do not know himself and give we comfort in the position that though man 's a fool yet god be wise that human advantage be unstable that we true honor be not to have a great part but to act it well that virtue only be we own and that happiness be always in we power the reader when he meet all this in its new array no longer know the talk of he mother and he nurse but may it not be say that every system of ethic must or ought to terminate in plain and general maxim for the use of life and though in such anxiom no discovery be make do not the beauty of the moral theory consist in the premise and the chain of reasoning that lead to the conclusion may not truth as johnson himself say be convey to the mind by a new train of intermediate image pope 's doctrine about the ruling passion do not seem to be refute though it be call in harsh term pernicious as well as false tend to establish a kind of moral predestination or overrule principle which can not be resist but johnson be too easily alarm in the cause of religion organize as the human race be individual have different inlet of perception different power of mind and different sensation of pleasure and pain all spread they charm but charm not all alike on different sens different object strike : hence different passion more or less inflame as strong or weak the organ of the frame and hence one master-passion in the breast like aaron 's serpent swallow up the rest brumoy say pascal from he infancy feel himself a geometrician and vandyke in like manner be a painter shakespeare who of all poet have the deepest insight into human nature be aware of a prevail bias in the operation of every mind by he we be tell masterless passion sway we to the mood of what it like or loathe it remain to inquire whether in the life before we the character be partial and too often draw with malignity of misrepresentation to prove this it be allege that johnson have misrepresent the circumstance relative to the translation of the first iliad and maliciously ascribe that performance to addison instead of tickell with too much reliance on the testimony of pope take from the account in the papers leave by mr spence for a refutation of the fallacy imputed to addison we be refer to a note in the biographium britannica write by the late judge blackstone who it be say examine the whole matter with accuracy and find that the first regular statement of the accusation against addison be publish by ruffhead in he life of pope from the material which he receive from dr warburton but with all due deference to the learn judge whose talent deserve all praise this account be by no means accurate sir richard steele in a dedication of the comedy of the drummer to mr congreve give the first insight into that business he say in a style of anger and resentment : if that gentleman -lrb- mr tickell -rrb- think himself injured i will allow i have wrong he upon this issue that if the reputed translator of the first book of homer shall please to give we another book there shall appear another good judge in poetry besides mr alexander pope who shall like it the authority of steele outweigh all opinion found on vain conjecture and indeed seem to be decisive since we do not find that tickell though warmly press thought proper to vindicate himself but the grand proof of johnson 's malignity be the manner in which he have treat the character and conduct of milton to enforce this charge have weary sophistry and exhaust the invention of a party what they can not deny they palliate what they can not prove they say be probable but why all this rage against dr johnson addison before he have say of milton : oh have the poet ne'er profan have he pen to varnish o'er the guilt of faithless man and have not johnson a equal right to avow he sentiment do he enemy claim a privilege to abuse whatever be valuable to englishmen either in church or state and must the liberty of unlicensed printing be deny to the friend of the british constitution it be unnecessary to pursue the argument through all its artifice since dismantle of ornament and seduce language the plain truth may be state in a narrow compass johnson know that milton be a republican : he say a acrimonious and surly republican for which it be not know that he give any better reason than that a popular government be the most frugal for the trappings of a monarchy would set up a ordinary commonwealth johnson know that milton talk aloud of the danger of readmit kingship in this nation and when milton add that a commonwealth be commend or rather enjoin by we savior himself to all christian not without a remarkable disallowance and the brand of gentilism upon kingship johnson think he no better than a wild enthusiast he know as well as milton that the happiness of a nation must need be firmest and certainest in a full and free council of they own elect where no single person but reason only sway but the example of all the republick record in the annals of mankind give he no room to hope that reason only would be hear he know that the republican form of government have little or no complication and no consonance of part by a nice mechanism form a regular whole be too simple to be beautiful even in theory in practice it perhaps never exist in its most flourishing state at athen rome and carthage it be a constant scene of tumult and commotion from the mischief of a wild democracy the progress have ever be to the dominion of a aristocracy and the word aristocracy fatally include the boldest and most turbulent citizen who rise by they crime and call themselves the best man in the state by intrigue by cabal and faction a pernicious oligarchy be sure to succeed and end at last in the tyranny of a single ruler tacitus the great master of political wisdom saw under the mixed authority of king noble and people a better form of government than milton 's boast republick and what tacitus admire in theory but despaired of enjoy johnson see establish in this country he know that it have be overturn by the rage of frantic man but he know that after the iron rod of cromwell 's usurpation the constitution be once more restore to its first principle monarchy be establish and this country be regenerate it be regenerate a second time at the revolution : the rights of man be then define and the blessing of good order and civil liberty have be ever since diffuse through the whole community the peace and happiness of society be what dr johnson have at heart he know that milton call he defense of the regicide a defense of the people of england but however glossed and varnished he think it a apology for murder have the man who under a show of liberty bring they king to the scaffold prove by they subsequent conduct that the public good inspire they action the end might have give some sanction to the means but usurpation and slavery follow milton undertake the office of secretary under the despotic power of cromwell offer the incense of adulation to he master with the title of director of public council the leader of unconquered army the father of he country milton declare at the same time that nothing be more please to god or more agreeable to reason than that the highest mind should have the sovereign power in this strain of servile flattery milton give we the right divine of tyrant but it seem in the same piece he exhort cromwell not to desert those great principle of liberty which he have profess to espouse for it would be a grievous enormity if after have successfully oppose tyranny he should himself act the part of a tyrant and betray the cause that he have defend this desertion of every honest principle the advocate for liberty live to see cromwell act the tyrant and with vile hypocrisy tell the people that he have consult the lord and the lord would have it so milton take a under part in the tragedy do that become the defender of the people of england brutus see he country enslave he strike the blow for freedom and he die with honor in the cause have he live to be a secretary under tiberius what would now be say of he memory but still it seem the prostitution with which milton be charge since it can not be defend be to be retort on the character of johnson for this purpose a book have be publish call remark on dr johnson 's life of milton to which be add milton 's tractate of education and areopagitica in this labor tract we be tell there be one performance ascribe to the pen of the doctor where the prostitution be of so singular a nature that it would be difficult to select a adequate motive for it out of the mountainous heap of conjectural cause of human passion or human caprice it be the speech of the late unhappy dr william dodd when he be about to hear the sentence of the law pronounce upon he in consequence of a indictment for forgery the voice of the public have give the honor of manufacture this speech to dr johnson and the style and configuration of the speech itself confirm the imputation but it be hardly possible to divine what could be he motive for accept the office a man to express the precise state of mind of another about to be destine to a ignominious death for a capital crime should one would imagine have some consciousness that he himself have incur some guilt of the same kind in all the school of sophistry be there to be find so vile a argument in the purlieus of grub street be there such another mouthful of dirt in the whole quiver of malice be there so envenom a shaft after this it be to be hope that a certain class of man will talk no more of johnson 's malignity the last apology for milton be that he act accord to he principle but johnson think those principle detestable pernicious to the constitution in church and state destructive of the peace of society and hostile to the great fabric of civil policy which the wisdom of age have teach every briton to revere to love and cherish he reckon milton in that class of man of whom the roman historian say when they want by a sudden convulsion to overturn the government they roar and clamor for liberty if they succeed they destroy liberty itself : ut imperium evertant libertatem praeferunt si perverterint libertatem ipsam aggredientur such be the sentiment of dr johnson and it may be ask in the language of bolingbroke be these sentiment which any man who be bear a briton in any circumstance in any situation ought to be ashamed or afraid to avow johnson have do ample justice to milton 's poetry : the criticism on paradise lose be a sublime composition have he think the author as good and pious a citizen as dr watt he would have be ready notwithstanding he nonconformity to do equal honor to the memory of the man it be now time to close this essay which the author fear have be draw too much into length in the progress of the work feeble as it may be he think himself perform the last human office to the memory of a friend whom he love esteem and honor : he saltern accumulem doni et fungar inani munere -- the author of these memoirs have be anxious to give the feature of the man and the true character of the author he have not suffer the hand of partiality to color he excellency with too much warmth nor have he endeavor

observation to the imitation of the third and tenth satire of juvenal we will not examine here johnson 's poetical merit since that discussion will more properly introduce he life of the poet but merely offer some few biographical remark in the poem of london mr boswell be of opinion that johnson do not allude to savage under the name of thale and add for he reason that johnson be not so much as acquaint with savage when he _ write _ he london about a month however before he _ publish _ this poem he address the follow line to he through the gentleman 's magazine for April 1738 ad ricardum savage humanani studium generi cui pectore fervet o colat humanum te foveatque genus we can not certainly infer from this a intimacy with savage but it be more probable that these line flow from a feeling of private friendship than mere admiration of a author in a public point of view and they at any rate give credibility to the general opinion that under the name of thale the poet refer to the author of the wanderer who be at this time prepare for he retreat to wale whither he actually go in the ensue year the name of lydiat vane and sedley which be bring forward in the poem on the vanity

enter holy order and to live upon a small patrimony he be highly esteem by the accomplished and unfortunate prince henry son of jame the first but he hope of provision in that quarter be blast by that prince 's premature death and he then accompany the celebrated usher into ireland after two or three year he return to england and poverty induce he now to accept the rectory of okerton near banbury which he have before decline here he imprudently become security for the debt of a relation and be unable to pay be imprison for several year he be release at last by he patron usher sir w boswell dr

encouragement to travel into the east to collect mss but the embarrassed state of the king 's affair prevent he petition from receive attention lastly he well-known attachment to the royal cause draw upon he the repeat violence of the parliament troops who plunder imprison and abuse he in the most cruel manner he die in obscurity and indigence in 1646 a stone be lay over he grave in okerton church in 1669 by the society of new college who also erect a honorary monument to he memory in the cloister of they college we have dwell thus long on lydiat 's name because when this poem be publish it be a subject of inquiry who lydiat be though some of he contemporary both in england and on the continent rank he with lord bacon in mathematical and physical knowledge for a more detailed account see chalmer ' biographical dictionary vol xxi whence the above fact have be extract and gentleman 's magazine vol lxviii galileo and he history be too well know to require a note in this place the vane who tell what ill from beauty spring be not lady vane the subject of smollett 's memoirs in peregrine pickle but accord to mr malone she be anne vane mistress to frederick prince of wale and die in

boswell 's tour to the hebride we find lord haile object to the instance of unfortunate beauty select by johnson and suggest in place of vane and sedley the name of shore and valière catherine sedley be daughter of sir charle sedley mistress of king jame the second who create she countess of dorchester she be a woman of a sprightly and agreeable wit which could charm without the aid of beauty and

title as a splendid indignity purchase at the expense of he daughter 's honor and when he be very active against the king about the time of the revolution he say that in gratitude he should do he utmost to make he majesty 's daughter a queen as the king have make he own a countess the king continue to visit she which give great uneasiness to the queen who employ she friend particularly the priest to persuade he to break off the correspondence they remonstrate with he on the guilt of the commerce and the reproach it would bring on the catholic religion she on the contrary employ the

garden theater the winter before say to be a turk prefatory notice to the tragedy of irene the history of this tragedy 's composition be interesting as afford date to distinguish johnson 's literary progress it be begin and considerably advance while he keep a school at edial near lichfield in 1736 in the following year when he relinquish the task of a schoolmaster so little congenial with he mind and disposition and resolve to seek he fortune in the metropolis irene be carry along with he as a foundation for he success mr walmsley one of he early friend recommend he and he fellow-adventurer garrick to the notice and protection of colson the mathematician unless mr piozzus be correct in rescue the character of colson from any identity with that of gelidus in the rambler -lrb- a -rrb- johnson entertain no lively recollection of he first patron 's kindness he be ever warm in expression of gratitude for favor confer on he in he season of want and obscurity and from he deep silence here we may conclude that the recluse mathematician do not evince much sympathy with the distress of the young candidate for dramatic fame be this however as it may johnson shortly after this introduction take lodgings at greenwich to proceed with he irene in quiet and retirement but soon return to lichfield to complete it the same year that see these successive disappointment witness also johnson 's return to london with he tragedy complete and its rejection by fleetwood the patentee at that time of drury lane theater twelve year elapse before it be act and after many alteration by he pupil and companion garrick who be then manager of the theater it be by he zeal and the support of the most eminent performer of the day carry through a representation of nine night johnson 's profit after the deduction of expense and together with the hundred pound which he receive from robert dodsley for the copy be nearly three hundred pound so fallacious be the hope cherish by walmsley that johnson would turn out a fine tragedy writer -lrb- b -rrb- the tragedy of irene say mr murphy be found on a passage in knolle 's history of the turk a author highly commend in the rambler no 122 a incident in the life of mahomet the great first emperor of the turk be the hinge on which the fable be make to move the substance of the story be shortly this : -- in 1453 mahomet lay siege to constantinople and have reduce the place become enamoured of a fair greek whose name be irene the sultan invite she to embrace the law of the prophet and to grace he throne enrage at this intended marriage the janizary form a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor to avert the impending danger mahomet in a full assembly of the grandee catch with one hand as knolle relate it the fair greek by the hair of she head and draw he falchion with the other he at one blow strike off she head to the great terror of they all and have so do say unto they ` now by this judge whether you emperor be able to bridle he affection or not -lrb- c -rrb- ' we be not unjust we conceive in affirm that there be a interest keep alive in the plain and simple narrative of the old historian which be lose in the declamatory tragedy of johnson it be sufficient for we present purpose to confess that he _ have _ fail in this he only dramatic attempt we shall endeavor more fully to show _ how _ he have fail in we discussion of he power as a critic that they be not blind to the defect of other by he own inefficiency in dramatic composition be fully prove by he judicious remark on cato which be construct on a plan similar to irene : and the strongest censure ever pass on this tragedy be convey in garrick 's application of johnson 's own severe but correct critique on the wit of charle in whose work declamation roar would while passion sleep -lrb- d -rrb- addison speak the language of poet say johnson in he preface to shakespeare and shakespeare of man we find in cato innumerable beauty which enamor we of its author but we see nothing that acquaint we with human sentiment or human action we place it with the fairest and the noblest progeny which judgment propagate by conjunction with learning but othello be the vigorous and vivacious offspring of observation impregnate by genius cato afford a splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners and deliver just and noble sentiment in diction easy elevated and harmonious but its hope and fear communicate no vibration to the heart : the composition refer we only to the writer we pronounce the name of cato but we think on addison the critic 's remark on the same tragedy in he life of addison be as applicable as the above to he own production cato be rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiment in elegant language than a representation of natural affection or of any state probable or possible in human life nothing here ` excite or assuage emotion : ' here be no ` magical power of raise phantastick terror or wild anxiety ' the event be expect without solicitude and be remember without joy or sorrow of the agent we have no care we consider not what they be do or what they be suffer we wish only to know what they have to say but while we thus pronounce johnson 's failure in the production of dramatic effect we will not withhold we tribute of admiration from irene as a moral piece for although a remark of fox 's on a unpublished tragedy of burke 's that it be rather rhetorical than poetical may be apply to the work under consideration still it abound throughout with the most elevated and dignified lesson of morality and virtue the address of demetrius to the aged calus on the danger of procrastination -lrb- e -rrb- aspasium 's reprobation of irene 's meditated apostasy -lrb- f -rrb- and the allusive panegyric on the british constitution -lrb- g -rrb- may be enumerate as example of its excellence in sentiment and diction lastly we may consider irene as one other illustrious proof that the most strict adherence to the far-famed unity the most harmonious versification and the most correct philosophy will not vie with a single and simple touch of nature express in simple and artless language but how rich in reputation must that author be who can spare _ a irene _ and not feel the loss -lrb- h -rrb- footnote -lrb- a -rrb- rambler no 24 and note -lrb-

tuti cultum contempsit agellus et petiit terras per freta longa nova the history of rassela prince of abissinium prefatory observation the following incomparable tale be publish in 1759 and the early familiarity with eastern manners which johnson derive from he translation of father lobo 's travels into abissinium may be presume to have lead he to fix he open scene in that country while rasselum christo the general of sultan seque mention in that work may have suggest the name of he speculative prince rassela be write in the evening of a single week and send to the press in portion with the amiable view of defray the funeral expense of the author 's aged mother and discharge she few remain debt the sum however which he receive for it do not seem large to those who know its subsequent popularity none of he work have be more widely circulate and the admiration which it have attract in almost every country of europe prove that with all its depression and sadness it do utter a voice that meet with a assenting answer in the heart of all who have try life and find its emptiness johnson 's view of we lot on earth be always gloomy and the circumstance under which rassela be compose be calculate to add a deepen tinge of melancholy to its speculation on human folly misery or malignity many of the subject discuss be know to have be those which have agitate johnson 's mind among they be the question whether the depart ever revisit the place that know they on earth and how far they may take a interest in the welfare of those over whom they watch when here we shall elsewhere have to contemplate the moralist standing on the border of he mother 's grave and ask with anxious agony whether that dark bourn once pass terminate for ever the care of maternity and love -lrb- a -rrb- the frivolous and the proud who think not or acknowledge not that there be secret in both matter and mind of which they philosophy have not dream may smile at what they may in they derision term such weak and idle inquiry but on they the most powerful mind that ever illuminate this world have fasten with a intense curiosity and own they fear or they ignorance have not dare to disavow they belief -lrb- b -rrb- it be not to be deny that rassela display life as one unvaried series of disappointment and leave the mind at its close in painful depression this effect have be consider a evil and regard even as similar to that produce by the doctrine of voltaire bolingbroke and rousseau who combine every thing venerable on earth with ridicule treat virtue and vice with equal contemptuous indifference and lay bare with cruel mockery the vanity of all mortal wish prospects and pursuit they motive for all this we need not pause in this place to examine but a distinction may be make between the melancholy of the heart and the melancholy of the mind : while the latter be sceptical sour and misanthropic the former be passionate tender and religious those who be under the influence of the one become inactive morose or heedless : detect the folly of the wisest and the frailty of the best they scoff at the very name of virtue they spurn as visionary and weak every attempt to meliorate man 's condition and from they conviction of the earthward tendency of he mind they bind he destiny by this narrow world and its concern but those whose heart be penetrate with a feeling for human infirmity and sorrow be benevolent and active consider man as the victim of sin and woe and death for a cause which reason can not unfold but which religion promise to terminate they sooth the short-lived disappointment of life by point to a loftier and more lasting state candide be the book of the one party rassela of the other they appear nearly together they exhibit the same picture of change and misery and crime but the one demoralize a continent and give birth to lust and rapine and bloodsh the other have bless many a heart and gladden the vale of sorrow with many a rill of pure and living water voltaire may be liken to the venomous toad of eastern allegory which extract a deadly poison from that sunbeam which bear health and light and life to all beside : the philosopher in rassela like some holy and aged man who have well nigh run he course in recount the toil and peril of he pilgrimage may sadden the young heart and crush the fond hope of inexperience but while he wound he present the antidote and the balm and tell where promise will be realize and hope will no more be disappoint we have venture to detain we reader thus long from rassela itself because from its similar view of life with the sceptical school many well-intentioned man have apprehend its effect might be the same we have therefore attempt briefly to distinguish the source whence these different writings have issue and we trust we have point out they remoteness from each other and we do not dwell on the subject at greater length because johnson 's writings in various part will require we attention on this particular head to be restless and weary of the dull detail and incomplete enjoyment of life be common to all lofty mind frederick of prussium seek in the bosom of a cold philosophy to chill every generous impulse and each warm aspiration after immortality but he painfully feel how inefficient be grandeur or power to fill the heart and plaintively exclaim to maupertuis que notre vie est peu de choose all be vanity the philosophy of rassela however though it pronounce on the unsatisfactory nature of all human enjoyment and though its perusal may check the worldling in he mirth and bring down the mighty in he pride do not with the philosophic conqueror sullenly despair but gently sooth the mourner by the prospect of a final recompense and repose its page inculcate the same lesson as those of the rambler but the precept which be tedious in a formal essay may acquire attraction in a tale and the sober charm of truth be divest of they austerity by the grace of innocent fiction -lrb- c -rrb- we may observe in conclusion that the abrupt termination of rassela so leave accord to sir john hawkin by its author to admit of continuation and its unbroken gloom induce miss e

different enjoyment and revelry and merriment be the business of every hour from the dawn of morning to the close of even these method be generally successful few of the prince have ever wish to enlarge they bound but pass they life in full conviction that they have all within they reach that art or nature could bestow and pity those whom fate have exclude from this seat of tranquillity as the sport of chance and the slave of misery thus they rise in the morning and lay down at night pleased with each other and with themselves all but rassela who in the twenty-sixth year of he age begin to withdraw himself from they pastime and assembly and to delight in solitary walk and silent meditation he often sit before table cover with luxury and forget to taste the dainty that be place before he : he rise abruptly in the midst of the song and hastily retire beyond the sound of musick he attendant observe the change and endeavor to renew he love of pleasure : he neglect they officiousness repulse they invitation and spend day after day on the bank of rivulet sheltered with tree where he sometimes listen to the bird in the branch sometimes observe the fish playing in the stream and anon cast he eye upon the pasture and mountain fill with animal of which some be bite the herbage and some sleeping among the bush this singularity of he humor make he much observe one of the sage in whose conversation he have formerly delighted follow he secretly in hope of discover the cause of he disquiet rassela who know not that any one be near he have for some time fix he eye upon the goat that be browse among the rock begin to compare they condition with he own what say he make the difference between man and all the rest of the animal creation every beast that stray beside I have the same corporal necessity with myself : he be hungry and crop the grass he be thirsty and drink the stream he thirst and hunger be appease he be satisfied and sleep : he rise again and be hungry he be again feed and be at rest i be hungry and thirsty like he but when thirst and hunger cease i be not at rest i be like he pained with want but be not like he satisfy with fulness the intermediate hour be tedious and gloomy i long again to be hungry that i may again quicken my attention the bird peck the berry or the corn and fly away to the grove where they sit in seeming happiness on the branch and waste they life in tuning one unvaried series of sound i likewise can call the lutanist and the singer but the sound that please I yesterday weary I to-day and will grow yet more wearisome to-morrow i can discover within I no power of perception which be not glut with its proper pleasure yet i do not feel myself delighted man surely have some latent sense for which this place afford no gratification or he have some desire distinct from sense which must be satisfy before he can be happy after this he lift up he head and see the moon rise walk towards the palace as he pass through the field and see the animal around he ye say he be happy and need not envy I that walk thus among you burden with myself nor do i ye gentle being envy you felicity for it be not the felicity of man i have many distress from which ye be free i fear pain when i do not feel it i sometimes shrink at evil recollect and sometimes start at evil anticipate : surely the equity of providence have balance peculiar suffering with peculiar enjoyment with observation like these the prince amuse himself as he return utter they with a plaintive voice yet with a look that discover he to feel some complacence in he own perspicacity and to receive some solace of the misery of life from consciousness of the delicacy with which he feel and the eloquence with which he bewail they he mingle cheerfully in the diversion of the evening and all rejoice to find that he heart be lighten chap iii the want of he that want nothing on the next day he old instructor imagine that he have now make himself acquaint with he disease of mind be in hope of cure it by counsel and officiously seek a opportunity of conference which the prince have long consider he as one whose intellect be exhaust be not very willing to afford : why say he do this man thus obtrude upon I shall i be never suffer to forget those lecture which please only while they be new and to become new again must be forget he then walk into the wood and compose himself to he usual meditation when before he thought have take any settled form he perceive he pursuer at he side and be at first prompt by he impatience to go hastily away but be unwilling to offend a man whom he have once reverenced and still love he invite he to sit down with he on the bank the old man thus encourage begin to lament the change which have be lately observe in the prince and to inquire why he so often retire from the pleasure of the palace to loneliness and silence i fly from pleasure say the prince because pleasure have cease to please i be lonely because i be miserable and be unwilling to cloud with my presence the happiness of other you sir say the sage be the first who have complain of misery in the happy valley i hope to convince you that you complaint have no real cause you be here in full possession of all that the emperor of abissinium can bestow here be neither labor to be endure nor danger to be dread yet here be all that labor or danger can procure or purchase look round and tell I which of you want be without supply : if you want nothing how be you unhappy that i want nothing say the prince or that i know not what i want be the cause of my complaint if i have any known want i should have a certain wish that wish would excite endeavor and i should not then repine to see the sun move so slowly towards the western mountain or lament when the day break and sleep will no longer hide I from myself when i see the kid and the lamb chase one another i fancy that i should be happy if i have something to pursue but possess all that i can want i find one day and one hour exactly like another except that the latter be still more tedious than the former let you experience inform I how the day may now seem as short as in my childhood while nature be yet fresh and every moment show I what i never have observe before i have already enjoy too much give I something to desire the old man be surprise at this new species of affliction and know not what to reply yet be unwilling to be silent sir say he if you have see the misery of the world you would know how to value you present state now say the prince you have give I something to desire i shall long to see the misery of the world since the sight of they be necessary to happiness chap iv the prince continue to grieve and muse at this time the sound of musick proclaim the hour of repast and the conversation be conclude the old man go away sufficiently discontented to find that he reasoning have produce the only conclusion which they be intend to prevent but in the decline of life shame and grief be of short duration whether it be that we bear easily what we have bear long or that finding ourselves in age less regard we less regard other or that we look with slight regard upon affliction to which we know that the hand of death be about to put a end the prince whose view be extend to a wider space could not speedily quiet he emotion he have be before terrify at the length of life which nature promise he because he consider that in a long time much must be endure he now rejoice in he youth because in many year much might be do this first beam of hope that have be ever dart into he mind rekindle youth in he cheek and double the lustre of he eye he be fire with the desire of do something though he know not yet with distinctness either end or mean he be now no longer gloomy and unsocial but consider himself as master of a secret stock of happiness which he could enjoy only by conceal it he affect to be busy in all scheme of diversion and endeavor to make other pleased with the state of which he himself be weary but pleasure never can be so multiply or continue as not to leave much of life unemployed there be many hour both of the night and day which he could spend without suspicion in solitary think the load of life be much lighten : he go eagerly into the assembly because he suppose the frequency of he presence necessary to the success of he purpose he retire gladly to privacy because he have now a subject of think he chief amusement be to picture to himself that world which he have never see to place himself in various condition to be entangled in imaginary difficulty and to be engage in wild adventure : but he benevolence always terminate he project in the relief of distress the detection of fraud the defeat of oppression and the diffusion of happiness thus pass twenty month of the life of rassela he busy himself so intensely in visionary bustle that he forget he real solitude and amidst hourly preparation for the various incident of human affair neglect to consider by what means he should mingle with mankind one day as he be sit on a bank he feign to himself a orphan virgin rob of she little portion by a treacherous lover and cry after he for restitution and redress so strongly be the image impressed upon he mind that he start up in the maid 's defense and run forward to seize the plunderer with all the eagerness of real pursuit fear naturally quicken the flight of guilt : rassela could not catch the fugitive with he utmost effort but resolve to weary by perseverance he whom he could not surpass in speed he press on till the foot of the mountain stop he course here he recollect himself and smile at he own useless impetuosity then raise he eye to the mountain this say he be the fatal obstacle that hinder at once the enjoyment of pleasure and the exercise of virtue how long be it that my hope and wish have fly beyond this boundary of my life which yet i never have attempt to surmount strike with this reflection he sit down to muse and remember that since he first resolve to escape from he confinement the sun have pass twice over he in he annual course he now feel a degree of regret with which he have never be before acquaint he consider how much might have be do in the time which have pass and leave nothing real behind it he compare twenty month with the life of man in life say he be not to be count the ignorance of infancy or imbecility of age we be long before we be able to think and we soon cease from the power of act the true period of human existence may be reasonably estimate at forty year of which i have muse away the four and twentieth part what i have lose be certain for i have certainly possess it but of twenty month to come who can assure I the consciousness of he own folly pierce he deeply and he be long before he could be reconcile to himself the rest of my time say he have be lose by the crime or folly of my ancestor and the absurd institution of my country i remember it with disgust yet without remorse : but the month that have pass since new light dart into my soul since i form a scheme of reasonable felicity have be squander by my own fault i have lose that which can never be restore : i have see the sun rise and set for twenty month a idle gazer on the light of heaven : in this time the bird have leave the nest of they mother and commit themselves to the wood and to the sky : the kid have forsake the teat and learn by degree to climb the rock in quest of independent sustenance i only have make no advance but be still helpless and ignorant the moon by more than twenty change admonish I of the flux of life the stream that roll before my foot upbraid my inactivity i sit feast on intellectual luxury regardless alike of the example of the earth and the instruction of the planet twenty month be pass who shall restore they these sorrowful meditation fasten upon he mind he pass four month in resolve to lose no more time in idle resolve and be awaken to more vigorous exertion by hear a maid who have break a porcelain cup remark that what can not be repair be not to be regret this be obvious and rassela reproach himself that he have not discover it have not know or not consider how many useful hint be obtain by chance and how often the mind hurry by she own ardor to distant view neglect the truth that lie open before she he for a few hour regret he regret and from that time bent he whole mind upon the means of escape from the valley of happiness chap v the prince meditate he escape he now find that it would be very difficult to effect that which it be very easy to suppose effect when he look round about he he see himself confine by the bar of nature which have never yet be break and by the gate through which none that once have pass it be ever able to return he be now impatient as a eagle in a grate he pass week after week in clamber the mountain to see if there be any aperture which the bush might conceal but find all the summit inaccessible by they prominence the iron gate he despair to open for it be not only secure with all the power of art but be always watch by successive sentinel and be by its position expose to the perpetual observation of all the inhabitant he then examine the cavern through which the water of the lake be discharge and look down at a time when the sun shone strongly upon its mouth he discover it to be full of broken rock which though they permit the stream to flow through many narrow passage would stop any body of solid bulk he return discourage and deject but have now know the blessing of hope resolve never to despair in these fruitless search he spend ten month the time however pass cheerfully away : in the morning he rise with new hope in the evening applaud he own diligence and in the night sleep sound after he fatigue he meet a thousand amusement which beguile he labor and diversified he thought he discern the various instinct of animal and property of plant and find the place replete with wonder of which he purpose to solace himself with the contemplation if he should never be able to accomplish he flight rejoice that he endeavor though yet unsuccessful have supply he with a source of inexhaustible inquiry but he original curiosity be not yet abate he resolve to obtain some knowledge of the way of man he wish still continue but he hope grow less he cease to survey any longer the wall of he prison and spare to search by new toil for interstice which he know could not be find yet determine to keep he design always in view and lay hold on any expedient that time should offer chap vi a dissertation on the art of fly among the artist that have be allure into the happy valley to labor for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitant be a man eminent for he knowledge of the mechanick power who have contrived many engine both of use and recreation by a wheel which the stream turn he force the water into a tower whence it be distribute to all the apartment of the palace he erect a pavilion in the garden around which he keep the air always cool by artificial shower one of the grove appropriate to the lady be ventilate by fan to which the rivulet that run through it give a constant motion and instrument of soft musick be place at proper distance of which some play by the impulse of the wind and some by the power of the stream this artist be sometimes visit by rassela who be please with every kind of knowledge imagine that the time would come when all he acquisition should be of use to he in the open world he come one day to amuse himself in he usual manner and find the master busy in build a sailing chariot : he see that the design be practicable upon a level surface and with expression of great esteem solicit its completion the workman be please to find himself so much regard by the prince and resolve to gain yet higher honor sir say he you have see but a small part of what the mechanick science can perform i have be long of opinion that instead of the tardy conveyance of ship and chariot man might use the swifter migration of wing that the field of air be open to knowledge and that only ignorance and idleness need crawl upon the ground this hint rekindle the prince 's desire of pass the mountain : have see what the mechanist have already perform he be willing to fancy that he could do more yet resolve to inquire further before he suffer hope to afflict he by disappointment i be afraid say he to the artist that you imagination prevail over you skill and that you now tell I rather what you wish than what you know every animal have he element assign he : the bird have the air and man and beast the earth -- so reply the mechanist fish have the water in which yet beast can swim by nature and man by art he that can swim need not despair to fly : to swim be to fly in a grosser fluid and to fly be to swim in a subtler we be only to proportion we power of resistance to the different density of matter through which we be to pass you will be necessarily upborne by the air if you can renew any impulse upon it faster than the air can recede from the pressure but the exercise of swimming say the prince be very laborious the strongest limb be soon wearied i be afraid the act of fly will be yet more violent and wing will be of no great use unless we can fly further than we can swim the labor of rise from the ground say the artist will be great as we see it in the heavier domestick fowl but as we mount higher the earth 's attraction and the body 's gravity will be gradually diminish till we shall arrive at a region where the man will float in the air without any tendency to fall no care will then be necessary but to move forwards which the gentlest impulse will effect you sir whose curiosity be so extensive will easily conceive with what pleasure a philosopher furnish with wing and hover in the sky would see the earth and all its inhabitant roll beneath he and present to he successively by its diurnal motion all the country within the same parallel how must it amuse the pendent spectator to see the move scene of land and ocean city and desert to survey with equal security the mart of trade and the field of battle mountain infested by barbarian and fruitful region gladden by plenty and lull by peace how easily shall we then trace the nile through all its passage pass over to distant region and examine the face of nature from one extremity of the earth to the other all this say the prince be much to be desire but i be afraid that no man will be able to breathe in these region of speculation and tranquillity i have be tell that respiration be difficult upon lofty mountain yet from these precipice though so high as to produce great tenuity of air it be very easy to fall therefore i suspect that from any height where life can be support there may be danger of too quick descent nothing reply the artist will ever be attempt if all possible objection must be first overcome if you will favor my project i will try the first flight at my own hazard i have consider the structure of all volant animal and find the folding continuity of the bat 's wing most easily accommodate to the human form upon this model i shall begin my task tomorrow and in a year expect to tower into the air beyond the malice and pursuit of man but i will work only on this condition that the art shall not be divulge and that you shall not require I to make wing for any but ourselves why say rassela should you envy other so great a advantage all skill ought to be exert for universal good every man have owe much to other and ought to repay the kindness that he have receive if man be all virtuous return the artist i should with great alacrity teach they all to fly but what would be the security of the good if the bad could at pleasure invade they from the sky against a army sailing through the cloud neither wall nor mountain nor sea could afford any security a flight of northern savage might hover in the wind and light at once with irresistible violence upon the capital of a fruitful region that be roll under they even this valley the retreat of prince the abode of happiness might be violate by the sudden descent of some of the naked nation that swarm on the coast of the southern sea the prince promise secrecy and wait for the performance not wholly hopeless of success he visit the work from time to time observe its progress and remark many ingenious contrivance to facilitate motion and unite levity with strength the artist be every day more certain that he should leave vulture and eagle behind he and the contagion of he confidence seize upon the prince in a year the wing be finish and on a morning appoint the maker appear furnished for flight on a little promontory : he wave he pinion awhile to gather air then leap from he stand and in a instant drop into the lake he wing which be of no use in the air sustain he in the water and the prince draw he to land half dead with terror and vexation -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- a -rrb- see rambler no 199 and note chap vii the prince find a man of learn the prince be not much afflict by this disaster have suffer himself to hope for a happier event only because he have no other means of escape in view he still persist in he design to leave the happy valley by the first opportunity he imagination be now at a stand he have no prospect of enter into the world and notwithstanding all he endeavor to support himself discontent by degree prey upon he and he begin again to lose he thought in sadness when the rainy season which in these country be periodical make it inconvenient to wander in the wood the rain continue longer and with more violence than have be ever know : the cloud break on the surround mountain and the torrent stream into the plain on every side till the cavern be too narrow to discharge the water the lake overflow its bank and all the level of the valley be cover with the inundation the eminence on which the palace be build and some other spot of rise ground be all that the eye could now discover the herd and flock leave the pasture and both the wild beast and the tame retreat to the mountain this inundation confine all the prince to domestick amusement and the attention of rassela be particularly seize by a poem which imlac rehearse upon the various condition of humanity he command the poet to attend he in he apartment and recite he verse a second time then enter into familiar talk he think himself happy in have find a man who know the world so well and could so skilfully paint the scene of life he ask a thousand question about thing to which though common to all other mortal he confinement from childhood have keep he a stranger the poet pity he ignorance and love he curiosity and entertain he from day to day with novelty and instruction so that the prince regret the necessity of sleep and long till the morning should renew he pleasure as they be sit together the prince command imlac to relate he history and to tell by what accident he be force or by what motive induce to close he life in the happy valley as he be go to begin he narrative rassela be call to a concert and oblige to restrain he curiosity till the evening chap viii the history of imlac the close of the day be in the region of the torrid zone the only season of diversion and entertainment and it be therefore midnight before the musick cease and the princess retire rassela then call for he companion and require he to begin the story of he life sir say imlac my history will not be long the life that be devote to knowledge pass silently away and be very little diversified by event to talk in publick to think in solitude to read and hear to inquire and answer inquiry be the business of a scholar he wander about the world without pomp or terror and be neither know nor value but by man like himself i be bear in the kingdom of goiama at no great distance from the fountain of the nile my father be a wealthy merchant who trade between the inland country of africk and the port of the red sea he be honest frugal and diligent but of mean sentiment and narrow comprehension he desire only to be rich and to conceal he riches lest he should be spoil by the governor of the province surely say the prince my father must be negligent of he charge if any man in he dominion dare take that which belong to another do he not know that king be accountable for injustice permit as well as do if i be emperor not the meanest of my subject should be oppress with impunity my blood boil when i be tell that a merchant durst not enjoy he honest gain for fear of lose they by the rapacity of power name the governor who rob the people that i may declare he crime to the emperor sir say imlac you ardor be the natural effect of virtue animated by youth : the time will come when you will acquit you father and perhaps hear with less impatience of the governor oppression be in the abissinian dominion neither frequent nor tolerate but no form of government have be yet discover by which cruelty can be wholly prevent subordination suppose power on one part and subjection on the other and if power be in the hand of man it will sometimes be abuse the vigilance of the supreme magistrate may do much but much will still remain undo he can never know all the crime that be commit and can seldom punish all that he know this say the prince i do not understand but i have rather hear thee than dispute continue thy narration my father proceed imlac originally intend that i should have no other education than such as might qualify I for commerce and discover in I great strength of memory and quickness of apprehension often declare he hope that i should be some time the richest man in abissinium why say the prince do thy father desire the increase of he wealth when it be already greater than he dare discover or enjoy i be unwilling to doubt thy veracity yet inconsistency can not both be true inconsistency answer imlac can not both be right but imputed to man they may both be true yet diversity be not inconsistency my father might expect a time of greater security however some desire be necessary to keep life in motion and he whose real want be supply must admit those of fancy this say the prince i can in some measure conceive i repent that i interrupted thee with this hope proceed imlac he send I to school but when i have once find the delight of knowledge and feel the pleasure of intelligence and the pride of invention i begin silently to despise riches and determine to disappoint the purpose of my father whose grossness of conception raise my pity i be twenty year old before he tenderness would expose I to the fatigue of travel in which time i have be instruct by successive master in all the literature of my native country as every hour teach I something new i live in a continual course of gratification but as i advance towards manhood i lose much of the reverence with which i have be use to look on my instructer because when the lesson be end i do not find they wiser or better than common man at length my father resolve to initiate I in commerce and open one of he subterranean treasury count out ten thousand piece of gold this young man say he be the stock with which you must negotiate i begin with less than the fifth part and you see how diligence and parsimony have increase it this be you own to waste or to improve if you squander it by negligence or caprice you must wait for my death before you will be rich : if in four year you double you stock we will thenceforward let subordination cease and live together as friend and partner for he shall always be equal with I who be equally skilled in the art of grow rich we lay we money upon camel conceal in bale of cheap goods and travel to the shore of the red sea when i cast my eye on the expanse of water my heart bound like that of a prisoner escape i feel a unextinguishable curiosity kindle in my mind and resolve to snatch this opportunity of see the manners of other nation and of learn science unknown in abissinium i remember that my father have oblige I to the improvement of my stock not by a promise which i ought not to violate but by a penalty which i be at liberty to incur and therefore determine to gratify my predominant desire and by drink at the fountain of knowledge to quench the thirst of curiosity as i be suppose to trade without connexion with my father it be easy for I to become acquaint with the master of a ship and procure a passage to some other country i have no motive of choice to regulate my voyage it be sufficient for I that wherever i wandered i should see a country which i have not see before i therefore enter a ship bind for surat have leave a letter for my father declare my intention chap ix the history of imlac continue when i first enter upon the world of water and lose sight of land i look round about I with please terror and think my soul enlarged by the boundless prospect imagine that i could gaze round for ever without satiety but in a short time i grow weary of look on barren uniformity where i could only see again what i have already see i then descend into the ship and doubt for awhile whether all my future pleasure would not end like this in disgust and disappointment yet surely say i the ocean and the land be very different the only variety of water be rest and motion but the earth have mountain and valley desert and city it be inhabit by man of different custom and contrary opinion and i may hope to find variety in life though i should miss it in nature with this thought i quiet my mind and amuse myself during the voyage sometimes by learn from the sailor the art of navigation which i have never practice and sometimes by form scheme for my conduct in different situation in not one of which i have be ever place i be almost weary of my naval amusement when we land safely at surat i secure my money and purchase some commodity for show join myself to a caravan that be pass into the inland country my companion for some reason or other conjecture that i be rich and by my inquiry and admiration finding that i be ignorant consider I as a novice whom they have a right to cheat and who be to learn at the usual expense the art of fraud they expose I to the theft of servant and the exaction of officer and see I plunder upon false pretence without any advantage to themselves but that of rejoice in the superiority of they own knowledge stop a moment say the prince be there such depravity in man as that he should injure another without benefit to himself i can easily conceive that all be pleased with superiority : but you ignorance be merely accidental which be neither you crime nor you folly could afford they no reason to applaud themselves and the knowledge which they have and which you want they might as effectually have show by warn as betray you pride say imlac be seldom delicate it will please itself with very mean advantage and envy feel not its own happiness but when it may be compare with the misery of other they be my enemy because they grieve to think I rich and my oppressor because they delight to find I weak proceed say the prince : i do not doubt of the fact which you relate but imagine that you impute they to mistaken motive in this company say imlac i arrive at agra the capital of indostan the city in which the great mogul commonly reside i apply myself to the language of the country and in a few month be able to converse with the learn man some of whom i find morose and reserve and other easy and communicative some be unwilling to teach another what they have with difficulty learn themselves and some show that the end of they study be to gain the dignity of instruct to the tutor of the young prince i recommend myself so much that i be present to the emperor as a man of uncommon knowledge the emperor ask I many question concern my country and my travels and though i can not now recollect any thing that he utter above the power of a common man he dismiss I astonish at he wisdom and enamoured of he goodness my credit be now so high that the merchant with whom i have travel apply to I for recommendation to the lady of the court i be surprise at they confidence of solicitation and gently reproach they with they practice on the road they hear I with cold indifference and show no token of shame or sorrow they then urge they request with the offer of a bribe but what i would not do for kindness i would not do for money and refuse they not because they have injure I but because i would not enable they to injure other for i know they would have make use of my credit to cheat those who should buy they wares have reside at agra till there be no more to be learn i travel into persium where i see many remains of ancient magnificence and observe many new accommodation of life the persian be a nation eminently social and they assembly afford I daily opportunity of remark character and manners and of trace human nature through all its variation from persium i pass into arabium where i see a nation at once pastoral and warlike who live without any settle habitation whose only wealth be they flock and herd and who have yet carry on through all age a hereditary war with all mankind though they neither covet nor envy they possession chap x imlac 's history continue a dissertation upon poetry wherever i go i find that poetry be consider as the highest learning and regard with a veneration somewhat approach to that which man would pay to the angelick nature and yet it fill I with wonder that in almost all country the most ancient poet be consider as the best : whether it be that every other kind of knowledge be a acquisition gradually attain and poetry be a gift confer at once or that the first poetry of every nation surprise they as a novelty and retain the credit by consent which it receive by accident at first : or whether as the province of poetry be to describe nature and passion which be always the same the first writer take possession of the most striking object for description and the most probable occurrence for fiction and leave nothing to those that follow they but transcription of the same event and new combination of the same image whatever be the reason it be commonly observe that the early writer be in possession of nature and they follower of art : that the first excel in strength and invention and the latter in elegance and refinement i be desirous to add my name to this illustrious fraternity i read all the poet of persium and arabium and be able to repeat by memory the volume that be suspend in the mosque of mecca but i soon find that no man be ever great by imitation my desire of excellence impel I to transfer my attention to nature and to life nature be to be my subject and man to be my auditor : i could never describe what i have not see i could not hope to move those with delight or terror whose interest and opinion i do not understand be now resolve to be a poet i see every thing with a new purpose my sphere of attention be suddenly magnify : no kind of knowledge be to be overlook i range mountain and desert for image and resemblance and picture upon my mind every tree of the forest and flower of the valley i observe with equal care the crag of the rock and the pinnacle of the palace sometimes i wander along the maze of the rivulet and sometimes watch the change of the summer cloud to a poet nothing can be useless whatever be beautiful and whatever be dreadful must be familiar to he imagination : he must be conversant with all that be awfully vast or elegantly little the plant of the garden the animal of the wood the mineral of the earth and meteor of the sky must all concur to store he mind with inexhaustible variety for every idea be useful for the enforcement or decoration of moral or religious truth and he who know most will have most power of diversify he scene and of gratify he reader with remote allusion and unexpected instruction all the appearance of nature i be therefore careful to study and every country which i have survey have contribute something to my poetical power in so wide a survey say the prince you must surely have leave much unobserved i have live till now within the circuit of these mountain and yet can not walk abroad without the sight of something which i have never behold before or never heed the business of a poet say imlac be to examine not the individual but the species to remark general property and large appearance : he do not number the streak of the tulip or describe the different shades in the verdure of the forest he be to exhibit in he portrait of nature such prominent and striking feature as recall the original to every mind and must neglect the minuter discrimination which one may have remark and another have neglect for those characteristick which be alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness but the knowledge of nature be only half the task of a poet he must be acquaint likewise with all the mode of life he character require that he estimate the happiness and misery of every condition observe the power of all the passion in all they combination and trace the change of the human mind as they be modify by various institution and accidental influence of climate or custom from the sprightliness of infancy to the despondence of decrepitude he must divest himself of the prejudice of he age or country he must consider right and wrong in they abstracted and invariable state he must disregard present law and opinion and rise to general and transcendental truth which will always be the same he must therefore content himself with the slow progress of he name contemn the applause of he own time and commit he claim to the justice of posterity he must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind and consider himself as preside over the thought and manners of future generation as a be superior to time and place he labor be not yet at a end : he must know many language and many science and that he style may be worthy of he thought must by incessant practice familiarize to himself every delicacy of speech and grace of harmony chap xi imlac 's narrative continue a hint on pilgrimage imlac now feel the enthusiastick fit and be proceed to aggrandize he own profession when the prince cry out : enough thou hast convinced I that no human being can ever be a poet proceed with thy narration to be a poet say imlac be indeed very difficult so difficult return the prince that i will at present hear no more of he labor tell I whither you go when you have see persium from persium say the poet i travel through syrium and for three year reside in palestine where i converse with great number of the northern and western nation of europe the nation which be now in possession of all power and all knowledge whose army be irresistible and whose fleet command the remotest part of the globe when i compare these man with the native of we own kingdom and those that surround we they appear almost another order of being in they country it be difficult to wish for any thing that may not be obtain : a thousand art of which we never hear be continually labor for they convenience and pleasure and whatever they own climate have deny they be supply by they commerce by what mean say the prince be the european thus powerful or why since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest can not the asiatick and african invade they coast plant colony in they port and give law to they natural prince the same wind that carry they back would bring we thither they be more powerful sir than we answer imlac because they be wiser knowledge will always predominate over ignorance as man govern the other animal but why they knowledge be more than ours i know not what reason can be give but the unsearchable will of the supreme be when say the prince with a sigh shall i be able to visit palestine and mingle with this mighty confluence of nation till that happy moment shall arrive let I fill up the time with such representation as thou canst give I i be not ignorant of the motive that assemble such number in that place and can not but consider it as the center of wisdom and piety to which the best and wisest man of every land must be continually resorting there be some nation say imlac that send few visitant to palestine for many numerous and learn sect in europe concur to censure pilgrimage as superstitious or deride it as ridiculous you know say the prince how little my life have make I acquaint with

superstitious accord to the principle upon which it be perform long journey in search of truth be not command truth such as be necessary to the regulation of life be always find where it be honestly seek change of place be no natural cause of the increase of piety for it inevitably produce dissipation of mind yet since man go every day to view the field where great action have be perform and return with stronger impression of the event curiosity of the same kind may naturally dispose we to view that country whence we religion have its beginning and i believe no man survey those awful

distress to estimate the comparative happiness of other knowledge be certainly one of the means of pleasure as be confess by the natural desire which every mind feel of increase its idea ignorance be mere privation by which nothing can be produce it be a vacuity in which the soul sit motionless and torpid for want of attraction and without know why we always rejoice when we learn and grieve when we forget i be therefore incline to conclude that if nothing counteract the natural consequence of learn we grow more happy as we mind take a wider range in enumerate the particular comfort of life we shall find many advantage on the side of the european they cure wound and disease with which we languish and perish we suffer inclemency of weather which they can obviate they have engine for the

remove all publick inconveniency : they have road cut through they mountain and bridge lay upon they river and if we descend to the privacy of life they habitation be more commodious and they possession be more secure they be surely happy say the prince who have all these conveniency of which i envy none so much as the facility with which separated friend interchange they thought the european answer imlac be less unhappy than we but they be not happy human life be everywhere a state in which much be to be endure and little to be enjoy -lrb- a -rrb- see idler no 33 and note : and

travels in greece egypt and the holy land part ii sect i 8vo ed vol iv p 288 -- ed chap xii the story of imlac continue i be not yet willing say the prince to suppose that happiness be so parsimoniously distribute to mortal nor can believe but that if i have the choice of life i should be able to fill every day with pleasure i would injure no man and should provoke no resentment : i would relieve every distress and should enjoy the benediction of gratitude i would choose my friend among the wise and my wife among the virtuous and therefore should be in no danger from treachery or unkindness my child should by my care be learn and pious and would repay to my age what they childhood have receive what would dare to molest he who might call on every side to thousand enrich by he bounty or assist by he power and why should not life glide quietly away in the soft reciprocation of protection and reverence all this may be do without the help of european refinement which appear by they effect to be rather specious than useful let we leave they and pursue we journey from palestine say imlac i pass through many region of asia in the more civilized kingdom as a trader and among the barbarian of the mountain as a pilgrim at last i begin to long for my native country that i might repose after my travels and fatigue in the place where i have spend my earliest year and gladden my old companion with the recital of my adventure often do i figure to myself those with whom i have sport away the gay hour of dawn life sit round I in its evening wonder at my tale and listen to my counsel when this thought have take possession of my mind i consider every moment as waste which do not bring I nearer to abissinium i hasten into egypt and notwithstanding my impatience be detain ten month in the contemplation of its ancient magnificence and in inquiry after the remains of its ancient learning i find in cairo a mixture of all nation some bring thither by the love of knowledge some by the hope of gain and many by the desire of live after they own manner without observation and of lie hide in the obscurity of multitude : for in a city populous as cairo it be possible to obtain at the same time the gratification of society and the secrecy of solitude from cairo i travel to suez and embark on the red sea pass along the coast till i arrive at the port from which i have depart twenty year before here i join myself to a caravan and reenter my native country i now expect the caress of my kinsman and the congratulation of my friend and be not without hope that my father whatever value he have set upon riches would own with gladness and pride a son who be able to add to the felicity and honor of the nation but i be soon convince that my thought be vain my father have be dead fourteen year have divide he wealth among my brother who be remove to some other province of my companion the greater part be in the grave of the rest some could with difficulty remember I and some consider I as one corrupt by foreign manners a man use to vicissitude be not easily deject i forget after a time my disappointment and endeavor to recommend myself to the noble of the kingdom they admit I to they table hear my story and dismiss I i open a school and be prohibit to teach i then resolve to sit down in the quiet of domestick life and address a lady that be fond of my conversation but reject my suit because my father be a merchant weary at last with solicitation and repulse i resolve to hide myself for ever from the world and depend no longer on the opinion or caprice of other i wait for the time when the gate of the happy valley should open that i might bid farewell to hope and fear : the day come my performance be distinguish with favor and i resign myself with joy to perpetual confinement hast thou here find happiness at last say rassela tell I without reserve art thou content with thy condition or dost thou wish to be again wander and inquire all the inhabitant of this valley celebrate they lot and at the annual visit of the emperor invite other to partake of they felicity great prince say imlac i shall speak the truth i know not one of all you attendant who do not lament the hour when he enter this retreat i be less unhappy than the rest because i have a mind replete with image which i can vary and combine at pleasure i can amuse my solitude by the renovation of the knowledge which begin to fade from my memory and by recollection of the accident of my past life yet all this end in the sorrowful consideration that my acquirement be now useless and that none of my pleasure can be again enjoy the rest whose mind have no impression but of the present moment be either corrode by malignant passion or sit stupid in the gloom of perpetual vacancy what passion can infest those say the prince who have no rival we be in a place where impotence preclude malice and where all envy be repress by community of enjoyment there may be community say imlac of material possession but there can never be community of love or of esteem it must happen that one will please more than another he that know himself despise will always be envious and still more envious and malevolent if he be condemn to live in the presence of those who despise he the invitation by which they allure other to a state which they feel to be wretched proceed from the natural malignity of hopeless misery they be weary of themselves and of each other and expect to find relief in new companion they envy the liberty which they folly have forfeit and would gladly see all mankind imprison like themselves from this crime however i be wholly free no man can say that he be wretched by my persuasion i look with pity on the crowd who be annually solicit admission to captivity and wish that it be lawful for I to warn they of they danger my dear imlac say the prince i will open to thee my whole heart i have long meditate a escape from the happy valley i have examine the mountain on every side but find myself insuperably bar : teach I the way to break my prison thou shalt be the companion of my flight the guide of my ramble the partner of my fortune and my sole director in the choice of life sir answer the poet you escape will be difficult and perhaps you may soon repent you curiosity the world which you figure to yourself smooth and quiet as the lake in the valley you will find a sea foam with tempest and boil with whirlpool you will be sometimes overwhelm by the wave of violence and sometimes dash against the rock of treachery amidst wrong and fraud competition and anxiety you will wish a thousand time for these seat of quiet and willingly quit hope to be free from fear do not seek to deter I from my purpose say the prince : i be impatient to see what thou hast see and since thou art thyself weary of the valley it be evident that thy former state be better than this whatever be the consequence of my experiment i be resolve to judge with mine own eye of the various condition of man and then to make deliberately my choice of life i be afraid say imlac you be hinder by stronger restraint than my persuasion yet if you determination be fix i do not counsel you to despair few thing be impossible to diligence and skill chap xiii rassela discover the means of escape the prince now dismiss he favorite to rest but the narrative of wonder and novelty fill he mind with perturbation he revolve all that he have hear and prepare innumerable question for the morning much of he uneasiness be now remove he have a friend to whom he could impart he thought and whose experience could assist he in he design he heart be no longer condemn to swell with silent vexation he think that even the happy valley might be endure with such a companion and that if they could range the world together he should have nothing further to desire in a few day the water be discharge and the ground dry the prince and imlac then walk out together to converse without the notice of the rest the prince whose thought be always on the wing as he pass by the gate say with a countenance of sorrow why art thou so strong and why be man so weak man be not weak answer he companion knowledge be more than equivalent to force the master of mechanick laugh at strength i can burst the gate but can not do it secretly some other expedient must be try as they be walk on the side of the mountain they observe that the cony which the rain have drive from they burrow have take shelter among the bush and form hole behind they tend upward in a oblique line it have be the opinion of antiquity say imlac that human reason borrow many art from the instinct of animal let we therefore not think ourselves degrade by learn from the cony we may escape by pierce the mountain in the same direction we will begin where the summit hang over the middle part and labor upward till we shall issue up beyond the prominence the eye of the prince when he hear this proposal sparkle with joy the execution be easy and the success certain no time be now lose they hasten early in the morning to choose a place proper for they mine they clamber with great fatigue among crag and bramble and return without have discover any part that favor they design the second and the third day be spend in the same manner and with the same frustration but on the fourth they find a small cavern conceal by a thicket where they resolve to make they experiment imlac procure instrument proper to hew stone and remove earth and they fall to they work on the next day with more eagerness than vigor they be presently exhaust by they effort and sit down to pant upon the grass the prince for a moment appear to be discourage sir say he companion practice will enable we to continue we labor for a longer time mark however how far we have advance and you will find that we toil will sometime have a end great work be perform not by strength but perseverance : yonder palace be raise by single stone yet you see its height and spaciousness he that shall walk with vigor three hour a day will pass in seven year a space equal to the circumference of the globe they return to they work day after day and in a short time find a fissure in the rock which enable they to pass far with very little obstruction this rassela consider as a good omen do not disturb you mind say imlac with other hope or fear than reason may suggest if you be pleased with prognostick of good you will be terrify likewise with token of evil and you whole life will be a prey to superstition whatever facilitate we work be more than a omen it be a cause of success this be one of those please surprise which often happen to active resolution many tiling difficult to design prove easy to performance chap xiv rassela and imlac receive a unexpected visit they have now work they way to the middle and solace they toil with the approach of liberty when the prince come down to refresh himself with air find he sister nekayah standing before the mouth of the cavity he start and stand confused afraid to tell he design yet hopeless to conceal it a few moment determine he to repose on she fidelity and secure she secrecy by a declaration without reserve do not imagine say the princess that i come hither as a spy : i have long observe from my window that you and imlac direct you walk every day towards the same point but i do not suppose you have any better reason for the preference than a cooler shade or more fragrant bank nor follow you with any other design than to partake of you conversation since then not suspicion but fondness have detect you let I not lose the advantage of my discovery i be equally weary of confinement with yourself and not less desirous of know what be do or suffer in the world permit I to fly with you from this tasteless tranquillity which will yet grow more loathsome when you have leave I you may deny I to accompany you but can not hinder I from follow the prince who love nekayah above he other sister have no inclination to refuse she request and grieve that he have lose a opportunity of show he confidence by a voluntary communication it be therefore agree that she should leave the valley with they and that in the mean time she should watch lest any other straggler should by chance or curiosity follow they to the mountain at length they labor be at a end they see light beyond the prominence and issue to the top of the mountain behold the nile yet a narrow current wander beneath they the prince look round with rapture anticipate all the pleasure of travel and in thought be already transport beyond he father 's dominion imlac though very joyful at he escape have less expectation of pleasure in the world which he have before try and of which he have be weary rassela be so much delighted with a wider horizon that he could not soon be persuade to return into the valley he inform he sister that the way be open and that nothing now remain but to prepare for they departure chap xv the prince and princess leave the valley and see many wonder the prince and princess have jewel sufficient to make they rich whenever they come into a place of commerce which by imlac 's direction they hide in they clothes and on the night of the next full moon all leave the valley the princess be follow only by a single favorite who do not know whither she be go they clamber through the cavity and begin to go down on the other side the princess and she maid turn they eye towards every part and see nothing to bind they prospect consider themselves as in danger of be lose in a dreary vacuity they stop and tremble i be almost afraid say the princess to begin a journey of which i can not perceive a end and to venture into this immense plain where i may be approach on every side by man whom i never see the prince feel nearly the same emotion though he think it more manly to conceal they imlac smile at they terror and encourage they to proceed but the princess continue irresolute till she have be imperceptibly draw forward too far to return in the morning they find some shepherd in the field who set milk and fruit before they the princess wonder that she do not see a palace ready for she reception and a table spread with delicacy but be faint and hungry she drink the milk and eat the fruit and think they of a higher flavor than the produce of the valley they travel forward by easy journey be all unaccustomed to toil or difficulty and know that though they might be miss they could not be pursue in a few day they come into a more populous region where imlac be divert with the admiration which he companion express at the diversity of manners station and employment they dress be such as might not bring upon they the suspicion of have any thing to conceal yet the prince wherever he come expect to be obey and the princess be frightened because those that come into she presence do not prostrate themselves before she imlac be force to observe they with great vigilance lest they should betray they rank by they unusual behavior and detain they several week in the first village to accustom they to the sight of common mortal by degree the royal wanderer be teach to understand that they have for a time lay aside they dignity and be to expect only such regard as liberality and courtesy could procure and imlac have by many admonition prepare they to endure the tumult of a port and the ruggedness of the commercial race bring they down to the seacoast the prince and he sister to whom every thing be new be gratify equally at all place and therefore remain for some month at the port without any inclination to pass further imlac be content with they stay because he do not think it safe to expose they unpractised in the world to the hazard of a foreign country at last he begin to fear lest they should be discover and propose to fix a day for they departure they have no pretension to judge for themselves and refer the whole scheme to he direction he therefore take passage in a ship to suez and when the time come with great difficulty prevail on the princess to enter the vessel they have a quick and prosperous voyage and from suez travel by land to cairo chap xvi they enter cairo and find every man happy as they approach the city which fill the stranger with astonishment this say imlac to the prince be the place where traveller and merchant assemble from all the corner of the earth you will here find man of every character and every occupation commerce be here honorable : i will act as a merchant and you shall live as stranger who have no other end of travel than curiosity it will soon be observe that we be rich we reputation will procure we access to all whom we shall desire to know you will see all the condition of humanity and enable yourself at leisure to make you choice of life they now enter the town stun by the noise and offend by the crowd instruction have not yet so prevail over habit but that they wonder to see themselves pass undistinguished along the street and meet by the lowest of the people without reverence or notice the princess could not at first bear the thought of be level with the vulgar and for some day continue in she chamber where she be serve by she favorite pekuah as in the palace of the valley imlac who understand traffick sell part of the jewel the next day and hire a house which he adorn with such magnificence that he be immediately consider as a merchant of great wealth he politeness attract many acquaintance and he generosity make he court by many dependant he table be crowd by man of every nation who all admire he knowledge and solicit he favor he companion not be able to mix in the conversation could make no discovery of they ignorance or surprise and be gradually initiate in the world as they gain knowledge of the language the prince have by frequent lecture be teach the use and nature of money but the lady could not for a long time comprehend what the merchant do with small piece of gold and silver or why thing of so little use should be receive as equivalent to the necessaries of life they study the language two year while imlac be prepare to set before they the various rank and condition of mankind he grow acquaint with all who have any thing uncommon in they fortune or conduct he frequent the voluptuous and the frugal the idle and the busy the merchant and the man of learn the prince be now able to converse with fluency and have learn the caution necessary to be observe in he intercourse with stranger begin to accompany imlac to place of resort and to enter into all assembly that he might make he choice of life for some time he think choice needless because all appear to he equally happy wherever he go he meet gaiety and kindness and hear the song of joy or the laugh of carelessness he begin to believe that the world overflow with universal plenty and that nothing be withhold either from want or merit that every hand shower liberality and every heart melt with benevolence and who then say he will be suffer to be wretched imlac permit the pleasing delusion and be unwilling to crush the hope of inexperience till one day have sit awhile silent i know not say the prince what can be the reason that i be more unhappy than any of we friend i see they perpetually and unalterably cheerful but feel my own mind restless and uneasy i be unsatisfied with those pleasure which i seem most to court i live in the crowd of jollity not so much to enjoy company as to shun myself and be only loud and merry to conceal my sadness every man say imlac may by examine he own mind guess what pass in the mind of other : when you feel that you own gaiety be counterfeit it may justly lead you to suspect that of you companion not to be sincere envy be commonly reciprocal we be long before we be convince that happiness be never to be find and each believe it possess by other to keep alive the hope of obtain it for himself in the assembly where you pass the last night there appear such sprightliness of air and volatility of fancy as might have suit being of a higher order form to inhabit serener region inaccessible to care or sorrow yet believe I prince there be not one who do not dread the moment when solitude should deliver he to the tyranny of reflection this say the prince may be true of other since it be true of I yet whatever be the general infelicity of man one condition be more happy than another and wisdom surely direct we to take the least evil in the choice of life the cause of good and evil answer imlac be so various and uncertain so often entangled with each other so diversify by various relation and so much subject to accident which can not be foresee that he who would fix he condition upon incontestable reason of preference must live and die inquire and deliberate but surely say rassela the wise man to whom we listen with reverence and wonder choose that mode of life for themselves which they think most likely to make they happy very few say the poet live by choice every man be place in he present condition by cause which act without he foresight and with which he do not always willingly cooperate and therefore you will rarely meet one who do not think the lot of he neighbor better than he own i be pleased to think say the prince that my birth have give I at least one advantage over other by enable I to determine for myself i have here the world before I i will review it at leisure : surely happiness be somewhere to be find chap xvii the prince associate with young man of spirit and gaiety rassela rise next day and resolve to begin he experiment upon life youth cry he be the time of gladness : i will join myself to the young man whose only business be to gratify they desire and whose time be all spend in a succession of enjoyment to such society he be readily admit but a few day bring he back weary and disgusted they mirth be without image they laughter without motive they pleasure be gross and sensual in which the mind have no part they conduct be at once wild and mean they laugh at order and at law but the frown of power dejected and the eye of wisdom abashed they the prince soon conclude that he should never be happy in a course of life of which he be ashamed he think it unsuitable to a reasonable be to act without a plan and to be sad or cheerful only by chance happiness say he must be something solid and permanent without fear and without uncertainty but he young companion have gain so much of he regard by they frankness and courtesy that he could not leave they without warn and remonstrance my friend say he i have seriously consider we manners and we prospects and find that we have mistake we own interest the first year of man must make provision for the last he that never think never can be wise perpetual levity must end in ignorance and intemperance though it may fire the spirit for a hour will make life short or miserable let we consider that youth be of no long duration and that in maturer age when the enchantment of fancy shall cease and phantom of delight dance no more about we we shall have no comfort but the esteem of wise man and the means of do good let we therefore stop while to stop be in we power : let we live as man who be sometime to grow old and to whom it will be the most dreadful of all evil to count they past year by folly and to be remind of they former luxuriance of health only by the malady which riot have produce they stare awhile in silence one upon another and at last drive he away by a general chorus of continued laughter the consciousness that he sentiment be just and he intention kind be scarcely sufficient to support he against the horror of derision but he recover he tranquillity and pursue he search chap xviii the prince find a wise and happy man as he be one day walk in the street he see a spacious building which all be by the open door invite to enter : he follow the stream of people and find it a hall or school of declamation in which professor read lecture to they auditory he fix he eye upon a sage raise above the rest who discourse with great energy on the government of the passion he look be venerable he action graceful he pronunciation clear and he diction elegant he show with great strength of sentiment and variety of illustration that human nature be degrade and debase when the lower faculty predominate over the higher that when fancy the parent of passion usurp the dominion of the mind nothing ensue but the natural effect of unlawful government perturbation and confusion that she betray the fortress of the intellect to rebel and excite she child to sedition against reason they lawful sovereign he compare reason to the sun of which the light be constant uniform and lasting and fancy to a meteor of bright but transitory lustre irregular in its motion and delusive in its direction he then communicate the various precept give from time to time for the conquest of passion and display the happiness of those who have obtain the important victory after which man be no longer the slave of fear nor the fool of hope be no more emaciate by envy inflamed by anger emasculate by tenderness or depress by grief but walk on calmly through the tumult or privacy of life as the sun pursue alike he course through the calm or the stormy sky he enumerate many example of hero immovable by pain or pleasure who look with indifference on those mode or accident to which the vulgar give the name of good and evil he exhort he hearer to lay aside they prejudice and arm themselves against the shaft of malice or misfortune by invulnerable patience conclude that this state only be happiness and that this happiness be in every one 's power rassela listen to he with the veneration due to the instruction of a superior being and wait for he at the door humbly implore the liberty of visit so great a master of true wisdom the lecturer hesitate a moment when rassela put a purse of gold into he hand which he receive with a mixture of joy and wonder i have find say the prince at he return to imlac a man who can teach all that be necessary to be know who from the unshaken throne of rational fortitude look down on the scene of life change beneath he he speak and attention watch he lip he reason and conviction close he period this man shall be my future guide : i will learn he doctrine and imitate he life be not too hasty say imlac to trust or to admire the teacher of morality : they discourse like angel but they live like man rassela who could not conceive how any man could reason so forcibly without feel the cogency of he own argument pay he visit in a few day and be deny admission he have now learn the power of money and make he way by a piece of gold to the inner apartment where he find the philosopher in a room half-darkened with he eye misty and he face pale sir say he you be come at a time when all human friendship be useless what i suffer can not be remedy what i have lose can not be supply my daughter my only daughter from whose tenderness i expect all the comfort of my age die last night of a fever my view my purpose my hope be at a end : i be now a lonely be disunite from society sir say the prince mortality be a event by which a wise man can never be surprise : we know that death be always near and it should therefore always be expect young man answer the philosopher you speak like one that have never feel the pang of separation have you then forget the precept say rassela which you so powerfully enforce have wisdom no strength to arm the heart against calamity consider that external thing be naturally variable but truth and reason be always the same what comfort say the mourner can truth and reason afford I of what effect be they now but to tell I that my daughter will not be restore the prince whose humanity would not suffer he to insult misery with reproof go away convince of the emptiness of rhetorical sound and the inefficacy of polished period and study sentence chap xix a glimpse of pastoral life he be still eager upon the same inquiry : and have hear of a hermit that live near the lowest cataract of the nile and fill the whole country with the fame of he sanctity resolve to visit he retreat and inquire whether that felicity which publick life could not afford be to be find in solitude and whether a man whose age and virtue make he venerable could teach any peculiar art of shun evil or endure they imlac and the princess agree to accompany he and after the necessary preparation they begin they journey they way lay through the field where shepherd tend they flock and the lamb be play upon the pasture this say the poet be the life which have be often celebrate for its innocence and quiet let we pass the heat of the day among the shepherd ' tent and know whether all we search be not to terminate in pastoral simplicity the proposal please they and they induce the shepherd by small present and familiar question to tell they opinion of they own state : they be so rude and ignorant so little able to compare the good with the evil of the occupation and so indistinct in they narrative and description that very little could be learn from they but it be evident that they heart be canker with discontent that they consider themselves as condemn to labor for the luxury of the rich and look up with stupid malevolence toward those that be place above they the princess pronounce with vehemence that she would never suffer these envious savage to be she companion and that she should not soon be desirous of see any more specimen of rustick happiness but could not believe that all the account of primeval pleasure be fabulous and be yet in doubt whether life have any thing that could be justly prefer to the placid gratification of field and wood she hope that the time would come when with a few virtuous and elegant companion she should gather flower plant by she own hand fondle the lamb of she own ewe and listen without care among brook and breeze to one of she maiden read in the shade chap xx the danger of prosperity on the next day they continue they journey till the heat compel they to look round for shelter at a small distance they see a thick wood which they no sooner enter than they perceive that they be approach the habitation of man the shrub be diligently cut away to open walk where the shades be darkest the bough of opposite tree be artificially interwoven seat of flowery turf be raise in vacant space and a rivulet that wanton along the side of a wind path have its bank sometimes open into small basin and its stream sometimes obstruct by little mound of stone heap together to increase its murmur they pass slowly through the wood delighted with such unexpected accommodation and entertain each other with conjecture what or who he could be that in those rude and unfrequented region have leisure and art for such harmless luxury as they advance they hear the sound of musick and see youth and virgin dancing in the grove and go still further behold a stately palace build upon a hill surround with wood the law of eastern hospitality allow they to enter and the master welcome they like a man liberal and wealthy he be skilful enough in appearance soon to discern that they be no common guest and spread he table with magnificence the eloquence of imlac catch he attention and the lofty courtesy of the princess excite he respect when they offer to depart he entreat they stay and be the next day still more unwilling to dismiss they than before they be easily persuade to stop and civility grow up in time to freedom and confidence the prince now see all the domestick cheerful and all the face of nature smile round the place and could not forbear to hope that he should find here what he be seek but when he be congratulating the master upon he possession he answer with a sigh : my condition have indeed the appearance of happiness but appearance be delusive my prosperity put my life in danger the bassa of egypt be my enemy incense only by my wealth and popularity i have be hitherto protect against he by the prince of the country but as the favor of the great be uncertain i know not how soon my defender may be persuade to share the plunder with the bassa i have send my treasure into a distant country and upon the first alarm be prepare to follow they then will my enemy riot in my mansion and enjoy the garden which i have plant they all join in lament he danger and deprecate he exile and the princess be so much disturb with the tumult of grief and indignation that she retire to she apartment they continue with they kind inviter a few day longer and then go forward to find the hermit chap xxi the happiness of solitude the hermit 's history they come on the third day by the direction of the peasant to the hermit 's cell : it be a cavern in the side of a mountain over-shadow with palm-tree at such a distance from the cataract that nothing more be hear than a gentle uniform murmur such as compose the mind to pensive meditation especially when it be assist by the wind whistle among the branch the first rude essay of nature have be so much improve by human labor that the cave contain several apartment appropriate to different use and often afford lodging to traveller whom darkness or tempest happen to overtake the hermit sit on a bench at the door to enjoy the coolness of the evening on one side lay a book with pen and papers on the other mechanical instrument of various kind as they approach he unregard the princess observe that he have not the countenance of a man that have find or could teach the way to happiness they salute he with great respect which he repay like a man not unaccustomed to the form of court my child say he if you have lose you way you shall be willingly supply with such conveniency for the night as this cavern will afford i have all that nature require and you will not expect delicacy in a hermit 's cell they thank he and enter be please with the neatness and regularity of the place the hermit set flesh and wine before they though he feed only upon fruit and water he discourse be cheerful without levity and pious without enthusiasm he soon gain the esteem of he guest and the princess repent of she hasty censure at last imlac begin thus : i do not now wonder that you reputation be so far extend we have hear at cairo of you wisdom and come hither to implore you direction for this young man and maiden in the choice of life to he that live well answer the hermit every form of life be good nor can i give any other rule for choice than to remove from all apparent evil he will remove most certainly from evil say the prince who shall devote himself to that solitude which you have recommend by you example i have indeed live fifteen year in solitude say the hermit but have no desire that my example should gain any imitator in my youth i profess arm and be raise by degree to the highest military rank i have traverse wide country at the head of my troops and see many battle and siege at last be disgust by the preferment of a younger officer and feeling that my vigor be begin to decay i be resolve to close my life in peace have find the world full of snare discord and misery i have once escape from the pursuit of the enemy by the shelter of this cavern and therefore choose it for my final residence i employ artificer to form it into chamber and store it with all that i be likely to want for some time after my retreat i rejoice like a tempest-beaten sailor at he entrance into the harbor be delight with the sudden change of the noise and hurry of war to stillness and repose when the pleasure of novelty go away i employ my hour in examine the plant which grow in the valley and the mineral which i collect from the rock but that inquiry be now grow tasteless and irksome i have be for some time unsettled and distract my mind be disturb with a thousand perplexity of doubt and vanity of imagination which hourly prevail upon I because i have no opportunity of relaxation or diversion i be sometimes ashamed to think that i could not secure myself from vice but by retire from the exercise of virtue and begin to suspect that i be rather impel by resentment than lead by devotion into solitude my fancy riot in scene of folly and i lament that i have lose so much and have gain so little in solitude if i escape the example of bad man i want likewise the counsel and conversation of the good i have be long compare the evil with the advantage of society and resolve to return into the world to-morrow the life of a solitary man will be certainly miserable but not certainly devout they hear he resolution with surprise but after a short pause offer to conduct he to cairo he dig up a considerable treasure which he have hide among the rock and accompany they to the city on which as he approach it he gaze with rapture chap xxii the happiness of a life lead accord to nature rassela go often to a assembly of learn man who meet at stated time to unbend they mind and compare they opinion they manners be somewhat coarse but they conversation be instructive and they disputation acute though sometimes too violent and often continue till neither controvertist remember upon what question they begin some fault be almost general among they every one be desirous to dictate to the rest and every one be please to hear the genius or knowledge of another depreciate in this assembly rassela be relate he interview with the hermit and the wonder with which he hear he censure a course of life which he have so deliberately choose and so laudably follow the sentiment of the hearer be various some be of opinion that the folly of he choice have be justly punish by condemnation to perpetual perseverance one of the youngest among they with great vehemence pronounce he a hypocrite some talk of the right of society to the labor of individual and consider retirement as a desertion of duty other readily allow that there be a time when the claim of the publick be satisfied and when a man might properly sequester himself to review he life and purify he heart one who appear more affect with the narrative than the rest think it likely that the hermit would in a few year go back to he retreat and perhaps if shame do not restrain or death intercept he return once more from he retreat into the world : for the hope of happiness say he be so strongly impressed that the longest experience be not able to efface it of the present state whatever it may be we feel and be force to confess the misery yet when the same state be again at a distance imagination paint it as desirable but the time will surely come when desire will be no longer we torment and no man shall be wretched but by he own fault this say a philosopher who have hear he with token of great impatience be the present condition of a wise man the time be already come when none be wretched but by they own fault nothing be more idle than to inquire after happiness which nature have kindly place within we reach the way to be happy be to live accord to nature in obedience to that universal and unalterable law with which every heart be originally impressed which be not write on it by precept but engraven by destiny not instil by education but infuse at we nativity he that live accord to nature will suffer nothing from the delusion of hope or importunity of desire he will receive and reject with equability of temper and act or suffer as the reason of thing shall alternately prescribe other man may amuse themselves with subtile definition or intricate ratiocination let they learn to be wise by easier mean let they observe the hind of the forest and the linnet of the grove let they consider the life of animal whose motion be regulate by instinct they obey they guide and be happy let we therefore at length cease to dispute and learn to live throw away the incumbrance of precept which they who utter they with so much pride and pomp do not understand and carry with we this simple and intelligible maxim : that deviation from nature be deviation from happiness when he have speak he look round he with a placid air and enjoy the consciousness of he own beneficence sir say the prince with great modesty as i like all the rest of mankind be desirous of felicity my closest attention have be fix upon you discourse : i doubt not the truth of a position which a man so learn have so confidently advanced let I only know what it be to live accord to nature when i find young man so humble and so docile say the philosopher i can deny they no information which my study have enable I to afford to live accord to nature be to act always with due regard to the fitness arise from the relation and quality of cause and effect to concur with the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity to cooperate with the general disposition and tendency of the present system of thing the prince soon find that this be one of the sage whom he should understand less as he hear he longer he therefore bow and be silent and the philosopher suppose he satisfied and the rest vanquish rise up and depart with the air of a man that have cooperate with the present system chap xxiii the prince and he sister divide between they the work of observation rassela return home full of reflection doubtful how to direct he future step of the way to happiness he find the learn and simple equally ignorant but as he be yet young he flatter himself that he have time remain for more experiment and further inquiry he communicate to imlac he observation and he doubt but be answer by he with new doubt and remark that give he no comfort he therefore discourse more frequently and freely with he sister who have yet the same hope with himself and always assist he to give some reason why though he have be hitherto frustrated he might succeed at last we have hitherto say she known but little of the world : we have never yet be either great or mean in we own country though we have royalty we have no power and in this we have not yet see the private recess of domestick peace imlac favor not we search lest we should in time find he mistake we will divide the task between we : you shall try what be to be find in the splendor of court and i will range the shades of humbler life perhaps command and authority may be the supreme blessing as they afford most opportunity of do good : or perhaps what this world can give may be find in the modest habitation of middle fortune too low for great design and too high for penury and distress chap xxiv the prince examine the happiness of high station rassela applaud the design and appear next day with a splendid retinue at the court of the bassa he be soon distinguish for he magnificence and admit as a prince whose curiosity have bring he from distant country to a intimacy with the great officer and frequent conversation with the bassa himself he be at first inclined to believe that the man must be please with he own condition whom all approach with reverence and hear with obedience and who have the power to extend he edict to a whole kingdom there can be no pleasure say he equal to that of feeling at once the joy of thousand all make happy by wise administration yet since by the law of subordination this sublime delight can be in one nation but the lot of one it be surely reasonable to think that there be some satisfaction more popular and accessible and that million can hardly be subject to the will of a single man only to fill he particular breast with incommunicable content these thought be often in he mind and he find no solution of the difficulty but as present and civility gain he more familiarity he find that almost every man who stand high in employment hate all the rest and be hate by they and that they life be a continual succession of plot and detection stratagem and escape faction and treachery many of those who surround the bassa be send only to watch and report he conduct every tongue be mutter censure and every eye be search for a fault at last the letter of revocation arrive the bassa be carry in chain to constantinople and he name be mention no more what be we now to think of the prerogative of power say rassela to he sister : be it without any efficacy to good or be the subordinate degree only dangerous and the supreme safe and glorious be the sultan the only happy man in he dominion or be the sultan himself subject to the torment of suspicion and the dread of enemy in a short time the second bassa be depose the sultan that have advance he be murder by the janizary and he successor have other view and different favorite chap xxv the princess pursue she inquiry with more diligence than success the princess in the mean time insinuate herself into many family for there be few door through which liberality join with good-humour can not find its way the daughter of many house be airy and cheerful but nekayah have be too long accustomed to the conversation of imlac and she brother to be much pleased with childish levity and prattle which have no meaning she find they thought narrow they wish low and they merriment often artificial they pleasure poor as they be could not be preserve pure but be imbitter by petty competition and worthless emulation they be always jealous of the beauty of each other of a quality to which solicitude can add nothing and from which detraction can take nothing away many be in love with trifler like themselves and many fancy that they be in love when in truth they be only idle they affection be not fix on sense or virtue and therefore seldom end but in vexation they grief however like they joy be transient every thing float in they mind unconnected with the past or future so that one desire easily give way to another as a second stone cast into the water efface and confound the circle of the first with these girl she play as with inoffensive animal and find they proud of she countenance and weary of she company but she purpose be to examine more deeply and she affability easily persuade the heart that be swell with sorrow to discharge they secret in she ear : and those whom hope flattered or prosperity delighted often court she to partake they pleasure the princess and she brother commonly meet in the evening in a private summer house on the bank of the nile and related to each other the occurrence of the day as they be sit together the princess cast she eye upon the river that flow before she answer say she great father of water thou that rollest thy flood through eighty nation to the invocation of the daughter of thy native king tell I if thou waterest through all thy course a single habitation from which thou dost not hear the murmur of complaint you be then say rassela not more successful in private house than i have be in court i have since the last partition of we province say the princess enable myself to enter familiarly into many family where there be the fairest show of prosperity and peace and know not one house that be not haunt by some fury that destroy they quiet i do not seek ease among the poor because i conclude that there it could not be find but i see many poor whom i have suppose to live in affluence poverty have in large city very different appearance it be often conceal in splendor and often in extravagance it be the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal they indigence from the rest they support themselves by temporary expedient and every day be lose in contrive for the morrow this however be a evil which though frequent i see with less pain because i could relieve it yet some have refuse my bounty more offend with my quickness to detect they want than please with my readiness to succor they : and other whose exigency compel they to admit my kindness have never be able to forgive they benefactress many however have be sincerely grateful without the ostentation of gratitude or the hope of other favor chap xxvi the princess continue she remark upon private life nekayah perceive she brother 's attention fix proceed in she narrative in family where there be or be not poverty there be commonly discord : if a kingdom be as imlac tell we a great family a family likewise be a little kingdom tear with faction and expose to revolution a unpractised observer expect the love of parent and child to be constant and equal but this kindness seldom continue beyond the year of infancy in a short time the child become rival to they parent benefit be allay by reproach and gratitude debase by envy parent and child seldom act in concert : each child endeavor to appropriate the esteem or fondness of the parent and the parent with yet less temptation betray each other to they child thus some place they confidence in the father and some in the mother and by degree the house be fill with artifice and feud the opinion of child and parent of the young and the old be naturally opposite by the contrary effect of hope and despondence of expectation and experience without crime or folly on either side the color of life in youth and age appear different as the face of nature in spring and winter and how can child credit the assertion of parent which they own eye show they to be false few parent act in such a manner as much to enforce they maxim by the credit of they life the old man trust wholly to slow contrivance and gradual progression : the youth expect to force he way by genius vigor and precipitance the old man pay regard to riches and the youth reverence virtue the old man deify prudence : the youth commit himself to magnanimity and chance the young man who intend no ill believe that none be intend and therefore act with openness and candor : but he father have suffer the injury of fraud be impel to suspect and too often allure to practice it age look with anger on the temerity of youth and youth with contempt on the scrupulosity of age thus parent and child for the greatest part live on to love less and less : and if those whom nature have thus closely unite be the torment of each other where shall we look for tenderness and consolation surely say the prince you must have be unfortunate in you choice of acquaintance : i be unwilling to believe that the most tender of all relation be thus impede in its effect by natural necessity domestick discord answer she be not inevitably and fatally necessary but yet it be not easily avoid we seldom see that a whole family be virtuous : the good and evil can not well agree : and the evil can yet less agree with one another : even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance when they virtue be of different kind and tend to extreme in general those parent have most reverence who most deserve it : for he that live well can not be despise many other evil infest private life some be the slave of servant whom they have trust with they affair some be keep in continual anxiety by the caprice of rich relation whom they can not please and dare not offend some husband be imperious and some wife perverse : and as it be always more easy to do evil than good though the wisdom or virtue of one can very rarely make many happy the folly or vice of one may often make many miserable if such be the general effect of marriage say the prince i shall for the future think it dangerous to connect my interest with that of another lest i should be unhappy by my partner 's fault i have meet say the princess with many who live single for that reason but i never find that they prudence ought to raise envy they dream away they time without friendship without fondness and be drive to rid themselves of the day for which they have no use by childish amusement or vitious delight they act as being under the constant sense of some known inferiority that fill they mind with rancor and they tongue with censure they be peevish at home and malevolent abroad and as the outlaw of human nature make it they business and they pleasure to disturb that society which debar they from its privilege to live without feeling or exciting sympathy to be fortunate without add to the felicity of other or afflict without tasting the balm of pity be a state more gloomy than solitude : it be not retreat but exclusion from mankind marriage have many pain but celibacy have no pleasure what then be to be do say rassela the more we inquire the less we can resolve surely he be most likely to please himself that have no other inclination to regard chap xxvii disquisition upon greatness the conversation have a short pause the prince have consider he sister 's observation tell she that she have survey life with prejudice and suppose misery where she do not find it you narrative say he throw yet a darker gloom upon the prospects of futurity : the prediction of imlac be but faint sketch of the evil paint by nekayah i have be lately convince that quiet be not the daughter of grandeur or of power : that she presence be not to be buy by wealth nor enforce by conquest it be evident that as any man act in a wider compass he must be more expose to opposition from enmity or miscarriage from chance whoever have many to please or to govern must use the ministry of many agent some of whom will be wicked and some ignorant by some he will be mislead and by other betray if he gratify one he will offend another : those that be not favor will think themselves injure and since favor can be confer but upon few the greater number will be always discontent the discontent say the princess which be thus unreasonable i hope that i shall always have spirit to despise and you power to repress discontent answer rassela will not always be without reason under the most just and vigilant administration of publick affair none however attentive can always discover that merit which indigence or faction may happen to obscure and none however powerful can always reward it yet he that see inferior desert advance above he will naturally impute that preference to partiality or caprice and indeed it can scarcely be hope that any man however magnanimous by nature or exalt by condition will be able to persist for ever in the fix and inexorable justice of distribution he will sometimes indulge he own affection and sometimes those of he favorite he will permit some to please he who can never serve he he will discover in those whom he love quality which in reality they do not possess and to those from whom he receive pleasure he will in he turn endeavor to give it thus will recommendation sometimes prevail which be purchase by money or by the more destructive bribery of flattery and servility he that have much to do will do something wrong and of that wrong must suffer the consequence and if it be possible that he should always act rightly yet when such number be to judge of he conduct the bad will censure and obstruct he by malevolence and the good sometimes by mistake the highest station can not therefore hope to be the abode of happiness which i would willingly believe to have flee from throne and palace to seat of humble privacy and placid obscurity for what can hinder the satisfaction or intercept the expectation of he whose ability be adequate to he employment who see with he own eye the whole circuit of he influence who choose by he own knowledge all whom he trust and whom none be tempt to deceive by hope or fear surely he have nothing to do but to love and to be love to be virtuous and to be happy whether perfect happiness would be procure by perfect goodness say nekayah this world will never afford a opportunity of decide but this at least may be maintain that we do not always find visible happiness in proportion to visible virtue all natural and almost all political evil be incident alike to the bad and good they be confound in the misery of a famine and not much distinguish in the fury of a faction they sink together in a tempest and be drive together from they country by invader all that virtue can afford be quietness of conscience a steady prospect of a happier state this may enable we to endure calamity with patience but remember that patience must suppose pain chap xxviii rassela and nekayah continue they conversation dear princess say rassela you fall into the common error of exaggeratory declamation by produce in a familiar disquisition example of national calamity and scene of extensive misery which be find in book rather than in the world and which as they be horrid be ordain to be rare let we not imagine evil which we do not feel nor injure life by misrepresentation i can not bear that querulous eloquence which threaten every city with a siege like that of jerusalem that make famine attend on every flight of locust and suspend pestilence on the wing of every blast that issue from the south on necessary and inevitable evil which overwhelm kingdom at once all disputation be vain : when they happen they must be endure but it be evident that these burst of universal distress be more dreaded than feel thousand and ten thousand flourish in youth and wither in age without the knowledge of any other than domestick evil and share the same pleasure and vexation whether they king be mild or cruel whether the army of they country pursue they enemy or retreat before they while court be disturb with intestine competition and ambassador be negotiate in foreign country the smith still ply he anvil and the husbandman drive he plough forward the necessaries of life be require and obtain and the successive business of the season continue to make its wonted revolution let we cease to consider what perhaps may never happen and what when it shall happen will laugh at human speculation we will not endeavor to modify the motion of the element or to fix the destiny of kingdom it be we business to consider what being like we may perform each labor for he own happiness by promote within he circle however narrow the happiness of other marriage be evidently the dictate of nature man and woman be make to be companion of each other and therefore i can not be persuade but that marriage be one of the means of happiness i know not say the princess whether marriage be more than one of the innumerable mode of human misery when i see and reckon the various form of connubial infelicity the unexpected cause of lasting discord the diversity of temper the opposition of opinion the rude collision of contrary desire where both be urge by violent impulse the obstinate contest of disagreeable virtue where both be support by consciousness of good intention i be sometimes dispose to think with the severer casuist of most nation that marriage be rather permit than approve and that none but by the instigation of a passion too much indulge entangle themselves with indissoluble compact you seem to forget reply rassela that you have even now represent celibacy as less happy than marriage both condition may be bad but they can not both be worst thus it happen when wrong opinion be entertain that they mutually destroy each other and leave the mind open to truth i do not expect answer the princess to hear that imputed to falsehood which be the consequence only of frailty to the mind as to the eye it be difficult to compare with exactness object vast in they extent and various in they part where we see or conceive the whole at once we readily note the discrimination and decide the preference : but of two system of which neither can be survey by any human be in its full compass of magnitude and multiplicity of complication where be the wonder that judge of the whole by part i be alternately affect by one and the other as either press on my memory or fancy we differ from ourselves just as we differ from each other when we see only part of the question as in the multifarious relation of politick and morality but when we perceive the whole at once as in numerical computation all agree in one judgment and none ever vary he opinion let we not add say the prince to the other evil of life the bitterness of controversy nor endeavor to vie with each other in subtilty of argument we be employ in a search of which both be equally to enjoy the success or suffer by the miscarriage it be therefore fit that we assist each other you surely conclude too hastily from the infelicity of marriage against its institution : will not the misery of life prove equally that life can not be the gift of heaven the world must be people by marriage or people without it how the world be to be peopled return nekayah be not my care and need not be yours i see no danger that the present generation should omit to leave successor behind they : we be not now inquire for the world but for ourselves chap xxix the debate on marriage continue the good of the whole say rassela be the same with the good of all its part if marriage be best for mankind it must be evidently best for individual or a permanent and necessary duty must be the cause of evil and some must be inevitably sacrifice to the convenience of other in the estimate which you have make of the two state it appear that the incommodity of a single life be in a great measure necessary and certain but those of the conjugal state accidental and avoidable i can not forbear to flatter myself that prudence and benevolence will make marriage happy the general folly of mankind be the cause of general complaint what can be expect but disappointment and repentance from a choice make in the immaturity of youth in the ardor of desire without judgment without foresight without inquiry after conformity of opinion similarity of manners rectitude of judgment or purity of sentiment such be the common process of marriage a youth and maiden meeting by chance or bring together by artifice exchange glance reciprocate civility go home and dream of one another have little to divert attention or diversify think they find themselves uneasy when they be apart and therefore conclude that they shall be happy together they marry and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness before have conceal they wear out life in altercation and charge nature with cruelty from those early marriage proceed likewise the rivalry of parent and child the son be eager to enjoy the world before the father be willing to forsake it and there be hardly room at once for two generation the daughter begin to bloom before the mother can be content to fade and neither can forbear to wish for the absence of the other surely all these evil may be avoid by that deliberation and delay which prudence prescribe to irrevocable choice in the variety and jollity of youthful pleasure life may be well enough support without the help of a partner longer time will increase experience and wider view will allow better opportunity of inquiry and selection : one advantage at least will be certain the parent will be visibly older than they child what reason can not collect say nekayah and what experiment have not yet teach can be know only from the report of other i have be tell that late marriage be not eminently happy this be a question too important to be neglect and i have often propose it to those whose accuracy of remark and comprehensiveness of knowledge make they suffrage worthy of regard they have generally determine that it be dangerous for a man and woman to suspend they fate upon each other at a time when opinion be fix and habit be establish when friendship have be contract on both side when life have be plan into method and the mind have long enjoy the contemplation of its own prospects it be scarcely possible that two travel through the world under the conduct of chance should have be both direct to the same path and it will not often happen that either will quit the track which custom have make please when the desultory levity of youth have settle into regularity it be soon succeed by pride ashamed to yield or obstinacy delighting to contend and even though mutual esteem produce mutual desire to please time itself as it modify unchangeably the external mien determine likewise the direction of the passion and give a inflexible rigidity to the manners long custom be not easily break : he that attempt to change the course of he own life very often labor in vain and how shall we do that for other which we be seldom able to do for ourselves but surely interpose the prince you suppose the chief motive of choice forget or neglect whenever i shall seek a wife it shall be my first question whether she be willing to be lead by reason thus it be say nekayah that philosopher be deceive there be a thousand familiar dispute which reason can never decide question that elude investigation and make logick ridiculous case where something must be do and where little can be say consider the state of mankind and inquire how few can be suppose to act upon any occasion whether small or great with all the reason of action present to they mind wretched would be the pair above all name of wretchedness who should be doom to adjust by reason every morning all the minute detail of a domestick day those who marry at a advanced age will probably escape the encroachment of they child but in diminution of this advantage they will be likely to leave they ignorant and helpless to a guardian 's mercy or if that should not happen they must at least go out of the world before they see those whom they love best either wise or great from they child if they have less to fear they have less also to hope and they lose without equivalent the joy of early love and the convenience of unite with manners pliant and mind susceptible of new impression which might wear away they dissimilitude by long cohabitation as soft body by continual attrition conform they surface to each other i believe it will be find that those who marry late be best please with they child and those who marry early with they partner the union of these two affection say rassela would produce all that could be wish perhaps there be a time when marriage might unite they a time neither too early for the father nor too late for the husband every hour answer the princess confirm my prejudice in favor of the position so often utter by the mouth of imlac : ` that nature set she gift on the right hand and on the leave ' those condition which flatter hope and attract desire be so constitute that as we approach one we recede from another there be goods so oppose that we can not seize both but by too much prudence may pass between they at too great a distance to reach either this be often the fate of long consideration he do nothing who endeavor to do more than be allow to humanity flatter not yourself with contrariety of pleasure of the blessing set before you make you choice and be content no man can taste the fruit of autumn while he be delight he scent with the flower of the spring no man can at the same time fill he cup from the source and from the mouth of the nile chap xxx imlac enter and change the conversation here imlac enter and interrupt they imlac say rassela i have be take from the princess the dismal history of private life and be almost discourage from further search it seem to I say imlac that while you be make the choice of life you neglect to live you wander about a single city which however large and diversified can now afford few novelty and forget that you be in a country famous among the earliest monarchy for the power and wisdom of its inhabitant a country where the science first dawn that illuminate the world and beyond which the art can not be trace of civil society or domestick life the old egyptian have leave behind they monument of industry and power before which all european magnificence be confess to fade away the ruin of they architecture be the school of modern builder and from the wonder which time have spare we may conjecture though uncertainly what it have destroy my curiosity say rassela do not very strongly lead I to survey pile of stone or mound of earth my business be with man i come hither not to measure fragment of temple or trace choke aqueduct but to look upon the various scene of the present world the thing that be now before we say the princess require attention and deserve it what have i to do with the hero or the monument of ancient time with time which never can return and hero whose form of life be different from all that the present condition of mankind require or allow to know any thing return the poet we must know its effect to see man we must see they work that we may learn what reason have dictate or passion have incite and find what be the most powerful motive of action to judge rightly of the present we must oppose it to the past for all judgment be comparative and of the future nothing can be know the truth be that no mind be much employ upon the present : recollection and anticipation fill up almost all we moment we passion be joy and grief love and hatred hope and fear of joy and grief the past be the object and the future of hope and fear even love and hatred respect the past for the cause must have be before the effect the present state of thing be the consequence of the former and it be natural to inquire what be the source of the good that we enjoy or the evil that we suffer if we act only for ourselves to neglect the study of history be not prudent : if we be intrust with the care of other it be not just ignorance when it be voluntary be criminal and he may properly be charge with evil who refuse to learn how he might prevent it there be no part of history so generally useful as that which relate the progress of the human mind the gradual improvement of reason the successive advance of science the vicissitude of learning and ignorance which be the light and darkness of think being the extinction and resuscitation of art and the revolution of the intellectual world if account of battle and invasion be peculiarly the business of prince the useful or elegant art be not to be neglect those who have kingdom to govern have understanding to cultivate example be always more efficacious than precept a soldier be form in war and a painter must copy picture in this contemplative life have the advantage : great action be seldom see but the labor of art be always at hand for those who desire to know what art have be able to perform when the eye or the imagination be strike with a uncommon work the next transition of a active mind be to the means by which it be perform here begin the true use of such contemplation we enlarge we comprehension by new idea and perhaps recover some art lose to mankind or learn what be less perfectly know in we own country at least we compare we own with former time and either rejoice at we improvement or what be the first motion towards good discover we defect i be willing say the prince to see all that can deserve my search and i say the princess shall rejoice to learn something of the manners of antiquity the most pompous monument of egyptian greatness and one of the most bulky work of manual industry say imlac be the pyramid fabrick raise before the time of history and of which the earliest narrative afford we only uncertain tradition of these the greatest be still stand very little injure by time let we visit they to-morrow say nekayah i have often hear of the pyramid and shall not rest till i have see they within and without with my own eye chap xxxi they visit the pyramid the resolution be thus take they set out the next day they lay tent upon they camel be resolve to stay among the pyramid till they curiosity be fully satisfy they travel gently turn aside to every thing remarkable stop from time to time and converse with the inhabitant and observe the various appearance of town ruin and inhabit of wild and cultivate nature when they come to the great pyramid they be astonish at the extent of the base and the height of the top imlac explain to they the principle upon which the pyramidal form be choose for a fabrick intend to coextend its duration with that of the world : he show that its gradual diminution give it such stability as defeat all the common attack of the element and could scarcely be overthrow by earthquake themselves the least resistible of natural violence a concussion that should shatter the pyramid would threaten the dissolution of the continent they measure all its dimension and pitch they tent at its foot next day they prepare to enter its interior apartment and have hire the common guide climb up to the first passage when the favorite of the princess look into the cavity step back and tremble pekuah say the princess of what art thou afraid of the narrow entrance answer the lady and of the dreadful gloom i dare not enter a place which must surely be inhabit by unquiet soul the original possessor of these dreadful vault will start up before we and perhaps shut we in for ever -lrb- a -rrb- she speak and throw she arm round the neck of she mistress if all you fear be of apparition say the prince i will promise you safety : there be no danger from the dead he that be once bury will be see no more that the dead be see no more say imlac i will not undertake to maintain against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of all age and of all nation there be no people rude or learn among whom apparition of the dead be not related and believe this opinion which perhaps prevail as far as human nature be diffuse could become universal only by its truth : those that never hear of one another would not have agree in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible that it be doubt by single caviller can very little weaken the general evidence and some who deny it with they tongue confess it by they fear -lrb- b -rrb- yet i do not mean to add new terror to those which have already seize upon pekuah there can be no reason why spectre should haunt the pyramid more than other place or why they should have power or will to hurt innocence and purity we entrance be no violation of they privilege we can take nothing from they how then can we offend they my dear pekuah say the princess i will always go before you and imlac shall follow you remember that you be the companion of the princess of abissinium if the princess be pleased that she servant should die return the lady let she command some death less dreadful than enclosure in this horrid cavern you know i dare not disobey you : i must go if you command I but if i once enter i never shall come back the princess see that she fear be too strong for expostulation or reproof and embrace she tell she that she should stay in the tent till they return pekuah be yet not satisfied but entreat the princess not to pursue so dreadful a purpose as that of enter the rececess of the pyramid though i can not teach courage say nekayah i must not learn cowardice nor leave at last undo what i come hither only to do -lrb- a -rrb- it may not be unacceptable to we reader to quote in this place a stanza from a ode to horror in the student ii 313 it allude to the story of a french gentleman who go

of marble and examine the chest in which the body of the founder be suppose to have be reposit they then sit down in one of the most spacious chamber to rest awhile before they attempt to return we have now say imlac gratify we mind with a exact view of the greatest work of man except the wall of china of the wall it be very easy to assign the motive it secure a wealthy and timorous nation from the incursion of barbarian whose unskilfulness in art make it easier for they to supply they want by rapine than by industry and who from time to time pour in upon the habitation of peaceful commerce as vulture descend upon domestick fowl they celerity and fierceness make the wall necessary and they ignorance make it efficacious but for the pyramid no reason have ever be give adequate to the cost and labor of the work the narrowness of the chamber prove that it could afford no retreat from enemy and treasure might have be reposit at far less expense with equal security it seem to have be erect only in compliance with that hunger of imagination which prey incessantly upon life and must be always appease by some employment those who have already all that they can enjoy must enlarge they desire he that have build for use till use be supply must begin to build for vanity and extend he plan to the utmost power of human performance that he may not be soon reduce to form another wish i consider this mighty structure as a monument of the insufficiency of human enjoyment a king whose power be unlimited and whose treasure surmount all real and imaginary want be compel to solace by the erection of a pyramid the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasure and to amuse the tediousness of decline life by see thousand labor without end and one stone for no purpose lay upon another whoever thou art that not content with a moderate condition imaginest happiness in royal magnificence and dreamest that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty with perpetual gratification survey the pyramid and confess thy folly chap xxxiii the princess meet with a unexpected misfortune they rise up and return through the cavity at which they have enter and the princess prepare for she favorite a long narrative of dark labyrinth and costly room and of the different impression which the variety of the way have make upon she but when they come to they train they find every one silent and dejected : the man discover shame and fear in they countenance and the woman be weep in the tent what have happen they do not try to conjecture but immediately inquire you have scarcely enter into the pyramid say one of the attendant when a troop of arab rush upon we we be too few to resist they and too slow to escape they be about to search the tent set we on we camel and drive we along before they when the approach of some turkish horseman put they to flight but they seize the lady pekuah with she two maid and carry they away : the turk be now pursue they by we instigation but i fear they will not be able to overtake they the princess be overpower with surprise and grief rassela in the first heat of he resentment order he servant to follow he and prepare to pursue the robber with he sabre in he hand sir say imlac what can you hope from violence or valor the arab be mount on horse train to battle and retreat we have only beast of burden by leave we present station we may lose the princess but can not hope to regain pekuah in a short time the turk return have not be able to reach the enemy the princess burst out into new lamentation and rassela could scarcely forbear to reproach they with cowardice but imlac be of opinion that the escape of the arab be no addition to they misfortune for perhaps they would have kill they captive rather than have resign they chap xxxiv they return to cairo without pekuah there be nothing to be hope from longer stay they return to cairo repenting of they curiosity censure the negligence of the government lament they own rashness which have neglect to procure a guard imagine many expedient by which the loss of pekuah might have be prevent and resolve to do something for she recovery though none could find any thing proper to be do nekayah retire to she chamber where she woman attempt to comfort she by tell she that all have they trouble and that lady pekuah have enjoy much happiness in the world for a long time and might reasonably expect a change of fortune they hope that some good would befall she wheresoever she be and that they mistress would find another friend who might supply she place the princess make they no answer and they continue the form of condolence not much grieve in they heart that the favorite be lose next day the prince present to the bassa a memorial of the wrong which he have suffer and a petition for redress the bassa threaten to punish the robber but do not attempt to catch they nor indeed could any account or description be give by which he might direct the pursuit it soon appear that nothing would be do by authority governor be accustom to hear of more crime than they can punish and more wrong than they can redress set themselves at ease by indiscriminate negligence and presently forget the request when they lose sight of the petitioner imlac then endeavor to gain some intelligence by private agent he find many who pretend to a exact knowledge of all the haunt of the arab and to regular correspondence with they chief and who readily undertake the recovery of pekuah of these some be furnish with money for they journey and come back no more some be liberally pay for account which a few day discover to be false but the princess would not suffer any means however improbable to be leave untried while she be do something she keep she hope alive as one expedient fail another be suggest when one messenger return unsuccessful another be despatch to a different quarter two month have now pass and of pekuah nothing have be hear the hope which they have endeavor to raise in each other grow more languid and the princess when she see nothing more to be try sink down inconsolable in hopeless dejection a thousand time she reproach herself with the easy compliance by which she permit she favorite to stay behind she have not my fondness say she lessen my authority pekuah have not dare to talk of she terror she ought to have fear I more than spectre a severe look would have overpower she a peremptory command would have compel obedience why do foolish indulgence prevail upon I why do i not speak and refuse to hear great princess say imlac do not reproach yourself for you virtue or consider that as blamable by which evil have accidentally be cause you tenderness for the timidity of pekuah be generous and kind when we act accord to we duty we commit the event to he by whose law we action be govern and who will suffer none to be finally punish for obedience when in prospect of some good whether natural or moral we break the rule prescribe we we withdraw from the direction of superior wisdom and take all consequence upon ourselves man can not so far know the connexion of cause and event as that he may venture to do wrong in order to do right when we pursue we end by lawful means we may always console we miscarriage by the hope of future recompense when we consult only we own policy and attempt to find a nearer way to good by overleap the settle boundary of right and wrong we can not be happy even by success because we can not escape the consciousness of we fault but if we miscarry the disappointment be irremediably imbittered how comfortless be the sorrow of he who feel at once the pang of guilt and the vexation of calamity which guilt have bring upon he consider princess what would have be you condition if the lady pekuah have entreat to accompany you and be compel to stay in the tent have be carry away or how would you have bear the think if you have force she into the pyramid and she have die before you in agony of terror have either happen say nekayah i could not have endure life till now : i should have be tortured to madness by the remembrance of such cruelty or must have pine away in abhorrence of myself this at least say imlac be the present reward of virtuous conduct that no unlucky consequence can oblige we to repent it chap xxxv the princess languish for want of pekuah nekayah be thus reconcile to herself find that no evil be insupportable but that which be accompany with consciousness of wrong she be from that time deliver from the violence of tempestuous sorrow and sink into silent pensiveness and gloomy tranquillity she sit from morning to evening recollect all that have be do or say by she pekuah treasured up with care every trifle on which pekuah have set a accidental value and which might recall to mind any little incident or careless conversation the sentiment of she whom she now expect to see no more be treasured in she memory as rule of life and she deliberate to no other end than to conjecture on any occasion what would have be the opinion and counsel of pekuah the woman by whom she be attend know nothing of she real condition and therefore she could not talk to they but with caution and reserve she begin to remit she curiosity have no great care to collect notion which she have no convenience of utter rassela endeavor first to comfort and afterwards to divert she he hire musician to whom she seem to listen but do not hear they and procure master to instruct she in various art whose lecture when they visit she again be again to be repeat she have lose she taste of pleasure and she ambition of excellence and she mind though force into short excursion always recur to the image of she friend imlac be every morning earnestly enjoin to renew he inquiry and be ask every night whether he have yet hear of pekuah till not be able to return the princess the answer that she desire he be less and less willing to come into she presence she observe he backwardness and command he to attend she you be not say she to confound impatience with resentment or to suppose that i charge you with negligence because i repine at you unsuccessfulness i do not much wonder at you absence i know that the unhappy be never please and that all naturally avoid the contagion of misery to hear complaint be wearisome alike to the wretched and the happy for who would cloud by adventitious grief the short gleam of gaiety which life allow we or who that be struggle under he own evil will add to they the misery of another the time be at hand when none shall be disturb any longer by the sigh of nekayah : my search after happiness be now at a end i be resolve to retire from the world with all its flattery and deceit and will hide myself in solitude without any other care than to compose my thought and regulate my hour by a constant succession of innocent occupation till with a mind purify from all earthly desire i shall enter into that state to which all be hasten and in which i hope again to enjoy the friendship of pekuah do not entangle you mind say imlac by irrevocable determination nor increase the burden of life by a voluntary accumulation of misery : the weariness of retirement will continue or increase when the loss of pekuah be forget that you have be deprive of one pleasure be no very good reason for rejection of the rest since pekuah be take from I say the princess i have no pleasure to reject or to retain she that have no one to love or trust have little to hope she want the radical principle of happiness we may perhaps allow that what satisfaction this world can afford must arise from the conjunction of wealth knowledge and goodness wealth be nothing but as it be bestow and knowledge nothing but as it be communicate : they must therefore be impart to other and to whom could i now delight to impart they goodness afford the only comfort which can be enjoy without a partner and goodness may be practice in retirement how far solitude may admit goodness or advance it i shall not reply imlac dispute at present remember the confession of the pious hermit you will wish to return into the world when the image of you companion have leave you thought that time say nekayah will never come the generous frankness the modest obsequiousness and the faithful secrecy of my dear pekuah will always be more miss as i shall live longer to see vice and folly the state of a mind oppress with a sudden calamity say imlac be like that of the fabulous inhabitant of the new-created earth who when the first night come upon they suppose that day would never return when the cloud of sorrow gather over we we see nothing beyond they nor can imagine how they will be dispel yet a new day succeed to the night and sorrow be never long without a dawn of ease but they who restrain themselves from receive comfort do as the savage would have do have they put out they eye when it be dark we mind like we body be in continual flux something be hourly lose and something acquire to lose much at once be inconvenient to either but while the vital power remain uninjured nature will find the means of reparation distance have the same effect on the mind as on the eye and while we glide along the stream of time whatever we leave behind we be always lessen and that which we approach increase in magnitude do not suffer life to stagnate it will grow muddy for want of motion : commit yourself again to the current of the world pekuah will vanish by degree you will meet in you way some other favorite or learn to diffuse yourself in general conversation at least say the prince do not despair before all remedy have be try the inquiry after the unfortunate lady be still continue and shall be carry on with yet greater diligence on condition that you will promise to wait a year for the event without any unalterable resolution nekayah think this a reasonable demand and make the promise to she brother who have be advise by imlac to require it imlac have indeed no great hope of regain pekuah but he suppose that if he could secure the interval of a year the princess would be then in no danger of a cloister chap xxxvi pekuah be still remember the progress of sorrow nekayah see that nothing be omit for the recovery of she favorite and have by she promise set she intention of retirement at a distance begin imperceptibly to return to common care and common pleasure she rejoice without she own consent at the suspension of she sorrow and sometimes catch herself with indignation in the act of turn away she mind from the remembrance of she whom yet she resolve never to forget she then appoint a certain hour of the day for meditation on the merit and fondness of pekuah and for some week retire constantly at the time fix and return with she eye swollen and she countenance cloud by degree she grow less scrupulous and suffer any important and press avocation to delay the tribute of daily tear she then yield to less occasion sometimes forget what she be indeed afraid to remember and at last wholly release herself from the duty of periodical affliction she real love of pekuah be yet not diminish a thousand occurrence bring she back to memory and a thousand want which nothing but the confidence of friendship can supply make she frequently regret she therefore solicit imlac never to desist from inquiry and to leave no art of intelligence untried that at least she might have the comfort of know that she do not suffer by negligence or sluggishness yet what say she be to be expect from we pursuit of happiness when we find the state of life to be such that happiness itself be the cause of misery why should we endeavor to attain that of which the possession can not be secure i shall henceforward fear to yield my heart to excellence however bright or to fondness however tender lest i should lose again what i have lose in pekuah chap xxxvii the princess hear news of pekuah in seven month one of the messenger who have be send away upon the day when the promise be draw from the princess return after many unsuccessful ramble from the border of nubium with a account that pekuah be in the hand of a arab chief who possess a castle or fortress on the extremity of egypt the arab whose revenue be plunder be willing to restore she with she two attendant for two hundred ounce of gold the price be no subject of debate the princess be in ecstasy when she hear that she favorite be alive and might so cheaply be ransom she could not think of delay for a moment pekuah 's happiness or she own but entreat she brother to send back the messenger with the sum require imlac be consult be not very confident of the veracity of the relater and be still more doubtful of the arab 's faith who might if he be too liberally trust detain at once the money and the captive he think it dangerous to put themselves in the power of the arab by go into he district and could not expect that the rover would so much expose himself as to come into the lower country where he might be seize by the force of the bassa it be difficult to negotiate where neither will trust but imlac after some deliberation direct the messenger to propose that pekuah should be conduct by ten horseman to the monastery of st anthony which be situate in the desert of upper egypt where she should be meet by the same number and she ransome should be pay that no time might be lose as they expect that the proposal would not be refuse they immediately begin they journey to the monastery and when they arrive imlac go forward with the former messenger to the arab 's fortress rassela be desirous to go with they but neither he sister nor imlac would consent the arab accord to the custom of he nation observe the law of hospitality with great exactness to those who put themselves into he power and in a few day bring pekuah with she maid by easy journey to the place appoint where receive the stipulate price he restore she with great respect to liberty and she friend and undertake to conduct they back towards cairo beyond all danger of robbery or violence the princess and she favorite embrace each other with transport too violent to be express and go out together to pour the tear of tenderness in secret and exchange profession of kindness and gratitude after a few hour they return into the refectory of the convent where in the presence of the prior and he brethren the prince require of pekuah the history of she adventure chap xxxviii the adventure of the lady pekuah at what time and in what manner i be force away say pekuah you servant have tell you the suddenness of the event strike I with surprise and i be at first rather stupified than agitate with any passion of either fear or sorrow my confusion be increase by the speed and tumult of we flight while we be follow by the turk who as it seem soon despaired to overtake we or be afraid of those whom they make a show of menacing when the arab see themselves out of danger they slacken they course and as i be less harass by external violence i begin to feel more uneasiness in my mind after some time we stop near a spring shaded with tree in a pleasant meadow where we be set upon the ground and offer such refreshment as we master be partaking i be suffer to sit with my maid apart from the rest and none attempt to comfort or insult we here i first begin to feel the full weight of my misery the girl sit weep in silence and from time to time look on I for succor i know not to what condition we be doom nor could conjecture where would be the place of we captivity or whence to draw any hope of deliverance i be in the hand of robber and savage and have no reason to suppose that they pity be more than they justice or that they would forbear the gratification of any ardor of desire or caprice of cruelty i however kiss my maid and endeavor to pacify they by remark that we be yet treat with decency and that since we be now carry beyond pursuit there be no danger of violence to we life when we be to be set again on horseback my maid cling round I and refuse to be part but i command they not to irritate those who have we in they power we travel the remain part of the day through a unfrequented and pathless country and come by moonlight to the side of a hill where the rest of the troop be station they tent be pitch and they fire kindle and we chief be welcome as a man much beloved by he dependant we be receive into a large tent where we find woman who have attend they husband in the expedition they set before we the supper which they have provide and i eat rather to encourage my maid than to comply with any appetite of my own when the meat be take away they spread the carpet for repose i be weary and hope to find in sleep that remission of distress which nature seldom deny order myself therefore to be undressed i observe that the woman look submissively attend when my upper vest be take off they be apparently strike with the splendor of my clothes and one of they timorously lay she hand upon the embroidery she then go out and in a short time come back with another woman who seem to be of higher rank and greater authority she do at she entrance the usual act of reverence and take I by the hand place I in a smaller tent spread with finer carpet where i spend the night quietly with my maid in the morning as i be sit on the grass the chief of the troop come towards I i rise up to receive he and he bow with great respect ` illustrious lady ' say he ` my fortune be better than i have presume to hope i be tell by my woman that i have a princess in my camp ' ` sir ' answer i ` you woman have deceive themselves and you i be not a princess but a unhappy stranger who intend soon to have leave this country in which i be now to be imprison for ever ' ` whoever or whencesoever you be ' return the arab ` you dress and that of you servant show you rank to be high and you wealth to be great why should you who can so easily procure you ransome think yourself in danger of perpetual captivity the purpose of my incursion be to increase my riches or more properly to gather tribute the son of ishmael be the natural and hereditary lord of this part of the continent which be usurp by late invader and low-born tyrant from whom we be compel to take by the sword what be deny to justice the violence of war admit no distinction : the lance that be lift at guilt and power will sometimes fall on innocence and gentleness ' ` how little ' say i ` do i expect that yesterday it should have fall upon I ' ` misfortune ' answer the arab ` should always be expect if the eye of hostility could learn reverence or pity excellence like yours have be exempt from injury but the angel of affliction spread they toil alike for the virtuous and the wicked for the mighty and the mean do not be disconsolate : i be not one of the lawless and cruel rover of the desert i know the rule of civil life : i will fix you ransome give a passport to you messenger and perform my stipulation with nice punctuality ' you will easily believe that i be please with he courtesy : and find that he predominant passion be desire of money i begin now to think my danger less for i know that no sum would be think too great for the release of pekuah i tell he that he should have no reason to charge I with ingratitude if i be use with kindness and that any ransome which could be expect for a maid of common rank would be pay but that he must not persist to rate I as a princess he say he would consider what he should demand and then smile bow and retire soon after the woman come about I each contend to be more officious than the other and my maid themselves be serve with reverence we travel onward by short journey on the fourth day the chief tell I that my ransome must be two hundred ounce of gold which i not only promise he but tell he that i would add fifty more if i and my maid be honourably treat i never know the power of gold before from that time i be the leader of the troop the march of every day be longer or shorter as i command and the tent be pitch where i choose to rest we now have camel and other conveniency for travel my own woman be always at my side and i amuse myself with observe the manners of the vagrant nation and with viewing remain of ancient edifice with which these desert country appear to have be in some distant age lavishly embellish the chief of the band be a man far from illiterate : he be able to travel by the star or the compass and have mark in he erratick expedition such place as be most worthy the notice of a passenger he observe to I that building be always best preserve in place little frequented and difficult of access : for when once a country decline from its primitive splendor the more inhabitant be leave the quicker ruin will be make wall supply stone more easily than quarry and palace and temple will be demolish to make stable of granite and cottage of porphyry chap xxxix the adventure of pekuah continue we wander about in this manner for some week whether as we chief pretend for my gratification or as i rather suspect for some convenience of he own i endeavor to appear contented where sullenness and resentment would have be of no use and that endeavor conduce much to the calmness of my mind but my heart be always with nekayah and the trouble of the night much overbalance the amusement of the day my woman who throw all they care upon they mistress set they mind at ease from the time when they see I treat with respect and give themselves up to the incidental alleviation of we fatigue without solicitude or sorrow i be please with they pleasure and animated with they confidence my condition have lose much of its terror since i find that the arab range the country merely to get riches avarice be a uniform and tractable vice : other intellectual distemper be different in different constitution of mind that which sooth the pride of one will offend the pride of another but to the favor of the covetous there be a ready way : bring money and nothing be deny at last we come to the dwelling of we chief a strong and spacious house build with stone in a island of the nile which lie as i be tell under the tropick ` lady ' say the arab ` you shall rest after you journey a few week in this place where you be to consider yourself as sovereign my occupation be war i have therefore choose this obscure residence from which i can issue unexpected and to which i can retire unpursued you may now repose in security : here be few pleasure but here be no danger ' he then lead I into the inner apartment and seat I on the richest couch bow to the ground he woman who consider I as a rival look on I with malignity but be soon inform that i be a great lady detain only for my ransome they begin to vie with each other in obsequiousness and reverence be again comfort with new assurance of speedy liberty i be for some day divert from impatience by the novelty of the place the turret overlook the country to a great distance and afford a view of many winding of the stream in the day i wander from one place to another as the course of the sun vary the splendor of the prospect and see many thing which i have never see before the crocodile and river-horse be common in this unpeopled region and i often look upon they with terror though i know that they could not hurt I for some time i expect to see mermaid and triton which as imlac have tell I the european traveller have station in the nile but no such being ever appear and the arab when i inquire after they laugh at my credulity at night the arab always attend I to a tower set apart for celestial observation where he endeavor to teach I the name and course of the star i have no great inclination to this study but a appearance of attention be necessary to please my instructer who value himself for he skill and in a little while i find some employment requisite to beguile the tediousness of time which be to be pass always amidst the same object i be weary of look in the morning on thing from which i have turn away weary in the evening i therefore be at last willing to observe the star rather than do nothing but could not always compose my thought and be very often think on nekayah when other imagine I contemplate the sky soon after the arab go upon another expedition and then my only pleasure be to talk with my maid about the accident by which we be carry away and the happiness that we should all enjoy at the end of we captivity there be woman in you arab 's fortress say the princess why do you not make they you companion enjoy they conversation and partake they diversion ' in a place where they find business or amusement why should you alone sit corrode with idle melancholy or why could not you bear for a few month that condition to which they be condemn for life the diversion of the woman answer pekuah be only childish play by which the mind accustom to stronger operation could not be keep busy i could do all which they delight in do by power merely sensitive while my intellectual faculty be fly to cairo they run from room to room as a bird hop from wire to wire in he cage they dance for the sake of motion as lamb frisk in a meadow one sometimes pretend to be hurt that the rest might be alarm or hide herself that another might seek she part of they time pass in watch the progress of light body that float on the river and part in mark the various form into which cloud break in the sky they business be only needlework in which i and my maid sometimes help they but you know that the mind will easily straggle from the finger nor will you suspect that captivity and absence from nekayah could receive solace from silken flower nor be much satisfaction to be hope from they conversation : for of what could they be expect to talk they have see nothing for they have live from early youth in that narrow spot : of what they have not see they could have no knowledge for they could not read they have no idea but of the few thing that be within they view and have hardly name for any thing but they clothes and they food as i bear a superior character i be often call to terminate they quarrel which i decide as equitably as i could if it could have amuse I to hear the complaint of each against the rest i might have be often detain by long story but the motive of they animosity be so small that i could not listen without intercept the tale how say rassela can the arab whom you represent as a man of more than common accomplishment take any pleasure in he seraglio when it be fill only with woman like these be they exquisitely beautiful they do not say pekuah want that unaffecting and ignoble beauty which may subsist without sprightliness or sublimity without energy of thought or dignity of virtue but to a man like the arab such beauty be only a flower casually pluck and carelessly throw away whatever pleasure he might find among they they be not those of friendship or society when they be play about he he look on they with inattentive superiority : when they vie for he regard he sometimes turn away disgust as they have no knowledge they talk could take nothing from the tediousness of life as they have no choice they fondness or appearance of fondness excite in he neither pride nor gratitude he be not exalt in he own esteem by the smile of a woman who see no other man nor be much oblige by that regard of which he could never know the sincerity and which he might often perceive to be exert not so much to delight he as to pain a rival that which he give and they receive as love be only a careless distribution of superfluous time such love as man can bestow upon that which he despise such as have neither hope nor fear neither joy nor sorrow you have reason lady to think yourself happy say imlac that you have be thus easily dismiss how could a mind hungry for knowledge be willing in a intellectual famine to lose such a banquet as pekuah 's conversation i be incline to believe answer pekuah that he be for sometime in suspense for notwithstanding he promise whenever i propose to despatch a messenger to cairo he find some excuse for delay while i be detain in he house he make many incursion into the neighbouring country and perhaps he would have refuse to discharge I have he plunder be equal to he wish he return always courteous related he adventure delighted to hear my observation and endeavor to advance my acquaintance with the star when i importune he to send away my letter he soothe I with profession of honor and sincerity and when i could be no longer decently deny put he troop again in motion and leave I to govern in he absence i be much afflict by this study procrastination and be sometimes afraid that i should be forget that you would leave cairo and i must end my day in a island of the nile i grow at last hopeless and dejected and care so little to entertain he that he for awhile more frequently talk with my maid that he should fall in love with they or with I might have be equally fatal and i be not much pleased with the grow friendship my anxiety be not long for as i recover some degree of cheerfulness he return to I and i could not forbear to despise my former uneasiness he still delay to send for my ransome and would perhaps never have determine have not you agent find he way to he the gold which he would not fetch he could not reject when it be offer he hasten to prepare for we journey hither like a man deliver from the pain of a intestine conflict i take leave of my companion in the house who dismiss I with cold indifference nekayah have hear she favorite 's relation rise and embrace she and rassela give she a hundred ounce of gold which she present to the arab for the fifty that be promise chap xl the history of a man of learn they return to cairo and be so well pleased at find themselves together that none of they go much abroad the prince begin to love learning and one day declare to imlac that he intend to devote himself to science and pass the rest of he day in literary solitude before you make you final choice answer imlac you ought to examine its hazard and converse with some of those who be grow old in the company of themselves i have just leave the observatory of one of the most learn astronomer in the world who have spend forty year in unwearied attention to the motion and appearance of the celestial body and have draw out he soul in endless calculation he admit a few friend once a month to hear he deduction and enjoy he discovery i be introduce as a man of knowledge worthy of he notice man of various idea and fluent conversation be commonly welcome to those whose thought have be long fix upon a single point and who find the image of other thing steal away i delighted he with my remark he smile at the narrative of my travels and be glad to forget the constellation and descend for a moment into the lower world on the next day of vacation i renew my visit and be so fortunate as to please he again he relax from that time the severity of he rule and permit I to enter at my own choice i find he always busy and always glad to be relieve as each know much which the other be desirous of learn we exchange we notion with great delight i perceive that i have every day more of he confidence and always find new cause of admiration in the profundity of he mind he comprehension be vast he memory capacious and retentive he discourse be methodical and he expression clear he integrity and benevolence be equal to he learn he deepest research and most favorite study be willingly interrupted for any opportunity of do good by he counsel or he riches to he closest retreat at he most busy moment all be admit that want he assistance : ` for though i exclude idleness and pleasure i will never ' say he bar my door against charity to man be permit the contemplation of the sky but the practice of virtue be command ' surely say the princess this man be happy i visit he say imlac with more and more frequency and be every time more enamoured of he conversation : he be sublime without haughtiness courteous without formality and communicative without ostentation i be at first great princess of you opinion think he the happiest of mankind and often congratulate he on the blessing that he enjoy he seem to hear nothing with indifference but the praise of he condition to which he always return a general answer and divert the conversation to some other topick amidst this willingness to be pleased and labor to please i have quickly reason to imagine that some painful sentiment press upon he mind he often look up earnestly towards the sun and let he voice fall in the midst of he discourse he would sometimes when we be alone gaze upon I in silence with the air of a man who long to speak what he be yet resolve to suppress he would often send for I with vehement injunction of haste though when i come to he he have nothing extraordinary to say and sometimes when i be leave he would call I back pause a few moment and then dismiss I chap xli the astronomer discover the cause of he uneasiness at last the time come when the secret burst he reserve we be sit together last night in the turret of he house watch the emersion of a satellite of jupiter a sudden tempest cloud the sky and disappointed we observation we sit awhile silent in the dark and then he address himself to I in these word : ` imlac i have long consider thy friendship as the greatest blessing of my life integrity without knowledge be weak and useless and knowledge without integrity be dangerous and dreadful i have find in thee all the quality requisite for trust -- benevolence experience and fortitude i have long discharge a office which i must soon quit at the call of nature and shall rejoice in the hour of imbecility and pain to devolve it upon thee ' i think myself honor by this testimony and protest that whatever could conduce to he happiness would add likewise to mine ` hear imlac what thou wilt not without difficulty credit i have possess for five year the regulation of weather and the distribution of the season : the sun have listen to my dictate and pass from tropick to tropick by my direction the cloud at my call have pour they water and the nile have overflow at my command i have restrain the rage of the dog-star and mitigate the fervor of the crab the wind alone of all the elemental power have hitherto refuse my authority and multitude have perish by equinoctial tempest which i find myself unable to prohibit or restrain i have administer this great office with exact justice and make to the different nation of the earth a impartial dividend of rain and sunshine what must have be the misery of half the globe if i have limit the cloud to particular region or confine the sun to either side of the equator ' chap xlii the opinion of the astronomer be explain and justified i suppose he discover in I through the obscurity of the room some token of amazement and doubt for after a short pause he proceed thus : ` not to be easily credit will neither surprise nor offend I for i be probably the first of human being to whom this trust have be impart nor do i know whether to deem this distinction a reward or punishment since i have possess it i have be far less happy than before and nothing but the consciousness of good intention could have enable I to support the weariness of unremitted vigilance ' how long sir say i have this great office be in you hand ` about ten year ago ' say he ` my daily observation of the change of the sky lead I to consider whether if i have the power of the season i could confer greater plenty upon the inhabitant of the earth this contemplation fasten on my mind and i sit day and night in imaginary dominion pour upon this country and that the shower of fertility and second every fall of rain with a due proportion of sunshine i have yet only the will to do good and do not imagine that i should ever have the power ` one day as i be look on the field wither with heat i feel in my mind a sudden wish that i could send rain on the southern mountain and raise the nile to a inundation in the hurry of my imagination i command rain to fall and by compare the time of my command with that of the inundation i find that the cloud have listen to my lip ' might not some other cause say i produce this concurrence the nile do not always rise on the same day ` do not believe ' say he with impatience ` that such objection could escape I : i reason long against my own conviction and labor against truth with the utmost obstinacy i sometimes suspect myself of madness and should not have dare to impart this secret but to a man like you capable of distinguish the wonderful from the impossible and the incredible from the false ' why sir say i do you call that incredible which you know or think you know to be true ` because ' say he ' i can not prove it by any external evidence and i know too well the law of demonstration to think that my conviction ought to influence another who can not like I be conscious of its force i therefore shall not attempt to gain credit by disputation it be sufficient that i feel this power that i have long possess and every day exert it but the life of man be short the infirmity of age increase upon I and the time will soon come when the regulator of the year must mingle with the dust the care of appoint a successor have long disturbed I the night and the day have be spend in comparison of all the character which have come to my knowledge and i have yet find none so worthy as thyself ' chap xliii the astronomer leave imlac he direction ` hear therefore what i shall impart with attention such as the welfare of the world require if the task of a king be consider as difficult who have the care only of a few million to whom he can not do much good or harm what must be the anxiety of he on whom depend the action of the element and the great gift of light and heat -- hear I therefore with attention ' i have diligently consider the position of the earth and sun and form innumerable scheme in which i change they situation i have sometimes turn aside the axis of the earth and sometimes vary the ecliptick of the sun : but i have find it impossible to make a disposition by which the world may be advantage what one region gain another lose by a imaginable alteration even without consider the distant part of the solar system with which ye be unacquainted do not therefore in thy administration of the year indulge thy pride by innovation do not please thyself with think that thou canst make thyself renown to all future age by disorder the season the memory of mischief be no desirable fame much less will it become thee to let kindness or interest prevail never rob other country of rain to pour it on thine own for we the nile be sufficient ' i promise that when i possess the power i would use it with inflexible integrity and he dismiss I press my hand ` my heart ' say he ` will be now at rest and my benevolence will no more destroy my quiet : i have find a man of wisdom and virtue to whom i can cheerfully bequeath the inheritance of the sun ' the prince hear this narration with very serious regard but the princess smile and pekuah convulse herself with laughter lady say imlac to mock the heaviest of human affliction be neither charitable nor wise few can attain this man 's knowledge and few practice he virtue but all may suffer he calamity of the uncertainty of we present state the most dreadful and alarming be the uncertain continuance of reason the princess be recollect and the favorite be abashed rassela more deeply affect inquire of imlac whether he think such malady of the mind frequent and how they be contract chap xliv the dangerous prevalence of imagination disorder of intellect answer imlac happen much more often than superficial observer will easily believe perhaps if we speak with rigorous exactness no human mind be in its right state -lrb- a -rrb- there be no man whose imagination do not sometimes predominate over he reason who can regulate he attention wholly by he will and whose idea will come and go at he command no man will be find in whose mind airy notion do not sometimes tyrannize and force he to hope or fear beyond the limit of sober probability all power of fancy over reason be a degree of insanity but while this power be such as we can control and repress it be not visible to other nor consider as any deprivation of the mental faculty : it be not pronounced madness but when it become ungovernable and apparently influence speech or action to indulge the power of fiction and send imagination out upon the wing be often the sport of those who delight too much in silent speculation when we be alone we be not always busy the labor of excogitation be too violent to last long the ardor of inquiry will sometimes give way to idleness or satiety he who have nothing external that can divert he must find pleasure in he own thought and must conceive himself what he be not for who be please with what he be he then expatiate in boundless futurity and cull from all imaginable condition that which for the present moment he should most desire amuse he desire with impossible enjoyment and confer upon he pride unattainable dominion the mind dance from scene to scene unite all pleasure in all combination and riot in delight which nature and fortune with all they bounty can not bestow in time some particular train of idea fix the attention all other intellectual gratification be reject the mind in weariness or leisure recur constantly to the favorite conception and feast on the luscious falsehood whenever she be offend with the bitterness of truth by degree the reign of fancy be confirm she grow first imperious and in time despotick then fiction begin to operate as reality false opinion fasten upon the mind and life pass in dream of rapture or of anguish this sir be one of the danger of solitude which the hermit have confess not always to promote goodness and the astronomer 's misery have prove to be not always propitious to wisdom i will no more say the favorite imagine myself the queen of abissinium i have often spend the hour which the princess give to my own disposal in adjust ceremony and regulate the court i have repress the pride of the powerful and grant the petition of the poor i have build new palace in more happy situation plant grove upon the top of mountain and have exult in the beneficence of royalty till when the princess enter i have almost forget to bow down before she and i say the princess will not allow myself any more to play the shepherdess in my wake dream i have often soothed my thought with the quiet and innocence of pastoral employment till i have in my chamber hear the wind whistle and the sheep bleat : sometimes free the lamb entangled in the thicket and sometimes with my crook encounter the wolf i have a dress like that of the village maid which i put on to help my imagination and a pipe on which i play softly and suppose myself follow by my flock i will confess say the prince a indulgence of fantastick delight more dangerous than yours i have frequently endeavor to image the possibility of a perfect government by which all wrong should be restrain all vice reform and all the subject preserved in tranquillity and innocence this think produce innumerable scheme of reformation and dictate many useful regulation and salutary edict this have be the sport and sometimes the labor of my solitude and i start when i think with how little anguish i once suppose the death of my father and my brother such say imlac be the effect of visionary scheme when we first form they we know they to be absurd but familiarize they by degree and in time lose sight of they folly -lrb- a -rrb- see traite médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale par pinel dr willi define in remarkable accordance with this case in rassela insanity to be the tendency of a mind to cherish one idea or one set of idea to the exclusion of other -- ed chap xlv they discourse with a old man the evening be now far past and they rise to return home as they walk along the bank of the nile delighted with the beam of the moon quiver on the water they see at a small distance a old man whom the prince have often hear in the assembly of the sage yonder say he be one whose year have calm he passion but not cloud he reason : let we close the disquisition of the night by inquire what be he sentiment of he own state that we may know whether youth alone be to struggle with vexation and whether any better hope remain for the latter part of life here the sage approach and salute they they invite he to join they walk and prattle awhile as acquaintance that have unexpectedly meet one another the old man be cheerful and talkative and the way seem short in he company he be please to find himself not disregard accompany they to they house and at the prince 's request enter with they they place he in the seat of honor and set wine and conserve before he sir say the princess a evening walk must give to a man of learn like you pleasure which ignorance and youth can hardly conceive you know the quality and the cause of all that you behold the law by which the river flow the period in which the planet perform they revolution every thing must supply you with contemplation and renew the consciousness of you own dignity lady answer he let the gay and the vigorous expect pleasure in they excursion it be enough that age can obtain ease to I the world have lose its novelty : i look round and see what i remember to have see in happier day i rest against a tree and consider that in the same shade i once dispute upon the annual overflow of the nile with a friend who be now silent in the grave i cast my eye upward fix they on the change moon and think with pain on the vicissitude of life i have cease to take much delight in physical truth for what have i to do with those thing which i be soon to leave you may at least recreate yourself say imlac with the recollection of a honorable and useful life and enjoy the praise which all agree to give you praise say the sage with a sigh be to a old man a empty sound i have neither mother to be delighted with the reputation of she son nor wife to partake the honor of she husband i have outlive my friend and my rival nothing be now of much importance for i can not extend my interest beyond myself youth be delighted with applause because it be consider as the earnest of some future good and because the prospect of life be far extend but to I who be now decline to decrepitude there be little to be fear from the malevolence of man and yet less to be hope from they affection or esteem something they may yet take away but they can give I nothing riches would now be useless and high employment would be pain my retrospect of life recall to my view many opportunity of good neglect much time squander upon trifle and more lose in idleness and vacancy i leave many great design unattempted and many great attempt unfinished my mind be burden with no heavy crime and therefore i compose myself to tranquillity endeavor to abstract my thought from hope and care which though reason know they to be vain still try to keep they old possession of the heart expect with serene humility that hour which nature can not long delay and hope to possess in a better state that happiness which here i could not find and that virtue which here i have not attain he rise and go away leave he audience not much elate with the hope of long life the prince console himself with remark that it be not reasonable to be disappoint by this account for age have never be consider as the season of felicity and if it be possible to be easy in decline and weakness it be likely that the day of vigor and alacrity might be happy that the noon of life might be bright if the evening could be calm the princess suspect that age be querulous and malignant and delighted to repress the expectation of those who have newly enter the world she have see the possessor of estate look with envy on they heir and know many who enjoy pleasure no longer than they could confine it to themselves pekuah conjecture that the man be older than he appear and be willing to impute he complaint to delirious dejection : or else suppose that he have be unfortunate and be therefore discontented : for nothing say she be more common than to call we own condition the condition of life imlac who have no desire to see they depressed smile at the comfort which they could so readily procure to themselves and remember that at the same age he be equally confident of unmingled prosperity and equally fertile of consolatory expedient he forbear to force upon they unwelcome knowledge which time itself would too soon impress the princess and she lady retire the madness of the astronomer hang on they mind and they desire imlac to enter upon he office and delay next morning the rising of the sun chap xlvi the princess and pekuah visit the astronomer the princess and pekuah have talk in private of imlac 's astronomer think he character at once so amiable and so strange that they could not be satisfy without a nearer knowledge and imlac be request to find the means of bring they together this be somewhat difficult the philosopher have never receive any visit from woman though he live in a city that have in it many european who follow the manners of they own country and many from other part of the world that live there with european liberty the lady would not be refuse and several scheme be propose for the accomplishment of they design it be propose to introduce they as stranger in distress to whom the sage be always accessible but after some deliberation it appear that by this artifice no acquaintance could be form for they conversation would be short and they could not decently importune he often this say rassela be true but i have yet a stronger objection against the misrepresentation of you state i have always consider it as treason against the great republick of human nature to make any man 's virtue the means of deceive he whether on great or little occasion all imposture weaken confidence and chill benevolence when the sage find that you be not what you seem he will feel the resentment natural to a man who conscious of great ability discover that he have be trick by understanding meaner than he own and perhaps the distrust which he can never afterwards wholly lay aside may stop the voice of counsel and close the hand of charity and where will you find the power of restore he benefaction to mankind or he peace to himself to this no reply be attempt and imlac begin to hope that they curiosity would subside but next day pekuah tell he she have now find a honest pretence for a visit to the astronomer for she would solicit permission to continue under he the study in which she have be initiate by the arab and the princess might go with she either as a fellow-student or because a woman could not decently come alone i be afraid say imlac that he will be soon weary of you company : man advance far in knowledge do not love to repeat the element of they art and i be not certain that even of the element as he will deliver they connect with inference and mingle with reflection you be a very capable auditress that say pekuah must be my care : i ask of you only to take I thither my knowledge be perhaps more than you imagine it and by concur always with he opinion i shall make he think it greater than it be the astronomer in pursuance of this resolution be tell that a foreign lady travel in search of knowledge have hear of he reputation and be desirous to become he scholar the uncommonness of the proposal raise at once he surprise and curiosity and when after a short deliberation he consent to admit she he could not stay without impatience till the next day the lady dress themselves magnificently and be attend by imlac to the astronomer who be please to see himself approach with respect by person of so splendid a appearance in the exchange of the first civility he be timorous and bashful but when the talk become regular he recollect he power and justify the character which imlac have give inquire of pekuah what could have turn she inclination toward astronomy he receive from she a history of she adventure at the pyramid and of the time pass in the arab 's island she tell she tale with ease and elegance and she conversation take possession of he heart the discourse be then turn to astronomy pekuah display what she know : he look upon she as a prodigy of genius and entreat she not to desist from a study which she have so happily begin they come again and again and be every time more welcome than before the sage endeavor to amuse they that they might prolong they visit for he find he thought grow brighter in they company the cloud of solicitude vanish by degree as he force himself to entertain they and he grieve when he be leave at they departure to he old employment of regulate the season the princess and she favorite have now watch he lip for several month and could not catch a single word from which they could judge whether he continue or not in the opinion of he preternatural commission they often contrived to bring he to a open declaration but he easily elude all they attack and on which side soever they press he escape from they to some other topick as they familiarity increase they invite he often to the house of imlac where they distinguish he by extraordinary respect he begin gradually to delight in sublunary pleasure he come early and depart late labor to recommend himself by assiduity and compliance excite they curiosity after new art that they might still want he assistance and when they make any excursion of pleasure or inquiry entreat to attend they by long experience of he integrity and wisdom the prince and he sister be convince that he might be trust without danger and lest he should draw any false hope from the civility which he receive discover to he they condition with the motive of they journey and require he opinion on the choice of life of the various condition which the world spread before you which you shall prefer say the sage i be not able to instruct you i can only tell that i have choose wrong i have pass my time in study without experience in the attainment of science which can for the most part be but remotely useful to mankind i have purchase knowledge at the expense of all the common comfort of life : i have miss the endearing elegance of female friendship and the happy commerce of domestick tenderness if i have obtain any prerogative above other student they have be accompany with fear disquiet and scrupulosity but even of these prerogative whatever they be i have since my thought have be diversify by more intercourse with the world begin to question the reality when i have be for a few day lose in please dissipation i be always tempt to think that my inquiry have end in error and that i have suffer much and suffer it in vain imlac be delighted to find that the sage 's understanding be break through its mist and resolve to detain he from the planet till he should forget he task of rule they and reason should recover its original influence from this time the astronomer be receive into familiar friendship and partook of all they project and pleasure : he respect keep he attentive and the activity of rassela do not leave much time unengaged something be always to be do the day be spend in make observation which furnish talk for the evening and the evening be close with a scheme for the morrow the sage confess to imlac that since he have mingle in the gay tumult of life and divide he hour by a succession of amusement he find the conviction of he authority over the sky fade gradually from he mind and begin to trust less to a opinion which he never could prove to other and which he now find subject to variation from cause in which reason have no part if i be accidentally leave alone for a few hour say he my inveterate persuasion rush upon my soul and my thought be chained down by some irresistible violence but they be soon disentangle by the prince 's conversation and instantaneously release at the entrance of pekuah i be like a man habitually afraid of spectre who be set at ease by a lamp and wonder at the dread which harass he in the dark yet if he lamp be extinguish feel again the terror which he know that when it be light he shall feel no more but i be sometimes afraid lest i indulge my quiet by criminal negligence and voluntarily forget the great charge with which i be intrust if i favor myself in a known error or be determine by my own ease in a doubtful question of this importance how dreadful be my crime no disease of the imagination answer imlac be so difficult of cure as that which be complicate with the dread of guilt : fancy and conscience then act interchangeably upon we and so often shift they place that the illusion of one be not distinguish from the dictate of the other if fancy present image not moral or religious the mind drive they away when they give it pain but when melancholick notion take the form of duty they lay hold on the faculty without opposition because we be afraid to exclude or banish they for this reason the superstitious be often melancholy and the melancholy almost always superstitious but do not let the suggestion of timidity overpower you better reason : the danger of neglect can be but as the probability of the obligation which when you consider it with freedom you find very little and that little grow every day less open you heart to the influence of the light which from time to time break in upon you : when scruple importune you which you in you lucid moment know to be vain do not stand to parley but fly to business or to pekuah and keep this thought always prevalent that you be only one atom of the mass of humanity and have neither such virtue nor vice as that you should be single out for supernatural favor or affliction chap xlvii the prince enter and bring a new topick all this say the astronomer i have often think but my reason have be so long subjugate by a uncontroulable and overwhelming idea that it dare not confide in its own decision i now see how fatally i betray my quiet by suffer chimera to prey upon I in secret but melancholy shrink from communication and i never find a man before to whom i could impart my trouble though i have be certain of relief i rejoice to find my own sentiment confirm by yours who be not easily deceive and can have no motive or purpose to deceive i hope that time and variety will dissipate the gloom that have so long surround I and the latter part of my day will be spend in peace you learning and virtue say imlac may justly give you hope rassela then enter with the princess and pekuah and inquire whether they have contrived any new diversion for the next day such say nekayah be the state of life that none be happy but by the anticipation of change : the change itself be nothing : when we have make it the next wish be to change again the world be not yet exhaust let I see something to-morrow which i never see before variety say rassela be so necessary to content that even the happy valley disgust I by the recurrence of its luxury yet i could not forbear to reproach myself with impatience when i see the monk of st anthony support without complaint a life not of uniform delight but uniform hardship those man answer imlac be less wretched in they silent convent than the abissinian prince in they prison of pleasure whatever be do by the monk be incite by a adequate and reasonable motive they labor supply they with necessaries it therefore can not be omit and be certainly reward they devotion prepare they for another state and remind they of its approach while it fit they for it they time be regularly distribute one duty succeed another so that they be not leave open to the distraction of unguided choice nor lose in the shades of listless inactivity there be a certain task to be perform at a appropriate hour and they toil be cheerful because they consider they as act of piety by which they be always advance towards endless felicity do you think say nekayah that the monastick rule be a more holy and less imperfect state than any other may not he equally hope for future happiness who converse openly with mankind who succor the distressed by he charity instruct the ignorant by he learning and contribute by he industry to the general system of life : even though he should omit some of the mortification which be practice in the cloister and allow himself such harmless delight as he condition may place within he reach this say imlac be a question which have long divide the wise and perplex the good i be afraid to decide on either part he that live well in the world be better than he that live well in a monastery but perhaps every one be not able to stem the temptation of publick life and if he can not conquer he may properly retreat some have little power to do good and have likewise little strength to resist evil many be weary of they conflict with adversity and be willing to eject those passion which have long busy they in vain and many be dismiss by age and disease from the more laborious duty of society in monastery the weak and timorous may be happily sheltered the weary may repose and the penitent may meditate those retreat of prayer and contemplation have something so congenial to the mind of man that perhaps there be scarcely one that do not propose to close he life in pious abstraction with a few associate serious as himself such say pekuah have often be my wish and i have hear the princess declare that she should not willingly die in a crowd the liberty of use harmless pleasure proceed imlac will not be dispute but it be still to be examine what pleasure be harmless the evil of any pleasure that nekayah can image be not in the act itself but in its consequence pleasure in itself harmless may become mischievous by endearing to we a state which we know to be transient and probatory and withdraw we thought from that of which every hour bring we nearer to the beginning and of which no length of time will bring we to the end mortification be not virtuous in itself nor have any other use but that it disengage we from the allurement of sense in the state of future perfection to which we all aspire there will be pleasure without danger and security without restraint the princess be silent and rasselas turn to the astronomer ask he whether he could not delay she retreat by show she something which she have not see before you curiosity say the sage have be so general and you pursuit of knowledge so vigorous that novelty be not now very easily to be find but what you can no longer procure from the living may be give by the dead among the wonder of this country be the catacomb or the ancient repository in which the body of the earliest generation be lodge and where by the virtue of the gum which embalm they they yet remain without corruption i know not say rassela what pleasure the sight of the catacomb can afford but since nothing else offer i be resolve to view they and shall place this with many other thing which i have do because i would do something they hire a guard of horseman and the next day visit the catacomb when they be about to descend into the sepulchral cave pekuah say the princess we be now again invade the habitation of the dead : i know that you will stay behind let I find you safe when i return no i will not be leave answer pekuah i will go down between you and the prince they then all descend and rove with wonder through the labyrinth of subterraneous passage where the body be lay in row on either side chap xlviii imlac discourse on the nature of the soul what reason say the prince can be give why the egyptian should thus expensively preserve those carcass which some nation consume with fire other lay to mingle with the earth and all agree to remove from they sight as soon as decent rite can be perform the original of ancient custom say imlac be commonly unknown for the practice often continue when the cause have cease and concern superstitious ceremony it be vain to conjecture for what reason do not dictate reason can not explain i have long believe that the practice of embalming arise only from tenderness to the remains of relation or friend and to this opinion i be more inclined because it seem impossible that this care should have be general : have all the dead be embalm they repository must in time have be more spacious than the dwelling of the living i suppose only the rich or honorable be secure from corruption and the rest leave to the course of nature but it be commonly suppose that the egyptian believe the soul to live as long as the body continue undissolved and therefore try this method of elude death could the wise egyptian say nekayah think so grossly of the soul if the soul could once survive its separation what could it afterwards receive or suffer from the body the egyptian would doubtless think erroneously say the astronomer in the darkness of heathenism and the first dawn of philosophy the nature of the soul be still dispute amidst all we opportunity of clearer knowledge some yet say that it may be material who nevertheless believe it to be immortal some answer imlac have indeed say that the soul be material but i can scarcely believe that any man have think it who know how to think for all the conclusion of reason enforce the immateriality of mind and all the notice of sense and investigation of science concur to prove the unconsciousness of matter it be never suppose that cogitation be inherent in matter or that every particle be a thinking be yet if any part of matter be devoid of thought what part can we suppose to think matter can differ from matter only in form density bulk motion and direction of motion : to which of these however varied or combine can consciousness be annex to be round or square to be solid or fluid to be great or little to be move slowly or swiftly one way or another be mode of material existence all equally alien from the nature of cogitation if matter be once without think it can only be make to think by some new modification but all the modification which it can admit be equally unconnected with cogitative power but the materialist say the astronomer urge that matter may have quality with which we be unacquainted he who will determine return imlac against that which he know because there may be something which he know not he that can set hypothetical possibility against acknowledge certainty be not to be admit among reasonable being all that we know of matter be that matter be inert senseless and lifeless and if this conviction can not be oppose but by refer we to something that we know not we have all the evidence that human intellect can admit if that which be know may be overrule by that which be unknown no be not omniscient can arrive at certainty yet let we not say the astronomer too arrogantly limit the creator 's power it be no limitation of omnipotence reply the poet to suppose that one thing be not consistent with another that the same proposition can not be at once true and false that the same number can not be even and odd that cogitation can not be confer on that which be create incapable of cogitation i know not say nekayah any great use of this question do that immateriality which in my opinion you have sufficiently prove necessarily include eternal duration of immateriality say imlac we idea be negative and therefore obscure immateriality seem to imply a natural power of perpetual duration as a consequence of exemption from all cause of decay : whatever perish be destroy by the solution of its contexture and separation of its part nor can we conceive how that which have no part and therefore admit no solution can be naturally corrupt or impaired i know not say rassela how to conceive any thing without extension what be extend must have part and you allow that whatever have part may be destroy consider you own conception reply imlac and the difficulty will be less you will find substance without extension a ideal form be no less real than material bulk : yet a ideal form have no extension it be no less certain when you think on a pyramid that you mind possess the idea of a pyramid than that the pyramid itself be stand what space do the idea of a pyramid occupy more than the idea of a grain of corn or how can either idea suffer laceration as be the effect such be the cause : as think such be the power that think a power impassive and indiscerptible but the be say nekayah whom i fear to name the be which make the soul can destroy it he surely can destroy it answer imlac since however unperishable it receive from a superior nature its power of duration that it will not perish by any inherent cause of decay or principle of corruption may be show by philosophy but philosophy can tell no more that it will not be annihilate by he that make it we must humbly learn from higher authority the whole assembly stand awhile silent and collect let we return say rassela from this scene of mortality how gloomy would be these mansion of the dead to he who do not know that he should never die that what now act shall continue its agency and what now think shall think on for ever those that lie here stretch before we the wise and the powerful of ancient time warn we to remember the shortness of we present state : they be perhaps snatch away while they be busy like we in the choice of life to I say the princess the choice of life be become less important i hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity they then hasten out of the cavern and under the protection of they guard return to cairo chap xlix this conclusion in which nothing be conclude it be now the time of the inundation of the nile : a few day after they visit to the catacomb the river begin to rise they be confine to they house the whole region be under water give they no invitation to any excursion and be well supply with material for talk they divert themselves with comparison of the different form of life which they have observe and with various scheme of happiness which each of they have form pekuah be never so much charm with any place as the convent of st anthony where the arab restore she to the princess and wish only to fill it with pious maiden and to be make prioress of the order : she be weary of expectation and disgust and would gladly be fix in some unvariable state the princess think that of all sublunary thing knowledge be the best : she desire first to learn all science and then purpose to find a college of learn woman in which she would preside that by converse with the old and educate the young she might divide she time between the acquisition and communication of wisdom and raise up fur the next age model of prudence and pattern of piety the prince desire a little kingdom in which he might administer justice in he own person and see all the part of government with he own eye but he could never fix the limit of he dominion and be always add to the number of he subject imlac and the astronomer be contented to be drive along the stream of life without direct they course to any particular port of these wish that they have form they well know that none could be obtain they deliberate awhile what be to be do and resolve when the inundation should cease to return to abissinium letter i -- to mr jame elphinston sept 25th 1750 dear sir -- you have as i find by every kind of evidence lose a excellent mother and i hope you will not think I incapable of partaking of you grief i have a mother now eighty-two year of age whom therefore i must soon lose unless it please god that she rather should mourn for I i read the letter in which you relate you mother 's death to mr strahan and think i do myself honor when i tell you that i read they with tear but tear be neither to you nor to I of any farther use when once the tribute of nature have be pay the business of life summons we away from useless grief and call we to the exercise of those virtue of which we be lament we deprivation the greatest benefit which one friend can confer upon another be to guard and excite and elevate he virtue this you mother will still perform if you diligently preserve the memory of she life and of she death : a life so far as i can learn useful wise and innocent and a death resign peaceful and holy i can not forbear to mention that neither reason nor revelation deny you to hope that you may increase she happiness by obey she precept and that she may in she present state look with pleasure upon every act of virtue to which she instruction or example have contribute whether this be more than a please dream or a just opinion of separate spirit be indeed of no great importance to we when we consider ourselves as act under the eye of god : yet surely there be something pleasing in the belief that we separation from those whom we love be merely corporeal and it may be a great incitement to virtuous friendship if it can be make probable that that union which have receive the divine approbation shall continue to eternity there be one expedient by which you may in some degree continue she presence if you write down minutely what you remember of she from you earliest year you will read it with great pleasure and receive from it many hint of soothing recollection when time shall remove she yet farther from you and you grief shall be mature to veneration to this however painful for the present i can not but advise you as to a source of comfort and satisfaction in the time to come for all comfort and all satisfaction be sincerely wish you by dear sir you most oblige most obedient and most humble servant sam johnson ii -- to mr thrale london aug 13 1765 madam -- if you have really so good a opinion of I as you express it will not be necessary to inform you how unwillingly i miss the opportunity of come to brighthelmstone in mr thrale 's company or since i

to tell you that i be sorry both for the poor lady and for you be useless i can not help either of you the weakness of mind be perhaps only a casual interruption or intermission of the attention such as we all suffer when some weighty care or urgent calamity have possession of the mind she will compose herself she be unwilling to die and the first conviction of approach death raise great perturbation i think she have but very lately think death close at hand she will compose herself to do that as well as she can which must at last be do may she not want the divine assistance you madam will have a great loss a greater than be common in the loss of a parent fill you mind with hope of she happiness and turn you thought first to he who give and take away in whose presence the living and dead be stand together then remember that when this mournful duty be pay other yet remain of equal obligation and we may hope of less painful performance grief be a species of idleness and the necessity of attention to the present preserve we by the merciful disposition of providence from be lacerate and devour by sorrow for the past you must think on you husband and you child and do what this dear lady have do for you not to come to town while the great struggle continue be undoubtedly well resolve but do not harass yourself into danger you owe the care of you health to all that love you at least to all whom it be you duty to love you can not give such a mother too much if you do not give she what belong to another i be & c xiv -- to mr thrale April 27 1773 dear madam -- hope be more please than fear but not less fallacious you know when you do not try to deceive yourself that the disease which at last be to destroy must be gradually grow worse and that it be vain to wish for more than that the descent to death may be slow and easy in this wish i join with you and hope it will be grant dear dear lady whenever she be lose she will be miss and whenever she be remembered she will be lament be it a good or a evil to I that she now love I it be surely a good for you will love I better and we shall have a new principle of concord and i shall be happier with honest sorrow than with sullen indifference : and far happier still than with counterfeit sympathy i be reasoning upon a principle very far from certain a confidence of survivance you or i or both may be call into the presence of the supreme judge before she i have live a life of which i do not like the review surely i shall in time live better i sit down with a intention to write high compliment but my thought have take another course and some other time must now serve to tell you with what other emotion benevolence and fidelity i be & c xv -- to the same may 17 1773 madam -- never imagine that you letter be long they be always too short for my curiosity i do not know that i be ever content with a single perusal of dear mrs salusbury i never expect much better news than you send I _ de pis en pis _ be the natural and certain course of she dreadful malady i be content when it leave she ease enough for the exercise of she mind why should mr \*\*\*\* suppose that what i take the liberty of suggest be concerted with you he do not know how much i revolve he affair and how honestly i desire he prosperity i hope he have let the hint take some hold of he mind you declaration to miss \*\*\*\* be more general than my opinion allow i think a unlimited promise of act by the opinion of another so wrong that nothing or hardly anything can make it right all unnecessary vow be folly because they suppose a prescience of the future which have not be give we they be i think a crime because they resign that life to chance which god have give we to be regulate by reason and superinduce a kind of fatality from which it be the great privilege of we nature to be free unlimited obedience be due only to the universal father of heaven and earth my parent may be mad and foolish may be wicked and malicious may be erroneously religious or absurdly scrupulous i be not bind to compliance with mandate either positive or negative which either religion condemn or reason reject there wander about the world a wild notion which extend over marriage more than over any other transaction if miss \*\*\*\* follow a trade would it be say that she be bind in conscience to give or refuse credit at she father 's choice and be not marriage a thing in which she be more interested and have therefore more right of choice when i may suffer for my own crime when i may be sue for my own debt i may judge by parity of reason for my own happiness the parent 's moral right can arise only from he kindness and he civil right only from he money conscience can not dictate obedience to the wicked or compliance with the foolish and of interest mere prudence be the judge if the daughter be bind without a promise she promise nothing and if she be not bind she promise too much what be mean by tie up money in trade i do not understand no money be so little tie as that which be employ in trade mr \*\*\*\* perhaps only mean that in consideration of money to be advance he will oblige he son to be a trader this be reasonable enough upon ten thousand pound diligently occupy they may live in great plenty and splendor without the mischief of idleness i can write a long letter as well as my mistress and shall be glad that my long letter may be as welcome as hers my night be grow again very uneasy and troublesome i know not that the country will mend they but i hope you company will mend my day though i can not now expect much attention and would not wish for more than can be spare from the poor dear lady yet i shall see you and hear you every now and then and to see and hear you be always to hear wit and to see virtue i shall i hope see you to-morrow and a little on the two next day and with that little i must for the present try to be contented i be & c xvi -- to mr thrale August 12 1773 dear

stilton one stage short of stamford where we intend to have lodge on the 7th we pass through stamford and grantham and dine at newark where i have only time to observe that the market-place be uncommonly spacious and neat in london we should call it a square though the side be neither straight nor parallel we come at night to doncaster and go to church in the morning where chamber find the monument of robert of doncaster who say on he stone something like this : -- what i give that i have what i spend that i have what i leave that i lose -- so saith robert of doncaster who reign in the world sixty-seven year and all that time live not one here we be invite to dinner and therefore make no great haste away we reach york however that night i be much disorder with old complaint next morning we see the minster a edifice of loftiness and elegance equal to the highest hope of architecture i remember nothing but the dome of st paul 's that can be compare with the middle walk the chapter-house be a circular building very stately but i think excel by the chapter-house of lincoln i then go to see the ruin of the abbey which be almost vanish and i remember nothing of they distinct the next visit be to the gaol which they call the castle a fabrick build lately such be terrestrial mutability out of the material of the ruin abbey the under gaoler be very officious to show he fetter in which there be no contrivance the head gaoler come in and see I look i suppose fatigue offer I wine and when i go away would not suffer he servant to take money the gaol be account the best in the kingdom and you find the gaoler deserving of he dignity we dine at york and go on to northallerton a place of which i know nothing but that it afford we a lodging on Monday night and about

think i want time the next stage bring we to durham a place of which mr thrale bid I take particular notice the bishop 's palace have the appearance of a old feudal castle build upon a eminence and look down upon the river upon which be formerly throw a drawbridge as i suppose to be raise at night lest the scot should pass it the cathedral have a massiness and solidity such as i have see in no other place it rather awe than please as it strike with a kind of gigantick dignity and aspire to no other praise than that of rocky solidity and indeterminate duration i have none of my friend resident and therefore see but little the library be mean and scanty at durham beside all expectation i meet a old friend : miss fordyce be marry there to a physician we meet i think with honest kindness on both side i think she much decayed and have since hear that the banker have involve she husband in he extensive ruin i can not forbear to think that i saw in she withered feature more

trouble on Tuesday night we come hither yesterday i take some care of myself and to-day i be _ quite polite _ i have be take a view of all that could be show I and find that all very near to nothing you have often hear I complain of find myself disappoint by book of travels i be afraid travel itself will end likewise in disappointment one town one country be very like another : civilized nation have the same custom and barbarous nation have the same nature : there be indeed minute discrimination both of place and manners which perhaps be not want of curiosity but which a traveller seldom stay long enough to investigate and compare the dull utterly neglect they the acute see a little and supply the rest with fancy and conjecture i shall set out again to-morrow but i shall not i be afraid see alnwick for dr percy be not there i hope to lodge to-morrow night at berwick and the next at edinburgh where i shall direct mr drummond bookseller at ossian 's head to take care of my

st andrew 's the most ancient of the scotch university and once the see of the primate of scotland the inn be full but lodgings be provide for we at the house of the professor of rhetorick a man of elegant manners who show we in the morning the poor remains of a stately cathedral demolish in knox 's reformation and now only to be imagine by trace its foundation and contemplate the little ruin

husband be the sixth tenant of this gloomy mansion in a lineal descent and claim by she marriage with this lord of the cavern a alliance with the bruce mr boswell staid awhile to interrogate she because he understand she language she tell he that she and she cat live together that she have two son somewhere who might perhaps be dead that when there be quality in the town notice be take of she and that now she be neglect but do not trouble they she habitation contain all that she have she turf for fire be lay in one place and she ball of coal-dust in another but she bed seem to be clean boswell ask she if she never hear any noise but she could tell he of nothing supernatural though she often wander in the night among the grave and ruin only she have sometimes notice by dream of the death of she relation we then view the remains of a castle on the margin of the sea in which the archbishop reside and in which cardinal beatoun be kill the professor who happen to be readout in the vacation make a publick dinner and treat we very kindly and respectfully they show we they college in one of which there be a library that for luminousness and elegance may vie at least with the new edifice at streatham but learn seem not to prosper among they one of they college have be lately alienate and one of they church lately desert a experiment be make of plant a shrubbery in the church but it do not thrive why the place should thus fall to decay i know not for education such as be here to be have be sufficiently cheap the term or as they call it they session last seven month in the year which the student of the highest rank and greatest expense may pass here for twenty pound in which be include board lodge book and the continual instruction of three professor 20th we leave st andrew 's well satisfied with we reception and cross the frith of tay come to dundee a dirty despicable town we pass afterwards through aberbrothick famous once for a abbey of which there be only a few fragment leave but those fragment testify that the fabrick be once of great extent and of stupendous magnificence two of the tower be yet stand though shatter into one of they boswell climb but find the stair break : the way into the other we do not see and have not time to search i believe it might be ascended but the top i think be open we lay at montrose a neat place with a spacious area

origin of language in which he trace monkey up to man and say that in some country the human species have tail like other beast he inquire for these long-tailed man of bank and be not well pleased that they have not be find in all he peregrination he talk nothing of this to I and i hope we part friend for we agree pretty well only we dispute in adjust the claim of merit between a shopkeeper of london and a savage of the american wilderness we opinion be i think maintain on both side without full conviction : monboddo declare boldly for the savage and i perhaps for that reason side with the citizen we come late to aberdeen where i find my dear mistress 's letter and learn that all we little people be happily recover of the measles every part of you letter be please there be two city of the name of aberdeen : the old town build about a mile inland once the see of a bishop which contain the king 's college and the remains of the cathedral and the new town which stand for the sake of trade upon a frith or arm of the sea so that ship rest against the quay the two city have they separate magistrate and the two college be in effect two university which confer degree independently of each other new aberdeen be a large town build almost wholly of that granite which be use for the new pavement in london which hard as it be they square with very little difficulty here i first see the woman in plaid the plaid make at once a hood and cloak without cut or sew merely by the manner of draw the opposite side over the shoulder the maid at the inn run over the house barefoot and child not dress in rag go without shoe or stocking shoe be indeed not yet in universal use they come late into this country one of the professor tell we as we be mention a fort build by cromwell that the country owe much of its present industry to cromwell 's soldier they teach we say he to raise cabbage and make shoe how they live without shoe may yet be see but in the passage through village it seem to he that survey they garden that when they have not cabbage they have nothing education be here of the same price as at st andrew 's only the session be but from the 1st of November to the 1st of April the academical building seem rather to advance than decline they show they library which be not very splendid but some manuscript be so exquisitely pen that i wish my dear mistress to have see they i have a unexpected pleasure by find a old acquaintance now professor of physick in the king 's college : we be on both side glad of the interview have not see nor perhaps think on one another

though this be not they season we hear at a distance the egg and the young be gather here in great number at the time of breed there be a bird here call a coot which though not much bigger than a duck lay a larger egg than a goose we go then to see the buller or bouilloir of buchan : buchan be the name of the district and the buller be a small creek or gulf into which the sea flow through a arch of the rock we walk round it and see it black at a great depth it have its name from the violent ebullition of the water when high wind or high tide drive it up the arch into the basin walk a little farther i spy some boat and tell my companion that we would go into the buller and examine it there be no danger all be calm we go through the arch and find ourselves in a narrow gulf surround by craggy rock of height not stupendous but to a mediterranean visitor uncommon on each side be a cave of which the fisherman know not the extent in which smuggler hide they goods and sometimes party of pleasure take a dinner i be & c xx -- to mr thrale skie September 6 1773 dearest madam -- i be now look on the sea from a house of sir alexander macdonald in the isle of skie little do i once think of

hundred yard between hedge or see five tree fit for the carpenter a few small plantation may be find but i believe scarcely any thirty year old at least they be all posterior to the union this day we dine with a country-gentleman who have in he grounds the remains of a druid 's temple which when it be complete be nothing more than a circle or double circle of stone place at equal distance with a flat stone perhaps a altar at a certain point and a stone taller than the rest at the opposite point the tall stone be erect i think at the south of these circle there be many in all the unfrequented part of the island the inhabitant of these part respect they as memorial of the sculpture of some illustrious person here i see a few tree we lay at bamff August 26th we dine at elgin where we see the ruin of a noble cathedral the chapter-house be yet stand a great part of elgin be build with small piazza to the lower story we go on to fori over the heath where macbeth meet the witch but have no

battlements and wind stair yet remain the rest of the house be though not modern of later erection on the 28th we go to fort george which be account the most regular fortification in the island the major of artillery walk with we round the wall and show we the principle upon which every part be construct and the way in which it could be defend we dine with the governor sir eyre coote and he officer it be a very pleasant and instructive day but nothing put my honor mistress out of my mind at night we come to inverness the last considerable town in the north where we staid all the next day for it be Sunday and see the ruin of what be call macbeth 's castle it never be a large house but be strongly situate from inverness we be to travel on horseback August 30th we set out with four horse we have two highlander to run by we who be active officious civil and hardy we journey be for many mile along a military way make upon the bank of lough ness a water about eighteen mile long but not i think half a mile broad we horse be not bad and the way be very pleasant the rock out of which the road be cut be cover with birch-trees fern and heath the lake below be beat its bank by a gentle wind and the rock beyond the water on the right stand sometimes horrid and wild and sometimes open into a kind of bay in which there be a spot of cultivate ground yellow with corn in one part of the way we have tree on both side for perhaps half a mile such a length of shade perhaps scotland can not show in any other place you be not to suppose that here be to be any more town or inn we come to a cottage which they call the general 's hut where we alight to dine and have egg and bacon and mutton with wine rum and whiskey i have water at a bridge over the river which run into the ness the rock rise on three side with a direction almost perpendicular to a great height they be in part cover with tree and exhibit a kind of dreadful magnificence : -- stand like the barrier of nature place to keep different order of be in perpetual separation near this bridge be the fall of fier a famous cataract of which by clamber over the rock we obtain a view the water be low and therefore we have only the pleasure of know that rain would make it at once please and formidable there will then be a mighty flood foam along a rocky channel frequently obstruct by protuberance and exasperate by reverberation at last precipitated with a sudden descent and lose in the depth of a gloomy chasm we come somewhat late to fort augustus where the lieutenant-governour meet we beyond the gate and apologize that at that hour he could not by the rule of a garrison admit we otherwise than at a narrow door which only one can enter at a time we be well entertain and well lodge and next morning after have view the fort we pursue we journey we way now lay over the mountain which be not to be pass by climb they directly but by traverse so that as we go forward we see we baggage follow we below in a direction exactly contrary there be in these way much labor but little danger and perhaps other place of which very terrifick representation be make be not in themselves more formidable these road have all be make by hew the rock away with pickax or burst it with gunpowder the stone so separated be often pile loose as a wall by the wayside we see a inscription import the year in which one of the regiment make two thousand yard of the road eastward after tedious travel of some hour we come to what i believe we must call a village a place where there be three hut build of turf at one of which we be to have we dinner and we bed for we could not reach any better place that night this place be call enoch in glenmorrison the house in which we lodge be distinguish by a chimney the rest have only a hole for the smoke here we have egg and mutton and a chicken and a sausage and rum in the afternoon tea be make by a very decent girl in a print linen : she engage I so much that i make she a present of cocker 's arithmetick i be & c xxi -- to mr thrale skie sept 141773 dearest madam -- the post which come but once a week into these part be so soon to go that i have not time to go on where i leave off in my last letter i have be several day in the island of raarsa and be now again in the isle of skie but at the other end of it skie be almost equally divide between the two great family of macdonald and macleod other proprietor have only small district the two great lord do not know within twenty square mile the contents of they own territory -- keep up but ill the reputation of highland hospitality we be now with macleod quite at the other end of the island where there be a fine young gentleman and fine lady the lady be study erse i have a cold and be miserably deaf and be troublesome to lady macleod i force she to speak loud but she will seldom speak loud enough raarsa be a island about fifteen mile long and two broad under the dominion of one gentleman who have three son and ten daughter the eldest be the beauty of this part of the world and have be polish at edinburgh : they sing and dance and without expense have upon they table most of what sea air or earth can afford i intend to have write about raarsa but the post will not wait longer than while i send my compliment to my dear master and little mistress i be & c xxii -- to mr thrale skie sept 21 1773 dearest madam -- i be so vex at the necessity of send yesterday so short a letter that i purpose to get a long letter beforehand by write something every day which i may the more easily do as a cold make I now too deaf to take the usual pleasure in conversation lady macleod be very good to I and the place at which we now be be equal in strength of situation in the wildness of the adjacent country and in the plenty and elegance of the domestick entertainment to a castle in gothick romance the sea with a little island be before we cascade play within view close to the house be the formidable skeleton of a old castle probably danish and the whole mass of build stand upon a protuberance of rock inaccessible till of late but by a pair of stair on the seaside and secure in ancient time against any enemy that be likely to invade the kingdom of skie macleod have offer I a island if it be not too far off i should hardly refuse it : my island would be pleasanter than brighthelmstone if you and my master could come to it but i can not think it pleasant to live quite alone oblitusque meorum obliviscendus et illis that i should be elate by the dominion of a island to forgetfulness of my friend at streatham i can not believe and i hope never to deserve that they should be willing to forget I it have happen that i have be often recognize in my journey where i do not expect it at aberdeen i find one of my acquaintance professor of physick : turn aside to dine with a country-gentleman i be own at table by one who have see I at a philosophical lecture : at macdonald 's i be claim by a naturalist who wander about the island to pick up curiosity : and i have once in london attract the notice of lady macleod i will now go on with my account the highland girl make tea and look and talk not inelegantly she father be by no mean a ignorant or a weak man there be book in the cottage among which be some volume of prideaux 's connexion : this man 's conversation we be glad of while we staid he have be out as they call it in forty-five and still retain he old opinion he be go to america because he rent be raise beyond what he think himself able to pay at night we bed be make but we have some difficulty in persuade ourselves to lie down in they though we have put on we own sheet at last we venture and i sleep very soundly in the vale of glenmorrison amidst the rock and mountain next morning we landlord like we so well that he walk some mile with we for we company through a country so wild and barren that the proprietor do not with all he pressure upon he tenant raise more than four hundred pound a year for near one hundred square mile or sixty thousand acre he let we know that he have forty head of black cattle a hundred goat and a hundred sheep upon a farm that he remember let at five pound a year but for which he now pay twenty he tell we some story of they march into england at last he leave we and we go forward wind among mountain sometimes green and sometimes naked commonly so steep as not easily to be climb by the greatest vigor and activity : we way be often cross by little rivulet and we be entertain with small stream trickle from the rock which after heavy rain must be tremendous torrent about noon we come to a small glen so they call a valley which compare with other place appear rich and fertile here we guide desire we to stop that the horse might graze for the journey be very laborious and no more grass would be find we make no difficulty of compliance and i sit down to take note on a green bank with a small stream run at my foot in the midst of savage solitude with mountain before I and on either hand cover with heath i look around I and wonder that i be not more affected but the mind be not at all time equally ready to be put in motion if my mistress and master and queeney have be there we should have produce some reflection among we either poetical or philosophical for though solitude be the nurse of woe conversation be often the parent of remark and discovery in about a hour we remount and pursue we journey the lake by which we have travel for some time end in a river which we pass by a bridge and come to another glen with a collection of hut call auknasheald the hut be generally build of clod of earth hold together by the intertexture of vegetable fiber of which earth there be great level in scotland which they call moss moss in scotland be bog in ireland and moss-trooper be bog-trotter there be however one hut build of loose stone pile up with great thickness into a strong though not solid wall from this house we obtain some great pail of milk and have bring bread with we we be liberally regale the inhabitant a very coarse tribe ignorant of any language but erse gather so fast about we that if we have not have highlander with we they might have cause more alarm than pleasure they be call the clan of macrae we have be tell that nothing gratify the highlander so much as snuff and tobacco and have accordingly store ourselves with both at fort augustus boswell open he treasure and give they each a piece of tobacco roll we have more bread than we could eat for the present and be more liberal than provident boswell cut it in slice and give they a opportunity of tasting wheaten bread for the first time i then get some half-penny for a shilling and make up the deficiency of boswell 's distribution who have give some money among the child we then direct that the mistress of the stone-house should be ask what we must pay she she who perhaps have never before sell any thing but cattle know not i believe well what to ask and refer herself to we : we oblige she to make some demand and one of the highlander settle the account with she at a shill one of the man advise she with the cunning that clown never can be without to ask more but she say that a shilling be enough we give she half-a-crown and she offer part of it again the macrae be so well pleased with we behavior that they declare it the best day they have see since the time of the old laird of macleod who i suppose like we stop in they valley as he be travel to skie we be mention this view of the highlander 's life at macdonald 's and mention the macrae with some degree of pity when a highland lady inform we that we might spare we tenderness for she doubt not but the woman who supply we with milk be mistress of thirteen or fourteen milch cow i can not forbear to interrupt my narrative boswell with some of he troublesome kindness have inform this family and remind I that the 18th of September be my birthday the return of my birthday if i remember it fill I with thought which it seem to be the general care of humanity to escape i can now look back upon threescore and four year in which little have be do and little have be enjoy a life diversify by misery spend part in the sluggishness of penury and part under the violence of pain in gloomy discontent or importunate distress but perhaps i be better than i should have be if i have be less afflict with this i will try to be content in proportion as there be less pleasure in retrospective consideration the mind be more disposed to wander forward into futurity but at sixty-four what promise however liberal of imaginary good can futurity venture to make yet something will be always promise and some promise will be always credit i be hope and i be pray that i may live better in the time to come whether long or short than i have yet live and in the solace of that hope endeavor to repose dear queeney 's day be next : i hope she at sixty-four will have less to regret i will now complain no more but tell my mistress of my travels after we leave the macrae we travel on through a country like that which we pass in the morning the highland be very uniform for there be little variety in universal barrenness the rock however be not all naked for some have grass on they side and birch and alder on they top and in the valley be often broad and clear stream which have little depth and commonly run very quick the channel be make by the violence of the wintry flood the quickness of the stream be in proportion to the declivity of the descent and the breadth of the channel make the water shallow in a dry season there be red deer and roe buck in the mountain but we find only goat in the road and have very little entertainment as we travel either for the eye or ear there be i fancy no singing bird in the highland towards night we come to a very formidable hill call rattiken which we climb with more difficulty than we have yet experienced and at last come to glanelg a place on the seaside opposite to skie we be by this time weary and disgusted nor be we humor much mend by we inn which though it be build of lime and slate the highlander 's description of a house which he think magnificent have neither wine bread egg nor any thing that we could eat or drink when we be take up stair a dirty fellow bounce out of the bed where one of we be to lie boswell bluster but nothing could be get at last a gentleman in the neighborhood who hear of we arrival send we rum and white sugar boswell be now provide for in part and the landlord prepare some mutton chop which we could not eat and kill two hen of which boswell make he servant broil a limb with what effect i know not we have a lemon and a piece of bread which supply I with my supper when the repast be end we begin to deliberate upon bed : mr boswell have warn we that we should _ catch something _ and have give we _ sheet _ for we _ security _ for -- and -- she say come back from skie so scratch themselves i think sheet a slender defense against the confederacy with which we be threaten and by this time we highlander have find a place where they could get some hay : i order hay to be lay thick upon the bed and sleep upon it in my great coat : boswell lay sheet upon he bed and repose in linen like a gentleman the horse be turn out to grass with a man to watch they the hill rattiken and the inn at glanelg be the only thing of which we or traveller yet more delicate could find any pretension to complain sept 2nd i rise rustling from the hay and go to tea which i forget whether we find or bring we see the isle of skie before we darken the horizon with its rocky coast a boat be procure and we lanch into one of the strait of the atlantick ocean we have a passage of about twelve mile to the point where -- reside have come from he seat in the middle of the island to a small house on the shore as we believe that he might with less reproach entertain we meanly if he aspire to meanness he retrograde ambition be completely gratify but he do not succeed equally in escape reproach he have no cook nor i suppose much provision nor have the lady the common decency of she tea-table we pick up we sugar with we finger boswell be very angry and reproach he with he improper parsimony i do not much reflect upon the conduct of a man with whom i be not likely to converse as long at any other time you will now expect that i should give you some account of the isle of skie of which though i have be twelve day upon it i have little to say it be a island perhaps fifty mile long so much indented by inlet of the sea that there be no part of it remove from the water more than six mile no part that i have see be plain you be always climb or descend and every step be upon rock or mire a walk upon plough ground in england be a dance upon carpet compare to the toilsome drudgery of wander in skie there be neither town nor village in the island nor have i see any house but macleod 's that be not much below you habitation at brighthelmstone in the mountain there be stag and roe buck but no hare and few rabbit nor have i see any thing that interest I as a zoologist except a otter bigger than i think a otter could have be you be perhaps imagine that i be withdraw from the gay and the busy world into region of peace and pastoral felicity and be enjoy the relick of the golden age that i be survey nature 's magnificence from a mountain or remark she minuter beauty on the flowery bank of a wind rivulet that i be invigorating myself in the sunshine or delight my imagination with be hide from the invasion of human evil and human passion in the darkness of a thicket that i be busy in gather shell and pebble on the shore or contemplative on a rock from which i look upon the water and consider how many wave be roll between I and streatham the use of travel be to regulate imagination by reality and instead of think how thing may be to see they as they be here be mountain which i should once have climb but to climb steep be now very laborious and to descend they dangerous and i be now content with know that by scramble up a rock i shall only see other rock and a wider circuit of barren desolation of stream we have here a sufficient number but they murmur not upon pebble but upon rock of flower if chlori herself be here i could present she only with the bloom of heath of lawn and thicket he must read that would know they for here be little sun and no shade on the sea i look from my window but be not much tempt to the shore for since i come to this island almost every breath of air have be a storm and what be worse a storm with all its severity but without its magnificence for the sea be here so broken into channel that there be not a sufficient volume of water either for lofty surge or a loud roar on sept 6th we leave -- to visit raarsa the island which i have already mention we be to cross part of skie on horseback a mode of travel very uncomfortable for the road be so narrow where any road can be find that only one can go and so craggy that the attention can never be remit it allow therefore neither the gaiety of conversation nor the laxity of solitude nor have it in itself the amusement of much variety as it afford only all the possible transposition of bog rock and rivulet twelve mile by computation make a reasonable journey for a day at night we come to a tenant 's house of the first rank of tenant where we be entertain better than at the landlord 's there be book both english and latin company gather about we and we hear some talk of the second sight and some talk of the event of forty-five a year which will not soon be forget among the islander the next day we be confine by a storm the company i think increase and we entertainment be not only hospitable but elegant at night a minister 's sister in very fine brocade sing erse song i wish to know the meaning but the highlander be not much use to scholastick question and no translation could be obtain next day sept 8th the weather allow we to depart a good boat be provide we and we go to raarsa under the conduct of mr malcolm macleod a gentleman who conduct prince charle through the mountain in he distress the prince he say be more active than himself they be at least one night without any shelter the wind blow enough to give the boat a kind of dancing agitation and in about three or four hour we arrive at raarsa where we be meet by the laird and he friend upon the shore raarsa for such be he title be master of two island upon the smaller of which call rona he have only flock and herd rona give title to he eldest son the money which he raise annually by rent from all he dominion which contain at least fifty thousand acre be not believe to exceed two hundred and fifty pound but as he keep a large farm in he own hand he sell every year great number of cattle which add to he revenue and he table be furnish from the farm and from the sea with very little expense except for those thing this country do not produce and of those he be very liberal the wine circulate vigorously and the tea chocolate and coffee however they be get be always at hand i be & c we be this morning try to get out of skie xxiii -- to mr thrale skie sept 24 1773 dear madam -- i be still in skie do you remember the song every island be a prison strongly guard by the sea we have at one time no boat and at another may have too much wind but of we reception here we have no reason to complain we be now with colonel macleod in a more pleasant place than i think skie could afford now to the narrative we be receive at raarsa on the seaside and after clamber with some difficulty over the rock a labor which the traveller wherever he repose himself on land must in these island be contented to endure we be introduce into the house which one of the company call the court of raarsa with politeness which not the court of versaille could have think defective the house be not large though we be tell in we passage that it have eleven fine room nor magnificently furnished but we utensil be most commonly silver we go up into a dining-room about as large as you blue room where we have something give we to eat and tea and coffee raarsa himself be a man of no inelegant appearance and of manners uncommonly refine lady raarsa make no very sublime appearance for a sovereign but be a good housewife and a very prudent and diligent conductress of she family miss flora macleod be a celebrated beauty have be admire at edinburgh dress she head very high and have manners so lady-like that i wish she head-dress be lower the rest of the nine girl be all pretty the youngest be between queeney and lucy the youngest boy of four year old run barefoot and wander with we over the rock to see a mill : i believe he would walk on that rough ground without shoe ten mile in a day the laird of raarsa have sometimes dispute the chieftainry of the clan with macleod of skie but be much inferior in extent of possession have i suppose be force to desist raarsa and its province have descend to its present possessor through a succession of four hundred year without any increase or diminution it be indeed lately in danger of forfeiture but the old laird join some prudence with he zeal and when prince charle land in scotland make over he estate to this son the present laird and lead one hundred man of raarsa into the field with officer of he own family eighty-six only come back after the last battle the prince be hide in he distress two night at raarsa and the king 's troops burn the whole country and kill some of the cattle you may guess at the opinion that prevail in this country they be however content with fight for they king they do not drink for he we have no foolish health at night unexpectedly to we who be stranger the carpet be take up the fiddler of the family come up and a very vigorous and general dance be begin as i tell you we be two and thirty at supper there be full as many dancer for though all who sup do not dance some dance of the young people who do not sup raarsa himself dance with he child and old malcolm in he fillibeg be as nimble as when he lead the prince over the mountain when they have dance themselves weary two table be spread and i suppose at least twenty dish be upon they in this country some preparation of milk be always serve up at supper and sometimes in the place of tart at dinner the table be not coarsely heap but at once plentiful and elegant they do not pretend to make a loaf there be only cake commonly of oats or barley but they make I very nice cake of wheat flour i always sit at the left hand of lady raarsa and young macleod of skie the chieftain of the clan sit on the right after supper a young lady who be visit sing erse song in which lady raarsa join prettily enough but not gracefully the young lady sustain the chorus better they be very little used to be ask question and not well prepare with answer when one of the song be over i ask the princess that sit next to I what be that about i question if she conceive that i do not understand it for the entertainment of the company say she but madam what be the meaning of it it be a love song this be all the intelligence that i could obtain nor have i be able to procure the translation of a single line of erse at twelve it be bed-time i have a chamber to myself which in eleven room to forty people be more than my share how the company and the family be distribute be not easy to tell macleod the chieftain and boswell and i have all single chamber on the first floor there remain eight room only for at least seven and thirty lodger i suppose they put up temporary bed in the dining-room where they stow all the young lady there be a room above stair with six bed in which they put ten man the rest in my next xxiv -- to mr thrale ostich in skie sept 30 1773 dearest madam -- i be still confine in skie we be unskilful traveller and imagine that the sea be a open road which we could pass at pleasure but we have now learn with some pain that we may still wait for a long time the caprice of the equinoctial wind and sit reading or write as i now do while the tempest be roll the sea or roaring in the mountain i be now no longer pleased with the delay you can hear from I but seldom and i can not at all hear from you it come into my mind that some evil may happen or that i might be of use while i be away but these thought be vain the wind be violent and adverse and we boat can not yet come i must content myself with write to you and hope that you will sometime receive my letter now to my narrative sept 9th have pass the night as be usual i rise and find the dining-room full of company we feast and talk and when the evening come it bring musick and dancing young macleod the great proprietor of skie and head of he clan be very distinguishable a young man of nineteen breed awhile at st andrew 's and afterwards at oxford a pupil of g strahan he be a young man of a mind as much advance as i have ever know very elegant of manners and very graceful in he person he have the full spirit of a feudal chief and i be very ready to accept he invitation to dunvegan all raarsa 's child be beautiful the lady all except the eldest be in the morning dress in they hair the true highlander never wear more than a riband on she head till she be marry on the third day boswell go out with old malcolm to see a ruin castle which he find less entire than be promise but he see the country i do not go for the castle be perhaps ten mile off and there be no ride at raarsa the whole island be rock or mountain from which the cattle often fall and be destroy it be very barren and maintain as near as i could collect about seven hundred inhabitant perhaps ten to a square mile in these country you be not to suppose that you shall find village or inclosure the traveller wander through a naked desert gratify sometimes but rarely with the sight of cow and now and then find a heap of loose stone and turf in a cavity between rock where a be bear with all those power which education expand and all those sensation which culture refine be condemn to shelter itself from the wind and rain philosopher there be who try to make themselves believe that this life be happy but they believe it only while they be say it and never yet produce conviction in a single mind he whom want of word or image sink into silence still think as he think before that privation of pleasure can never please and that content be not to be much envy when it have no other principle than ignorance of good this gloomy tranquillity which some may call fortitude and other wisdom be i believe for a long time to be very frequently find in these den of poverty every man be content to live like he neighbor and never wander from home see no mode of life preferable to he own except at the house of the laird or the laird 's nearest relation whom he consider as a superior order of being to whose luxury or honor he have no pretension but the end of this reverence and submission seem now approach the highlander have learn that there be country less bleak and barren than they own where instead of work for the laird every man will till he own ground and eat the produce of he own labor great number have be induce by this discovery to go every year for some time past to america macdonald and macleod of skie have lose many tenant and many labourer but raarsa have not yet be forsake by a single inhabitant rona be yet more rocky and barren than raarsa and though it contain perhaps four thousand acre be possess only by a herd of cattle and the keeper i find myself not very able to walk upon the mountain but one day i go out to see the wall yet stand of a ancient chapel in almost every island the superstitious votary of the romish church erect place of worship in which the drone of convent or cathedral perform the holy office but by the active zeal of protestant devotion almost all of they have sink into ruin the chapel at raarsa be now only consider as the burying-place of the family and i suppose of the whole island we would now have go away and leave room for other to enjoy the pleasure of this little court but the wind detain we till the 12th when though it be Sunday we think it proper to snatch the opportunity of a calm day raarsa accompany we in he six-oared boat which he say be he coach and six it be indeed the vehicle in which the lady take the air and pay they visit but they have take very little care for accommodation there be no way in or out of the boat for a woman but by be carry and in the boat thus dignified with a pompous name there be no seat but a occasional bundle of straw thus we leave raarsa the seat of plenty civility and cheerfulness we dine at a publick house at port re so call because one of the scottish king land there in a progress through the western isle raarsa pay the reckoning privately we then get on horseback and by a short but very tedious journey come to kingsburgh at which the same king lodge after he land here i have the honor of salute the far-famed miss flora macdonald who conduct the prince dress as she maid through the english force from the island of lewe and when she come to skie dine with the english officer and leave she maid below she must then have be a very young lady she be now not old of a please person and elegant behavior she tell I that she think herself honor by my visit and i be sure that whatever regard she bestow on I be liberally repay if thou likest she opinion thou wilt praise she virtue she be carry to london but dismiss without a trial and come down with malcolm macleod against whom sufficient evidence could not be procure she and she husband be poor and be go to try they fortune in america : sic rerum volvitur orbis at kingsburgh we be very liberally feast and i sleep in the bed in which the prince repose in he distress the sheet which he use be never put to any meaner office but be wrap up by the lady of the house and at last accord to she desire be lay round she in she grave these be not whig on the 13th travel partly on horseback where we could not row and partly on foot where we could not ride we come to dunvegan which i have describe already here though poor macleod have be leave by he grandfather overwhelm with debt we have another exhibition of feudal hospitality there be two stag in the house and venison come to the table every day in its various form macleod besides he estate in skie larger i suppose than some english county be proprietor of nine inhabit isle and of he island uninhabited i doubt if he very exactly know the number i tell he that he be a mighty monarch such dominion fill a englishman with envious wonder but when he survey the naked mountain and tread the quake moor and wander over the wild region of gloomy barrenness he wonder may continue but he envy cease the unprofitableness of these vast domain can be conceive only by the means of positive instance the heir of col a island not far distant have lately tell I how wealthy he should be if he could let rum another of he island for twopence halfpenny a acre and macleod have a estate which the surveyor report to contain eighty thousand acre rent at six hundred pound a year while we be at dunvegan the wind be high and the rain violent so that we be not able to put forth a boat to fish in the sea or to visit the adjacent island which may be see from the house but we fill up the time as we could sometimes by talk sometimes by read i have never want book in the isle of skie we be invite one day by the laird and lady of muck one of the western island two mile long and three quarter of a mile high he have half he island in he own culture and upon the other half live one hundred and fifty dependant who not only live upon the product but export corn sufficient for the payment of they rent lady macleod have a son and four daughter they have live long in england and have the language and manners of english lady we live with they very easily the hospitality of this remote region be like that of the golden age we have find ourselves treat at every house as if we come to confer a benefit we be eight day at dunvegan but we take the first opportunity which the weather afford after the first day of go away and on the 21st go to ulinish where we be well entertain and wander a little after curiosity in the afternoon a interval of calm sunshine court we out to see a cave on the shore famous for its echo when we go into the boat one of we companion be ask in erse by the boatman who they be that come with he he give we character i suppose to we advantage and be ask in the spirit of the highland whether i could recite a long series of ancestor the boatman say as i perceive afterwards that they hear the cry of a english ghost this boswell say disturbed he we come to the cave and clamber up the rock come to a arch open at one end one hundred and eighty foot long thirty broad in the broadest part and about thirty high there be no echo : such be the fidelity of report but i see what i have never see before muscle and whilk in they natural state there be another arch in the rock open at both end September 23rd we remove to talisker a house occupy by mr macleod a lieutenant colonel in the dutch service talisker have be long in the possession of gentleman and therefore have a garden well cultivate and what be here very rare be shaded by tree a place where the imagination be more amuse can not easily be find the mountain about it be of great height with waterfall succeed one another so fast that as one cease to be hear another begin between the mountain there be a small valley extend to the sea which be not far off beat upon a coast very difficult of access two night before we arrival two boat be drive upon this coast by the tempest one of they have a pilot that know the passage the second follow but a third miss the true course and be drive forward with great danger of be force into the vast ocean but however gain at last some other island the crew creep to talisker almost lifeless with wet cold fatigue and terror but the lady take care of they she be a woman of more than common qualification have travel with she husband she speak four language you find that all the islander even in these recess of life be not barbarous one of the minister who have adhere to we almost all the time be a excellent scholar we have now with we the young laird of col who be heir perhaps to two hundred square mile of land he have first study at aberdeen and afterwards go to hertfordshire to learn agriculture be much impressed with desire of improvement he likewise have the notion of a chief and keep a piper at macleod 's the bagpipe always play while we be dine col have undertake by permission of the wave and wind to carry we about several of the island with which he be acquaint enough to show we whatever curious be give by nature or leave by antiquity but we grow afraid of deviate from we way home lest we should be shut up for month upon some little protuberance of rock that just appear above the sea and perhaps be scarcely mark upon a map you remember the doge of genoa who be ask what strike he most at the french court answer myself i can not think many thing here more likely to affect the fancy than to see johnson end he sixty-fourth year in the wilderness of the hebride but now i be here it will gratify I very little to return without see or do my best to see what those place afford i have a desire to instruct myself in the whole system of pastoral life but i know not whether i shall be able to perfect the idea however i have many picture in my mind which i could not have have without this journey and should have pass it with great pleasure have you and master and queeney be in the party we should have excite the attention and enlarged the observation of each other and obtain many please topick of future conversation as it be i travel with my mind too much at home and perhaps miss many thing worthy of observation or pass they with transient notice so that the image for want of that reimpression which discussion and comparison produce easily fade away but i keep a book of remark and boswell write a regular journal of we travels which i think contain as much of what i say and do as of all other occurrence together for such a faithful chronicler as griffith i hope dearest madam you be equally careful to reposit proper memorial of all that happen to you and you family and then when we meet we shall tell we story i wish you have go this summer in you usual splendor to brighthelmstone mr thrale probably wonder how i live all this time without send to he for money travel in scotland be dear enough dearer in proportion to what the country afford than in england but residence in the isle be unexpensive company be i think consider as a supply of pleasure and a relief of that tediousness of life which be feel in every place elegant or rude of wine and punch they be very liberal for they get they cheap but as there be no custom-house on the island they can hardly be consider as smuggler they punch be make without lemon or any substitute they table be very plentiful but a very nice man would not be pampered as they have no meat but as they kill it they be oblige to live while it last upon the same flesh they kill a sheep and set mutton boil and roast on the table together they have fish both of the sea and of the brook but they can hardly conceive that it require any sauce to sauce in general they be stranger : now and then butter be melt but i dare not always take lest i should offend by dislike it barley broth be a constant dish and be make well in every house a stranger if he be prudent will secure he share for it be not certain that he will be able to eat any thing else they meat be often newly kill be very tough and as nothing be sufficiently subdue by the fire be not easily to be eat carve be here a very laborious employment for the knife be never whet table knife be not of long subsistence in the highland : every man while arm be a regular part of dress have he knife and fork appendant to he dirk knive they now lay upon the table but the handle be apt to show that they have be in other hand and the blade have neither brightness nor edge of silver there be no want and it will last long for it be never clean they be a nation just rise from barbarity : long contented with necessaries now somewhat studious of convenience but not yet arrive at delicate discrimination they linen be however both clean and fine bread such as we mean by that name i have never see in the isle of skie they have oven for they bake they pie but they never ferment they meal nor mould a loaf cake of oats and barley be bring to the table but i believe wheat be reserve for stranger they be commonly too hard for I and therefore i take potato to my meat and be sure to find they on almost every table they retain so much of the pastoral life that some preparation of milk be commonly one of the dish both at dinner and supper tea be always drunk at the usual time but in the morning the table be polluted with a plate of slice of strong cheese this be peculiar to the highland at edinburgh there be always honey and sweetmeat on the morning tea-table strong liquor they seem to love every man perhaps woman begin the day with a dram and the punch be make both at dinner and supper they have neither wood nor coal for fuel but burn peat or turf in they chimney it be dig out of the moor or moss and make a strong and lasting fire not always very sweet and somewhat apt to smoke the pot the house of inferior gentleman be very small and every room serve many purpose in the bed-rooms perhaps be lay up store of different kind and the parlor of the day be a bed-room at night in the room which i inhabit last about fourteen foot square there be three chest of drawer a long chest for larger clothes two closet-cupboard and the bed they room be commonly dirty of which they seem to have little sensibility and if they have more clean floor would be difficultly keep where the first step from the door be into the dirt they be very much inclined to carpet and seldom fail to lay down something under they foot better or worse as they happen to be furnish the highland dress be forbid by law be very little used sometimes it may be see but the english traveller be strike with nothing so much as the _ nudité des pieds _ of the common people skie be the greatest island or the greatest but one among the hebride of the soil i have already give some account : it be generally barren but some spot be not wholly unfruitful the garden have apple and pear cherry strawberry raspberry currant and gooseberry but all the fruit that i have see be small they attempt to sow nothing but oats and barley oats constitute the bread-corn of the place they harvest be about the beginning of October and be so late be very much subject to disappointment from the rain that follow the equinox this year have be particularly disastrous they rainy season last from autumn to spring they have seldom very hard frost nor be it ever know that a lake be cover with ice strong enough to bear a skater the sea round they be always open the snow fall but soon melt only in 1771 they have a cold spring in which the island be so long cover with it that many beast both wild and domestick perish and the whole country be reduce to distress from which i know not if it be even yet recover the animal here be not remarkably small perhaps they recruit they breed from the mainland the cow be sometimes without horn the horn and unhorn cattle be not accidental variation but different species : they will however breed together October 3rd the wind be now change and if we snatch the moment of opportunity a escape from this island be become practicable i have no reason to complain of my reception yet i long to be again at home you and my master may perhaps expect after this description of skie some account of myself my eye be i be afraid not fully recover my ear be not mend my nerve seem to grow weaker and i have be otherwise not as well as i sometimes be but think myself lately better this climate perhaps be not within my degree of healthy latitude thus i have give my most honor mistress the story of I and my little ramble we be now go to some other isle to what we know not the wind will tell we i be & c xxv -- to mr thrale mull oct 15 1773 dear madam -- though i have write to mr thrale yet have a little more time than be promise I i would not suffer the messenger to go without some token of my duty to my mistress who i suppose expect the usual tribute of intelligence a tribute which i be not very able to pay October 3rd after have be detain by storm many day in skie we leave it as we think with a fair wind but a violent gust which bo have a great mind to call a tempest force we into col a obscure island on which -- nulla campis arbor aestiva recreatur aura there be literally no tree upon the island part of it be a sandy waste over which it would be really dangerous to travel in dry weather and with a high wind it seem to be little more than one continue rock cover from space to space with a thin layer of earth it be however accord to the highland notion very populous and life be improve beyond the manners of skie for the hut be collect into little village and every one have a small garden of root and cabbage the laird have a new house build by he uncle and a old castle inhabit by he ancestor the young laird entertain we very liberally he be heir perhaps to three hundred square mile of land which at ten shilling a acre would bring he ninety-six thousand pound a year he be desirous of improve the agriculture of he country and in imitation of the czar travel for improvement and work with he own hand upon a farm in hertfordshire in the neighborhood of you uncle sir thoma salusbury he talk of do useful thing and have introduce turnip for winter fodder he have make a small essay towards a road col be but a barren place description have here few opportunity of spread she color the difference of day and night be the only vicissitude the succession of sunshine to rain or of calm to tempest we have not know wind and rain have be we only weather at last after about nine day we hire a sloop and have lain in it all night with such accommodation as these miserable vessel can afford be land yesterday on the isle of mull from which we expect a easy passage into scotland i be sick in a ship but recover by lie down i have not good health i do not find that travel much help I my night be flatulent though not in the utmost degree and i have a weakness in my knee which make I very unable to walk pray dear madam let I have a long letter i be & c xxvi -- to mr thrale inverary oct 24 1773 honor mistress -- my last letter to you and my dear master be write from mull the third island of the hebride in extent there be no post and i take the opportunity of a gentleman 's passage to the mainland in mull we be confine two day by the weather on the third we get on horseback and after a journey difficult and tedious over rock naked and valley untrack through a country of barrenness and solitude we come almost in the dark to the seaside weary and dejected have meet with nothing but water fall from the mountain that could raise any image of delight we company be the young laird of col and he servant col make every maclean open he house where he come and supply we with horse when we depart but the horse of this country be small and i be not mount to my wish at the seaside we find the ferryboat depart if it have be where it be expect the wind be against we and the hour be late nor be it very desirable to cross the sea in darkness with a small boat the captain of a sloop that have be drive thither by the storm see we distress and as we be hesitate and deliberate send he boat which by col 's order transport we to the isle of ulva we be introduce to mr macquarry the head of a small clan whose ancestor have reign in ulva beyond memory but who have reduce himself by he negligence and folly to the necessity of sell this venerable patrimony on the next morning we pass the strait to inch kenneth a island about a mile in length and less than half a mile broad in which kenneth a scottish saint establish a small clerical college of which the chapel wall be still stand at this place i beheld a scene which i wish you and my master and queeney have partake the only family on the island be that of sir allan the chief of the ancient and numerous clan of maclean the clan which claim the second place yield only to macdonald in the line of battle sir allan a chieftain a baronet and a soldier inhabit in this insulate desert a thatched hut with no chamber young col who own he as he chief and whose cousin be he lady have i believe give he some notice of we visit he receive we with the soldier 's frankness and the gentleman 's elegance and introduce we to he daughter two young lady who have not wanted education suitable to they birth and who in they cottage neither forget they dignity nor affect to remember it do not you wish to have be with we sir allan 's affair be in disorder by the fault of he ancestor : and while he form some scheme for retrieve they he have retreat hither when we salutation be over he show we the island we walk uncover into the chapel and saw in the reverend ruin the effect of precipitate reformation the floor be cover with ancient grave-stone of which the inscription be not now legible and without some of the chief family still continue the right of sepulture the altar be not yet quite demolish beside it on the right side be a bass-relief of the virgin with she child and a angel hover over she on the other side still stand a hand-bell which though it have no clapper neither presbyterian bigotry nor barbarian wantonness have yet take away the chapel be thirty-eight foot long and eighteen broad boswell who be very pious go into it at night to perform he devotions but come back in haste for fear of spectre near the chapel be a fountain to which the water remarkably pure be convey from a distant hill through pipe lay by the romish clergy which still perform the office of conveyance though they have never be repair since popery be suppress we soon after go in to dinner and want neither the comfort nor the elegancy of life there be several dish and variety of liquor the servant live in another cottage in which i suppose the meat be dress towards evening sir allan tell we that Sunday never pass over he like another day one of the lady read and read very well the evening service -- and paradise be open in the wild next day 18th we go and wander among the rock on the shore while the boat be busy in catch oyster of which there be a great bed oyster lie upon the sand one i think stick to another and cockle be find a few inch under the sand we then go in the boat to sondiland a little island very near we find it a wild rock of about ten acre part naked part cover with sand out of which we pick shell and part clothe with a thin layer of mould on the grass of which a few sheep be sometimes feed we then come back and dine i pass part of the afternoon in reading and in the evening one of the lady play on she harpsichord and boswell and col dance a reel with the other on the 19th we persuade sir allan to lanch he boat again and go with we to icolmkill where the first great preacher of christianity to the scot build a church and settle a monastery in we way we stop to examine a very uncommon cave on the coast of mull we have some difficulty to make we way over the vast mass of broken rock that lie before the entrance and at the mouth be embarrass with stone which the sea have accumulate as at brighthelmstone but as we advance we reach a floor of soft sand and as we leave the light behind we walk along a very spacious cavity vault over head with a arch almost regular by which a mountain be sustain at least a very lofty rock from this magnificent cavern go a narrow passage to the right hand which we enter with a candle and though it be obstruct with great stone clamber over they to a second expansion of the cave in which there lie a great square stone which might serve as a table the air here be very warm but not oppressive and the flame of the candle continue pyramidal the cave go onward to a unknown extent but we be now one hundred and sixty yard under ground we have but one candle and have never hear of any that go farther and come back we therefore think it prudent to return go forward in we boat we come to a cluster of rock black and horrid which sir allan choose for the place where he would eat he dinner we climb till we get seat the store be open and the repast take we then enter the boat again the night come upon we the wind rise the sea swell and boswell desire to be set on dry ground : we however pursue we navigation and pass by several little island in the silent solemnity of faint moonshine see little and hearing only the wind and the water at last we reach the island the venerable seat of ancient sanctity where secret piety repose and where fall greatness be reposit the island have no house of entertainment and we manfully make we bed in a farmer 's barn the description i hope to give you another time i be & c xxvii -- to mr thrale edinburgh nov 12 1773 dearest madam -- among the possibility of evil which my imagination suggest at this distance i miss that which have really happen i never have much hope of a will in you favor but be willing to believe that no will would have be make the event be now irrevocable it remain only to bear it not to wish it have be different be impossible but as the wish be painful without use it be not prudent perhaps not lawful to indulge it as life and vigor of mind and sprightliness of imagination and flexibility of attention be give we for valuable and useful purpose we must not think ourselves at liberty to squander life to enervate intellectual strength to cloud we thought or fix we attention when by all this expense we know that no good can be produce be alone as little as you can when you be alone do not suffer you thought to dwell on what you might have do to prevent this disappointment you perhaps could not have do what you imagine or might have do it without effect but even to think in the most reasonable manner be for the present not so useful as not to think remit yourself solemnly into the hand of god and then turn you mind upon the business and amusement which lie before you all be best say chene as it have be except the error of we own free will burton conclude he long book upon melancholy with this important precept : be not solitary be not idle remember chene 's position and observe burton 's precept we come hither on the ninth of this month i long to come under you care but for some day can not decently get away they congratulate we return as if we have be with phipp or bank i be ashamed of they salutation i have be able to collect very little for queeney 's cabinet but she will not want toy now she be so well employ i wish she success and be not without some thought of become she schoolfellow i have get a italian rassela surely my dear lucy will recover i wish i could do she good i love she very much and should love another godchild if i might have the honor of stand to the next baby i be & c xxviii -- to mr thrale edinburgh nov 18 1773 my dearest mistress -- this be the last letter that i shall write while you be read it i shall be come home i congratulate you upon you boy but you must not think that i will love he all at once as well as i love harry for harry you know be so rational i shall love he by degree poor pretty dear lucy can nothing do she good i be sorry to lose she but if she must be take from we let we resign she with confidence into the hand of he who know and who only know what be best both for we and she do not suffer yourself to be deject resolution and diligence will supply all that be want and all that be lose but if you health should be impaired i know not where to find a substitute i shall have no mistress mr thrale will have no wife and the little flock will have no mother i long to be home and have take a place in the coach for Monday i hope therefore to be in london on Friday the 26th in the evening please to let mr william know i be & c xxix -- to the same lichfield June 23 1775 dear madam -- now i hope you be think : shall i have a letter to-day from lichfield something of a letter you will have how else can i expect that you should write and the morning on which i should miss a letter would be a morning of uneasiness notwithstanding all that would be say or do by the sister of stowhill who do and say whatever good they can they give I good word and cherry and strawberry lady \*\*\*\* and she mother and sister be visit there yesterday and lady -- take she tea before she mother mr cobb be to come to miss porter 's this afternoon miss a -- come little near I mr langley of ashbourne be here to-day in he way to birmingham and every body talk of you the lady of the amicable society be to walk in a few day from the townhall to the cathedral in procession to hear a sermon they walk in linen gown and each have a stick with a acorn but for the acorn they could give no reason till i tell they of the civick crown i have just have you sweet letter and be glad that you be to be at the regatta you know how little i love to have you leave out of any shine part of life you have every right to distinction and should therefore be distinguish you will see a show with philosophick superiority and therefore may see it safely it be easy to talk of sit at home contented when other be see or make show but not to have be where it be suppose and seldom suppose falsely that all would go if they could to be able to say nothing when every one be talk to have no opinion when every one be judge to hear exclamation of rapture without power to depress to listen to falsehood without right to contradict be after all a state of temporary inferiority in which the mind be rather harden by stubbornness than support by fortitude if the world be worth win let we enjoy it if it be to be despise let we despise it by conviction but the world be not to be despise but as it be compare with something better company be in itself better than solitude and pleasure better than indolence : ex nihilo nihil fit say the moral as well as the natural philosopher by do nothing and by know nothing no power of do good can be obtain he must mingle with the world that desire to be useful every new scene impress new idea enrich the imagination and enlarge the power of reason by new topick of comparison you that have see the regatta will have image which we who miss it must want and no intellectual image be without use but when you be in this scene of splendor and gaiety do not let one of you fit of negligence steal upon you hoc age be the great rule whether you be serious or merry whether you be state the expense of you family learn science or duty from a folio or float on the thame in a fancied dress of the whole entertainment let I not hear so copious nor so true a account from any body as from you i be dearest madam you & c xxx -- to mr thrale ashbourne dear madam -- i be sure i write and write and every letter that come from you charge I with not write since i write to queeney i have write twice to you on the 6th and the 9th : be please to let I know whether you have they or have they not that of the 6th you should regularly have have on the 8th yet you letter of the 9th seem not to mention it all this puzzle I poor dear \*\*\*\* he only grow dull because he be sickly age have not yet begin to impair he nor be he such a chameleon as to take immediately the color of he company when you see he again you will find he reanimate most man have they bright and they cloudy day at least they have day when they put they power into action and day when they suffer they to repose fourteen thousand pound make a sum sufficient for the establishment of a family and which in whatever flow of riches or confidence of prosperity deserve to be very seriously consider i hope a great part of it have pay debt and no small part buy land as for gravelling and walling and digging though i be not much delighted with they yet something indeed much must be allow to every man 's taste he that be grow rich have a right to enjoy part of the growth he own way i hope to range in the walk and row upon the water and devour fruit from the wall dr taylor want to be garden he mean to buy a piece of ground in the neighborhood and surround it with a wall and build a gardener 's house upon it and have fruit and be happy much happiness it will not bring he but what can he do better if i have money enough what would i do perhaps if you and master do not hold I i might go to cairo and down the red sea to bengal and take a ramble in indium would this be better than building and plant it would surely give more variety to the eye and more amplitude to the mind half fourteen thousand would send I out to see other form of existence and bring I back to describe they i answer this the day on which i have yours of the 9th that be on the 11th let I know when it come i be & c xxxi -- to mr thrale lichfield August 2 1775 madam -- i dine to-day at stowhill and be come away to write my letter never surely be i such a writer before do you keep my letter i be not of you opinion that i shall not like to read they hereafter for though there be in they not much history of mind or anything else they will i hope always be in some degree the record of a pure and blameless friendship and in some hour of languor and sadness may revive the memory of more cheerful time why you should suppose yourself not desirous hereafter to read the history of you own mind i do not see twelve year on which you now look as on a vast expanse of life will probably be pass over uniformly and smoothly with very little perception of you progress and with very few remark upon the way the accumulation of knowledge which you promise to yourself by which the future be to look back upon the present with the superiority of manhood to infancy will perhaps never be attempt or never will be make and you will find as million have find before you that forty-five have make little sensible addition to thirty-three as the body after a certain time gain no increase of height and little of strength there be likewise a period though more variable by external cause when the mind commonly attain its stationary point and very little advance its power of reflection judgment and ratiocination the body may acquire new mode of motion or new dexterity of mechanick operation but its original strength receive not improvement : the mind may be store with new language or new science but its power of thinking remain nearly the same and unless it attain new subject of meditation it commonly produce thought of the same force and the same extent at very distant interval of life as the tree unless a foreign fruit be ingraft give year after year production of the same form and the same flavor by intellectual force or strength of thought be mean the degree of power which the mind possess of survey the subject of meditation with its circuit of concomitant and its train of dependence of this power which all observe to be very different in different mind part seem the gift of nature and part the acquisition of experience when the power of nature have attain they intended energy they can be no more advance the shrub can never become a tree and it be not unreasonable to suppose that they be before the middle of life in they full vigor nothing then remain but practice and experience and perhaps why they do so little may be worth inquiry but i have just now look and find it so late that i will inquire against the next post night i be & c xxxii -- to mr thrale lichfield august 1775 dear madam -- instead of forty reason for my return one be sufficient -- that you wish for my company i purpose to write no more till you see I the lady at stowhill and greenhill be unanimously of opinion that it will be best to take a post chaise and not to be trouble with the vexation of a common carriage i will venture to suppose the lady at streatham to be of the same mind you will now expect to be tell why you will not be so much wiser as you expect when you have live twelve year longer it be say and say truly that experience be the best teacher and it be suppose that as life be lengthen experience be increase but a closer inspection of human life will discover that time often pass without any incident which can much enlarge knowledge or ratify judgment when we be young we learn much because we be universally ignorant we observe every thing because every thing be new but after some year the occurrence of daily life be exhaust one day pass like another in the same scene of appearance in the same course of transaction : we have to do what we have often do and what we do not try because we do not wish to do much better we be tell what we already know and therefore what repetition can not make we know with greater certainty he that have early learn much perhaps seldom make with regard to life and manners much addition to he knowledge not only because as more be know there be less to learn but because a mind store with image and principle turn inwards for its own entertainment and be employ in settle those idea which run into confusion and in recollect those which be steal away practice by which wisdom may be keep but not gain the merchant who be at first busy in acquire money cease to grow richer from the time when he make it he business only to count it those who have family or employment be engage in business of little difficulty but of great importance require rather assiduity of practice than subtilty of speculation occupy the attention with image too bulky for refinement and too obvious for research the right be already know : what remain be only to follow it daily business add no more to wisdom than daily lesson to the learning of the teacher but of how few life do not state duty claim the greater part far the greater part of human mind never endeavor they own improvement opinion once receive from instruction or settle by whatever accident be seldom recall to examination have be once suppose to be right they be never discover to be erroneous for no application be make of any thing that time may present either to shake or to confirm they from this acquiescence in preconception none be wholly free between fear of uncertainty and dislike of labor every one rest while he might yet go forward and they that be wise at thirty-three be very little wiser at forty-five of this speculation you be perhaps tired and would rather hear of sophy i hope before this come that she head will be easier and you head less fill with fear and trouble which you know be to be indulge only to prevent evil not to increase it you uneasiness about sophy be probably unnecessary and at worst you own child be healthful and you affair prosperous unmingled good can not be expect but as we may lawfully gather all the good within we reach we may be allow to lament after that which we lose i hope you loss be at a end and that as far as the condition of we present existence permit you remain life will be happy i be & c xxxiii -- to mr thrale lichfield march 25 1776 dear madam -- this letter will not i hope reach you many day before I in a distress which can be so little relieved nothing remain for a friend but to come and partake it poor dear sweet little boy when i read the letter this day to mr aston she say such a death be the next to translation yet however i may convince myself of this the tear be in my eye and yet i could not love he as you love he nor reckon upon he for a future comfort as you and he father reckon upon he he be go and we be go we could not have enjoy he long and shall not long be separate from he he have probably escape many such pang as you be now feel nothing remain but that with humble confidence we resign ourselves to almighty goodness and fall down without irreverent murmur before the sovereign distributer of good and evil with hope that though sorrow endureth for a night yet joy may come in the morning i have know you madam too long to think that you want any argument for submission to the supreme will nor can my consolation have any effect but that of show that i wish to comfort you what can be do you must do for yourself remember first that you child be happy and then that he be safe not only from the ill of this world but from those more formidable danger which extend they mischief to eternity you have bring into the world a rational being have see he happy during the little life that have be grant he and can have no doubt but that he happiness be now permanent and immutable when you have obtain by prayer such tranquillity as nature will admit force you attention as you can upon you accustomed duty and accustomed entertainment you can do no more for we dear boy but you must not therefore think less on those whom you attention may make fitter for the place to which he be go i be dearest dearest madam you most affectionate humble servant xxxiv -- to mr thrale sept 6 1777 dearest lady -- it be true that i have loiter and what be worse loiter with very little pleasure the time have run away as most time run without account without use and without memorial but to say this of a few week though not please might be bear but what ought to be the regret of he who in a few day will have so nearly the same to say of sixty-eight year but complaint be vain if you have nothing to say from the neighborhood of the metropolis what can occur to I in little city and petty town in place which we have both see and of which no description be wanted i have leave part of the company with which you dine here to come and write this letter in which i have nothing to tell but that my night be very tedious i can not persuade myself to forbear try something as you have now little to do i suppose you be pretty diligent at the thraliana and a very curious collection posterity will find it do not remit the practice of write down occurrence as they arise of whatever kind and be very punctual in annex the date chronology you know be the eye of history and every man 's life be of importance to himself do not omit painful casualty or unpleasing passage they make the variegation of existence and there be many transaction of which i will not promise with aenea et haec olim meminisse juvabit yet that remembrance which be not pleasant may be useful there be however a intemperate attention to slight circumstance which be to be avoid lest a great part of life be spend in write the history of the rest every day perhaps have something to be note but in a settle and uniform course few day can have much why do i write all this which i have no thought of when i begin the thraliana drive it all into my head it deserve however a hour 's reflection to consider how with the least loss of time the loss of what we wish to retain may be prevent do not neglect to write to I for when a post come empty i be really disappointed boswell i believe will meet I here i be dearest lady you & c xxxv -- to mr thrale lichfield October 3 1777 dear madam -- this be the last time that i shall write in this excursion from this place to-morrow i shall be i hope at birmingham from which place i shall do my best to find the nearest way home i come home i think worse than i go and do not like the state of my health but vive hodie make the most of life i hope to get better and -- sweep the cobweb but i have sad night mr aston have send I to mr greene to be cure do you see foote at brighthelmstone -- do you think he would so soon be go -- life say falstaff be a shuttle he be a fine fellow in he way and the world be really impoverish by he sink glory murphy ought to write he life at least to give the world a footeiana now will any of he contemporary bewail he will genius change _ he sex _ to weep i would really have he life write with diligence it will be proper for I to work pretty diligently now for some time i hope to get through though so many week have pass little life and little criticism may serve have be in the country so long with very little to detain I i be rather glad to look homewards i be & c xxxvi -- to mr thrale October 13 1777 dear madam -- yet i do love to hear from you : such pretty kind letter as you send but it give I great delight to find that my master miss I i begin to wish myself with you more than i should do if i be want less it be a good thing to stay away till one 's company be desire but not so good to stay after it be desire you know i have some work to do i do not set to it very soon and if i should go up to london with nothing do what would be say but that i be -- who can tell what i therefore stay till i can bring up something to stop they mouth and then -- though i be still at ashbourne i receive you dear letter that come to lichfield and you continue that direction for i think to get thither as soon as i can one of the do die yesterday and i be afraid she fawn will be starve i wish miss thrale have it to nurse but the doctor be now all for cattle and mind very little either do or hen how do you and you aunt part do you turn she out of door to begin you journey or do she leave you by she usual shortness of visit i love to know how you go on i can not but think on you kindness and my master 's life have

constitution that whatever distemper he have he always have he head affect i be less fright the seizure be i think not apoplectical but hysterical and therefore not dangerous to life i would have you however consult such physician as you think you can best trust broomfield seem to have do well and by he practice appear not to suspect a apoplexy this be a solid and fundamental comfort i remember dr marsiglus a italian physician whose seizure be more violent than mr thrale 's for he fall down helpless but he case be not consider as of much danger and he go safe home and be now a professor at padua he fit be consider as only hysterical i hope sir philip who frank you letter comfort you as well as mr seward if i can comfort you i will come to you but i hope you be now no longer in want of

merry or sad or busy or idle and forget that death be hover over we you be a dear lady for write again the case as you now describe it be worse than i conceive it when i read you first letter it be still however not apoplectick but seem to have something worse than hysterical -- a tendency to a palsy which i hope however be now over i be glad that you have heberden and hope we be all safer i be the more alarm by this violent seizure as i can impute it to no wrong practice or intemperance of any kind and therefore know not how any defense or preservative can be obtain mr thrale have certainly less exercise than when he follow the fox but he be very far from unwieldiness or inactivity and further still from any vitious or dangerous excess i fancy however he will do well to ride more do dear madam let I know every post how he go on such sudden violence be very dreadful we know not by what it be let loose upon we nor by what its effect be limit if my come can either assist or divert or be useful to any purpose let I but know : i will soon be with you mr kennedy queeney 's bauci end last week a long life of disease and poverty she have be marry about fifty year dr taylor be not much

despair of make a end mr nichol hold that addison be the most take of all that i have do i doubt they will not be do before you come away now you think yourself the first writer in the world for a letter about nothing can you write such a letter as this so miscellaneous with such noble disdain of regularity like shakespeare 's work such graceful negligence of transition like the ancient enthusiast the pure voice of nature and of friendship now of whom shall i proceed to speak of whom but mr montague have mention shakespeare and nature do not the name of montague force itself upon I such be the transition of the ancient which now seem abrupt because the intermediate idea be lose to modern understanding i wish she name have connect itself with friendship but ah colin thy hope be

demolition of the mass-house by lincoln 's inn a exact journal of a week 's defiance of government i can not give you on Monday mr strahan who have be insult speak to lord mansfield who have i think

old bailey there be not i believe a hundred but they do they work at leisure in full security without sentinel without trepidation as man lawfully employ in full day such be the cowardice of a commercial place on Wednesday they break open the fleet and the king 's bench and the marshalsea and wood street counter and clerkenwell bridewell and release all the prisoner at night they set fire to the fleet and to the king 's bench and i know not how many other place and one might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many part the sight be dreadful some people be threaten mr

to they hole and lead to prison the street be safe and quiet : lord george be last night send to the tower mr john wilke be this day with a party of soldier in my neighborhood to seize the publisher of a seditious paper every body walk and eat and sleep in security but the history of the last week would fill you with amazement : it be without any modern example several chapel have be destroy and several inoffensive papist have be plunder but the high sport be to burn the gaol this be a good rabble trick the debtor and the criminal be all set at liberty but of the criminal as have always happen many be already retake and two pirate have surrender themselves and it be expect that they will be pardon government now act again with its proper force and we be all again under the protection

about half a minute i be alarm and pray god that however he might afflict my body he would spare my understanding this prayer that i might try the integrity of my faculty i make in latin verse the line be not very good but i know they not to be very good : i make they easily and conclude myself to be unimpaired in my faculty soon after i perceive that i have suffer a paralytick stroke and that my speech be take from I i have no pain and so little dejection in this dreadful state that i wonder at my own apathy and consider that perhaps death itself when it should come would excite less horror than seem now to attend it in order to rouse the vocal organ i take two dram wine have be celebrate for the production of eloquence i put myself into violent motion and i think repeat it but all be vain i then go to bed and strange as it may seem i think sleep when i see light it be time to contrive what i should do though god stop my speech he leave I my hand : i enjoy a mercy which be not grant to my dear friend lawrence who now perhaps overlook I as i be write and rejoice that i have what he want my first note be necessarily to my servant who come in talk and could not immediately

to mr thrale london October 9 1783 two night ago mr burke sit with I a long time he seem much pleased with he journey we have both see stonehenge this summer for the first time i tell he that the view have enable I to confute two opinion which have be advance about it one that the material be not natural stone but a artificial composition harden by time this notion be as old as camden 's time and have this strong argument to support it that stone of that species be nowhere to be find the other opinion advance by dr charlton be that it be erect by the danes mr bowle make I observe that the transverse stone be fix on the perpendicular supporter by a knob form on the top of the upright stone which enter into a hollow cut in the cross stone this be a proof that the enormous edifice be raise by a people who have not yet the knowledge of mortar which can not be suppose of the dane who come hither in ship and be not ignorant certainly of the art of life this prove likewise the stone not to be factitious for they that could mould such durable mass could do much more than make mortar and could have continue the transverse from the upright part with the same paste you have doubtless see stonehenge and if you have not i should think it a hard task to make a adequate description it be in my opinion to be refer to the earliest habitation of the island as a druidical monument of at least two thousand year probably the most ancient work of man upon the island salisbury cathedral and its neighbor stonehenge be two eminent monument of art and rudeness and may show the first essay
