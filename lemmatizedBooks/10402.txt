the maternal tribute in rag-time he and the conspire instrument be conceal in the depths of the vehicle from the gaze of the multitude but mr heatherbloom at the back face they on the little step which serve as concert stage there be no limelight or stereopticon picture to add to the illusion -- only the disconcerting face and the light of day he never before know how bright the day could be but he continue to stand there in spite of the ludicrous and try position he sing a certain daredevil light in he eye now a suspicion of a covert smile on he face it might be rather tragic -- he

closely crop black beard a foreigner -- most likely russian the girl be as beautiful as the dainty orchid with which the superb car be adorn and which she also wear in she gown -- yellow orchid tenderly fashion but very insistent and bright upon this patrician vision mr heatherbloom have inadvertently look and the pathetic plaint regard mother die on the wing of nothingness with unfilial respect he literally abandon she and cast she to the wind he eye gleam as they rest on the girl he seem to lose himself in reverie do she the vision in orchid notice he perhaps the chauffeur at that moment increase the speed of the big car but as it dash past the crimson mouth of the beautiful girl tighten and harden into a straight line and those wonderful starlike eye shine suddenly with a light as hard as steel disdainful contemptuous albeit perhaps passionate then she orchid shine car and all be whirl on rattle bang go the iron-rimmed wheel of other rougher vehicle bing bang sound the piano like a soul in torment horatio heatherbloom stand motionless then he figure sway slightly he lift the music as if to shield he feature from the other -- he many auditor but they do not mind that brief interruption it afford a moment for that rough and ready dialogue which a gathering of this kind find to its liking give he a trokee anybody get a cough drop it be soothing syrup he want no it be we want that what the devil -- mr mackintosh look out of the wagon mr heatherbloom suddenly laugh a forced reckless laugh guess it be the dampness i be like some artist -- have to be careful where i sing have a tablet feller do say a man in the audience horatio look he in the eye maybe it be you want something the facetious one begin to back away he have see that look before the steely glint that go before battle the chord now if you please say mr heatherbloom to the composer in a still quiet voice mr mackintosh hit viciously mr heatherbloom sing again he do more than that he outdo himself he employ bombast -- some think it pathos he throw a tremolo into he voice it pass for emotion he catch 'em in mr mackintosh 's parlance and catch 'em hard some more people buy copy the alert mr mackintosh manage to gather in about a dollar and saw in consequence great fortune come he way at last the cloud have a golden lining say you be the pard i have be a-looking for he jubilantly tell mr heatherbloom as they prepare to move on we 'll make a beautiful team be not it a peach what that song it make they look like a rainy day git up and mr mackintosh prod the bony rib of they steed mr heatherbloom absent-mindedly gaze in the direction the big shine motor have vanish chapter ii vary fortune mr heatherbloom 's new-found employment prove but ephemeral the next day the sheriff take possession of the music emporium and all it contain include the nomadic piano and the now empty jug the contents of the last the composer-publisher take care to put beyond reach of he many creditor whom he in consequence face with a seemingly care-free if artificial jocularity mr heatherbloom walk soberly forth from the shop of concord he have but turn the corner of the street when into the now dissonant hole in the wall amid the scene of wreck and disaster step a tall dark man with a closely crop beard who speak english with a accent and who regard the erstwhile proprietor and the minion of the law with ill-concealed arrogance and disfavor you have he begin in halt tone a young man here who sing on the street like the minstrel of old the -- what you call they -- troubadour we _ have _ correct mr mackintosh he have just ` jump the coup ' or rather be ` shoo out ' the new-comer fasten he gaze upon the other he have superb almost mesmeric eye will you kindly speak the language as i understand it he say and the other do for there be that in the caller 's manner which compel immediate compliance immovably he listen to the composer-publisher 's explanation _ eh bien _ he say he handsome rather barbaric head high when mr mackintosh have conclude he be go it be well i have fulfil my mission and walk out the impose stranger hail a taxi and disappear from the neighborhood meanwhile mr horatio heatherbloom have walk slowly on he be now some distance from the one-time emporium where should he go he fortune have not be enhance materially by he brief excursion into the realm of melody he have thirty cent in cash and a dollar-and-a-half appetite a untidy place where they display a bargain assortment of creature comfort attract he gaze he think of meal in the past -- of caviar a la russe three dollar and a half a portion peach melba three franc each at the café de paris truffle capon from normandy duck after the manner of the incomparable frederic about half a dozen peach melba would have appeal to he now he look instead with the eye of longing at a codfish ball oh glorious appetite mock recollection of hour of satiety should he yield to temptation he stop then prudence prevail the day be yet too young to give way recklessly to casual gastronomic allurement so he step on again quickly avert he head from shop window lest he caution and conservatism might give way he start to turn into a side street -- but do not instead he laugh slightly to himself what flee from a outpost of time-worn celery beat a inglorious retreat before a phalanx of machine-made pie he would look they -lrb- figuratively -rrb- in the eye have as it be fairly stare out of countenance the bland pie and beam with stern contempt upon the droopy preraphaelite celery he go better satisfied on he way it be these little victory that count at that moment mr heatherbloom march on like a knight of old for steadfastness of purpose he lip veil a covert smile as if behind the hard mask of life he see something a little odd and whimsical appeal to some secret sense of humor that even hunger could not wholly annihilate the lock of hair seem to droop rather pathetically at that moment he sensitive feature be slightly pinch he face be pale it would probably be paler before the day be over _ n'importe _ the future have to be meet -- for better or worse multitude pass this way and that a elevated go crash by devastate influence seem to surround he he slender form stiffen when next he stop it be to linger not in front of a eating establishment but before a bulletin-board upon which be paste a page of newspaper want ad for trained man in all walk of life trained man hateful word how often have he encounter it ah here be one advertisement without the train he devour it eagerly the item like a oasis in the desert of he general incapacity and uselessness exercise a odd fascination for he in spite of the absolute impossibility of he profess to possess a fractional part of those moral attribute demand by the fair advertiser she -- a miss van rolsen -- be seek a paragon not a person nevertheless he resolve to assail the apparently unassailable and repair to a certain ultrafashionable neighborhood of the town before a brownstone front that bear the number he seek he pause a moment draw a deep breath and start to walk up the front step but with a short laugh he come suddenly to a halt half-way up look over the stone balustrade down at the other entrance below -- the tradesman 's -- the butcher ' the baker ' the candlestick maker ' -- and yes the servant ' -- they way in -- he he go down the step and walk on and away as a matter of course but once more stop he have do a good deal of go this way and that and then stop during the last few month thing have to be work out and sometimes he brain do not seem to move very quickly to be work out he now survey the butcher ' and the baker ' -lrb- and yes the servant ' -rrb- entrance with casual or philosophic interest from the vantage point of the other side of the street it be not different from any other of the entrance of the kind but it hold he gaze then he walk across the street again and go in -- or down it do not really seem now such a bad kind of entrance when you come to investigate it in a high impersonal way not half so bad as the subway and people do not mind that still mr heatherbloom experience a peculiar thrill when he put up he thumb press a button and wonder what next would happen who answer door down here -- the maid -- the cook -- the laundress he feel himself to be very indistinct and vague standing there in the shadow and try to assume a nonchalant bearing he wonder just what bear _ be _ proper under the circumstance he cherish indistinct recollection of have hear or read that the butcher 's boy be usually favor with a broadly defy and independent visage that he come in whistle and go forth swagger a cat-meat man he have once look upon from the upper lodge of front step somewhere in the dim long ago have possess a melancholy manner and countenance how should he comport himself what should he say -- when the inevitable happen when the time come to say something how lead the conversation by natural and easy stage to the purport of he visit he rehearse a few sentence then straightway forget they why do they keep he wait so long do they always keep people as long as that -- down here he put he thumb again -- well what do you want the door have open and a buxom female arm akimbo regard he mr heatherbloom repay she gaze with interest it _ be _ the cook then who act as door tender of these region subterranean he fear by she expression that he have interrupt she in the preparation of some esculent delicacy and with the fear be bear a parenthetical inquiry he wonder what that delicacy might be but forbear to inquire he state he business you 'll be the thirteenth that be be ` turn down ' to-day for that job observe cook blandly with which cheer assurance she consign he to some one else -- a maid with a tipped-up nose -- and presently he find himself be show up that be the expression use the room into which he be usher be a parlor absently he seat himself the maid titter he look at she -- or rather the tipped-up nose a attractive bit of anatomy saucy provocative mr heatherbloom 's head tilted a little he survey the detail with the look of a connoisseur she color go but remain in the hall to peer there be many article of virtu lie around -- on table or in cabinet -- and the caller 's appearance be against he he would bear

reason think the maid then give a start of surprise the hand of the suspicious-looking caller have lift involuntarily to he breast pocket a mechanical movement such as a young gentleman might make who be reach for a cigarette case do he intend -- actually intend to -- but the caller 's hand fall he sit forward suddenly on the edge of he chair and seem for the first time aware that he attitude partook of the anomalous for gather up he shabby hat from the gorgeous rug he abruptly rise just in time to confront or be confront by a austere lady in stiff satin or brocade and with bristle iron-gray hair he notice however that unlike the maid she have a very prominent nose -- that _ now _ sniff good heaven what a frightful odor of gasolene jane where be my salt jane rush in at the same time four or five dog that have follow in the lady 's wake begin to bark as if they too be echo the plaint : what a frightful odor salt jane salt and as they bark in many key but always fortissimo they run frantically this way and that as though chase by somebody or something -lrb- perhaps the odor of gasolene -rrb- or chase one another in a mad outburst of canine exuberance sardanapoli beauty curly naughty the lady call out but in vain sardanapoli continue to cut caper beauty 's conduct be not beautiful while as for naughty -lrb- all yellow bow and black curl -rrb- he seem endeavor to live

honor of call and -- you be another answer to the advertisement then i suppose the lady 's voice unceremoniously interrupt he confess himself another answer and in that capacity proceed now to reply as best he might to a merciless and rapid fire of question she would have make a excellent cross-examiner for the prosecution mr heatherbloom do not seem to enjoy the grill a number of query he answer frankly other he evade he seem -- ominous circumstance -- especially secretive regard certain detail of he past he do not care to say where he be bear or who he parent be what have he do what occupation have he follow well -- he seem to hesitate a good deal -- he have once try wash dish but -- dreamily -- they have discharge he the man say something about there be a debit balance on

very extraordinary what madam he venture that naughty who so seldom take to stranger should -- she find herself say perhaps it be the scent of the gasolene he suggest it be _ in spite of _ the gasolene she retort sharply and for some moment ruminate it be not until afterward mr heatherbloom learn that she confidence in naughty 's instinct amount to a hobby only once have she think he at fault in he likes or dislike of people when he have show a predilection for the assistant rector 's shapely calf but after that gentleman 's elopement with a lady of the choir and he desertion of wife and child naughty 's erstwhile disrespect for the cloth which miss van rolsen have grieve over become illumine with force and significance thereafter she have never doubt he he have bark at all twelve

murder in we bed she say half to herself but with sudden decision i have conclude to engage you and my duty venture mr heatherbloom the advertisement do not say you be to exercise the darling every day in the park ah horatio 's exclamation be noncommittal what he might have add be interrupt by a light footstep in the hall and the voice of some one who stop in pass before the door i be go now aunt say a voice mr heatherbloom start he hand tighten on the back of a chair from where he stand he could see but the rim of a wonderful hat he gaze at a few wave rose fitting note of color as it be for the lovely face behind conceal from he by the curtain the elderly lady answer mr heatherbloom hear a prince someone 's name mention then the rose be whisk back the voice -- musical as silver bell -- recede and the front door close mr heatherbloom gaze around he -- at the furnishings in the room -- she who stand before he he seem bewildered and now as to you wages say a voice -- not silver bell -- sharply i hardly think i should prove suitable -- he begin in somewhat panic-stricken tone when -- nonsense the word or the energy impart to it appear to crush for the moment further opposition on he part he faculty become concentrated on a sound without of a big car gathering headway in front of the door mr heatherbloom listen perhaps he would have like to retreat then and there from that house but it be too late fate have precipitated he here a mad tragic jest he do not catch the amount of he proposed stipend that be mention he even forget for the moment he be hungry he could no longer hear the car it have go but it would return return and then -- he head whirl at the thought chapter iii a encounter mr heatherbloom a few day later sit one morning in central park he canine charge be tie to the bench and while they chafe at restraint and try vainly to get away and chase squirrel he scrutinize one of the page of a newspaper some person have leave there what the young man read seem to give he no great pleasure he put down the paper then pick it up again and regard a snap-shot illustration occupy a conspicuous position on the society page prince bori strogareff ride in the park the picture be label the newspaper photographer have catch for he sensational sheet a excellent likeness of a foreign visitor in whom new york be at the time greatly interested a picturesque personality -- the prince -- half distinguished gentleman half bold brigand in appearance be depict on a superb bay and look every inch a horseman mr heatherbloom continue to stare at the likeness the feature dark rather wild-looking as if a trace of he ancient tartar ancestry have survive the cultivate touch of time then the young man on the bench once more turn he attention to the text accompany the cut report engagement of miss elizabeth dalrymple to prince bori strogareff the prince have vast estate in russium and russia-asia he forbear be prominent in the day when crakow be build and the cossack and the pole be engage in constant strife on the steppe miss dalrymple with whom this stalwart romantic personage be say to be deeply enamored be niece and heiress of the eccentric miss van rolsen the third richest woman in new york and probably in the world miss dalrymple be the only survive daughter of charle dalrymple of san francisco who make he fortune with martin ferguson of the same place at the time -- the paper fall from mr heatherbloom 's hand for several moment he sit motionless then he get up unloosened he charge and move on they naturally become once more wild with joy but he heed not they exuberance even naughty 's demonstration bring no answering touch of he hand that now lift to he breast and take something from he pocket -- a article wrap in a pink tissue-paper mr heatherbloom unfold the warm-tinted cover with light sedulous finger and look steadily and earnestly at a miniature but only for a brief interval by this time curly et al have become a incomprehensible tangle of dog and lead string about mr heatherbloom 's leg so much so indeed that in the effort to extricate himself he drop the tiny picture with a sudden passionate exclamation he stoop for it the anger that transform he usually mild visage seem about to vent itself on he charge but almost at once subside carefully brushing the picture on he coat he replace it in he pocket and quietly start to disentangle he charge from himself this be at length accomplish he know however that the unraveling would have to be do all over again ere long it constitute a important part of he duty the promenade be punctuate by about so many mix-up mr heatherbloom accept they philosophically or absent-mindedly at any rate while untie knot or disengage thing he usually exhibit much patience it might have be notice some time later that mr heatherbloom retrace he footstep to miss van rolsen 's betray a rather vacillate and uncertain manner as if he be somewhat reluctant to go into or to approach too near the old-fashioned stiff and stately house for fear of meet some one or a dread of some sudden encounter with miss van rolsen 's niece so far he have not see she since that first day perhaps he congratulate himself on he good fortune in this respect if so he reckon without he host it be possible for two people to frequent the same house for quite a while without meeting when one of they live on the avenue side and flit back and forth via the front step while the other come and go only by the subterranean route but sooner or later though belong to widely different world these two be bind to come face to face even in spite of the determination of one of the person to avert such a contingency mr heatherbloom always peer carefully about before venture from the house with he pampered charge he be no less watchfully alert when he return he could not however have only five sens tell when the front door might be suddenly open at a inopportune moment it be open this very morning on the third day of he probation at such a moment and he have be plan after read the newspaper article in the park to tender he resignation that very afternoon it avail he nothing now to regret indecision he be partly coerce by the masterful mistress of the house into remain as long as he have remain or to lament that other sentiment conspire to this end -- the desire or determination not to flee from what he most fear empty bravado if he could but flee now but there be no flee turn retreat or evade the issue have to be meet miss dalrymple gown in a filmy material which lend a evanescent charm to she slender figure come down the front step as he be about to enter the area way below the girl look at he and she eye suddenly widen she stop mr heatherbloom quite pale bow and would have go on when something in she look or the first word that fall from she lip hold he you she say as if she do not at all comprehend he repay she regard with less steady look he have to say something and he do not wish to why could not people just meet and pass on the way dumb creature do the gift of speech have its disadvantage -- on occasion it force one to insufficient answer or superfluous explanation yes he say you -- miss van rolsen engage I i do not really want to stay but it come about some thing do you know you see he add i do not know she be you aunt when i answer the advertisement she bent she gaze down upon he as if she hardly hear beneath the bright adornment of tint the lovely face -- it be a very proud face -- have become icy cold the violet eye be hard as shine crystal to mr heatherbloom that slender figure tensely poise seem at once overwhelmingly near and inexpressibly remote he start to lean on a iron picket but change he mind and stand rather too stiffly without support before he eye the flower in she hat wave and wave he try to keep he eye on they i have be intend he observe in tone he endeavor to make light to tell miss van rolsen she must find some one else to take my place it would not be very difficult it be not a position that require a trained man difficult she seem to have difficulty in speak the word she cold eye suddenly light with unutterable scorn if any one in this world ever experience thorough disdain for any one else she expression imply it be she that experience it for he valet for dog mr heatherbloom flush they be very nice dog he murmur indeed they be exceptional she give a abrupt frozen little laugh then bent down she face slightly and do you wash and curl and perfume they she ask she small white tooth set tightly after she speak well i do not perfume they answer mr heatherbloom miss van rolsen attend to that herself she know the particular essence better than i a slightly strained smile struggle about

thing be why do you want this position what ulterior motive lay behind she be speak now almost automatically as if he be not present for of course there be some other motive the truth be observe mr heatherbloom lightly but pass a uncertain hand over he brow i have reach that point -- i should qualify by say i have long be at the point where one be willing to take any ` honest work of any kind ' i suppose you have hear the phrase before it be a common one but believe I it be quite by accident i come here quite ` believe you ' say the girl as one would address a inferior for the purpose of put he into the category where he belong ` honest work ' when have you be particular as to that whether or not -- with mock irony in the pitiless violet eye -- it be ` honest ' mr heatherbloom start he

not care i -- you reconcile the idea of my be _ that _ very easily with -- it fit perfectly say the girl with the rest of the picture what one have already piece together it be just another odd-shaped black bit that go in snugly you appreciate the comparison i think i do answer mr heatherbloom you be allude to picture puzzle be there anything more he start as if to go one moment -- of course you can not stay here say the girl i have intend to go at once as i tell you observe mr heatherbloom you have you mean you will no i will not go now that be he add of my own volition you do well to

she do not speak the word but it tremble on the sweet passionate lip he do not answer suppose she go on i offer you the chance and do not speak if you will go -- immediately i can not he answer she brow bent she little hand seem to clench but he stand without look at she appear absorb in a tiny bit of cloud in the sky very well she say a dangerous glint in she eye he look quite insignificant at the moment she be far above he he clothes be threadbare the way thief ' clothes or pickpocket ' usually be if you expect any mercy from I -- she begin but she do not finish a figure approach catch she eye -- the handsome stalwart figure of a man whose feature light at sight of she ah miss dalrymple she face change a unexpected pleasure prince she say with almost a excess of gaiety he answer in kind she come down the step quickly offer he she hand and as he gallantly raise the small perfumed finger to he lip mr heatherbloom seem to fade away into the dark subterranean entrance chapter iv fate at the door although mr heatherbloom wait expectantly that day for he dismissal it do not come this surprised he somewhat then he reflect that miss elizabeth dalrymple be probably so absorb in the prince -- remember she rather effusive greet of that fortunate individual -- she have forget such a small matter as have the dog valet eject from the premise she would remember on the morrow of course but she do not the hour pass and he be suffer to go about the even or uneven tenor of he way this he do mechanically he scrub and comb beauty beautifully with a dire sense of fate knock at the door he pass she on to miss van rolsen to be freshly be-ribboned by that lady 's own particular hand the thin bony finger he think would be pointed accusingly at he busy itself solely with the knot and bow of a new ribbon after which the grim lady dismiss he -- from she presence not the house -- curtly several day go by still no one accuse he he be still suffer to remain why he could not understand at the end of a long -- seemingly interminable week -- he put himself deliberately in the way of find out come to or go from the house he linger around the area entrance purposely to encounter she whom he have heretofore above all other wish to avoid a feverish desire possess he to meet the worst and then go about he way no matter where it might lead he he be past solicitude in that regard he do at length manage to meet she -- not as before in the full daylight but toward dusk as she return this time on foot to the house miss dalrymple may i speak to you he say to the indistinctly see slender figure that start lightly up the front step she do not even stop although she must have hear he a moment he see she like a shadow then the front door open he hear a crisp metallic click the door close slowly with head a little downbent he walk out up the way she have come then around the corner a short distance to the stable over which he have he room it be a nice room he have at first thought probably because he like horse they -- four or five thoroughbred -- whinny as he open the door he have start up the dark narrow stair to he chamber but stop at that sound and grope about from stall to stall pass around the expect lump of sugar after which all seem well as far as he and they be concern only that other problem -- he could not shake it from he to resign now -- under fire how he wish he might but to remain -- he situation be intolerable he go up to he room feeling like a ghost he mind be full of dark presence as if he have live a thousand time before and have be surround only by hostile influence that now come back in the still watch of the night to haunt he he dread go to the house the next day but he go perhaps he reflect she be only allow he to retain he present position under a kind of espionage to trap he and put he beyond the pale of respectable society he remember the cruel lip the passionate dislike -- contempt -- even hatred -- in she eye yes that might be it -- the reason for she temporary silence the house be full of valuable thing sooner or later -- be you quite satisfied madam with my service say mr heatherbloom that afternoon to miss van rolsen you seem to do well enough she answer shortly he brighten perhaps some one else would do better perhaps she return dryly but i be not go to try but he say desperately i -- i do not think they -- the dog like I quite so much as they do naughty in particular he add quickly i -- i think yesterday he would have like to -- growl and nip at I do he she ask study he with disconcert keenness actually do that no but -- do i understand you wish to give I notice she interrupt sharply not at all in a alarmed tone i could not -- i mean i would not do that only i think you might have feel dissatisfied -- people usually do with I he add impressively so if you would like to give I -- she make a gesture that will do i be very busy this morning the beg list though smaller than usual -- only three hundred and seventy-six letter -- have to be attend to thus the matter of mr heatherbloom 's staying or go continued much to that person 's discomfiture _ in statu quo _ it be true he find later a compromise course a way out of the difficulty -- as he think little know the extraordinary new web he be weave -- but before that time come several thing happen in the first place he discover that miss dalrymple be not entirely pleased at the publication of the story of she engagement to the prince she position -- she family 's and that of miss van rolsen be such that newspaper advertising or notoriety could not but be distasteful i hope people will not think i keep a social secretary mr heatherbloom hear she say yes hear she he be in the dog ' boudoir the conservatory adjoin he could not help be where he be he belong there at the time nor could he help hearing he do not try to listen he certainly do not wish to though she have a very sweet voice -- that soothe one to a species of lotus dream -- forgetfulness of soap-suds or the odor of canine disinfectant permeate the white foam -- why should they think you have a social secretary the voice of a man -- the prince -- inquire he have deep fine tone truly russian tone with a subtle vibration in they because when such thing be publish about people they secretary usually put they in return the girl he be silent a moment mr heatherbloom think he hear the breaking of the stem of a flower you be very much irritated -- angry observe the prince at length quietly be not you she ask i no it be a bourgeois confession perhaps mr heatherbloom sit up straighter the water drip from he finger i be pleased go on the sonorous low voice i wish -- it be so there be a sudden movement in the conservatory a rustling of leaf or of a gown then -- mr heatherbloom relax in surprise -- a peal of merry laughter fill the air how apropo how well you say that miss dalrymple there be a slightly rise inflection in the man 's tone you doubt my sincerity the sincerity of a russian prince no indeed she return gaily i be in earnest he say simply do not be mr heatherbloom could in fancy see the flash of a white hand amid red flower eye dance like violet in the wind he could perceive also as plainly as if he be in that other room the deep ardent eye of the prince downbent upon the blither one the commanding figure of the man near that other slender almost illusive presence a flower to be grasp only by a bold wooer like the prince do not be she repeat you be so much more charming when you be not i think i hear that line in a play once one of the robertson kind it be give by a stock company in san francisco that be where i come from you know have you ever be there no say the prince slowly dark eye try to beat down the merriment in the blue one mr heatherbloom could in imagination fill in all the stage detail if it only be stage dialogue stage talk not play with love in earnest playing with love he have read a book of that name once somewhere in italy -- yes it sound like a italian title something very disagreeable happen to the heroine a woman or a girl can not lightly play with love with a sicilian but of course the prince be not a sicilian no he be say now with admirable poise in answer to she question i have not visit you wonderful golden gate but i hope to go there some day -- with you he add he word be simple the accent alone make they sound formidable it seem to convey a impregnable purpose one not to be shake or disturb mr heatherbloom feel vaguely disturbed he heart pound oddly he half start to get up then sink back he wait for another peal of laughter it do not come why of course i should have no objection to you be one of a train party say miss dalrymple at length that be not just what i mean return the prince in he courtliest tone but it be not hard to picture he now with a glitter in he gaze -- immovable sure of himself there be a rather long pause break once more by miss dalrymple : shall we not return to the music room that interval what have it mean mute acquiescence on she part a down-turning of the imperious lash before the steadfastness of the other 's look -- tacit assent the casting off of barrier the opening of the gate of the divine inner citadel mr heatherbloom be on he foot now he take a step toward the door but pause of course something clammy have fall from he hand lay damp and drip on the rag he stare at it -- a bar of soap what have he be about to do -- he -- to step in there -- into the conservatory with he bar of soap -- grotesque anomaly he face wear a strange expression he be laugh inwardly oh how he be laugh at himself fortunately he have a saving sense of humor what have next be say in the conservatory what be now be say there he hear word but they have no meaning for he i will send you the second volume of _ the fire and sword _ trilogy go on the prince one of my ancestor figure in it the hero -- who be not exactly a hero perhaps in the heroine 's mind for a time -- do what he must do he have what he must have he claim what nature make for he he know no other law than that of he imperishable inner self i too must rise to those height my eye be set on it must be it be write we be fatalist we russian near the tartar line and you and i -- fervently -- be predestine for each other mr heatherbloom have but dimly hear the prince 's word and fail to grasp they he do not want to he head be hum she light answer sound as if she might be very happy yes naturally she be make to be happy to dance about like sunshine he like to think of the picture the prince too be necessary to complete it necessary reaffirm mr heatherbloom to himself pull with damp finger at the inconsequential lock of hair over he brow of course if the prince could be eliminate from that mental picture of she felicity -- but he be a part of the composition big barbaric romantic look in fact it would not have be a adequate composition at all without he no indeed and something rise in mr heatherbloom 's throat one of he eye -- or be it both of they -- seem a little misty that confound soap it be strong a bit of it in the corner of the eye make one blink the two in the conservatory say something more but the young man in the boudoir do not catch it at all well by some intense mental process or the sound of the scrubber on the edge of the tub he find he could shut a definite cognizance of word almost entirely from he sense of hear the prince 's voice seem slightly louder that in a general way be patent no doubt the occasion warrant more fervor on he part mr heatherbloom try to imagine what she would look like in -- so to say a very complaisant mood not with flame glance full of aversion and scorn violet eye replete only with love light mr heatherbloom bent lower over the tub he four-footed charge beauty contentedly immerse to the neck in nice comfortably warm water lick he he do not feel the touch the fragrance of orchid seem to come to he above that other more healthful less agreeable odor of special cleanse preparation she accent be hear once more those final word sound like a soft command naturally she could command the prince -- now mr heatherbloom hear a door close -- a replica of the harsh click he have listen to when she have shut the front door so unceremoniously on he a short time before then he hear nothing more he gaze around he as he sit with he hand tightly close have it be only a dream naughty whine sardanapoli edge toward he and mechanically he begin to brush he down until he shine as sleek and shine as he assyrian namesake chapter v a contretemps more day pass and mr heatherbloom continue to linger in he last position it promise to be a record-making situation from the standpoint of longevity he have never last at any one task so long before miss van rolsen to he consternation seem to unbend somewhat before he as if she be begin -- actually -- to be more prepossess in he favor these evidence that he be rise in the stern lady 's good grace fill mr heatherbloom with new dismay destiny certainly seem to be make a mock of he a week go by two week -- three and still twice a day he continue to march to and from the park with he charge the face of all the nurse-maid and other who frequent the big parallelogram of green become familiar to he he learn to know by sight the people who ride in the park and have a distant acquaintance with the squirrel he become for the first time aware one day from the perusal of a certain newspaper he always purchase now that the prince have return to russia although miss dalrymple refuse to be interview or to confirm or deny any statement it be generally understand -lrb- convenient phrase -rrb- that the wedding would take place in the fall at the old van rolsen home the prince have leave america in he yacht -- the _ nevskus _ -- for st petersburg announce the society editor after a special interview with the czar and a few necessary business arrangement the nobleman would return at once for he bride and perhaps he -- mr heatherbloom -- would still be at he post of duty at the van rolsen house since the day the prince have be with miss dalrymple in the conservatory mr heatherbloom have not see or rather hear that gentleman at the house but then he -- mr heatherbloom -- belong in the rear and no doubt the prince have continue to be a daily or twice or three-times-a-day visitor to miss van rolsen 's elegant if somewhat stiff reception room now however he would come no more until he come finally to take with he the bride -- the thought be in horatio 's mind when for a third time he encounter she face to face on a landing near a stair or somewhere in the house he could not afterward just exactly recall where only that she look through he without recognition speech or movement of a eyelash as if he have be a thing of thin air but a thing that become suddenly imbue with real life inspire with purpose she have permit he to remain in the house know he profess helplessness in the matter -- she _ must _ have divine that -- play with he as a tigress with a victim -lrb- yes a tigress mr heatherbloom wildly on the spur of the moment compare she in he mind to that fierce beautiful creature -rrb- he would force she to tell he to go she would certainly not suffer he to remain there another day if he tell she -- miss dalrymple there be something i ought to say i could not help overhear you and the prince one day several week ago in the conservatory after he say it he ask himself what excuse he have for say it if he have stop to analyze the impulse he would have see how absurd unreasonable and uncalled for he word be but he have no time to analyze like a diver who plunge suddenly on some mad impulse into a whirlpool he have cast himself into the vortex she look at he and there be nothing _ in nubibus _ to she about he presence now the violet eye see a substance -- such as it be recognize a reality -- of its kind before the cloud gather in they depths mr heatherbloom feel inclined to excuse himself and go on but instead he wait there be even a furtive smile on he lip that belie a quick throbbing in he breast he thrust one hand as debonairly as possible into he trousers pocket he attitude might have be interpret to express indifference recklessness or one or more of the synonymous feeling she think so badly of he already that she could not think much worse and -- so -- have she be paler than she wont or have excess of passion send the color from she face -- you be a spy as _ well _ he head shoot back a little at the accent on the well but he thrust he hand yet deeper into the pocket and strive not to lose that assume expression of ease i -- a spy i do not intend to -- you -- he pause if he wish to set himself right in she eye why should he have speak at all mr heatherbloom see he have not quite argue out this matter as he should have do he bearing become less assure be there -- she voice low and tense -- anything despicable mean paltry enough that you be not mr heatherbloom moisten he lip he strive to think of a reply sufficiently comprehensive to cover all the feature of the case but not find one at once apologetic and yet not so remain silent he make however a little gesture with he hand -- the one that be not in the pocket that seem to imply something he do not quite know what she come slightly closer and he heart begin to pound harder a breath of perfume seem to ascend between they the arrow in she eye dart into he how much -- _ what _ do you hear she demand i -- be really not sure -- be it the orchid which perfumed the air he have always hear they be odorless the question intrude he brain seem capable of a dual capacity or of a general incapacity of simultaneous consideration he might possibly have step back a little now but there be a wall the broad blank wall behind he he wish he be that void she have first seem to see -- or not to see -- in he i do not hear very much -- the first part i imagine -- the first part rose of anger burn on she cheek and afterward -- spy she little hand be tight against she side he hesitate she foot move all that be passionate vibrant in she nature seem concentrate on he i do not think i catch much but i hear he say something about fate or destiny and man come into they own -- that old greek kind of talk do not you know -- he speak lightly why not there be no need of be melodramatic what have to be must be he could not alter she or what she would think then -- then i be too busy to catch more -- that be if i have want to -- which i do not he be force to add the last it burst from he lip with sudden passion then they curve a little as if to ask excuse for a superfluity she continue to look at he and he look at she now squarely a strange calm descend upon he and that he say be all i hear or know until this morning when i saw in the paper dreamily he be come back in the fall for -- the color concentrate with sudden swift brightness in she cheek you see that -- any one -- every one saw -- oh -- she start to speak further then bit she lip while the lace stir beneath the white throat mr heatherbloom have not follow what she say be cognizant only of she anger she eye be fasten on something beyond he but return soon very soon oh she say i might have know -- if i let you stay through pity you would -- pity say mr heatherbloom because i do not want to turn you out into the street -- she speak the word fiercely mr heatherbloom seem now quite impervious to stab or thrust i permit you to remain for -- she stop -- remember what you once be who you people be what -- fling the word at he -- you might have be instead -- of what you be mr heatherbloom gaze now without wince a unnatural absence of feeling seem to have pass over he feature make they almost mask-like it be as if he stand in some new pellucid atmosphere of he own of course he say as half speak to himself i must have earn my salary or miss van rolsen would not have retain I so i be not a recipient of charity therefore -- do the word suggest far-away school-boy lesson on syllogism and sophistry -- i have no right to feel offended in that you let I remain you say ` through pity ' when as a matter of fact it be impossible for I to tender my resignation in view of -- he finish the rest of a rather involve logical conclusion to himself take he hand out of he pocket now and pass it lightly in a somewhat drag fashion over he eye then he gaze momentarily beyond as if he see something appertain to the auld lang syne but recall himself with a start to the beautiful face the thread of gold the violet eye you will see to it now of course -- he manner become brisk almost businesslike -- that i as a factor be eliminate here that i may conclude be you intention perhaps say the girl a sibyl for intentness now you would prefer to go to be ask to you would find the street -- with swift discerning contempt -- more profitable for you purpose than here where you be know perhaps assent mr heatherbloom he speak quite airily then suddenly stiffen at he word the sight of he as he utter they she come abruptly yet nearer she breath sweep and seem to scorch he cheek i should think she say you would be ashamed to live ashamed he begin then stop there be no need of speak further for she have go chapter vi plot and counter-plot mr heatherbloom drift not look for a way one be force upon he it come to he unexpectedly chance serve he he would have thrust it from he but could not during he more or less eccentric peregrination in central park he have form visual acquaintance with sundry folk picture of some of they be very dimly impressed on he consciousness other -- and the major part -- on he subconsciousness flat face big face red face pale face one countenance in the last class make itself a trifle more insistent than the other its possessor have watch with interest he progress interrupt with entanglement and have listen to the music of he march the canine fantasia staccato affettuoso mr heatherbloom 's halt footstep in the park generally lead he to the height it be not a very high point but it be the highest he could find and he could look off on something -- a lake or reservoir of water he do not know just which and a jagged sky-line the person that exhibit casual curiosity in he movement and he come thither be a woman she seem slight and sinuous sit there against the stone parapet and deep dark eye accentuate the pallor of she face he do not think it strange she should always be at this spot when he come in fact it be quite a while before he notice the almost daily coincidence of they mutual presence at the same place at about the same time after she first half-sly half-sedulous regard of he she would look away she face then wear a soft and melancholy expression she appear very sad it take quite a while for this fact to be communicate to mr heatherbloom though she shift she figure often as if to call attention to the pale profile of she face against a leaden sky he thought remain introspective only the sky-line seem to interest he but one day something white come dancing in the breeze to he foot absorb in deep neutral tone afar he do not see it he four-footed charge however be quick to perceive the object oh say the lady mr heatherbloom look be -- be it yours he ask it -- be she remark with a slight accent on the last word he get up there seem little use endeavor to rescue the handkerchief now i be afraid i have be rather slow he remark quite stupid i be sure she may have have she own opinion but maintain a discreet silence mr heatherbloom stoop and gather in the remnant you will permit I he observe to replace it of course but it be not you fault it be that of my charge then no the wind let 's blame it on the wind she laugh she dark eye full on he though mr heatherbloom seem hardly to see they after that when they meet on this little elevation she bow to he and sometimes venture a remark or two he do not seem over-anxious to talk but he meet she troubled face with calm and unvarying though somewhat absent-minded courtesy he reply to she question perfunctorily tell she whom he serve betray however in turn no inquisitiveness concern she for he she be just some one who come and go and incidentally interfere with he study of the

the maid with the saucy nose mr heatherbloom indifferently vouchsafe have just leave to marry out of service how fortunate the fair questioner cry then sigh miss van rolsen be a maiden lady would probably be most particular about recommendation that they should be of the home-made intelligible brand from people you could call up by telephone and interrogate have she be very particular in he case mr heatherbloom say no -- not joyfully and explain though she draw word from he he talk to the sky-line she listen seem think deeply you be not please to be there keenly i -- oh of course quickly she do not appear to note he changed manner this miss van rolsen -- be not she the one whose niece -- miss elizabeth dalrymple -- recently refuse the hand and heart of a russian prince she say

to look upon she with new favor beauty have momentarily escape he vigilance and enjoy a mad romp after a squirrel before she be capture what he companion laughingly suggest would have happen if beauty have really escape and he mr heatherbloom have be force to return to the house without she what mr heatherbloom start he might lose he position _ n'est - cepa _ he do not answer the idea be bear why _

now to the world a cold place devoid of french lamb chop a hard place for homeless dog and man alike about to waive the temptation mr heatherbloom pause the idea be capable of modification or expansion most idea be but he shortly afterward dismiss the entire matter from he mind it would at best be but a compromise a evasion of the pact he have make with himself it be not to be think of at this moment he companion sway and mr heatherbloom have just time to put out he arm then help she to a bench she partly recover it be nothing she remark bravely one get sometimes a little faint when -- it be the old old story of privation and want that now fall with seem reluctance from she lip mr heatherbloom have become all attention more than that he seem greatly distressed a woman actually in

fall pensively upon he she do not seem to see at all he have once more become a nullity he rather prefer that rôle however perhaps he feel it be easier to impersonate annihilation in the inception than to have it or a wish for it thrust later too strongly upon he i adhere to my opinion that he sell naughty i should never have employ this man assert miss van rolsen fasten she fiery eye on mr heatherbloom why do not you speak my dear and give I you opinion to she niece i have not any aunt you be discerning you have judgment miss van rolsen speak almost hysterically remember he -- point a

ramble on to the impervious beautiful girl you should have call I foolish eccentric yes that be what i be to have take he in as i do miss dalrymple raise she brow and move to a piano to adjust the flower in a vase she smile at they with soft enigmatic lip if i may venture a opinion madam observe mr heatherbloom in a far-away voice i should say naughty will surely return or be return you venture

meanwhile you may be sure grimly you will be very well watch under the circumstance i should prefer -- since you _ have _ discharge I -- to leave at once you preference be a matter of utter indifference you be employ with a definite understanding in this regard mr heatherbloom gaze rather wildly out of the window two week -- that much longer he be about to say he would not be well watch he would take himself off -- that she could not keep he but pause a contract be a contract though orally make she could hold he yet a little but why do she wish to he have not calculate upon this he

be quite possible and what if the person in the park have know it he review the circumstance of they different meeting detail that have not impressed themselves upon he at the time -- that have almost escape he notice now stand out clearer -- too clear in he mind he remember how she have brighten astonishingly after the brief fainting spell when he have make he ill-advised proposal it have be as elixir to she he recall how she have meet he every day have it be mere chance or -- disconcert suspicion -- have she deliberately plan -- for mr heatherbloom there be no sleep that night at the first sign of dawn he be up and out direct he step toward the park as a criminal return to the haunt of he crime no face of any kind now greet he there only tree confront he gaunt ghostlike in the early morning mist even the squirrel be yet abe in they miniature swiss chalet in the air the sun rise at last red and threatening he now meet a policeman who look at he questioningly mr heatherbloom greet

the kitchen he have wrong she -- this poor girl or young woman who in she dire distress have appeal to he how he despise now the uncharitable dark thought of the night how he could congratulate himself he have obey impulse and not stop to reason too closely or to question too suspiciously when he have decide to act the day before all be well that end well all he have to do now be to complete as unostentatiously as possible he term of service -- but perhaps he would be release at once no not at once those anxious to supersede he begin to dribble in it be true but they fade away one by one after interview with miss van rolsen and return no more they be a mournful lot these would-be ten-dollar-a-week custodian mr heatherbloom wonder if he own physiognomy in a general way would merge nicely in a composite photograph of they he duty he perform now as quietly as he could two week more ten day nine eight then ah then he do not see miss van rolsen again nor miss dalrymple he encounter the fair unknown though he acquaintance of the park occasionally as she in demure cap and white ruffle apron glide softly she allotted way sometimes he nod to she in distant fashion sometimes she get by before he actually realize he have pass she she seem to move so quickly and with such little ado or it may be he be not very observant he do not feel very keen on mere minor detail these day he experience principally the sensation of one who be now merely mark time as it be -- figuratively perform a variety of goose-step the way the german soldier do but one day she -- marie they call she -- stop he i understand from one of the servant that it cost you you position to -- do what you do you know what i mean -- he look alarm do not worry about that but should not i steady dark eye upon he

excuse I but do you know that night after i have consign he to you care in the park i afterward feel quite anxious -- for what she come closer wonder if you -- ha ha mr heatherbloom stop in he confusion he endeavor to turn the conversation from himself and miss dalrymple he seem to be get into deep water you wonder what in a low tone since he now feel oblige to speak he do coolly enough if you have some ulterior motive he say with a quiet smile she it be who now start back and she face pale slightly why -- what ulterior motive what do you mean he tell she in plain word she breathe more evenly then smile sweetly she have a strange face sometimes thank you she say you be very frank _ mon amus _ i like you none the less for it though you do so injure I -- in you thought she eye have a enigmatic light well i must go now to miss dalrymple she be begin to be so fond of I she drawl the last word as if she like to linger on they you see i too have a little russian blood in I mr heatherbloom look down and i think she love to hear I tell of that wonderful country -- the white night of st petersburg -- the splendid steppe -- the grandeur of we venice of the north of course she be immensely interested in russium now significantly its ostentation its splendor its barbaric picturesqueness but tell I what be she prince like he be very handsome naturally or she would not so dote on he mr heatherbloom 's feature have harden he do not answer directly she like to talk about russium he say half to himself marie shrug be it not to be she country some day no it be not the word seem force from he lip he speak almost fiercely she may live there with he but it will never be she country this be she country she be its product a american to she finger-tip and all the grand duke and prince of the winter palace can not change she she belong to old californium she grow up among the orange tree and the flower and she heart will ever yearn for they in you frozen land of tyranny oh oh oh say mademoiselle marie how eloquent monsieur can be quite a orator one would say he too have know this land of orange tree and flower i mr heatherbloom bit he lip but she only shake a finger oh oh altogether like a different person from he casual acquaintance of the park he gaze at she closer how quickly the mark of trouble anxiety have fade from she face as if they have never exist what do you mean he ask look into eye now full of a new and peculiar understanding nothing she say and vanish he gaze where she have be he could not account for a sudden strange emotion as if some one have trail a shadow over he a premonition of something go to happen that could not be foresee or avert something worse than anything that have go before what nonsense he press he lip tightly and go about he duty like a automaton eight day -- seven day -- six day more -- only six -- chapter viii the unexpected the blow fall a thunderbolt from the clear sky it daze certain people at first it be difficult to realize what have happen or if anything _ have _ really happen for might not what seem a deep and dire mystery turn out to be nothing so very mysterious after all a message would soon come everything would then be clear up and those most concerned would laugh at they apprehension but the hour go by and the affair remain inexplicable no word be hear concern miss dalrymple 's whereabouts she seem to have disappear as completely as if she have vanish on the persian magic carpet what could it mean the circumstance briefly be : miss dalrymple four or five day before mr heatherbloom 's term of service come to a end have express a desire to revisit she old home and friend in the west one of a party make up mostly of other californian -- now resident of new york city -- the girl have fail to appear on the private car at the appoint time and the train have pull out leave she behind at the first important stop a telegram have be hand to a gentleman of the party from miss dalrymple it express she regret at have reach the station too late owing to circumstance she would explain later and announce she intention of come on with she maid in a few day they be not to wait anywhere for she but to go right along the party do it be sorry to have lose one of its most popular member but no one think anything more of the matter until at denver after a telegram have be forward to the van rolsen house in new york ask just when miss dalrymple would arrive as camping preparation for a joyous pilgrimage in the mountain be in progress miss van rolsen gasp when this message reach she miss dalrymple and she maid -- a young woman newly engage by miss van rolsen -- have leave the house for the train to which the private car be attach neither have be hear from since the aunt have of course presume she niece have go as plan she have receive no word from she but suppose she be of a light-hearted heedless company think nothing of that it be possible miss dalrymple have actually miss she train but if so why have she not return to she aunt 's house where have she go what have become of she no trace of she could be find certain force in the central railroad office at new york could not discover any evidence that the young girl have take a subsequent train there be no record of she name at any ticket office no state-room have be reserve by or for she in fact telegram to official in chicago and other point west fail to elicit satisfactory information of any kind miss van rolsen find herself with something real to worry about she rise to the occasion she niece after all be everything to she the van rolsen million be ultimately for she and the old lady 's every ambition be center in the girl she have be proud of she beauty she social triumph with great determination she set herself to solve the puzzling problem could people thus completely disappear nowadays it seem impossible she assert sit behind closed door in she library to the private agent of the secret-service bureau whom she have just call in he beg to differ from she and point to a number of case which have seem just as strange and mysterious in the begin ransom -- the black hand -- who could say what secret influence have be at work in this case it be a very important one miss dalrymple have money of she own she be know to be she aunt 's heiress the conclusion -- but this be not morocco or turkey miss van rolsen somewhat vehemently return true we have have however we civilized ransuili answer the agent and mention a number of name in support of he theory no doubt after a interval miss van rolsen would have news of she niece -- through those who have perpetrate the outrage or she might even receive a few write word from the girl herself after that it be a question of negotiate or while profess to deal with the perpetrator to ferret they out if one could the latter course be dangerous for those who stoop to this particular crime be usually of a desperate type he and miss van rolsen could consider that question later meanwhile she must avoid worry as much as possible the young girl would no doubt be well treat have the speaker look around at this moment he might have observe that the heavy curtain draw before the door lead into the hall and close by miss van rolsen move suddenly but neither the agent nor miss van rolsen engross at the far end of the room notice the drapery waver a moment then settle once more into its fold the telegram purport to be from miss dalrymple to one of the party on the train could -- the agent go on -- very easily have be send by some one else no doubt have be the miscreant have seize upon a lucky combination of circumstance for two or three day while miss dalrymple be suppose to be speed across the continent they unsuspected and unmolested would be afford every opportunity to convey she to some remote and for they safe refuge it be a cleverly plan coup and could not have be conceive and consummate without -- here he speak slowly -- inside assistance the curtain at the doorway again stir and now madam we come to you servant say the police agent i should like to know something about they my servant sir be for the most part old and trust ` for the most part ' he catch at the phrase we will deal first with those who do _ not _ come in that category there be a young man recently employ that i have not be at all pleased with he leave to-morrow ah say the visitor not the person i meet go out of the area way with the dog as i come in she answer affirmatively h -- mn he pause but tell I why you have not be please with he and in brief all the circumstance of he come here miss van rolsen do so in a voice she strive to make patient although she could not disguise its tremulousness or the feverish anxiety that consume she she relate the most trivial detail seem irrelevance but the visitor do not interrupt she instead he study carefully she face pinch and wear the angular figure slightly bent the finger nervously clasp and unclasp as she speak he watch she through habit and still forbore speak even when she refer to the escape of she canine favorite from he caretaker and how the dog have later be return though the listener 's eye have at this point dilate slightly after he carelessness in this matter he seem to want to get away from the house at once observe miss van rolsen without avail himself of the two-week ' notice i have agree to give he the visitor relapse into he chair a ironical light appear in he eye perhaps add miss van rolsen you attach no significance to the fact on the contrary i attach every importance to it have it not occur to you there be a little collusion in this matter of the lose dog collusion miss van rolsen 's accent express incredulity you must be wrong why the young woman would not even accept the reward and it be not a small one two hundred or so dollar ma'am not she stake he murmur satirically i be afraid two hundred thousand dollar would be nearer the mark these people have set for themselves but she do not ask for a place here only for I to look over she reference -- one be from a lady i know in paris -- and to recommend she to my friend -- she know you other maid have leave this confederate have of course tell she it be all arrange that she should come here rest assure of that and have accomplish she purpose -- clever that she be -- she at once start to ingratiate herself with you niece to make herself useful as a mistress of language she _ be _ useful in fact more so than any ordinary maid where do she come from find out whom she represent and -- we 'll have the key to the mystery but she too have disappear after turn the game over to the other perhaps i would suggest cabling those foreign reference this young woman give you they will of course include you pari friend know nothing of she the name she give you be not she own but by what unfortunate combination of circumstance -- miss van rolsen speak somewhat incoherently -- should these people have be lead to settle on my niece as the victim of they cowardly design there be so many other -- you forget the publicity concern this prince you niece be to marry the old lady stiffen pardon my mention it but miss dalrymple have in this connection be very much before the public gaze against she wish sir and mine snapped miss van rolsen she -- i -- have both lament the fact but what can one do the journalist settle on the prince as a fruitful source for speculation he be of noble family very wealthy no fortune-hunter which have make it all the more distressing for he and we she seem about to say something further then she lip suddenly tighten as i say it have be very distressing she end after a pause i expect it be one of the reason my niece want to get away from new york for a time no doubt the caller 's voice be courtesy itself although he probably but half-credited miss van rolsen 's protestation in the matter people like to complain of the press and newspaper notoriety when in they heart perhaps they be not so displeased to be in that terrible lime-light especially when the person associate with they happen to be a count or a duke or a prince unfortunately one have to put up with these thing he now add but you be positive you have tell I everything a instant she seem to hesitate i be positive you know everything relative to the subject he arise in that event -- he manner indicate a sudden resolution -- there be one little preliminary to be attend to which be -- to arrest this fellow heatherbloom arrest when at once there be no time to be lose already -- he give a sudden exclamation what be it she ask he step toward the curtain it move perceptibly some one have be listen exclaimed miss van rolsen excitedly yes some one significantly as he speak he throw back the curtain and reveal the door partly ajar it must have be -- not one of my old servant -- they would not have -- he stop she there be the front way out of this house and the area way below he say rapidly be there any other way of escape to the street no he dart out of the room to the front door she follow quite in time he say cast a quick look both way along the avenue and then let he glance fall to the servant ' entrance below you think he will try to -- he regard she swiftly while i stand guard here would you mind get some one to ` phone my office and ask two or three of my man to step over at once not that i doubt my own ability to cope with the case -- finger the handle of a weapon on he pocket -- only it be always well to take no chance especially now now since he have practically convict himself and confirm my theory we shall get at the truth through he we be nearer the solution of the matter than i dare hope for i 'll telephone myself she cry and start back to do so when a excited face confront she if ye plase ma'am it be the cook what be it miss van rolsen speak sharply if ye plase i think ma'am this mr heatherbloom have take lave av he sens why what have he be do he have faith just jump over the fence into we neighbor 's yard on the corner and -- the man on the step do not wait to hear more with something that sound like a imprecation he spring quickly down to the sidewalk and run toward the corner chapter ix who fight and run as mr heatherbloom prepare to issue from he neighbor 's gate opening on the side street the feminine voice of one of the servant in the rear of the corner house call out in alarm at sight of the strange figure speeding across they metropolitan imitation of a back yard if anything be need to stimulate the fugitive 's footstep it be the sound of that voice he stay not on the order of he go but push back the heavy bolt -- fortunately he egress be not bar by a lock door -- he tear open the gate and spring to the sidewalk then without stop he run on away from the fashionable avenue the street he traverse like many thoroughfare of its kind be comparatively desert most of the time nobody impede he progress though one or two people gaze after he from they window he have go about three-quarter of a block when the window spectator discern a heavier build figure come lumber around the corner apparently in hot pursuit mr heatherbloom glancing over he shoulder also observe this person he capture and subsequent incarceration seem inevitable already the fugitive be draw near to busier fourth avenue there he would be oblige to relax he pace he could not sprint down that thoroughfare without attract undue attention behind the pursuer call out he be however too short of breath for compelling vocal effect mr heatherbloom on the contrary have good control of he breathing and be moreover yet fresh and physically capable which fact make it the more difficult for he to settle down to a forced albeit sharp walk as he approach the corner when he gait suddenly accelerate once more a street-car have just start not very far from he and mr heatherbloom run after it a fine pretext for speed be offer he as he let himself go in the way he have once go somewhere in the past in a hundred-yard ' dash he feel joyously conscious both of cover space quickly and that he do so without make himself particularly prominent fool who run after street-car be bear every moment he be happy to be relegate to that idiotic class by any onlooker he catch the car while it be go he do not want it to stop for he neither do it stop to pick up any one else for several block there be a space before it unobstructed by traffic the motorman turn on more power and mr heatherbloom listen gratefully to the hum wheel at the same time he look back at the corner where he have turn into fourth avenue he fancy a number of people be gather he could surmise the cause the stockily-built man -- he pursuer -- be ask question he have learn what have become of the fugitive and be presumably look around for a taxi in vain at least mr heatherbloom so conclude because one do not appear in hot chase behind they the motorman still give rapid service the conductor look at he watch by which mr heatherbloom imagine they have time to make up he hope so then resent a pause at a corner for a old lady how he wish she have not be afflict with rheumatism and could have get on without help but at length the light-weight conductor do manage to pull the heavy-weight passenger aboard time lose thirty seconds the motorman manipulate the lever more deliberately now and they gather headway slowly mr heatherbloom dare not remain longer where he be as the car approach a corner near a elevated station he get off he be oblige to walk now a short distance but he do so hastily draw near the iron step lead upward he once more look back a taxi _ be _ whirling after he and he have no doubt as to its occupant the street-car could easily have be keep in sight and he leave it be note mr heatherbloom now throw discretion to the wind dash toward the stairway he run up just as he reach the ticket window the pursue vehicle stop below some one spring out do not pause to pay the chauffeur but call out to he he name start after mr heatherbloom that gentleman have by this time board the train wait above he stand on the rear platform any moment the pursuer would appear he do appear as the gate of the train be close and the car have start on they way yet he do not give up for run alongside the last car he call out to the guard : fugitive from justice criminal -- on this train open the gate for I a instant the guard hesitate rule however be rule five hundred dollar if you let I on the voice pant the guard in he own mind decide he would let the other on -- too late the last car dash past the end of the platform a faint sigh of relief from mr heatherbloom be drown in the tumult of the wheel then he endeavor to appear indifferent apathetic it be not easy to do so the secret-service agent have be hear by many other a fugitive from justice on the train mr heatherbloom try to look as little the part as possible to simulate by he expression a preoccupy young business man of heavy responsibility fortunately the train be crowd nevertheless he fancy people glance especially at he he wish now he be better dress good clothes may cover a multitude of sin still there be no reason why he should be suspect more than sundry other indifferently-dressed people he would dismiss the thought tell himself he be go down town on some little errand he even devise what that errand should be -- to procure theater ticket but he brain do not seem quite capable of concentrate itself solely on desirable orchestra chair it constantly and perversely revert to that other disagreeable subject -- a fugitive from -- whoever could the fellow be he endeavor by a mental process to eliminate himself and see but a mythical some one else in a mythical background a short person a tall one what kind of person would the imaginary individual be anyhow and what have he do what crime commit mr heatherbloom try to think with the mind of all these other people on the train to put himself figuratively in they shoe one young sprig of a girl about fourteen with sallow complexion and bead-like black eye keep regard he he conceive a profound dislike for she shift a foot then straighten and banish she peremptorily from he environment he principal interest lay now in casual glimpse of window and speculation as to what be behind they he vary this employment in a pass endeavor to decipher sundry sign that obtruded incidentally within range of vision he have make out only a few when the train slacken and come to a standstill mr heatherbloom tell himself he would get off as quickly as possible then change he mind and remain people would of course argue that under the circumstance the unknown criminal would be among those to leave the train at the first opportunity a number get out mr heatherbloom note the passenger who remain aboard and watch closely the depart one a few of the latter seem slightly self-conscious notably a elderly spinster who have never do anything wrong be possess of a unusual sensitiveness see that slouchy chap -- by jove i believe -- do look like a tough customer -- on the contrary he just look poor mr heatherbloom turn upon the two speaker warmly why could he not have keep silent why be he oblige to obtrude he opinion into they conversation they stare and he half turn as the train bang itself along once more where should he go reach for a paper that some one have discard he sink into a vacant seat and open the sheet with misgive what would the big type say nothing miss van rolsen have manage to keep the strange affair of she niece 's disappearance out of the column of the papers they know nothing about it as yet -- only a single little item in the shipping news in fine print which suddenly catch he gaze bear in any way and that a remote one upon she niece and she affair mr heatherbloom regard it with dull glance the few line mean nothing to he -- then later he have cause to turn to they with abrupt wonder avidity now he eye sweep with simulated interest the general news of the day he profess to read cable dispatch but a odd reaction seem to have settle on he the excitement of the chase become for the moment forget the scope of he mental visuality no longer include the figure of the agent from the private detective bureau a anxiety more poignant move he he thought center on that other matter -- the cause of miss van rolsen 's apprehension -- the while those emotion that have hold he a listener behind the curtain in she library again stir in he breast he have not play the eavesdropper for any selfish purpose or through a sense of personal apprehension the sudden realization of he own danger have perforce awaken in he the need for quick action if he would save himself if what chance have he but for one compelling reason one consume purpose he would not have flee at all he would have face they instead but he have work to do -- he a fugitive a logical candidate for the prison cell ironical situation even now he hear a voice at he elbow mr heatherbloom some one speak suddenly to he and he wheel with abrupt swift fierceness well be you go to eat I up the voice laugh he look into the pert face of jane -- the maid with the provoke nose -- who have be at miss van rolsen 's she have get on at the other end of the car at the last station and after wait a few moment for he to see she have move toward he or a seat at he side just then vacate by some one prepare to leave mr heatherbloom 's face clear he banish the belligerent expression you look edible enough he say with forced jocularity indeed she retort surprise at such gallantry from one who have heretofore not deign to pay she compliment i 'll have to tell my husband about you playfully but how be thing at miss van rolsen 's anything new mr heatherbloom murmur something about the customary routine then even as he speak become conscious of a sudden new disconcerting circumstance the track for the up and the down train on the elevated have widely separated and run now on the extreme side of the broad thoroughfare from he side of the car the young man be afford a view of the pavement below between the two sustain iron structure a chill shot through he and he smile become set gaze down he discern on the street beneath and a little to one side of they a motor-car speeding fast apparently bent on keep up with they how -- how 's you husband he say irrelevantly the car _ be _ keep up with they very well thank you -lrb- would _ it _ reach the next station before they -rrb- you -- you have a pleasant home he ask -lrb- a slight blockade below impede momentarily the taxi mr heatherbloom raise he handkerchief to he moist brow -rrb- lovely she answer be you go far brooklyn he say at random what _ be _ they talk about -lrb- the car be once more under way fortunately they progress overhead would not be impede by a press of vehicle -rrb- that be where we live -- brooklyn she say be it get a nice house he have practically ask this question before but he hardly know what he be say a policeman have stop the taxi and be shake he head as at a rather fishy story mr heatherbloom by a species of telepathy seem to overhear the excited talk wage below oh yes lovely jane 's accent be but parenthetical to something else the taxi have be allow to proceed in spite of the detain thought-wave mr heatherbloom have launch toward the officer of the law the occupant have probably show a badge mr heatherbloom stretch he neck out of the window you can come around and see sometime if you want to pride in she voice and meet my husband husband be a very substantial baker charm i be sure ha ha he suddenly laugh what be it she look startled funniest accident he wave he hat as at some one out of the window see that taxi bump into a dray ha ha i do not see anything so funny in that straighten no you should have see the expression on he face -- he whose the -- ah drayman 's of course he -- look so mad i should have think she observe the man in the car would have be the maddest it could not have hurt the dray much no perhaps that be what make it seem so funny to I well she say i never notice before that you have a great sense of humor you never know I jauntily they get off at brooklyn bridge together as they make they way through the crowd mr heatherbloom appear most care-free and very sedulous of he companion 's welfare especially when they pass one or two loiterer who seem eye the passenger rather closely two for brooklyn mr heatherbloom lay down a dime at the ticket office soon unmolested he speed on once more but as they cross the busy river all he light-heartedness seem suddenly to desert he the question he have be vainly ask himself earlier that day be reiterate in he brain where be she what have become of she he hand clasp closely a red spot burn on he cheek chapter x a new-found theory no the prince be not come back to america and she -- miss dalrymple -- be not go to marry he jane 's voice run on rather at random suddenly with unusual force penetrate mr heatherbloom 's consciousness not go -- be not -- what be you talk about the young man 's waver attention focus itself on she now with swift completeness he have hardly hear she until a few moment before when she conversation have first drift to that ever fascinating feminine topic of foreign lord and american heiress then narrow down much to he inward disapproval to one particular title individual and one particular heiress but you be mistake of course he say bruskly oh be i she retort i suppose you believe everything you read in the newspaper mr heatherbloom do not answer now he be stare out of the window against the sky the jut line of building seem to waver new extraordinary angle and jog seem to assert themselves he gaze have a glittering brightness when it turn have you any better authority he tone be a challenge i hear she tell he so myself she say succinctly that she could never marry he and that he must never come back mr heatherbloom 's hand crumple the newspaper then mechanically he fold it and put it in he pocket he look be once more bent outward tiny speck that be big steamboat go very fast seem motionless on the sparkling surface of the water afar he thought scatter he try to collect they to realize where he be how he happen to be there the identity of the speaker and what she have be say certain preconceived fix idea and conclusion have be topple over brush aside in a instant be it possible i be wait to trim and fill the lamp say jane -lrb- miss van rolsen cling to oil lamp for reading -rrb- the prince and she be in the library he have a loud voice you know the young man do but why -- search I vivaciously he be the very pick of the whole cargo of duke and the like there be not another girl in new york would have do it but surely scarcely hear she last word no newspaper would dare to announce such a thing without -- oh would not it when it call up the house every day almost and get : ` there be nothing to say ' do not i answer the ` phone once or twice myself ` miss van rolsen decline to be interview concern she niece she have nothing to say ' i think i once giggle the man 's voice at the other end be so aggressive he say he be the city editor himself be that very high up mr heatherbloom do not seem to hear he scarcely see he companion now nevertheless he be conscious of a desire to be alone in order to concentrate consider reach for light and find it but where could he discover a safe spot he problem be a dual one primarily he must consider himself he must not forget he own desperate situation and danger the train begin to slacken bring the sense of it once more poignantly to mind he companion have not reach the station yet but he suddenly rise the car stop with a jerk mr heatherbloom murmur something hurriedly and dive for the door on the street he breathe deeply stand as in a daze while the thunder of iron-rimmed wheel surround he he be cognizant principally of certain word hum in he brain : the prince and she be not engage the nobleman not return to america in the fall never come back but that item in fine print in the newspaper he have in he pocket -- what do it mean nothing of course beyond what it say still -- some one bump into mr heatherbloom whereupon he suddenly realize that he be stand on one of the busiest corner and have be make himself as conspicuous as possible hastily he move on to what destination he glance toward a

come to town enter in unconventional fashion as the train have slacken at a siding on the outskirts he have quietly and unperceived slip off the back platform of the rear car then make he way by devious and little frequented side street to the sea-front there he eager gaze scan the craft move in the open or motionless at the distant wharf a expression of acute disappointment pass over he feature he eye do not find what they seek have that mad flight be for nothing have he but run into a new kind of pocket here all to no purpose mr heatherbloom sit down he be weary and worn the dancing sparkle laugh at he he do not feel like laugh back even as he lean against the parapet a newsboy close at hand call out : all about the mysterious abduction one of the miscreant trace to this city superintendent of police warn of he probable arrival the lad look at mr heatherbloom as he shout that gentleman return he gaze with unflinching stolidness what abduction he ask beautiful new york

desire for desultory conversation mr heatherbloom after a moment 's careful scrutiny show a disposition to be accommodate in this regard he even take the initiative -- suddenly ask question after question about this boat and that she name when she have come where she be go of what she cargo consist the other reply willingly like many of he kind in the port although he could not read or write he be wise in harbor-front knowledge know all the float tramp and the sailing craft i suppose it be always about the same old boat drop in here mr heatherbloom after a little observed insinuatingly yes always de same ole tub assent the darky a shadow cross the other 's face but he manage to assume a light air batter hulk and sailing brig of a past generation eh he put the case strongly but the darky only nod smilingly he strong point in conversation be in agree with people he even forget patriotism toward he own port in be amiable mr heatherbloom glance now beyond they to the right and the left but no one whom he have reason to fear come within scope of he vision he figure relax when would they come to take he the newsboy 's word reiterate themselves in he mind trace to this city of course miss van rolsen 's million be at the command of the secret-service bureau he description have be telegraph far and wide and when it should be fruitful of result what would become of he theory nevertheless he would go on while he could to the last if he try to explain they would consider it but a paltry blind to cover he own criminality he could expect no help from they he have to triumph or fail through he own effort to fail certainly it be decree for the moment something in he breast pocket seem to burn there a tiny object now without the frame involuntarily he raise he hand then he figure sway the street wave up and down he have eat little during the last two or three day scornfully in he own mind he berate that momentary weakness and steady himself he eye cold and clear now return to the color man he grope for and take up the thread of the talk where he have leave it old hulk and brig you do not ever happen to have any really fine boat come in here do you like mr morgan 's big private yacht for example no we be not never see dat craft yere di port 's more for lumber and -- mr heatherbloom look down i see a item in the paper -- he strive to speak unconcernedly -- a marconigram -- that a certain russian prince 's private yacht -- the _ nevskus _ -- have damage she propeller or some other part of she gear and be be tow into this harbor for emergency repair oh yes boss say the man the listener take a firmer grip on the parapet you do mean de big white boat w ` at lie on de odder side ob de island can not see she from yere dey do fix she up mighty quick a ' she gwine ter lebe to-night leave to-night mr heatherbloom 's face change suppress eagerness expectancy shone from he eye he turn away to conceal it from the other look like good fishing over there near the island he observe after a pause taus not so much for fishin ' as crabbin ' return the other crab repeat mr heatherbloom a grand sport now if -- be you a crabber the darky confess that crab be he main occupation he boat swing right over there for a dollar he would give the other several hour ' diversion mr heatherbloom accept the offer with alacrity a few moment later seat in a dilapidated cockle-shell he find himself slam over the water the boat do not ship the top of many sea but it take in enough spray over the port bow to drench pretty thoroughly the passenger in the stern the darky handle the sheet of a small much patch sail keep himself comparatively dry but mr heatherbloom do not seem to mind the drenching though the briny drop sting he cheek he face continue ever bent forward toward a point of land to the right of which lay the island that come ever nearer but slowly -- so slowly he could see the top of the spar of a vessel now over the high sand-hill he body bent toward it in he eye shine a steely light they little boat draw closer to the near side of the island the hillock stand up higher the taper topmast of the craft on the other side disappear the crabber 's cockle-shell come to anchor in a tranquil sandy cove mr heatherbloom although inwardly chafe feel oblige to restrain impatience he could not afford to awaken the darky 's suspicion therefore he simulated interest and -- crabbed he enjoy a streak of good luck but he artificial enthusiasm soon wane he at length suggest try the other side of the island whereupon he pilot expostulate what more do he passenger want the latter thought he would stretch he leg a bit on the shore it make he stiff to sit still so long he would get out and walk around -- he have a predilection for desert island while he be gratify he fancy the darky could return to he more remunerative business of gathering in the denizen of the deep five minute later mr heatherbloom stand on the sandy beach he start as if to walk around the island but have not go far before he turn and move at a right angle up over the sand-hill the dull-hued bush that somehow find nourishment on the yellow mound now conceal he figure from the boatman the same hardy vegetation afford he a shelter from the too inquisitive gaze of any person on the yacht when he have gain the summit of the sand there he peer through the leaf down upon a beautiful vessel she lay near the shore whatever she injury it seem to have be repair by this time for few sign of life be apparent on or about she steam be up a faint dun-colored smoke sweep pennon-like from she white funnel some one be inspect she stern from a platform swing over the rail and to mr heatherbloom 's strained vision this person 's interest or concern center in the mechanism of she rudder the trouble have be there no doubt and if so the yacht have probably come or be bring near the island at high water and at low tide any damage she might have suffer have be attend to she injury must have be more vexatious than serious would she as the darky have affirm leave when the tide be once more at its full she lie in the outer instead of in the inner harbor seem significant time pass the person on the platform regain the deck and disappear in the bush the watcher suddenly start something at one of the port window have catch he glance a ribbon a flutter bit of lace a woman 's feature that phantom-like have come and vanish he look hard -- so steadily that spot begin to dance before he sight but he could not verify that first impression yet he remain the shadow on the furze grow longer fall in strange angular shape down the hillside the sun dip low at length mr heatherbloom after the manner of one who have make up he mind to something abruptly rise he walk back toward the cove where he have disembark as he draw near the darky catch sight of he pull up anchor and paddle he boat to the shore but mr heatherbloom do not at once get in he eye rest on the bushel or so of freshly catch bubble-blowing crab he strive to appear calm and matter-of-fact what do you expect to get for they he ask point ` bout fifty cent de dozen boss crab market be not what it ought ter be jest now why do not you try to sell they to the yacht over there mr heatherbloom manage to speak carelessly but it be a difficult task jest beco she be ` over there ' boss return the darky lazily mighty swift tide sweep around de head of dat island he explain and you do not like rowing against it quickly see here i 'll tell you what i 'll do i like a bit of exercise and just for the gamble i 'll give you sixty cent a dozen for the lot and keep all i can get over that the owner of that craft be a russian and all russian like sea food when they can not get caviar they 'll no doubt make a bid for crab dat sound like berry good argumentation boss make it seventy -- avarice struggle on the dusky countenance -- a ' -- do say mr heatherbloom endeavor to disguise the fierce eagerness well within he here be on account toss he last bill to the other and now get out it 'll be easier pull without you the darky grin and obey this be a strenuous passenger truly not averse to stiff rowing after a stiff walk jest for pleasure but the dusky pilot have meet these anomalous white being before -- spo ` tsman they call themselves and a certain sense of humor as mr heatherbloom sit down to the oar cause the color man involuntarily to hum : _ i ` se get a white man a-workin ' for I _ he have only finish a bar or two however when the tune abruptly cease on he lip dat 's too bad he say i guess de deal 's off boss regretfully eh mr heatherbloom look around he mean to keep the man to he bargain now by force if necessary look dar continue the darky mr heatherbloom do look in the direction indicate a puff of black smoke could be see rise over the island and -- significant fact -- the dark smudge seem to be crawl along beyond the sky-line of the sand-hill the young man turn pale it be de russian yacht boss she be under way all right mr heatherbloom continue to gaze where the island be lower he see the topmast move along -- then the boat herself white beautiful swing out from behind with bow point seaward and steam fast dat 's too bad murmur the color man i do be powerful disappointed boss the other do not answer go go he have wait too long to board she he could not reach she now -- he would never reach she the flame of the die sun flare in mr heatherbloom 's face but he continue motionless chapter xii on the road go it be the only word he could think of every thought every emotion center around it he could not reason or argue no plan occur to he now he continue to sit still see but one picture -- a boat vanish night have begin to fall as they return to the city its light play mockingly in the darkness mr heatherbloom view they with apathetic gaze the secret-service man the chief of police and he assistant be on shore somewhere wait to capture he but he do not care let they take he now what do it matter when the boat reach land he get out like a automaton perhaps he make answer to the darky 's last cheerful good night but if so he speak without know it the boatman let he go willingly mr heatherbloom have not ask for he last bill back again and the other overlook remind he of he remissness the greenback be considerably more than the fare indifferent to he fate mr heatherbloom move on no one molest he he walk along dark highway not through fear of be apprehend but because he mood be dark he do not even notice where he go he just keep go he forget he be hungry but at length as in a dream he begin to realize a physical weariness overwrought nature assert itself he be not make of iron he muscle respond reluctantly without observe he surroundings he sink listlessly to the earth the cool grass receive he exhaust frame beyond some distance away the light of the city throw now a sullen glow on the sky all be comparatively still about he the noise of the city be replace by the lighter sound of vehicle on the well keep almost non-resounding country road it seem to be a main thoroughfare but with little life and animation about it at that evening hour a buggy do go by occasionally however and not far from mr heatherbloom at a curb stand a motor-car he have suffer himself to relax on the ground in front of a small house set well back among spectral-looking tree and surround by a stone wall overgrown with foliage mr heatherbloom remain unmindful of he surroundings the lamp of the car near by be not light a single figure on the front seat be barely distinguishable now this person get down and light a cigarette he seem restless walk to and fro and glance once or twice at the house from a single window a faint light gleam then it vanish only to reappear a few moment later at another window among the mass of foliage firefly glisten a tree-toad begin to make a sound but almost immediately stop the front door have apparently open and some person or person come out the faint crunching on the gravel indicate more than one person now they step on the grass for there be no audible indication of they approach the man near the machine throw quickly away he cigarette and open the door of the car several people issue from the gate cross the sidewalk and get in mr heatherbloom be hardly aware of the fact they seem but unmean shadow the driver bent over and light one of he lamp as he do so the flare reveal for a instant he face -- square rather handsome and beard a faint flicker of interest for some reason undefinable to himself at the moment sweep over mr heatherbloom he have be lie where the grass be tall and now raise himself on he elbow the better to peer over the wave top the car have gather headway and swing out into the road when suddenly some one in it laugh and utter a exclamation in a foreign tongue that musical note -- a word he do not understand -- be waft to mr heatherbloom it act upon he like a galvanic shock he spring to he foot and bewildered stare after the machine what have happen be he dream he could hardly at first believe the evidence of he sens for the laugh come back to he in the night be that of the woman for whom he have procure employment at miss van rolsen 's he could have swear to the fact now and the man whose countenance he have so briefly see be no doubt of she own nationality -- a russian involuntarily without realize what he do mr heatherbloom start to run in the direction the car have go but he soon stop what madness -- to attempt to catch a sixty-horse-power machine why it be nearly a mile away already the young man stand stock-still while a cogent reaction sweep over he the woman have pass within fifty foot of where he have lie head near the earth mope a mock desire to atone for a great remissness find he impotent there seem nothing for he to do now but to reconcile himself to the irreconcilable to stay here while every desire urge he to follow she to learn why this woman be in the car and who be with she naturally he have expect she would be on the yacht now steam away out to sea and here she be a new enigma confront he mr heatherbloom continue to stand in the center of the road he head whirl he pant hard out of breath from he recent dash a loud honk honk from another machine come unexpectedly up behind cause he to leap aside just in time the second car whiz by although obey a impulse bear on the instant he call out wildly wave he arm to bring it to a halt if they see he strange motion -- which be unlikely the night be dark -- they do not heed they soon the second machine be some distance away then its rear light gleam like a vanish coal and suddenly disappear altogether around a bend of the road he look back no other vehicle of any description be in sight now but it profit nothing to continue passive immovable he have to act to walk on no matter how slowly he face at least be set in the direction the woman have go how long it take he to reach the turn of the thoroughfare he could not tell but at length there he come again to a abrupt stop some distance ahead in the road appear a machine motionless -- wait or break down which car be it the one contain the woman or the other that come after if the former -- he press on eagerly yet keep to the shadow alive once more to the need of caution he heart pound hard he could see a form pass in front of the machine the light of the lamp enable he now to make out the other occupant -- three man no woman be with they this become poignantly irrefutably evident as he draw nearer he could see plainly the empty car and the trio of figure he could hear they talk but be not yet able to distinguish what they say these be the people whose attention he have try to attract back there in the road he purpose then occur to he in a flash renew itself strongly now he would ask they aid circumstance might enable he to do so now with better grace he have have a good deal of experience with car of diver kind and make at different time in the past why not proffer these stranger he fairly expert service he feel sure he could soon learn and repair what be wrong with the machine have make himself useful he could then intimate that a lift down the road would be acceptable and he would probably get it but he do not carry out he intention something he hear as he come closer to they cause he to hesitate and reconsider mixed with anathema direct against the car of rather a cheap type be word that have for he more than pass significance these man be after some one and that the some one be none other than himself mr heatherbloom soon become fully convinced fate have be kinder to he than he know when he have endeavor and fail to win they notice he crouch back now against a rail fence they low disgruntled tone be still bear to he for some moment they continue to work over the machine without apparently be able to set it to rights if this go on much longer say one of they he 'll get away from brownville providin ' he be there grumble another people be always see a escape criminal in a dozen different locality at the same time brownville the listener soon divine from a sentence drop here and there that the place be a little fishing village a short distance down the coast he surmise also that they have by this time the main harbor of the city fairly watch as far as outgoing vessel be concerned and be reach out to prevent a possible exit from the smaller community fishing craft leave from there could easily take out a fugitive and thus enable he to escape this contingency the authority be now endeavor to avert that they also have some kind of a clue point to they present destination and incite they to make haste thither be evident from the skeptical remark mr heatherbloom have overhear a series of explosion as sudden as spasmodic break in on the listener 's thought hurray say one we be off and they be quickly mr heatherbloom also move with extreme abruptness and expedition wait in the shadow until they have all spring into the car and the machine have fairly start he then dart forward seize a strap and clinging as best he might hoist himself to the place in the rear design for a trunk one desire only in resort to this expedient move he -- to get in touch as soon as possible if possible with the other car this machine of inferior build suggest it be true a dubious way to that end but it be the best that offer he do not see the incongruity of he position of be a passenger though secretly and surreptitiously of the car contain those embark on a mission so closely concern himself instead of flee from they he be actually court they company pursue himself as it be at another time he might have smile now the situation have for he nothing of the comic it be tragically grim also decidedly unpleasant a strong odor of gasolene permeate he nostril until he be nearly suffocate by it and all the dust stir by they flight swirl up on he make it difficult to refrain from cough fortunately the machine have a monopoly on noise and any sound from he would have pass unnoticed he have ride the bumper not so long ago on freight and perforce indulge in kindred uncomfortable method of free transportation in the course of he recent career but he have never experienced anything quite so little to be desire as this the driver have begin to speed as if to make up for lose time he be force the engine to its limit the machine of light construction shake violently negotiate the steep place with jump and slide down on the other side with breakneck velocity the dust thicken about mr heatherbloom 's head so that he could scarcely see he arm ache and every bump nearly tear he loose he wind the strap around he wrist and strove to ensconce himself deeper in a place not large enough for he he be on a edge all the time and feel as if he be fall over every moment the edge too be sharp and dig into he mr heatherbloom however have little thought of bodily discomfort he be more concern in make progress and the difficulty of maintain he position he only fear be that he would be compel to abandon he place because he physical energy might not be equal to the demand put upon it he set he tooth now and begin to count the seconds the faster they go the better be he purpose serve he strive to find encouragement in the think the other car could make a superior showing in the way of speed but it might stop voluntarily somewhere after a while or something might happen to arrest its progress the race do not always belong to the swift he endeavor to formulate some plan as to just what he would do if he do finally manage to overtake the woman and she party but at length cease try sufficient unto the moment be the problem thereof he could but strive in the present he dispel the fear that he could not hold on much longer and fill himself with new determination not to yield but even as he do so a bigger bump than any they have yet encounter jerk he abruptly from he place when finally he manage to collect himself and he sens and sit up uncertainly in the road the car be far away the snap of explode gasolene grow faint -- fainter -- then cease altogether chapter xiii in the night a wayworn figure some time thereafter move slowly along the desert road where it run like a wind ribbon over the top of a great bluff a sea wind come in vary gust bent low the long grass and rustle in the bush the moon have escape from behind dark cloud in a stormy sky and throw its ray far and wide they impart a frosty sheen to the wavy surface between road and sea and brighten the thoroughfare which lengthen tortuously disappear beneath in a tangle of forest or underbrush mr heatherbloom gaze wearily down the road then over the grass in the latter direction afar a strip of ocean lay like a argent stream flow between the top of the bank and the horizon toward that illusory river he leave the main highway walk in somewhat discourage fashion it might avail he little so much time have elapse but from the edge of the bluff he would be afford a view of the surrounding country and the topography of the coast a vast spread of the ocean unfold to he gaze before he have reach the brink of the prominence he heavy-lidded eye sweep to the right rest on a heterogeneous group of dwelling scatter well above the sand and directly below a wooded uprising of land myriad speck of light glimmer amid shadowy roof brownville undoubtedly a board walk run along the ocean and a small pier extend like a arm over the water on the faintly glistening sand old boat draw up here and there resemble so many black footprint not far from where mr heatherbloom stand a path go downward a shorter way to the village than by the road he have just leave he stare unthinkingly a moment at the narrow walk then begin mechanically to descend a dull realization weigh on he that when he reach he destination the woman would be far away he wonder why he have go on under the circumstance -- why he have ever think he stand a ghost of a chance of overtake she only the hopelessness of the situation in all its grim verity face he now the path zigzag through the bush at a turn the village be lose to sight in front be a sheer fall to the sea as he keep on project branch strike he and raise he hand to guard he face he trip and almost fall recover himself he glance down something have catch on he shoe and he lean over to loosen it he finger close on a long strip of soft substance -- a veil the kind worn by woman motor mr heatherbloom 's eye rest on it apathetically then with a sudden flash of interest a faint but heavy perfume emanate from the silky filament it be darkish in hue -- brown he should say the russian woman be partial to that color the thought come to he quickly he stand bewildered what if it be hers then how have it come here on this narrow foot-path unless -- have the big car stop at the top of the promontory and discharge its passenger there but why should it have do so for what possible reason he could think of none other woman come this way -- the path be not difficult other woman wear brown veil and yet that odd familiar fragrance -- it seem to belong to a foreign bizarre personality such as sonium turgeinov 's crush in he palm the veil he thrust it into he pocket he would find out more below possibly if she have actually pass this way a feverish zest be bear anew the authority be look for she as well as for himself he remember she apparently have so far cleverly evade they if he could but lead they to she he would not mind so much he own apprehension she presence in the locality at the same time the _ nevskus _ have be in the harbor would fairly prove the correctness of he theory of miss dalrymple 's whereabouts if he could now deliver the russian woman into the hand of the law he would have a wedge to force the power that be to give credence to at least the material part of he story -- that the prince have leave port with the young girl -- and to compel they to see the necessity of act at once that he himself would be hold equally culpable with the woman be of no moment fatigue seem to fall from he shoulder he go along more swiftly inspire with new vague hope down -- down the voice of the sea grow nearer now he could hear the dull thud of the wave then the weird whistle sound that succeed spring from a granite out-jutting to the sand he look eagerly searchingly this way and that he see no one he gaze lowered and he walk from the dry to the wet strand there he stop a exclamation escape he lip a faint light fall between black rock reveal fresh footprint on the surface of the sand and yes -- a long furrow -- the mark of the keel of a boat he study the footprint closer but without discover sign of a woman 's only the indentation of heavy seaman 's boot be in evidence mr heatherbloom experience a keen disappointment then feel abruptly reassure the impress of she lighter tread have be eliminate by the man in lifting and push to launch the boat they boot have roughly kick up the sand thereabout he be fairly satisfied the woman have embark the seclusion of the spot favor the assumption the fishing-boat be all either strand or at anchor nearer the village but why and whither have she go the ocean in front fail to answer the latter question and he glance turn on the one hand be the village on the other high almost perpendicular rock run seaward obscure the view it would not be easy to get around that point without a boat it could not be do mr heatherbloom begin to walk briskly toward the village the moon throw he shadow in odd bob motion here and there once he stop abruptly some one on the beach afar be approach a fisherman mr heatherbloom crouch back among the rock when the person come to a halt cling to the shadow on the landward side of the beach the young man continue to advance but cautiously for a single voice might now start a general hue and cry beyond closer to town he could see other form small dark move spot not far distant however lay the nearest boat to get to she he have to expose himself to the pale glimmer no alternative remain he step quickly across the sand reach the craft and strove to launch she but she be clumsy and heavy and resist he effort the man whoever he might be be come closer he call out and mr heatherbloom push and struggle more desperately -- without avail he cast a quick glance over he shoulder the man be run toward he -- he tone now ring out loudly authoritatively mr heatherbloom do not obey that stern command to halt instead he make a wild abrupt dash for the sea the report of a revolver awake the echo and a bullet whiz close recklessly he plunge into the water the man on the shore empty he weapon but with what success he could not tell a head amid the dark wave be not easily discernible another and larger object however be plainly apparent about a hundred yard from land -- a fishing-boat that swing at anchor would the other succeed in reach it for that be no doubt he purpose or have one of the leaden missive tell the man with weapon hot wait he scan the water then look toward the town a number of figure on the beach be hasten in he direction from the pier afar a naphtha put out he could hear faintly the sound of the engine suddenly above the boat at anchor near the man on shore a sail shoot up then flutter and snap in the wind a moment later it be draw in the line hold the craft to the buoy slip out and the bow swing sharply around mr heatherbloom work swiftly one desire move he -- to get around that point before be overtake -- to discover what lay beyond then let happen what would he reach for a line and hoist a jib though it be almost more canvas than he small craft could carry she careen and plunge throw the spray high he turn a quick glance back toward the naphtha the sky have become overcast and distant object be not so easily discernible on the surface of the water but he make out she light -- two she be head on for he he look steadily ahead again the grim line of out-jutting rock -- a black shadow against the sky -- exercise a weird fascination for he he be well out in the open now where the wind blow a half-gale he figure be wet from the sea but he feel no chill suddenly the hand grip the tiller tighten and he heart give a great bind then sink not far from that portentous point of land he see another light -- green a boat be emerge from the big basin of water beyond the starboard signal set high above the wave belong to no small craft such as the woman have embark in the sight of it fit a contingency that have flash through he brain on the beach the realization leave he helpless now -- he last opportunity be go he shift the tiller violently recklessly at that moment a shrill whistle from behind remind he once more of the naphtha he could have laugh what be the wretched little puffing thing to he now the single green light -- that alone be the all in all it belong to the _ nevskus _ he be sure for one reason or another she have but make pretense of go to sea and instead have come here -- to wait the woman be on she now and also -- the thought madden he again that pierce whistle the naphtha be come up fast amid the turmoil of he thought he realize this vaguely he do not wish to find himself deliver unto they yet -- not just yet a wilder recklessness seize he cloud speed across the heaven like grip fury ' hand the water run level to he boat 's gunwale but he refuse to ease she all the while he be draw nearer the single green light -- a mock light signal of a mock chase that have lead and could lead to nothing still he go on toss by the wave -- sport of they he have to play the play out oh to see better to visualize to the utmost the last scene of he poignant drama of failure in the naphtha some one 's voice belch through a megaphone he laugh outright now come and get he if they want he he would give they as merry a dash as possible he boat race madly through the water -- nearer yet nearer the green light now a large dark outline loom before he he would have to stop to come about in a moment or -- a great wave strike he half fill he boat but he do not seem to notice a dazzling white glow suddenly surround he from the naphtha a search-light have be flash it fall on he fully sprinkle over on the wild hurtle wave beyond and just touch the side of the outgoing vessel mr heatherbloom look toward the vessel and he pupil dilate the light leap into the air with the motion of the naphtha and in a instant be go but the impress of a single detail remain on he retina -- of a side ladder lower no doubt for the woman and not yet hoist into place on the big boat the wildness of the sea seem to surge through mr heatherbloom 's vein he do not come about he do not try to now it be too late that ladder -- he would seize it as they sweep by closer he boat run a swirl of water catch he throw he from he course he make a frantic effort to regain it but without avail the big steel bow of the great boat strike and overwhelm the little craft chapter xiv the crisis on the _ nevskus _ the lookout forward walk slowly back and forth once or twice he shake he head but a few moment before the yacht have run down a small boat he have report the matter and -- the _ nevskus _ have continue ahead full speed she have not even slacken long enough to make the usual futile pretense of extend assistance to the unfortunate occupant or occupant he excellency prince bori evidently do not wish or have no time to bother with blunderer if they get in he way so much the worse for they the lookout pause to stare once more ahead suddenly start though apathetic like most of the lower class of he countryman he utter a faint guttural of surprise and peer over the bow a voice have seem to rise from the very seething depths of the sea naturally superstitious he make the sign of the cross on he breast while tale of dead seaman who come back play through he dull fancy once more he hear it -- that voice that seem to mingle with the wail tone of the deep the little swing lantern beneath the bowsprit play on he bearded face as he bent farther forward and with grow wonder not unmixed with fear now make out something dark cling to one of the steel line that run from the project timber to the ship it take the lookout a few moment to realize that this dark object that have a voice -- albeit a faint one -- could not be other than a recent occupant of the small boat he have see disappear this person must have leap upward at the critical moment and catch one of the taut strand upon which he have somehow manage to hoist himself and to which he now cling desperately it be a precarious position and one that the motion of the yacht make but briefly tenable satisfied that the dark object be a reality and not a unwonted visitation the lookout begin deliberately to unloosen a gasket moment might be eternity to the man below but muscovite slowness be not to be hurry the yacht 's bow poise in mid air a breathless instant chaos seem leap upward toward mr heatherbloom when something -- a line -- strike and rub against he cheek he seize and trust himself to it eagerly the sailor be strong he pull in the rope mr heatherbloom come up but he strength be almost go he would have let go when iron finger close on he wrist and after that he remember no more he awake in a berth in a fo ` castle and it be daylight through a partly-opened hatch he could see the fine spray that come over the side of the yacht amid misty particle touch by the sun shine a tiny segment of rainbow this mr heatherbloom watch with a kind of childish interest then stretch himself more luxuriously on the hard bunk it be very fine have nothing more important and arduous to do than watch prismatic hue he thought float back to long forget wonder-day when he have possess that master-marvel of toy a kaleidoscope and on occasion have importantly permit the golden-haired child in the big house on the top of the hill to -- the dream be abruptly dispel by some one lay a tarry hand on he shoulder mr heatherbloom raise himself the person have a characteristic russian face for a moment the young man stare at the stolid feature then look around he he see the customary furnishings of such a place hammock bag and chest several of the last marked with russian character a trace of color spring to mr heatherbloom 's face he realize now what boat he be actually on and what it all mean to he he could hardly believe however and continue to regard the upside down odd lettering when the sailor who have so unceremoniously disturbed he motion he to get out mr heatherbloom obey he feel very stiff and somewhat light-headed but he steady himself against the woodwork the sailor draw a dipperful of hot tea from a samovar and thrust it into he hand he drink with avidity after which the sailor make he to understand he be to follow the young man hesitate -- a new risk confront he to whom would he be take the prince he have once be stand in the area way of the van rolsen house when the nobleman have approach have the distinguished visitor then be so absorb in the sight of miss dalrymple come down the step that he have utterly fail to observe the humble caretaker of canine possibly -- and again possibly not in the former contingency he might yet have a brief breathing-spell to think -- to plan for the future unless -- there be another to reckon with -- the woman he have meet in the park whose automobile he have attempt to follow she too be on the boat he have be she dupe once be he now to become she victim the young man 's jaw set there be no hold back now however he have to go on -- and he do with seeming indifference and bold enough step at the top of the ladder the sailor pass he on to some one else -- a officer -- who lead he this way and that until they reach a secluded part of the deck where near the rail stand a tall dark figure glass in hand until the last moment mr heatherbloom have hope it might be only the captain he would be call on to encounter and that that August person would summarily dispose of he order he somewhere out of sight below to work he passage in the sailor ' galley perhaps he would have welcome the most ignominious service to have find now a respite -- to be enable to escape discovery a little longer but the wished-for contingency have not arise he face the inevitable the man you excellency he excellency look he have be scan the horizon and he expression be both moody and preoccupy mr heatherbloom bent slightly forward he lid fall to conceal a sudden glitter in he eye he hand touch something hard in he pocket if he excellency recognize he -- there be one way -- a last mad desperate way to serve to save she it would be the end-all for he but he life be a very small thing to give to she he do not value it greatly -- that physical self that have be such a ill servant he gaze at the prince now with veil expectancy he attitude seemingly relax innocent of strenuosity would the prince 's gaze flare back with a spark of remembrance if in that tense instant it have do so then -- but he excellency regard mr heatherbloom blankly he eye be emotionless you mean the fellow we run down the prince speak as if irritated by the intrusion the same excellency the officer step back mr heatherbloom do not move what do you get in we way for the prince 's voice have a metallic ring he tower harshly arrogant over he uninvited passenger do not you know enough to get out of the way it appear not sir heatherbloom wonder at the sound of he own voice it seem to come small and quiet from so far off he excellency have not recognize he but be he suspicious maybe not no one would be fool enough to get deliberately in the way of the fast-steaming _ nevskus _ small craft be numerous in the bay and accident to they would happen there be nothing so out of the ordinary for a big boat to run down a tiny craft it be somewhat uncommon for any one in the wee boat to save himself truly but even in this feature of the present case the prince experience but a mild interest who be you he say a fisherman not exactly answer mr heatherbloom though sometimes i crab i be crab yesterday as he speak he gaze sweep beyond to not far-distant cabin door and window he and the prince be stand on the starboard side of the boat it be this side that have face the island when the young man have gaze down upon the yacht from the big sand-hill and fancy he have see -- what be i go to do with you the prince seem more out of temper now my crew be all russian and i do not want any of you -- he stop shift light play ominously in he gaze a few dissatisfied line on he face deepen i do not ask you to come aboard he end with a angry gesture sorry to intrude mr heatherbloom speak at random but i really could not help it do not you know no time to ask permission he excellency frown do he suspect in these word a attempt at that insidious american humor he have often vainly endeavor to fathom mr heatherbloom gaze at he now with seemingly innocent but really very attentive eye a superb specimen of over six foot of masculinity the prince be picturesquely attire in russian yachting-garb while a cossack cap adorn a visage as bold and romantic as any young woman might wish to gaze upon and gaze upon it himself -- that rather stunning picture the prince present on he own yacht -- a sudden chill run through mr heatherbloom this title paragon refuse by miss dalrymple a feudal lord who make you dapper french count and hungarian baron appear but small fry indeed by contrast the light of the sea seem suddenly to dazzle mr heatherbloom a wild thought surge through he brain betty dalrymple bewildering confuse make up of captivating inconsistency have sometimes be accuse by people of a capacity for do the wildest thing have she for excitement -- or any other reason -- elope with the prince be they perhaps marry even now he dismiss the think quickly all the circumstance point against this theory he original one be -- must be -- correct well now you be here i suppose i have get to keep you the prince have again speak i suppose so say mr heatherbloom absently he be study now the near-by cabin window one with beautiful lace and glimpse of pink beyond catch he glance what can you do sharply oh a lot of thing have the curtain wave he heart thump hard -- he scarcely see the prince now not manage a sail-boat i be convinced he force himself to turn again as through a mist be aware of he excellency 's sneering countenance judge from you recent performance that be hardly a fair test mr heatherbloom reply anyhow he thought be key to a straining-point he glance _ would _ swerve he strive he best to control it she be there -- there -- shroud and stay seem to sing the word he would have swear he catch the flash of a white wrist why not be the prince still examine question he again a primal impulse be suppress though he muscle be like whipcord he yet compel himself to endure the ordeal what be the query about ah he remember well you see i must have lose my head it be not a bright answer but he do not care it be the best that occur the prince stride restlessly away a few pace then return be you ever at sea before i once own a y -- mr heatherbloom pause -- with a effort resume he part and a smile somewhat strain : i once go on a cruise on a gentleman 's yacht some one _ be _ in the state-room be overhear he head hum the refrain of the taut line ring louder what as cabin-boy cook why you see -- the prince certainly do not see he -- he be once more stare away over the dark water -- i act in a good many capacity kind of general utility as it be do this that and the other ` the other ' i should surmise contemptuously mr heatherbloom move the curtain have move again where be you go he ask a little wildly you see i might have important business on shore foolish talk -- yet it fit in as well as anything the prince for he part do not at first seem to catch the other 's word when he do he laugh loudly sardonically that be good excellent _ you _ have ` important business ' yes important repeat mr heatherbloom i -- he get no further he eye meet another be at the window rest a moment on a woman 's face which then suddenly vanish but not before he realize that she too have see he -- see and recognize he have catch in that fleeting instant wonder irony incredulity -- a grow understanding then he hear a soft laugh -- a musical but devilish laugh -- sonium turgeinov 's chapter xv the sword of damocles mr heatherbloom stand as if stunned he face very pale for the instant all he suppress emotion concentrate on this woman -- he evil genius -- who have betray he before and who would betray he again now he wait breathing hard why do she not appear why do not the blow fall he could not understand that interval -- nothing happen be she but play with he the prince have abruptly turn apparently he have not hear that very low laugh bore no doubt by the interview he have start to walk away almost at the same time mr heatherbloom have catch sight of the face at the window as in a dream mr heatherbloom now hear he excellency 's brusk voice address a command to the officer listen to the latter a moment or two later address he come along the officer 's english be labor and guttural mr heatherbloom 's eye swing swiftly from the near-by door through which he have momentarily expect the woman to emerge involuntarily he would have step after the vanish figure of the prince -- what to do he know not when -- _ non non _ say the officer intervene hee excellenz dislike to be -- importune the last word cost the speaker a effort to the listener it be hardly intelligible but the officer 's manner indicate plainly he meaning mr heatherbloom manage to hold himself still he seem standing in the center of a vortex the prince have by this time go the woman do not step forth this lame and impotent conclusion be out of all proportion to the seemingly inevitable he could scarcely realize it be he -- actually he -- who after another pause follow the officer with scant interest hardly any at all to some inferno where flame leap and hiss he could not but be aware of they although the voice tell he that he would remain here make himself useful and incidentally work he way among the stoker sound very far off he could have exclaim scoffingly after the disappear officer not anxious to linger any longer than necessary here work he way indeed how long would he be permit to do so when would he be again send for and deal with -- in what manner he shovel coal feverishly though the irony of the task smite he for in feed the insatiable bed he be with he own hand help to furnish the energy that waft she he would have serve farther and farther from the home land every additional mile put between that shore and the boat increase the prince 's sense of power he be work for he excellency and against she in a revulsion of feeling he lean on he shovel whereupon a besooted giant of the lower region tap he shoulder this person -- foreman of the gang -- point significantly to the inactive implement he brow be low brutish and he have a fist like a hammer mr heatherbloom lift the shovel and look at the low brow but fortunately he do not act on the impulse it be as if some detain angel reach down into those realm of pluto and at the critical moment lay a white hand where the big paw have touch he the young man resume he toil after all what do it matter -- some one would shovel the stuff that brief revolt have be spasmodic sentimental here where the heat be almost intolerable and the red tongue spring like fork dagger before dull eye brutality and hatred alone seem to reign the prince might be the prodigal free-handed gentleman to he officer he be the slave-driver by proxy to he stoker he who dominate in that place of torment have be a overseer from one of the village the prince own these man be the descendant of serf once or twice heatherbloom rather incoherently try to engage one or two of they in conversation to learn where the yacht be go -- to southern sea across the atlantic -- but they only stare at he as if he be some strange be quite beyond they ken so he desist of course they could not understand he and of course they know nothing he wish to know in this prison a sense of motion and direction be as naught fortunately mr heatherbloom 's muscle be in good condition and there be not a superfluous ounce on he but he need all he energy to escape the fist and the boot that day to keep pace with the other the perspiration pour from he face in sooty rivulet he know if he give way what kind of consideration to expect he be be test the foreman 's eye themselves seem full of spark there be something tentative expectant in they curious gleam as they rest on he heatherbloom now could hardly keep to he foot he own eye burn the flame dance as if with a living hatred of he in a semi-stupor he almost forget the sword without that swing over he hold but by a thread that might be cut any instant he could not have last many minute more when relief come sodden sullen man take the place heatherbloom stagger out with he own herd he feel the need of food as well as rest he grope he way somewhere -- into a dark close place he find black-looking bread -- or be it hand to he he eat throw himself down thought of she -- then cease to think at all the sword he companion or specter no longer exist for he it may be some spiritual part of he during that physical coma draw from a supermundane source beatific draft for he awake refresh he mind clear even alert he gaze around he alone move he companion resemble so many bag of rag cast here and there only the snore now diminuendo then crescendo dispel the illusion a smoking lamp throw a paucity of light and a good deal of odor around they be it night the shadow play hide-and-seek in corner there be no sound of the sea mr heatherbloom move toward a door he pulse seem to throb in rhythm with the engine whose strong pulsation shake those limp unconscious form he open the iron door and look out only blackness relieve by a low-power electric light meet he gaze he creep from the place why do not some one rise up to detain he surely he be watch he experience a uncanny sense of be allow to proceed just so far when invisible finger would pounce upon he to hurl he back the soot still lay on he face he have see no bucket and water at the mouth of a tunnel-like aperture he hesitate but still no one spring in front or glide up from behind to interfere with he progress he go on a perpendicular iron ladder enable he to reach a open space on the desert lower deck another ladder lead to the upper deck could he mount it and still escape detection and in that case -- to what end a bell strike the hour nine o'clock he count the stroke much time have indeed pass since leave port the yacht he judge should be capable of sixteen knot where be they now and where be she -- in what part of the boat have they confine the young girl come what might he would try to ascertain creep softly up the second ladder he peer around still he see no one it be a dark night a shadow lay like a blanket on the sea he feel for he revolver -- they have not take it from he -- and start to make he way cautiously aft when something he see bring he to a abrupt halt a figure -- a woman 's -- or a young girl 's -- not far distant look over the side the form be barely discernible he could but make out the vague fluttering of a gown be it she whom he seek how could he find out he dare not speak she move and he realize he could not let she go thus it might be a opportunity -- no doubt they would suffer the young girl the freedom of the deck it would be along the line of a conciliatory policy on the prince 's part to attempt to reassure she as much as possible after the indignity ' she have suffer the watcher 's eye strain she be go he half start forward -- to risk all -- to speak he lip form a name but do not breathe it for at that moment the swaying of the boat have throw a flicker of light on the face and mr heatherbloom draw back the edge of he ardor dull the woman move a few step this way and that he hear the swish of she skirt now they almost touch he stand motionless where the shadow be deepest and at that near contact a blind anger sweep over he against she -- who hold he in she power to eliminate when she would -- when what be she cue but of course she must have speak already -- it be inconceivable otherwise then why have the prince not act at once summarily he excellency be not one to hesitate about drastic measure mr heatherbloom could not solve the riddle at all he could only crouch back farther now and wait through the gloom he divine a new swiftness in she step a certain sinuosity of movement that suddenly melt into immobility a red spot have appear close by burn now on blackness it be follow by another 's footstep a man cigar in hand join she ah prince she say he mutter something heatherbloom do not catch what she exclaim lightly no better humor he answer be eloquent a flicker of light he have move toward reveal he face gallant romantic enough in its happier moment but now distinctly unpleasant with the stamp of ancestral sybarite of the petersburg court shine through the cruelty and intolerance of semi-tartar

honorarium offer be enormous for a poor ill-treated player whose very soul be ready to sing _ de profundis _ do it tempt she -- forlorn downhearted -- she pause close by the spark brighten dim -- brighten dim mr heatherbloom bent nearer at any rate she be honest enough to attempt to dissuade you -- in vain and then -- she voice change -- since you will it so she yield it sound wild impossible the plan you broach perhaps because it do seem so impossible it win over poor sonium turgeinov -- she who have throw she cap over the windmill there would be excitement fascination in play such a thrilling part in real life be you ever hungry prince she break off what a absurd question what be more to the point tell I it be all well do -- the device or excuse of substitute another motor-car

scoffing -- i never dream _ you _ would not afterward be able to -- she word leap into a new channel what can the child want _ est-ce-qu ` elle aime un autre _ that might explain -- a expletive smack more of montmartre than of the boulevard capucine fall from the nobleman 's lip he brush the ash fiercely from he cigar it be not so -- it will not explain anything he return violently do not i once have it from she own lip that at least she be not -- he stop _ mon dieu _ that contingency -- suddenly she again laugh delicious what nothing my own thought by the way what have become of the man we pick up from the sail-boat the prince make a gesture he be down below -- among the stoker why do you ask it be natural i suppose to take a faint interest in a poor fisherman you have almost drown not i brutally no a smile enigmatical play around she lip how droll droll heartless then but you great noble be that a little eh _ mon ami _ he shrug and return quickly to that other more interesting subject _ elle va m ` epouser _ he exclaim violently i will stake my life on it she will she must must the woman raise she hand you say that to a american girl we be not at the finis yet a ugly crispness be manifest in he tone there be port and priest a-plenty and this voyage be apt to be a long one unless she consent -- charming man she speak almost absently now have not i anything to offer

she be a witch like those that come out of the reed on the volga -- to steal alike the soul of fisherman and prince he pause then go on moodily i suppose i should have go -- allow myself to be dismiss as a boy from school ' i have play with you you have amuse I you no longer do so adieu ' so she would have say to I if not in word by implication no _ mercus _ he break off angrily _ tant s ` en faut _ i too shall have something to say -- and soon -- to-night -- he make a swift gesture throw he cigar into the sea and walk off how tiresome but the word fall from the woman 's lip uneasily she stretch she lithe form and look up into the night then she too disappear mr heatherbloom stand motionless she know who he be and yet she have not reveal he secret to the prince because she deem he but a pawn paltry inconsequential because she wish to save the hot-headed nobleman from commit a deed of violence -- a crime even -- if he should learn the reason matter little in mr heatherbloom 's mind he excellency 's last word -- all they portend -- exclude now consideration of all else he gaze uncertainly in the direction the nobleman have go suddenly start to follow stealthily cautiously when another person approach mr heatherbloom would have draw back but it be too late -- he be see he absence from the stoker ' quarter have be discover after search for he below and not find he the giant foreman have come up here to look around he be swing he long arm and mutter angrily when he catch sight of he delinquent helper the man utter a low hoarse sound that augur ill for mr heatherbloom the latter know what he have to expect -- that no mercy would be show he he step swiftly backward at the same time look about for something with which to defend himself chapter xvi the despot prince bori

fast the swaying of the yacht be like the rhythmic motion of he arab through the long grass beyond the dnieper in that wild land where conventionality and law be as naught he see the operator now lean forward to write the apparatus which have become silent again speak the word come now fast then slow flame of flame what a instrument that harness the spark chase destiny itself with they they crackle like whip the operator throw down he pen excellency he almost run into the tall motionless figure pardon a message -- they want to establish communication with the _ nevskus _ -- to learn if we pick

uncontrollable strogareff line so the story go francoi return to he instrument he excellency 's look sweep beyond he hear now only the sound of the sea -- restless in unending tumult the wind blow colder and he go below but not to rest he be in no mood for that what then he hesitate at war with himself patience patience what fool advice from sonium turgeinov he help himself liberally from a decanter on a loui quinze sideboard in the beautiful _ salle à manger _ the soft light reveal he and he only a solitary figure in that luxurious place -- master of all he survey but not master of he

flower he pass a big hand across he brow he heart-beat be like the gallop hoof of a horse bear he whither gold of she hair violet of she eye whither the rave mad poet wine seem run in he blood he move toward the distant door it be lock -- of course for the moment he have forget thrust he hand into he pocket he draw out a key and unsteadily fit it but before turn it he stand a instant listen no

give he the order to make at once for the nearest american port you will ask he how far it be and how soon we can get there beyond that you will say nothing make no explanation or utter a single superfluous word very well the prince seemingly acquiescent but with a dangerous glitter in he eye move toward the telephone one moment the nobleman stop with he hand near a receiver he finger tremble you will speak in french a syllable of russian just one and -- mr heatherbloom 's expression leave no doubt as to he mean dog he excellency 's swollen face become the hue of paper a instant he seem

weapon be behind the prince as the latter poignantly realize ill-suppressed rage make he excellency 's tone now slightly waver : be you there m le capitaine steady mr heatherbloom whisper warningly in he excellency 's free ear emphasize the caution with a significant pressure from he right hand at the same time he catch the answer from afar -- a deferential voice : _ ouus _ excellence there be fortunately on the wire a singing sound that would serve to drown evidence of emotion in the nobleman 's tone excellence wish to speak with I go on the distant voice i do the prince breathe fast -- pause you will change the boat 's course and -- he speak with difficulty a warmer breath fan he cheek he feel a sensation like ice on the back of he neck make for the nearest american port how far be it mr heatherbloom 's prompt whisper be audible only to he excellency five hour come over the wire mr heatherbloom experience a thrill of satisfaction they be nearer the coast than he have suppose he know the yacht have be take a southerly course he have consider that when the bold idea come to act as he be do possibly the prince have be drive out of the last port by the publicity attendant upon mr heatherbloom 's presence there before certain need repair have be complete these mr heatherbloom now surmise it be he excellency 's intention to have attend to in some island harbor before proceed with a longer voyage only five hour good-by now burst from the nobleman so violently that mr heatherbloom 's momentary exultation change to a feeling of apprehension but m le capitaine have evidently become accustomed to occasional explosive moment from he August patron he concern himself only with the command not the manner in which it be give eh _ mon dieu _ do i hear you excellency aright he accent express surprise but not of a immoderate nature he no doubt receive many arbitrary and unexpected order when he excellency go a-cruising repeat the order heatherbloom 's whisper seem fairly to sting the nobleman 's disengaged ear the latter do repeat -- savagely -- jerkily but the hum wire temper the tone m le capitaine understand fully he say as much he excellency should be obey -- mr heatherbloom push the nobleman 's head abruptly aside cover the mouthpiece with he hand perhaps he divine that irresistible malediction about to fall from he excellency 's lip hang it up he say the nobleman 's breath be labor but he place he receiver where it belong mr heatherbloom do likewise both now step back upon the prince 's brow stand drop of perspiration the yacht have already slow up and be turn he excellency listen may i ask how much longer you be desirous of my company here oh yes you may ask the boat have begin to quiver again she be go at full speed once more only now she head

have she hear do she know anything of what be happen -- that the yacht be now turn homeward he dare not linger on the think the prince be watch he with eye that seem to dilate and contract a moment 's carelessness the briefest cessation of watchfulness would be at once seize upon by he excellency enable he to shift the advantage the young man meet that expectant gleam sorry to seem officious but if you excellency will sit down once more not here -- over there indicate a stationary arm-chair before a desk in a recess of the room the prince obey he have no alternative the fellow must of course be a madman the prince reiterate in he own mind unless -- i tell you excellency i have no wish for a long sea voyage a mock voice now make itself hear the nobleman start and look closer a mist seem to fall from before he gaze he recognize the fellow now -- the man they have run down the shock of that terrible experience the strain of the disaster have turn the fellow 's brain that would explain everything -- this extraordinary occurrence there be nothing to do but to humor he for the moment though it be awkward -- devilish -- or might soon be -- if this game should be continue much longer mr heatherbloom glide silently toward the hanging near the alcove what now -- the prince ask with he eye mr heatherbloom unloosened from a brass holder a silk cord as thick as he thumb if you excellency will permit I -- he step to the prince 's side that person regard the cord strong as hemp what do you mean burst from he it be quite apparent a oath escape the prince 's throat regardless of consequence he spring to he foot never a desperate determination gleam in he eye this crowning outrage he a nobleman -- to suffer himself to be bind ignominiously by some low _ polisson _ of a raffish mushroom country it be inconceivable _ jamai _ he repeat ah well say mr heatherbloom resignedly nevertheless i shall make the attempt to do what i propose and if you resist -- you will assassinate I stammer the nobleman we will not discuss how the law might characterize the act only the word come quickly do not waste vain hope that i will not assassinate you if it be necessary i never waste powder either -- can clip a coin every time one of my few accomplishment enigmatically and -- as the prince hesitate one breathless second -- i can get you straight first shoot sure he excellency believe he he have hear how in this bizarre america a single man sometimes hold up a entire train out west and have he own sweet way with engineer conductor and passenger this madman on the slightest provocation now be evidently prepare to emulate that extraordinary and undesirable type what might he not do or attempt to do the nobleman 's figure relax slightly he lip twitch then he sink back once more into the strong solid chair at the desk good say mr heatherbloom a cold smile like a faint ripple on a mountain lake sweep he lip now we shall get on faster chapter xviii the coup mr heatherbloom with finger deft as a sailor 's secure the prince the single silken band do not suffice other cord divert from the ornamental to a like practical purpose be wind around and around he excellency 's leg and arm hold he so tightly to the chair he could scarcely move have complete this task mr heatherbloom next with vandal hand whip from the wall a bit of priceless embroidery throw it over the nobleman 's head and in spite of sundry frenzied objection effectually gag he then draw the heavy curtain so that they almost conceal the bind figure in the dim recess the young man step once more out into the salon how still it suddenly seem he glance sweep toward the door through which the young girl have vanish why have he hear no sound from she why do she not appear now she must have catch something of what have be go on he go swiftly to the door miss dalrymple no answer he rap again -- louder -- then try the door it resist he shake it betty yes he call she that in the alarm and excitement of the moment it be -- it be all right open the door again that hush -- nothing more mr heatherbloom pull rather wildly at the lock of hair over he brow then a sudden frenzy seem to seize he he launch himself forward and strike fairly with he shoulder -- once -- twice the door at length yield with a crash he rush in -- fall to he knee betty oh betty for the moment he stare helplessly at the motionless form on the floor then lift the girl in he arm he lay she on a couch one little white hand swing limp he seize it with grimy finger it be oddly cold and a shiver go over he he feel for she pulse -- she heart -- at first catch no answering throb for he own heart be beat so wildly the world seem to swim -- then he straighten the filmy dress not so white now in spot have flutter beneath she throat he gaze rapturously it 'll be all right he say again darling he could say it now when she could not hear darling darling he repeat it constitute he vocabulary of term of endearment he feel the need of no other she lay like a lily he see nothing anomalous in certain stain of soot even on the wonderful face where he have unconsciously touch it when he have raise she and strain she to he one mad instant in he arm in fact he do not see those stain he eye be close to such detail -- and the crimson mark too on she gown he knuckle be bleed he be unaware of it he be not outwardly a very presentable adorer but he become suddenly a most daring one he grimy hand touch the shine hair half-unbound he raise one of the marvelous tress -- he hungry lip sweep it lightly -- or do he but breathe a divine fragrance by some inner process he spirit seem to have come that instant very near to hers he forget where he be time and space be annihilate he be bring abruptly back to the living present by a sudden knock at the door without which he have lock after enter that way from the deck mr heatherbloom listen the person whoever he be on receive no response soon go away have they discover what have happen to the foreman of the stoker whom heatherbloom have strike down with a heavy iron belaying-pin the man have attack he with murderous intent in defend himself heatherbloom believe he have kill the fellow the chance blow he have deliver with the formidable weapon have be one of desperation and despair it have be more than a question of he life or the other 's she fate have be involve in that critical moment he have drag the unconscious figure to the shadow behind a life-boat they would not be likely to stumble across the incriminate evidence while it be dark nor be it likely that the foreman 's absence below would cause the man to look for he the overworked stoker would be but too pleased to escape for a spell they tyrannous master mr heatherbloom standing near the threshold of the dressing-room glance now toward the little french clock without over four hour yet to port how slowly time go he turn out all the light save one shaded lamp of low candle-power in the cabin then he do the same in the room where the girl be no one must peer in on he from unexpected place he look up and see that the skylight be cover with canvas mr heatherbloom remain in the salon he need to continue master of he thought in the dressing-room he have just now forget himself that would not do he must concentrate all he faculty every energy to bring this coup bear on the inspiration of the moment to a successful conclusion desperate as he plan be he believe now he would win out by the vibration he know the boat be still steam full speed on she new course the condition be all favorable they would reach port before dawn at break of day the health officer would come aboard and after that -- the telephone suddenly ring should he answer that imperious summons perhaps the man who have just knock at the door have be one of the officer or the captain himself come in person to speak with he excellency about the unexpected change in the boat 's course or some technical question or difficulty that might have arise in consequence thereof he look toward the recess between the curtain he catch sight of the prince 's eye and in the dim light he fancy they shine with sudden hope -- expectancy the nobleman must have hear the crash of the door to the dressing-room what he have think be of no moment a viperish fervor replace that other brief expression in he excellency 's gaze once more that metallic call -- harsh loud as not to be deny mr heatherbloom make up he mind perhaps all depend on he decision he would answer step across the salon he take down the receiver the singing on the wire have be pronounced he could imitate the prince 's autocratic tone and the person at the other end would not discover in all likelihood the deception well say mr heatherbloom loudly in french what do you want have not i give order not to be -- he voice die away he nearly drop the receiver a woman answer moreover the wire do not seem to sing so much now sonia turgeinov 's tone be transmit in all they intrinsic flute-like lucidity what have happen you excellency she ask anxiously happen the young man manage to say nothing then why have the yacht 's course be change i can tell by the star from my cabin window that we be not head at all in the same direction we be go -- he try to speak unconcernedly : just change for a short time on account of some reef and the current go to sleep he command and leave the problem of navigation to other sleep _ mon dieu _ if i only could -- mr heatherbloom dare talk no more so ring off the prince might have be capable of such bruskness sonium turgeinov have not seem to suspect anything wrong she have merely be inquisitive and have take it for grant the nobleman be at the other end of the wire mr heatherbloom stride restlessly to and fro seconds go by -- minute he count the ticking of the clock -- suddenly wheel sharply \* \* \* \* \* the young girl stand in the doorway -- he have hear and now see she she come forward quickly though uncertainly in the dim light she look like a shadow he draw in he breath miss -- he begin then stop she gaze rest on he almost indistinguishable on the other side of the salon what do it mean who be you she speak intrepidly enough but he see she slender form sway who be he about to explain in a rush of word mr heatherbloom hesitate to she he have be of course but a conspirator of the russian woman in the affair miss van rolsen have deem he culpable the detective have be sure of it would miss dalrymple think more leniently of he than mere unprejudiced people those who know less of he than she he very presence on the yacht although somewhat inexplicably complicate in recent occurrence be _ per se _ a primal damning circumstance but she spare he the necessity of answer she divine now from he blacken feature what he position on the yacht must be he be only a poor stoker but -- you be a brave fellow cry betty dalrymple and i 'll not forget it you interfere -- i remember -- a brave fellow it be well he have not betray himself let she think that of he for the moment a poignant mockery lend pain to the thrill of she word you rush in strike he what then he will not play the bully and scoundrel again for some time burst from mr heatherbloom he tone be impetuous once more he seem to see what he have see during those last moment on the deck -- when he have be unable to restrain himself longer -- and have yield to a single hot-blooded impulse the big brute he mutter she seem to regard he in slight surprise where be he what have become of he he be safe -- you mean you conquer he beat he -- you she voice thrill you bet i do say mr heatherbloom with the least evidence of incoherency she word have be verbal champagne to he i give he the dandiest best lick -- he stop perhaps he realize that he explanation be begin to seem slightly tinge with too great evidence of personal satisfaction if not boastfulness you see i have a gun he murmur rather apologetically but say the girl come nearer i do not understand he start to meet that advance then back away a little i have get he safe where he can not move or bother you any more mr heatherbloom glance over he shoulder but he do not tell she where he have he and the yacht 's go back to the nearest american port he could not help add impetuously to reassure she go back impossible wonder incredulity be in she voice it be true as shooting bet -- she be too bewildered to notice that slight slip of the tongue it be a fact miss he add more gruffly but how she tone betray reticence in credit the miracle yet this blacken figure must have prevail over the prince or the latter would not have so mysteriously disappear how do it happen well you see i just happen around you a stoker stoker he be remind by she tone do not usually happen around on deck of palatial private yacht he must seek a different more definite explanation he think he see a way he could let she know part of the truth the fact be i be look for this boat at the last port she stop at i have cause to think you would be on she could not stop the yacht from go to sea for reason too numerous to mention so i just slip out and come aboard in a kind of disguise -- a disguise then you be a detective i think i may truthfully say i be but in a sort of private capacity when a really important case occur it interest I now this be a important case and -- and it interested I he hardly know what he be say she eye be so insistent betty dalrymple have always have the most disconcerting eye because you see you -- you aunt be so anxious -- and -- with a flash of inspiration -- the reward be a big one the reward of course she voice die away you hope to get it that be the reason -- he let he silence answer in the affirmative he feel relieved now she have not recognize he -- yet in the recess behind the drapery the chair in which he excellency be bind creak be he struggle to release himself mr heatherbloom have faith in the knot and the silken cord the girl turn she head do not you think it would be better -- he speak quickly -- for you to return to you cabin i 'll let you know when i want you and -- but if i prefer to stay here may i not turn on the light not for world hastily it be necessary they should not see I if they do -- he be oblige to explain a little of the real situation to she of the stratagem he have employ this he do in few word she listen eagerly the mantle of the commonplace which to she eye have fall a few moment before on he shoulder become at least partly withdraw she divine the great hazard the danger he have face -- be face now detective or not it have be daringly do she voice with a warm thrill in it say as much she eye shine like star she come of a live virile stock from man and woman who have do thing themselves if only i too have a weapon she say lean toward he in case they should discover -- no no it would not do at all why not the warm lip breathe i can shoot some one once teach I -- she stop short a chill seem descend you be say -- he prompt eagerly but she do not answer the sweep of she hair make a shadowy veil around she he mind hark swiftly back she have always have wondrous hair it have take two big braid to hold it most girl could get they hair in one braid he have be very proud for she of those two braid -- once -- with they blue or pink ribbon that have pop below the edge of she skirt he continue to see blue and pink ribbon now both be for some time silent at length she stir -- seat herself mr heatherbloom mechanically do likewise but at a distance from she he try not to see she to become mentally oblivious of she presence to concentrate again solely on the matter in hand a long long interval pass chug chug the engine continue to grind how far away they sound another sound too at length break the stillness -- a stealthy footfall on the deck it send he at once softly to the window he gaze out she follow be -- be we get anywhere near port he do not tell she that it be not port he be look for so soon as he gaze out searchingly into the night what be it she have draw the curtain a little she shoulder touch he suddenly he arm sweep she back what do you mean -- he turn on she sternly -- by draw that curtain be any one there any one -- he begin almost fiercely then pause the figure he have see in that flash look like that of the foreman of the stoker in that case then the fellow be not dead he have recover through a mistaken sense of mercy mr heatherbloom have not slip the seemingly lifeless body over the side now he and she too be likely to pay dearly for that clemency bitterly he clench he hand have the man catch a glimpse of he at the window a flicker of electric light without shone on it the girl start again to speak hush he draw she back yet farther above some one have raise the corner of the canvas cover the skylight it be too dark however for the person whoever it might be to discern very much below neither mr heatherbloom nor he companion now move the tenseness and excitement of the moment hold they the girl breathe quickly she hand be at he sleeve even in that moment of suspense and peril he be conscious of the nearness of she -- the lithe young form so close the creaking of the chair in the recess be again hear have he excellency catch sight of the person above be he endeavor to attract attention and could the observer at the skylight discern the nobleman it seem unlikely the glass above do not appear to extend quite over the recess through a slight opening of the drapery mr heatherbloom however could see he captive and notice he seem to be try to tip back farther in he chair to reach out behind with he bind hand -- toward what the young man abruptly realize and half start to he foot -- but not in time the chair go over backward and come down with a crash but not before he excellency 's finger have succeed in touch a electric button near the desk a flood of light fill the place it be answer by a shout -- a signal for other voice fragment of glass fall around a figure drop into the salon other follow the door to the deck yield to force from without mr heatherbloom though surprised and outnumber struggle as best he might he weapon ring out then as they press closer he defend himself with the butt of he revolver and he fist there could be but one end to the unequal contest the girl -- a helpless spectator -- realize that though she could with difficulty perceive what take place it be all so chaotic she try to draw nearer but beard face intervene rough hand thrust she back she would have call out but the word would not come it be like a evil dream as through a mist she see one among many who have enter from the deck -- a giant in size he carry a oaken bar in he hand and now steal sidewise with murderous intent toward the single figure strive so gallantly no no betty dalrymple 's voice come back to she suddenly she exclaim wildly incoherently but the foreman of the stoker raise the bar wait he find he opportunity he arm descend chapter xix and then -- mr heatherbloom regain consciousness or semi-consciousness in a ill-smelling place he first impulse be to raise he hand to he ache head but he could not do this on account of two iron band that hold he wrist to a stanchion he leg too he next become vaguely aware be fasten by a similar contrivance to the deck he close he eye and lean back the throbbing seem to beat on he brain like the angry surf smite harder and harder until nature at length come to he relief and oblivion once more claim he how long it be before he again open he eye he could not tell the shooting throe be still there but he could endure they now and even think in a incoherent fashion he gaze around the light grudgingly admit by a small port-hole reveal a bare prison-like cell realization of what it all mean he be there sweep over he and in a semi-delirious frenzy he tug at he fastening he do not succeed in release himself he only increase the hurtle wave of pain in he head what do she think of she valiant rescuer now he who have raise she hope so high but to dash they utterly some one some time later bring he water and give he bread release he wrist while he eat and fasten they again when he have finish the hour that seem day pass during that time he half think he have another visitor but be not sure the delirium have return he strive to think lucidly but know himself very light-headed he imagine sonium turgeinov come to he that she look down on he _ mon dieu _ it be my canine keeper the man with the dog what a lame and impotent conclusion for one so clever i look for something better from you my intrepid friend who dare to come aboard in that thrilling manner -- who manage to follow I through what art i do not know how be the mighty fall she tone be low mocking he disdain to reply really i be disappoint after my not have betray who you be to the prince why do not you he say she laugh perhaps because i be a artist and it seem inartistic to intervene -- to interrupt the action at a inopportune moment -- to stultify what promise to be a unusually involve complication when first i saw and recognize you on the _ nevskus _ it be like one of those divine surprise of the master dramatist m sardou really i be indebted for the thrill of it besides have i speak the prince might have toss you overboard he be quite capable of do so that too would have be inartistic would have turn a comedy of love into rank melodrama rank nonsense of course such a conversation could not be real but he cry out in the dream : what matter if he excellency have toss I overboard what good be i here to she you mean to she of course bitterly the vision 's eye be very bright she plastic rather mature form bent nearer he feel a cool hand at the bandage readjust it about he head that naturally could not be she who have betray betty dalrymple to the prince would not be sedulous about mr heatherbloom 's injury foolish boy she breathe incongruous solicitude who be you no common dog-tender -- of that i be sure what have you be what -- wildly there there say half-soothingly that

send again bread and water and after what seem a intolerable interval he find himself eat with zest he be exceedingly hungry he also begin to feel mentally normal although he thought be the reverse of agreeable day have no doubt go by he chafe at this enforced inaction but sometimes through sheer weariness fall into a semblance of natural sleep despite the sit posture he be oblige to maintain on one such occasion he be abruptly awaken by a light throw suddenly on he face he would have start to he foot but the fetter restrain he it be night a lantern hold by a hand that shake slightly reveal a face he do not know he feel assure however of he mental lucidity at the moment the new-comer though a stranger be undoubtedly flesh and blood what do you want say the prisoner a word with you monsieur the speaker have a smooth face and dark soulful eye he manner be both furtive and constrain he look around as if uncomfortable at find himself in that place well i guess you can have it i can not get away mutter the manacled man miss dalrymple send I mr heatherbloom 's interest be manifest he strive to suppress outward sign of it what -- what for she want to make sure you be not dead the prisoner do not answer he emotion be too great at the moment to permit he do so she be in trouble yet she consider the poor detective that be like she -- straight as a string -- true blue -- the visitor start to go hold on say mr heatherbloom whose idea be surge fast this youth have manage to come here at she instigation have she make a friend of he a ally he do not appear a heroic one but he be no doubt the best that have offer betty dalrymple be not one to sit idly she would seek way and mean she be clever know how to use those violet eye -lrb- do not mr heatherbloom himself remember -rrb- who be he -- this nocturnal caller not a officer -- he be too young cabin-boy perhaps more likely the operator mr heatherbloom have notice that the yacht be provide with the wireless outfit how long have i be here he now ask abruptly it be three day since monsieur be knock on the head mr heatherbloom look down three day well it cost I a fortune he sigh remember the rôle of detective that have be thrust upon he i could have stand for the sore head the other have he foot at the threshold but he linger how much of a fortune what be the reward he strive to speak carelessly but there be a trace of eagerness in he tone you mean what _ be _ it return mr heatherbloom and name a amount large enough to make the soulful eye open and to think watchfully one little message to the shore might procure for the sender such a sum monsieur indignantly you think that i would -- then you _ be _ the wireless operator i be francois speak more calmly he excellency have have the apparatus destroy he will take no chance of other spy or detective be aboard who might understand its use the prisoner hardly hear the last word for the moment he be concern only with he disappointment a sudden hope have die almost as soon as it have be bear too bad he murmur then -- how do you get here the third officer have the key and we cabin be adjoining i seize a opportune moment slip in and take a wax impression of what i want then with a old key and a file -- monsieur be a great detective perhaps but i too with gaston boastfulness can aspire to a little cleverness a great deal say mr heatherbloom the while he brain work rapidly betty dalrymple must have pay the youth well for serve she thus far thrift as well as sentiment seem to shine from francoi ' eloquent dark eye could he be induce to espouse she cause yet further monsieur must not think i would prove disloyal to he excellency my employer speak up the youth as if read what have be pass through the other 's mind there could be no harm in a mere inquiry as to monsieur 's state of health none at all assent the prisoner quickly though -- a sudden inspiration come to mr heatherbloom -- contingency may arise when one can best serve those who employ he by secretly oppose they i do not understand monsieur say francoi cautiously the prince be a madman by incur the enmity of he imperial master he would rush on to he own destruction suppose by this misalliance the very map of europe itself be destine to be change the word sound portentous and francoi stare he have imagination the beautiful american girl have tell he that this man before he be a great and daring detective he speak now even as a emissary of the czar himself the prince be a high lord close to the throne these be deep water the youth look troubled mr heatherbloom allow the thought he have inspire to sink in what be we first port he voice more authoritative now demand francoi mention a island when do we get there we be near it to-night but on account of the rock and reef i hear the captain say we would slow down so as not to enter the harbor until daybreak daybreak and then mr heatherbloom close he eye when he again open they they reveal none of the poignant emotion that have sweep over he what time be it now about ten my jailer -- the third officer you say -- visit this cell once every night do you know what time he come i should not be here monsieur at this moment if i do not know that he come in a hour after he watch be over with the bread and water -- monsieur 's frugal fare and now -- those apprehension momentarily dull by wonderment seem return to francoi -- i will bid monsieur -- stay one moment mr heatherbloom 's accent be feverish command you must -- in the name of the czar -- for the prince 's sake -- for hers -- for -- for the reward -- monsieur again that flicker of indignation mr heatherbloom sweep it aside she have ask you to help she escape he demand swiftly francoi do not exactly deny there be no listener here it would be impossible for she to escape he answer rather sullenly then she do broach a plan -- one you refuse to accede to what be it mere madness scoffingly mademoiselle may be generous and _ mon dieu _ very persuasive but she do not get I to -- what _ be _ she proposal answer sternly you can not incriminate yourself here francoi know that the cell be remote there could be no harm in let the talk drift a little further he reply briefly outline the plan excellent observe mr heatherbloom mere madness reiterate francoi not at all but if it be some people would under the circumstance with subtle accent gladly undertake it -- just as you will he add oh will i ironically yes when you hear all i have to say in the first place i relinquish all claim to the reward sufficient for I -- and mr heatherbloom mumble something about the czar bah that sound very well only there would not be any reward retort francoi the prince would only capture we again and then -- he shrug i know he temper and have no desire for the longer voyage with old man charon -- wait more aggressively i have not do no one will suspect that you have be here to-nigh ' t he ask do monsieur think i be a fool no no and now my little errand for mademoiselle be finish -- you can do as miss dalrymple wish achieve a embarrassment of riches and run no risk whatever yourself indeed start slightly at least no appreciable one mr heatherbloom explain he plan quickly francoi listen at first with open skepticism then with grow interest _ mon dieu _ if it be possible he mutter south-of-france imagination have again be appeal to but no -- remember all the reward will be for you -- swiftly -- sufficient to buy vineyard and settle down for a life of peace and plenty -- francoi ' eye waver any frenchman would have find the picture entice already the beautiful american girl have as mr heatherbloom suspect surreptitiously thrust several valuable jewel upon the youth as a reward for this preliminary service have experience a foretaste of riches francoi perhaps secretly long for more of the glittering gem and for some of those american dollar which sound five time as large in franc besides this man the great detective or emissary inspired confidence he tone be vibrant compelling and for you monsieur -- the risk for you -- francoi falter never mind about I you consent the other swallow mutter a monosyllable in a low tone then -- heatherbloom murmur a few instruction miss dalrymple be not to know i understand say francoi quickly and go out stealthily he close and lock the door behind he chapter xx into the infinite the midnight hour draw near and above deck tranquillity reign it be however the comparative quiet that follow a storm a threatening day have culminate in a fierce tropical downpour -- a cloud-burst -- when the very heaven have seem to open the _ nevskus _ steam forward at half speed have come almost to a stop strike by the mass of water she have fairly staggered beneath the impact now she lay motionless while every shroud and line drip the darkness have become inky only the light from cabin window which lay on the wet deck like shaft of silver relieved that cimmerian effect the sea moan from the lash it have receive -- a faint undertone however that become suddenly drown by loud and harsh clangor the hammer on metal somewhere below possibly something have go wrong with a hatch or iron compartment door inadvertently leave open or one of the ventilator may have get jam and need adjust the captain as he hasten down a companionway mutter angrily beneath he breath about water in the stoke room the deck in the vicinity of the cabin seem now desert when from the shadow a figure that have merge in the general gloom step out and pass swiftly through one of the trail of light glide stealthily toward the stern this person draw near the rail and peer cautiously over look down on one of the small boat swing out in readiness for the landing party at dawn mademoiselle he breathe low be that you francoi come up softly from the boat he murmur something be all in readiness quite make haste the person above about to swing himself over the rail pause a cabin door near by have be throw open and a stream of light shoot near he some one come out moreover she -- for the some one be a woman -- do not close the door the youth crouch back try to draw himself from sight but the woman see he and come quickly forward speak she think he no doubt one of the sailor he do not answer perhaps be too frightened to do so and he silence cause she to draw nearer more sharply she start to address he in she own native russian but the word abruptly cease a sudden exclamation fall from she lip he as if make desperate by what the woman now at the rail see or divine seem imbue with extraordinary strength the success or failure of the enterprise hang on how he meet this unexpected emergency heroic if need be brutal measure be demand she outcry be stifle but sonium turgeinov be strong and resist like a tigress perhaps she think he mean to kill she and in a excess of fear she manage to call out once fortunately for the youth the hammering below continue but whether she have make herself hear or not be uncertain confront by a dire possibility he exert himself to the utmost to still that warn voice in frenzied haste he seize the heavy scarf she have throw around she shoulder upon leave the cabin and wound it about she face and head the sinuous body seem to grow limp in he arm he be not a pleasant task but a necessary one this woman have deliver the girl to the prince in the first place would now attempt to frustrate she escape any moment some one else might come on deck and discover they quick why do not you come betty dalrymple 's anxious voice ascend from the darkness the youth know well that no time must be lose but what to do he could not leave the woman she might be only feign unconsciousness and anyway they would soon find she and learn the truth that would mean they quick recapture already he think he hear a footstep descend from the bridge -- approach -- with extraordinary strength for one of francoi ' slender build he swing the figure of the woman over the side drop she into the boat and follow himself a breathless moment of suspense ensue he listen the approach footstep come on then pause and turn the other way the youth wait no longer the little boat at the side be lower softly it touch the water and float away from the _ nevskus _ like a leaf then the darkness swallow it how far be we from the yacht now francoi only a few mile mademoiselle do you think we 'll be far enough away at daybreak so they can not see we have no fear mademoiselle the voice of francoi in the stern thrill there be a fair sailing wind be not it strange -- betty dalrymple speak half to herself regard the motionless form in the bottom of the boat -- that she of all person and i should be thus thrust together in such a tiny craft on such a enormous sea i really could not help it mademoiselle -- apologetically -- bring she with we there be no alternative oh i be not criticize you who do so splendidly the girl 's eye again fall she be unconscious a long time francoi the youth 's reply be lose amid the sound of the water only the sea talk now wildly moodily fly feather of foam fleck the night the boat take the wave laboriously and come down with shrill seething she seem ludicrously minute amid that vast unrest the youth steer steadily to betty dalrymple he seem just go on anyhow dashing toward a black blanket with nothing beyond it be all very wonderful and awe-inspiring as well as somewhat fearsome the wave have a cruel sound if one listen to they closely a question float in she mind find after a long time hesitate but audible expression : do you think there be any doubt about we be able to make one of the island francoi none whatever come back the confident almost eager reply not the slightest doubt in the world mademoiselle the island be very near and we can not help see one of they at daybreak daybreak she say i wish it be here now swish swish go the sea with more menacing sound for the moment francoi steer wildly and the boat careen he bring she up sharply the girl speak no more perhaps the motion of the little craft gradually become more soothing as she accustom herself to it for before long she head droop it be dry in the bow a blanket protect she from the wind and weary with the event of the last few day she seem to rest as securely on this wave-rocked couch as a child in its cradle the youth uncertain whether she sleep or not forbear to disturb she hour go by as the night wear on a few star come out in a discourage kind of way heretofore he have be steer by the wind now that scanty peripatetic band adrift on celestial highway assist he in keep he course when one sleepy-eyed planet go in another not far away -lrb- from the human scope of survey -rrb- come out and francoi with the perspicacity of a follower of the sea seem to have learn how to gage direction by a visual game of hide-and-seek with the pin-point of infinitude between watch the star the sea and the sail he find absorb occupation for mind and muscle sometimes in the water 's depression a lull would catch they then when the wind boom again over the top of the crest slapping fiercely the canvas a brief period of hazard have to be meet the boat like a delicate live creature need a fine as well as a firm hand he faculty thus concentrate francoi have remain oblivious to the dark form in the center of the boat although long ago sonia turgeinov have first move and look up if she make any sound he whose glance pass steadily over she have not hear it she raise herself slightly sit a long time motionless a arm throw over a seat she eye alternate in direction from the sea near the downward gunwale to the almost indistinguishable figure of he in the stern the while she finger play with a scarf -- the one that have be wind around she head once she lean back she cheek against the sharp thwart she gaze heavenward she remain thus a long while with body motionless though she finger continue to toy with the bit of heavy silk as if keep pace with some mercurial rush of thought a wastrel she have be in many strange place but never before have she find herself in a situation so extraordinary to she startled outlook the boat might well have seem a chip toss on the mad foam of chaos this figure almost indistinguishable yet so steadfastly present at the stern of the little craft appear grim and ghostlike but that he be no ghost -- he grip have be real certainly that he have be too perforce a master of action she lean she head on she elbow strangely she feel no resentment the tired star as by a community of interest and common understanding slowly fade altogether the woman bent she glance bow-ward the day -- what would it reveal she understand a good deal yet much still puzzle she as through a dream she have seem to hear the name francoi -- to listen to a crystalline voice fresh as the tinkle bell in some temple at the dawn the darkness of the sky fuse into a murky gray and as that somber tone begin in turn to be replace by a lighter neutral tint she make out dimly the figure of the girl as by a species of fascination she continue to look at she while the morn unfold slowly from behind a dark promontory of vapor aurora 's warm hand now toss out a few careless ribbon they lighten the chilly-looking sea they touch a golden tress -- just one that steal out from under the gray blanket the girl 's face could not be see the heavy cover conceal the line of the lithe young form as she continue to sleep -- undisturbed by the first manifestation of the dawn -- the woman 's glance sweep backward to he at the helm the shaft of light show now he face worn and set yet strangely transfigure he do not seem to notice she beneath heavy lid he quick glance shoot this way and that to where wisp of mist on the surface of the sea partly obscure the outlook sonium turgeinov divine he purpose he be look for the _ nevskus _ but although he continue to search in the direction of the yacht he do not catch sight of she only the wind and twine diaphanous veil play where he fear she might have be visible a expression of great satisfaction pass over he feature then he sway from sheer weariness he could have drop gladly to the bottom of the boat brain as well as sinew have its limitation and the night have be long and try he have do work that call for tenseness and mental concentration every moment he have outlast diver and many period when catastrophe might have overwhelm they and now that the blackness which have shroud a thousand unseen risk and peril have be sweep aside a almost overpowering reaction claim he this natural lassitude become the more marked after he have scan the horizon in vain for the prince 's pleasure-yacht he task however be far from over and he straighten to sonium turgeinov he gaze and he expression be almost somnambulistic he continue steer guide they destiny as by force of habit luckily the breeze have wane and the boat dance more gaily than dangerously it throw little rainbow of spray in the air he blink at they he eye half close in the bow the old dun-colored blanket stir but he do not see it a glorious sun sweep up and begin to lap thirstily the waver mist from the surface of the sea sonium turgeinov speak now softly to the steersman what she say he do not know he lack-luster gaze meet hers all dislike and disapproval seem to have vanish from it he see she only as one see a face in a daguerreotype of long ago or look at feature limn by a soulless etcher do you see it he ask what tree be not those tree i see nothing you do you must they be there he speak almost roughly as if she irritated he oh yes i think i do see something she say and start like a speck -- a film -- a bird 's wing perhaps in the bow the blanket again stir then as from the dull chrysali emerge brightness and beauty so from those dun fold spring into the morning light a red-lipped lovely vision tree repeat the steersman to sonium turgeinov i be positive -- he go on but lose interest in he own word fatigue seem to fall from he in a instant he stare from beneath she golden hair betty dalrymple 's eye flash full upon he you she say mr heatherbloom appear to relapse he expression -- that smile -- vague indefinite -- again partook of the somnambulistic chapter xxi a anomalous situation the most unexpected and extraordinary thing in the world have happen yet betty dalrymple ask no question have she do so it be probable that mr heatherbloom would have be physically unequal to the labyrinthine explanation the occasion demand for a brief spell the girl have continue to regard he and she have seem about to speak further then the blue light of she gaze have slowly turn and she lip remain mute he be glad of this of course he would later have to tell something but sufficient unto that unlucky hour be the perplexity thereof sonia turgeinov have be surprise too but it be betty dalrymple 's surprise that have most awaken she wonder why do not you know it be he the dark eye seem to say to the young girl who else on earth do you think it be the mystery for she as well as for betty dalrymple deepen only for mr heatherbloom there exist no mystery it be all now clear as day he have do what he have set out to do she would soon be enable to find she way back to civilization he present concern lay with the occupation of the moment the tree _ be _ a tree this be the most momentous immediate consideration a few more mile have establish that fact with positiveness but distance on the water be long and they three would have to journey together on the sea yet a while he bethink he of he duty as host these -- he two passengers-were in he care you should find biscuit in a basket and water in a cask he say speak to both of they and at the same time to immeasurable distance if you do not mind look -- i can not very well at that a nervous laugh well from sonium turgeinov 's throat she have to give way possibly the absurd thought seize she that all the tragedy and comedy might be simmer down to one thing be there biscuit in the basket but betty dalrymple do not laugh she eye be like star on a wintry night she face be white as paper it be turn now from the steersman -- ahead she see the blur before they become a definite line of green later she make out detail the large head of small tree the former look like big overflow cabbage the trunk beneath sprawl this way and that as the vagary of the wind have direct they growth in front of they and the vernal strip a white line slowly resolve itself into move foam she -- they all could hear it now faintly -- they be very near no thunderous anthem it peal forth its voice seethe in soft cadence mr heatherbloom with sheet taut run he craft toward the sand but the boat ground some little distance from the shore it be useless to attempt to go farther so he let he sail out get up and step overboard the water be rather more than knee deep he tug at the boat and attempt to draw she up farther without much success she be too heavy and desist from he effort he approach miss dalrymple the young girl shrink back slightly but seem not to notice that first instinctive movement he reach over and lift she out it be do in a businesslike manner and with no more outward concern than a kikujus porter might have display in meet the exigency of a like situation the bubble seethe around mr heatherbloom 's leg unmindful of they or the shift sand beneath foot he stride straight as might be for the shore he burden be not a heavy one but it seem very still and unyielding he release she at the earliest possible opportunity and in the same matter-of-fact way -lrb- still that of a human ferry on the bank of the turbulent chanium -rrb- he return for he other passenger around sonium turgeinov 's rich lip a mock smile seem to play she arise at once how charming how very gallant she murmur first you nearly strangle one and then -- she soft arm steal about he neck and she warm breath sweep he cheek as stony-faced he trudge along this time he burden be heavier although there be man who would not have mind that under the circumstance the dark eye full of sparkle and enigma turn upon he frosty one but she do not see very far into that so-called medium of the soul she receive only a impression one get in look at a wall he put she down -- gently whereupon she dark brow lift ironically he gentle -- to she do she dream she feel again that fierce clasp of the night before and mentally tell herself she would like to label he a artistic study in contrast really the adventure begin to be worth while she feel almost reconcile to it he have carry she off as the rough old-fashioned pirate bear away feminine prize from a town they have loot from dog-tender to bucaneer -- he appeal to she imagination she experience a childlike desire to sit down where he have leave she and play with the shell but instead she look toward betty dalrymple that young girl however do not return she regard though the golden head a few moment before have lift once with a swift bird-like motion toward sonium turgeinov en route beachward now the girl 's feature be steadfastly bent away whatever gladness she may have feel in thus after many vicissitude reach land safely she keep to herself mr heatherbloom resume the task of porter he next burden -- the water-cask -- be the heaviest of all he struggle with it and once nearly go down so tired be he but he get it ashore and the basket of biscuit too and some other thing the boat float more lightly he now pull to the strand then he take out the spar and the sail this do he gaze around the place be desert by man though of bird and crab and other crawl object there be a-plenty mr heatherbloom stand with knit brow it be a time for contemplation visual and mental for the latter he do not feel very fit as he strive to think what be best to do next the other two -- he still force himself to keep to the purely impersonal aspect of the case -- be he charge be woman they be mutually and equally -lrb- the mockery of it -rrb- dependent on he he be responsible for they welfare and well-being in the sail-boat he have be captain ashore he become commandant a answerable factor he begin to plan what kind of place have they come to -- be it big or small -- inhabit or desert all this would have to be ascertain later meanwhile temporary headquarters be need he would erect a tent the spar and boom serve for the ridge and front pole the sail for the canvas cover the sheet and halyard for the restrain line sonium turgeinov again watch he she interest be now of that vague kind she have sometimes experience when the manager appear on a darkened stage with a fresh crackle manuscript then she have loll back and listen to the first reading she would have loll back now -- for the air be soporific -- but instead she start suddenly the old wound on mr heatherbloom 's head heretofore conceal by the cap francoi have procure for he have reopen as he exert himself he raise he hand quickly and seem a little at a loss she step to he at once the scarf monsieur thank you he take it absently it serve diver purpose she murmur and mr heatherbloom remember the more violent employment he have find for it the night before flush slightly she add delicate emphasis to she remark by assist he with she own finger she tie a knot and rather painstakingly spread out the end he endure grimly miss dalrymple appear not to have observe the episode but of course it have in reality be all quite fully reveal to she it be in keep with certain circumstance of the past that the russian woman should not be unmindful of he she confrère in the conspiracy that much be patent but other happening be not so easily reconcile what have take place on the deck of the _ nevskus _ in those breathless last few moment as they be escape be in ill conformity with those amicable relation which should have exist between the two this man 's presence in the boat in the place of francoi could be explain by no logical process with the premise she have at she command the bandage possess a subtly weird and bizarre interest for the young girl he have be injure how for what reason betty dalrymple 's mind sweep seemingly without very definite cause to another scene one of violence again she hear the crash of glass and see form leap into the cabin she thought revert on the instant to the unknown helper she have be oblige to leave behind somehow real as he have be he seem at this moment strangely apart something in the abstract then all illusive speculation merge abruptly into a realization that need no demonstration sonium turgeinov possess a certain outré attractiveness the young girl have never note before the violet eye shine through the long shade lash rest a moment on she then pass steadily beyond i be off for a look around mr heatherbloom have transfer they meager possession to the tent now address miss dalrymple or sonium turgeinov or a indefinite space between they better stay right here while i be go he tone have a firm accent sorry there be only biscuit for breakfast but perhaps there 'll be better fare before long if you should move around -- he eye linger authoritatively on betty dalrymple -- keep to the beach how very solicitous laugh sonium turgeinov as the young man stride off that be intend especially for you mademoiselle as for I it do not matter with a shrug i might stroll into the wood be devour by wild beast and who would care betty dalrymple do not answer a truce mademoiselle say the other in the same gay tone i know very well what you think of I you tell I very clearly on the _ nevskus _ and before that on shore in this instance however since it be through no fault or choice of mine that we be throw thus closely together would it not be well to make the best of the situation there seem indeed no choice in the matter answer the young girl coldly none unless like those in the admirable play we elect to pitch we respective camp at different part of the beach but that would be absurd would not it besides i have my punishment -- no light one for sonium turgeinov who herself have be accustom to a little adulation in the past i be _ de trop _ _ de trop _ there be a faint uplifting of the brow _ you _ should not be altogether that you mean i should be very friendly with he my colleague and confidant _ n'est ce pas _ sonium 's dark eye sweep swiftly the proud lovely face in truth he prove a able assistant she voice be a little mock what if i should tell you it be he who plan it all -- devise the way and mean a statue could not have be more immovable than betty dalrymple or suddenly what if i should say quite -- _ au contraire _ the girl stir sonium turgeinov seem to ruminate should i be so forgiving -- after last night she murmur it would be inconsistent would not it -- or angelic and i be no angel the girl 's lip start to form a question but she do not speak afar mr heatherbloom 's figure could be see almost at the vanish point he be toiling up a incline then the green foliage swallow he sonium turgeinov smile at vacancy though i do owe he a little she go on half meditative he _ be _ kind to I in the park he be sorry for I think of it and without admire I other man have profess for poor sonium turgeinov a little interest or solicitude at diver time and place but it have always be accompany with something else be that beyond the understanding of you pure soul nourish in a hothouse mademoiselle there be a sudden hard ring of rebellion in she tone be i handsome you eye say it not long ago _ ma foi _ she voice become light again it be parsifal himself who talk with I in the park -- that place for rendezvous and romance she thought leap over time and space the first light of the sun reveal to you this day the last face you expect to see it be as if a bit of miracle or a little diablerie have happen i too be in a haze not so great -- though on the deck the night before i little expect to encounter one i have last see in chain a prisoner -- a prisoner -- in chain -- he -- betty dalrymple stare you do not know what on earth do you expect that the prince would give he the _ suite de luxe _ after the beat he excellency receive -- the beat half-stammered the girl then the man in the salon who claim to be a detective be -- what he claim that laugh sonium turgeinov _ très drôle _ but betty dalrymple do not laugh she eye bent seaward see nothing now of the leap wave she face be fix as a cameo 's only she hair stir wind-tossed all in motion like she thought and regard she sonium turgeinov 's eye begin to harden a little do the woman regret for the moment what she have say divine again some play within a play yet what could there be in common between this beautiful heiress and the _ gardeurde chien _ no it be absurd to conceive anything of the kind nevertheless sonia turgeinov unaccountably begin to experience a vague hostility for the young girl this she might partly attribute to the great gap of convention separate they she own life in confused picture surge panorama-like before she mental vision : the garret begin the cold and hunger hardship the beating when a child the girl problem -- so hard the woman 's -- faugh what a life would that the flame of the artist have burn more brightly or not at all she try to imagine what she would have be if she too have be bear to a golden cradle a great ennui sweep over she how old she feel on a sudden and how homesick too yes that be it -- homesickness she could have stretch out she arm toward she much beloved and sometimes a little hated russium the bright dome of she native city seem to shine now in she eye she walk in spirit the stony pavement of the kremlin cruelty intolerance suffering -- all these reign in the city of extreme but she would have kiss even the cold marble at the foot of dead tyrant the way the people do if she could have stand at that moment in one of the old old sacred place she brief flight into the new world have lead she to no pot of gold at rainbow end the little honorarium from he excellency for she part in this adventure she do not want now she regret that she have ever embark upon it what penalty might she not have to pay yet the law with dragon finger would reach out -- no doubt be reach out now -- to grip she well let it a crisp matter-of-fact voice -- conceal any agitation the speaker may have feel -- break in upon these varied reflection mr heatherbloom rather out of breath but quiet and determine stand before they miss dalrymple -- mademoiselle there be no occasion for alarm but it will be necessary for we to leave here at once chapter xxii a unexpected offer to leave it be sonia turgeinov who speak you mean -- she eye turn oceanward but see nothing he make a quick gesture toward a break in the outline of the shore where the island sweep around beyond he say succinctly and she have no doubt as to he mean the tent he have put up where it could not be see from the sea but they boat -- he look at the little craft a too distinct object on the sand those on a vessel skirt the shore could not fail to discover that incriminate bit of evidence with they glass and there be no way of get rid of it he could not destroy it with he bare hand it be unsinkable if he set it adrift wind and sea would drive it straight back they probably discover we absence about daybreak and surmise correctly the direction the breeze would carry we he mutter half bitterly we must go at once these last word he speak firmly but where again it be sonia turgeinov who question he betty dalrymple remain silent she eye shine with a new inscrutable light she cheek though pale have the warmth of a live pearl she touch the sand with the tip of she shoe but he do not regard she nor do he answer sonium turgeinov go to the tent he bent over the basket of biscuit and hastily fill he pocket then throw a woman 's heavy cloak over he arm he step quickly to miss dalrymple 's side come he say laconically she foot cinderellum 's for daintiness cease its motion she turn at once around she lip a strange little smile flit but fade almost immediately save for she straightness and that proud characteristic poise of the head she might have seem at that moment of emergency a veritable griselda for acquiescence he start to walk away when -- what about I cry sonium turgeinov you can come or you can stay say mr heatherbloom the chance be that the prince will see the boat land and get you and if he do not there be plenty of biscuit and i 'll send back for you when i can that prospect be not very invite she demur suppose i elect not to risk it -- to go with you it be for you to decide and quickly he say in a cold crisp tone you dismiss my fate bruskly monsieur she return there be no time to bandy word madam he retort warmly i be not oblivious to you -- i trust i would not be to any woman -- but every minute now be precious of course a instant she look at the girl and a spark appear in the dark eye then sonia turgeinov 's feature abruptly relax and she wave she hand carelessly i have decide she say in she old manner go my best adieus monsieur -- mademoiselle with a gay courtesy farewell babe in the wood she voice be once more mock they move silently away but before they have go far enough to disappear in the forest she suddenly run toward they no no she say in a different voice i have change my mind it be such a tiny thing that boat -- in the glare and shine they might not see it and then -- she shudder how frightfully lonesome -- the terrible night -- he make a impatient gesture after I then you miss dalrymple will come last ah you think i be come because i may wish to help they sonia turgeinov say quickly i intend to take no chance he return in the same tone and the three move on he set a sharp pace if there be need for haste at all it be now at the beginning of they flight they plunge deeper into the forest no one speak only the crackle under foot and certain wood sound break the stillness unfortunately the soil be soft so that they footprint might be follow by any one verse in woodcraft at time they be force to skirt unusually thick place but in spite of these deviation mr heatherbloom be enable generally to keep to they course by consult a small compass he have find in the boat it be essential to maintain as straight a line as possible people sometimes walk round and round in forest he take no chance of that better a moment lose now and then while stop to wait for the quiver pointer to settle than return perhaps to the very spot they have leave as thus they advance often he look around to reassure himself that the young girl in spite of the roughness of the way yet follow once sonia turgeinov arrest that swift backward look she own shone with curiosity how in heaven 's name do you do it monsieur she ask suddenly draw nearer get out of that cell i mean when last i see you on the ship you be as securely fasten as a prisoner in the fortress at petersburg of course you must have have some one to help -- he answer coldly recall a promise to protect francoi he could however and do tell she the truth in this without involve the youth when the third officer my jailer come to the cell and release my hand -- well i do the best i could surprise he get the key and leave he there in my stead a little jap trick for handle man that i learn in san francisco long ago he add she dark eye linger on he not without a trace of admiration mademoiselle be fortunate indeed in she champion she murmur and yet that do not explain the preparation for departure -- the provision in the boat -- other little detail how come you by that compass for example it explain all that will be explain which mean once more you do not trust I she shrug _ eh bien _ and again they go on in silence toward noon reach a fringe of the forest they find before they a wide open space where the ground be higher and dry but the walk more difficult the grass long and tenacious twine snake-like around they ankle they have to go more slowly but reach at length the top of the eminence here mr heatherbloom stop they eat they biscuit and rest but only for a brief while scan the distance in the direction they have come he suddenly discern move form on the farthest edge of the open space -- form which advance toward they no doubt as to they purpose could be entertain he excellency have land and be already in pursuit a smolder fire leap from mr heatherbloom 's eye while rage that she should thus be drive harder fill he breast fool that he have not kill the prince when opportunity have offer that night in the cabin he clemency might -- probably would -- cost she dear we have get to go on and faster say the young man he hand be clench he arm be stiff at he side can you do it he ask betty dalrymple she answer standing in a green recess she have never appear more beautiful to he than in that moment of peril green and red thing flash behind she -- tiny feathered creature that shine like jewel the dewdrop from the branch in sunless place be glisten brilliant in the gold of she hair but he have no time to gaze the figure be draw nearer you use to be able to run betty it seem as if it be all my fault -- hoarsely -- but you 'll have to do so now again that ready response from she do she in the excitement of the moment call he by a christian name not horatio he do not take cognizance of it neither do sonium turgeinov seem to the latter speak quickly : i remain here of course say mr heatherbloom with a glance back toward the open space she overlook the significance or bitterness in he accent keep to the right she say swiftly believe I or not i 'll send they to the leave it be you only chance otherwise they would overtake you in a hour among the prince 's man be cossack train to feat of endurance you would do that he look at she quickly the dark eye do not swerve from the gray one do i betray you on the boat say sonium turgeinov rather haughtily no he concede and yet i know you you know that she affirm yes you know I slowly do i tell he excellency who you be when he have you a prisoner she demand and -- no he be oblige to say again see she take from she breast a tiny cross i have that as a child would i kiss it and -- tell you a lie in the next breath he do not answer i have live up to the letter of my contract with he excellency it be at a end perhaps i be a little sorry for my own part -- with a laugh slightly reckless -- or maybe -- with a flash of seriousness -- i have become in the least afraid you law be very severe and -- i have not count on mademoiselle 's steadfast resistance to -- _ mon dieu _ -- a prince who have be consider irresistible -- whose principality be larger than one of you state -- who would have make she in truth a czaritza i have fancy in a rush of word the mad episode might end as it do in the prince 's favorite _ fire and sword _ trilogy with wedding-bell and rejoice she pause abruptly i have also not count on the all-important possibility that mademoiselle might have bestow she heart on another -- madam it be betty dalrymple who speak quickly sonia turgeinov laugh maliciously go she say or -- almost fiercely -- i may change my mind they go sonium turgeinov turn and look out over the open space the approach figure be now much nearer chapter xxiii starlight dusk have begin to fall but still two figure go on through the forest -- slowly with obvious effort one turn often to the other hold back a branch or proffer such service as he might over rough place for betty dalrymple 's movement be no longer those of a lithe wood-nymph she have never feel so weary before the first shades of twilight make it harder to distinguish they way amid intervene object and once a elastic bit of underbrush strike she sharply in the face the blow smart like the touch of a whip but she only smile faintly the momentary sting spur she on faster until she foot catch and she stumble and would have fall except that mr heatherbloom have turn at that moment and put out a arm forgive I he voice be full of contrition it have be brutal to make you go on like this but i have to it do not matter the slender form slide from he over-quickly you too must be very tired she say with breath come fast he glance swiftly back listen we 'll rest here he command we have get to i should have stop before but -- the word come in a harsher staccato -- i dare not i 'll be all right in a few moment she answer rest on a fall log and then -- no no he say in a tone of finality after all there be small likelihood they 'll find we now besides it will soon be too dark to go on fortunately the night be warm and i have get this cloak for you and for yourself she voice be very low and quiet or perhaps it seem so because here in the little recess in the great wood the hush be most pronounced I he laugh you seem to forget i be one of the happy brotherhood that just drop down anywhere should not know what to do with a silk eiderdown if i have one he gaiety sound rather force she be silent and the quietude seem oppressive the girl lean back to a great tree trunk and look up the sky wear a ocher hue against which the branch quiver in zigzag of blackness mr heatherbloom move apart to watch but still he neither see nor hear sign of any one drawing near the sad ocher merge into a somber blue the star come out one by one then in shoal she could hardly see he now so fast have the tropical night descend but she hear he step return quite certain there be no danger he reassure she go back a way thank you she say and add : for all betty the star twinkle madly pulsate wave seem to vibrate in the air a moment he continue to stare into the darkness then again turn he have not see how the girl 's hand have suddenly close and she slender form have sway as restlessly he resume he sentinel 's duty sonium turgeinov 's last word once more recur to he how often have he think of they that long afternoon and wonder who be the one the young girl would now shortly be free to turn to there have be many in the past who have seek she favor perhaps the unknown be one of these or more likely one of the newer many that have arise no doubt since in the gayer larger world of new york or the continent betty dalrymple 's manner at the russian woman 's word indicate that the latter have -- how mr heatherbloom could not imagine -- hit upon a great kernel of truth again in fancy he see on she cheek that swift flush of warm blood lucky thrice lucky the man who have cause it softly mr heatherbloom move nearer be she sleep he himself feel too fag to sleep like psyche in the glade she be cover all with starlight he venture closer bent over the widely open eye look suddenly into he the woman tell I you have nothing to do with it -- that plot of hers and the prince she say slowly i know now why you be on the boat and -- all the rest -- what it mean for I you be there you know then -- embarrassed -- the awful mess i make of it all -- you dare a great deal she say softly and come a awful cropper she do not answer directly at first francoi be most reluctant to risk go with I she go on i think it odd at the time he should change so suddenly become so brave now i understand at least a little -- in a general way i have be over-quick to think evil of you ever since we meet again perhaps in the past too -- slowly -- i have be -- betty he cry uneasily and seem about once more to move away when -- do not go she say i 'll not talk if you command I not to you have be the master to-day you know with subtle accent have i he voice show evidence of distress i do not really mean -- it be necessary he end firmly of course it be say the girl she accent convey no note of displeasure profile-wise he see she face now -- the young moon beyond do not think i be blame you i be not quite so hard perhaps as i once be mr heatherbloom stand back a little farther in the shadow maybe my poor little standard of judgment -- she stop i have be heedless heartless perhaps -- you he exclaim you there be only unfaltering adoration in he tone -- faith unchanged and unchangeable she speak with a little catch in she voice : oh i have not care i _ do _ flirt with the prince he accuse I of that he be right what do it matter to I if i make other suffer i have not always have so good a time as i seem to -- there be a ring of passion in she tone now what happen she say turn on he swiftly what have happen i want to know all -- you mean about the prince i know all i want to know about he scornfully i mean -- she slender figure bent toward mr heatherbloom -- you what have take place and why have it what do it all mean do not you understand he draw in he breath slowly tell I she say still tensely poise she eye insistent in the shadow of she hair miss dalrymple -- betty -- he half stammer i want to know she repeat there be a inexorable demand in she gaze mr heatherbloom straighten the ordeal -- it must be meet -- though that box of pandora be best leave unopened he could not refuse she anything this she ask of he be not easy to grant however where shall i begin he say uncertainly you know a great deal there do not seem much worth talk about begin where we leave off -- we boy-and-girl engagement you break it quite right of you she stir slightly it be at best but a perfunctory business half arrange by we parent to keep the million together -- you never blame I a little then she ask i -- blame you wonderingly you be as far from I as a star what you think of I you tell I it be all right -- true stuff though it sink in like a blade i be nothing -- worse than nothing a rich man 's son -- a commonplace type a good fellow some call I at monte carlo paris elsewhere he pause a moment he seem another personality -- that other one she see it anew catch a glimpse of it like a flash on a mirror then he seem to relapse farther back into the shadow i really do not want to bear you he say perfunctorily raise a uncertain hand to the stray lock on he forehead you be not -- do that go on she eye be full of question after i see you that last time -- he nod -- you disappear no one ever hear anything of you again or know what have become of you as no one care he say with a short laugh what do it matter you be lose to the world -- have vanish completely she go on sometimes i think -- fear you be dead she voice change fear he repeat ah yes you do not want I to go out like that no she say slowly not like that he look at she comprehendingly in spite of the bitter passionate repudiation of he she have be a little in earnest -- have care in the least how he go down why he say with a forced smile i do not think you would bother to give the matter a thought you have some purpose she persist study he i see -- seem to feel it now it all -- you -- be incomprehensible i mean when i see you again that first time in new york after so long -- it be funny be not it he say with rather strained lightness the chariot of concord -- _ what be the matter with mother _ -- the gaping or jibe crowd -- then you go by -- she eyelid droop he stand now erect and motionless in spite of the determination to maintain that matter-of-fact pose vision appear momentarily in he eye the glamour of the instant he have refer to catch he all he have feel then at the unexpected sight of she -- beautiful far-away -- return to he she be near now but still immeasurably distant he pull himself together he have not explain very much yet he be force to go on she eye once more seem to draw the story from he yes i have some purpose in go away like that the idea come to I at the sanatorium when i be about ` all in ' they would manage to keep the drug and the drink from I and one day i seem to wake up and realize i have not ever really live just be a tail-ender who have ` go the pace ' have not even have a beginning be it too late to start over again probably he voice come in crisp accent but it be a last chance -- a feeble one -- a straw to the drown he laugh that sound absurd to you but i do not know how to explain it better no it do not sound absurd she say the idea of mine -- how to carry it out way and means be not hard to find i go to -- he mention a name -- a old friend of my father 's he think i be a fool bruskly but in the end he approve or seem to anyhow i persuade he to take all my bond security and the rest of -lrb- for I -rrb- curse stuff at the end of a certain time if i want back the few million i have not yet run through he be to give they to I minus commission wage etc you mean say the girl that be the way you take to go back to the beginning as you call it she eye be like star you practically give away all you money so as to start by yourself how could i start with it he ask with a faint smile do not you see betty -- in a momentary eagerness he forget himself -- there could not be any compromise besides it come to I -- you will laugh -- she do not laugh -- that some day somewhere else if not here i would have to make that begin to be something myself remember that old hindu fellow with a red turban who sit on you front lawn beneath the palm and have the woman gather around he in a kind of hypnotic state he say something like that -- i think he a old fakir at the time he use a lot of flowery language but i guess boil down it mean start at the bottom of the ladder build yourself up the way my father do with a certain wistful pride you remember he she head move fine look be not he ruminatively he get there with he hand and brain and honestly while i have not ever use either i hope he break off all this do not sound like preach no she say a instant he gaze linger on she you be sleepy now he speak suddenly no i be not you find it a little hard at first a little when a man be relax and the reaction be on he -- he stop tell I -- tell I all she breathe every bit of it harry he lip twitch to hear he almost forget name speak again by she a moment he seem to waver temptation of violet eye wonder of the rapt face oh that he might catch she in he arm claim she anew this time for all time but again he master himself and go on succinctly as quickly as possible between the line however the girl might read the record of struggle which be very real to she he have revert to the beginning with poor tool and most scanty experience and there be that other fight that make it a double fight the fiercer conflict with self hunger privation want which she might divine though he do not speak of they become as lesser detail she listen enrapt i guess that be about all he say at last she continue to look at he he feature clear-cut in the white light and you do not ever really go back -- to undo it all once i do go back to ` frisco -- he tell she of the relapse with cold candor -- out at heel and ready to give up i want the million they be go you mean lose yes he have speculate be dead poor fellow you say that and you have never try to get any of the money back fortunately he die bankrupt say mr heatherbloom calmly and you fail to show the world he be a -- thief something in the word sear she what be the use he leave a wife and child besides he really serve I by what the world would call rob I i _ have _ to continue at the begin it be the foot of the ladder all right he add she face show no answering gaiety you be go to amount to a great deal some day she say i think very few of we in this world find ourselves she add slowly perhaps some do not have to hunt so hard as other observe mr heatherbloom do not they she lip wear a odd little smile he throw back he shoulder good night now you be very tired i know she put out she hand he take it -- how soft and small and cold the seconds be throb hour he could not release it at once the little finger grow warmer -- warmer in he palm -- they very pulsation seem throb with he suddenly he drop she hand good night he say quickly he remember he be nothing to she -- that they would soon part for ever good night she answer softly then silence chapter xxiv a explanation morn come they have hear or see nothing of the prince and he man mr heatherbloom walk back for a cold plunge in a stream that have whisper not far from they camping spot throughout the night he and betty dalrymple breakfast together on a old log it be not much of a meal -- a few cracker and crumb that be leave -- but neither appear to mind the meagerness of the fare with much gaiety -lrb- the dawn seem to have bring with it a special allegrezza of its own -rrb- she insist upon a fair and equitable division of they scanty store even to the apportioning of the crumb into two equal pile then prodigal-hand for a castaway who know not where she next meal might come from she toss a bit or two to the bird and be reward by a song all this seem very wonderful to mr heatherbloom there have never before be such a breakfast compare to it the _ dejeuner à la fourchette _ of a durand or a foyot be as starvation fare it be surprising how beautiful the dark place of the night before look now daylight metamorphose the spot into a sylvan fairyland mr heatherbloom could have linger there indefinitely the soft moss woo he somewhat aweary with world contact she fill he eye the faint shadowy line beneath hers which he have note at the dawn have now vanish the same sun-god that order the forest flower to lift they gay head command the rosebud to unfold they bright petal on she cheek she lip be as red berry the cobweb behind alight with sunshine gleam no more than the toss golden hair she have strive as best she might with the last not entirely to she own satisfaction but completely to mr heatherbloom 's he untutored masculine sense rather glory in the unconventionally of a superfluous tangle or two he find she most charming with a few rent in she gown from branch or brier they seem to establish a new bond of camaraderie to make blithe appeal to he nomadic soul it be as if fate have direct she footstep until they have touch and linger on the outer circle of he vagabondage both seem to have forget all about he excellency rest query mr heatherbloom quite she answer there be no trace of weariness in she voice and you ditto he laugh then more gravely you see i fall asleep while watch he confess i be glad you would make a lenient commanding officer shall we go on where i do not exactly know he confess that be lovely then tentatively it be nice here fine he assent there be no hardness in the violet eye as they rest on he he do not pause to analyze the miracle he only accept it a moment he yield to the temptation of the lotus-eater and continue to luxuriate in the lap of arcadium then he bestir himself uneasily it be not sufficient just to breathe in the golden gladness of the moment yes it be fine he repeat only you see -- of course she say with a little sigh and rise _ i _ see you be go to be very domineering the way you be yesterday i domineering be not you she demand look at he from beneath long lash i be sure i do not intend -- he stop for she be laugh at he they go on and she mood continue to puzzle he never have he see she so blithe so gay she wave she hand back at the woodland spot good-by she say then they come upon the little town suddenly -- so suddenly that both appear bewildered only a hillock have separate they from the sight of it the night before they look and look it lay beneath a upward sweep of land in a cosy indenture of a great circle that sweep far around and away fringed with cocoanut tree small wisp or corkscrew of smoke defile the blue of the sky a wharf with a steamer at the end obtrude abruptly upon the curve of the shore mr heatherbloom regard the boat -- a link from arcadium to the mundane world he should have be glad but he do not seem overwhelm at the sight he stand very still he hardly feel she hand on he sleeve the girl 's eye be full of sparkle what luck he say at length he voice low and somewhat more formal be not it she answer and draw in she breath -- i can scarcely believe it it be there all right he speak slowly come and they go down a color worker in the field stare at they but betty nod gaily and ask what town it be and the name of the island he tell they grow wonderment in he gaze how could they be here and not know that where have they come from to he they be as mysterious as two visitant from mar regardless of the effect they produce on the dusky toiler they walk on the island prove to be larger than they have think and commercially important they have the day before but cross a neck of it soon now they reach the verge of the town and stand on its main artery of traffic the cobblestone pavement resound with the rattle of cart and rough native vehicle at a curb stand a dilapidated public conveyance to which be attach a horse of harmoniously antique aspect miss dalrymple get in and mr heatherbloom take he place at she side the cable office say the girl briefly whereupon a lad of mixed ancestry begin to whack energetically the protuberant rib of the drowsy steed it wake he and they clatter down the narrow way mr heatherbloom lean back he gaze straight ahead but betty dalrymple look around with interest at the people of diver shades and hue and for the most part in costume of vary degree of picturesque originality after have narrowly escape run over a small proportion of the juvenile color population overflow from odd little shop and house they reach the transportable zinc shed that serve as a cable office here miss dalrymple indite rapidly a most voluminous message pay the clerk in a businesslike manner and unmindful of he amaze expression as he read what she have write tranquilly re-enter the carriage miss van rolsen will be relieve when she get that observe mr heatherbloom mechanically it 'll be a happy moment for she meditatively and will not she be gladder still when she see we answer the girl gaily the use of the plural slightly disconcerted mr heatherbloom for the moment but he dismiss it as a inadvertence where now he ask where do you think with dancing eye shopping of course fortunately i draw plenty of money before start for californium a hour or so later mr heatherbloom sit with parcel in he arm and bundle galore around he he accept the situation gracefully indeed display a almost tender solicitude for those especial package she herself hand he what next she have at length exhaust the somewhat limited resource of the thoroughfare drive to the best hotel be she command she laugh at the picture he make or at something in she own thought she have unconsciously assume toward he a manner in the least proprietary but if he notice he do not resent it they go faster she voice be a low thread of music run through a accompaniment of crash dissonance she wear a hat now -- the best she could find he consider it most fetch but she thrilling derision overwhelm he expression of opinion though the way be so rough that they be occasionally throw rather violently one against another they arrive in high spirit at they destination mr heatherbloom have perform the commendable feat of preserve intact the parcel and bundle en route in the best hotel they be give two room overlook a courtyard redolent with orchid the girl nod a brief farewell to he from the threshold of she room in about a hour please come back he do brush up and with shoe shine as presentable as possible she wear the same gown but the sundry rent be mend and there have occur other change he could divine rather than define he bring she information -- not agreeable he say he be very sorry but the next boat for the united state would not call at the island for a fortnight he expect she to show dismay but she receive the news with commendable fortitude if not resignation i can cable aunt every day -- so there can be no cause for worry -- and she will only be the more pleased when we actually do arrive again the plural and once more that prophetic picture which include mr heatherbloom within the pale of the venerable and austere miss van rolsen 's jubilation he look embarrassed but say nothing during the hour of he exclusion from miss dalrymple 's company he have sally forth on a small but necessary financial errand of he own francoi have place in the basket of biscuit a revolver and this latter mr heatherbloom rightfully construe it as he own personal property in lieu of the weapon he excellency have deprive he of have exchange for a bit of cardboard and a greenback the last name reinforce by the small amount mr heatherbloom have leave upon reach the _ nevskus _ and of which the prince have not deprive he would relieve he necessity for the moment after that well he would take up the problem presently he have no time for it now this day at least should be consecrate to betty dalrymple he have a inkling that on the morrow he would see less of she the girl 's story would get around the american consul would call and tender he service the governor too sir charle somebody whose palatial residence look down on the town from the side of the hill might be expect to become officially and paternally interested the little cable office despite rule and regulation could not long retain its prodigious secret moreover mr heatherbloom in a absent-minded moment have inscribe miss dalrymple 's name on the register or visitor ' book he recall how the eye of the old mammy the proprietress have fairly roll with curiosity no he would not be permit long to have she to himself he ruminate better make the most of he opportunity now besides he present monetary position forbid he presence for more than a day or two at the best hotel its rate be for he distinctly prohibitive the exigency of financial difference would soon separate they she could draw on miss van rolsen for thousand he have but five dollar and twelve cent -- or be it thirteen -- to he name he keep these reflection however to himself and continue to bask in the sunshine of a fool 's paradise they ride walk and explore they go to the fruit and the flower market he buy she a great bunch of flower and she not only take it but wear it for a time he step on air he flower constitute a fine splash of color on the girl 's gown she heart beat beneath they the thought be as wine shall we they have partake of tea -lrb- or nectar -rrb- in a small shop and now she pause before that most modern manifestation of a restless civilization a begilded over-ornamented nickelodeon think of find one of they way off here just as at home more extraordinary you want to go in he laugh why not it will be a experience they enter the place be half fill and they take seat toward the back there be film and song of the usual character it be very gay gurgle of merriment from creole and darky be hear on all side they too yield freely gladly to its infection happy creole happy darky happy betty dalrymple and horatio heatherbloom -- heiress and outcast there be a democracy in laughter yon darky smile at miss dalrymple while mr heatherbloom laugh with she with they and the world for be she not near right there by he side to mr heatherbloom the tinsel palace have become a temple of felicity and wonder suddenly he start and he face change the great diamond robbery one of the film be in progress and there depict on the canvas amid many figure he see himself the most pronounced in that realistic group and betty dalrymple see the semblance of he also for she give a slight gasp and sit more erect in the move picture he be run away from a crowd shall -- shall we go the face of the flesh-and-blood mr heatherbloom be very red he look toward the door she do not answer she eye continue bent straight before she and she see the whole quick scene of the drama unfold then the street become clear the flee figure have turn a corner as a automobile not engage for the performance come around it and go by a big car -- she own -- she be in it she catch like a flash on the canvas a glimpse of herself look around then the scene come to a end betty dalrymple laugh -- a little hysterically oh she say oh oh he become if possible redder oh she repeat then why -- with eye full of mingled tragedy and comedy -- do you not explain it all that day when -- of course she know even as she speak why he could not or would not you have cause to think so many thing he murmur but that how -- how strange i see you and -- he laugh and the manager tell I i be a ` rotten bad ' actor those be he word not very elegant but i believe he until now -- say something harsh and hard to I she whisper almost fiercely i deserve it the violet eye be passionate betty he exclaim wonderingly do you call that harsh she demand mockingly you -- you should be cross with I -- scold I -- punish I -- well he say calmly you have not believe _ that _ lately anyhow no i just set it aside as something incomprehensible not to be think of or to be consider any more i believe in you with all my soul since last night -- a good deal before that yes yes -- in my innermost heart you believe I do not you he answer he hardly know what some one be singing _ put on you old gray bonnet _ she shoulder touch he arm and linger there oh my dear she be say to herself the pianist bang the vocalist bawl while mr heatherbloom sit in ecstasy chapter xxv gaiety they take she away the next day the governor -- sir charle somebody -- have hear of she and come and claim she he lady -- portly majestic -- arrive with he they carriage be the finest on the island and they horse be the best the coachman and footman be cover with the most approved paraphernalia and always constitute a unending source of wonder and admiration for the native the latter gather in front of the best hotel on this occasion they do not quite know what be take place but the sight of the big carriage there draw they about like fly mr heatherbloom do not linger to speculate or to survey he have see but not speak to miss dalrymple that morning she have smile at he across space behind orchid a moment or two he have sit dream how fine it would be to live for ever in such a courtyard with betty dalrymple 's face on the other side then the hubbub below disturbed and dispel he reflection he go down to investigate and to retreat sir charle and he lady be in the hall they seem to charge the entire hostelry with they presence mr heatherbloom walk contemplatively out and down the street he mind with a little encouragement would have flit back to courtyard and orchid but he force it along less fanciful line mundane consideration be imperative and courtyard be a luxury of the rich he calculate that after pay he bill at the best hotel he would not have much more than half a dollar or two english shilling leave the situation demand calm practical reflection he strive to bestow upon it the necessary measure of orderly thinking yesterday with its nickelodeon or temple of wonder be yesterday to-day with its problem be to-day he have linger in the happy valley or kingdom of micomicon but the carriage be before the door -- the golden chariot have come to bear away the beautiful princess mr heatherbloom ask for employment at the wharf and get it the supercargo of the boat load there have be indulge not wisely but too well in green swizzle a insidious drink of the country and when last see be oblivious to the world a red-haired mate with superfluous utterance inform the applicant he could come that afternoon and temporarily essay the delinquent one 's duty check up the bag of merchandise and banana the native be bring aboard and otherwise make himself useful mr heatherbloom tender he thanks and depart he wander aimlessly for a while but the charm of the town have vanish he
