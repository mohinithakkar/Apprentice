produce by juliet sutherland marium cecilium lim and the online distribute proofread team northern trail book i by william j long _ wood folk series book vi _ 1905 preface in the original preface to northern trail the author state that with the solitary exception of the salmon 's life in the sea after he vanish from human sight every incident record here be found squarely upon personal and accurate observation of animal life and habit i now repeat and emphasize that statement even when the observation be for the reader 's sake put into the form of a connected story there be not one trait or habit mention which be not true to animal life such a statement ought to be enough especially as i have repeatedly furnish evidence from reliable eye-witness to support every observation that the critic have challenge but of late a strenuous public attack have be make upon the wolf story in this volume by two man claim to speak with authority they take radical exception to my record of a big white wolf kill a young caribou by snap at the chest and heart they declare this method of kill to be a mathematical impossibility and by inference a gross falsehood utterly ruinous to true idea of wolf and of natural history as no fact or proof be give to support this charge the first thing which a sensible man naturally do be to examine the fitness of the critic in order to ascertain upon what knowledge or experience they base they dogmatic statement one of these critic be a man who have no personal knowledge of wolf or caribou who assert that the animal have no possibility of reason or intelligence and who have for year publicly deny the observation of other man which tend to disprove he ancient theory it seem hardly worth while to argue about either wolf or man with such a naturalist or to point out that descarte ' idea of animal as purely mechanical or automatic creature have long since be lay aside and be never consider seriously by any man who have live close to either wild or domestic animal the second critic 's knowledge of wolf consist almost entirely of what he have happen to see when chase the creature with dog and hunter judge by he own nature book with they barbaric record of slaughter he experience of wild animal be gain while kill they such a man will undoubtedly discover some thing about animal how they fight and hide and escape they human enemy but it hardly need any argument to show that the man who go into the wood with dog and rifle and the desire to kill can never understand any living animal if you examine now any of the little book which he condemn you will find a totally different story : no record of chasing and killing but only of patient watching of creep near to wild animal and win they confidence whenever it be possible of follow they day and night with no motive but the pure love of the thing and no object but to see exactly what each animal be do and to understand so far as a man can the mystery of its dumb life naturally a man in this attitude will see many trait of animal life which be hide from the game-killer as well as from the scientific collector of skin for instance practically all wild animal be shy and timid and run away at man 's approach this be the general experience not only of hunter but of casual observer in the wood yet my own experience have many time show I exactly the opposite trait : that when these same shy animal find I unexpectedly close at hand more than half the time they show no fear whatever but only a eager curiosity to know who and what the creature be that sit so quietly near they sometimes indeed they seem almost to understand the mental attitude which have no thought of harm but only of sympathy and friendly interest once i be follow for hour by a young wolf which act precisely like a lose dog too timid to approach and too curious or lonely to run away he even wag he tail when i call to he softly have i shoot he on sight i would probably have foolishly believe that he intend to attack I when he come trot along my trail three separate time i have touch a wild deer with my hand once i touch a moose once a eagle once a bear and a score of time at least i have have to frighten these big animal or get out of they way when they curiosity bring they too near for perfect comfort so much for the personal element for the general attitude and fitness of the observer and he critic but the question be not chiefly a personal one it be simply a matter of truth and observation and the only honest or scientific method be first to go straight to nature and find out the fact and then -- lest you own eyesight or judgment be at fault -- to consult other observer to find if perchance they also have see the fact exemplify this be not so easy as to dogmatize or to write animal story but it be the only safe method and one which the nature writer as well as the scientist must follow if he work be to endure follow this good method when the critic have proclaim that my record of a big wolf kill a young caribou by bite into the chest and heart be a impossibility i go straight to the big wood and as soon as the law allow secure photograph and exact measurement of the first full-grown deer that cross my trail these photograph and measurement show beyond any possibility of honest doubt the follow fact : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the lower chest of a deer between and just behind the foreleg be thin and wedge-shaped exactly as i state and the point of the heart be well down in this narrow wedge the distance through the chest and point of the heart from side to side be in this case exactly four and one-half inch a man 's hand as show in the photograph can easily grasp the whole lower chest of a deer place thumb and forefinger over the heart on opposite side -lrb- 2 -rrb- the heart of a deer and indeed of all ruminant animal lie close against the chest wall and be easily reach and wound the chest cartilage except in a old deer be soft the rib be thin and easily crushed and the space between the rib be wide enough to admit a man 's finger to say nothing of a wolf 's fang in this case the point of the heart as the deer lay on he side be barely five eight of a inch from the surface -lrb- 3 -rrb- any dog or wolf therefore have a spread of jaw of four and one-half inch and fang three quarter of a inch long could easily grasp the chest of this deer from beneath and reach the heart from either side as the jaw of the big northern wolf spread from six to eight inch and he fang be over a inch long to kill a deer in this way would require but a slight effort the chest of a caribou be anatomically exactly like that of other deer only the caribou fawn and yearling of northern trail have smaller chest than the animal i measure so much for the fact and the possibility as for specific instance year ago i find a deer just kill in the snow and beside he the fresh track of a big wolf which have probably be frighten away at my approach the deer be bite just behind and beneath the left shoulder and one long fang have enter the heart there be not another scratch on the body so far as i could discover i think this very exceptional at the time but year afterwards my indian guide in the interior of newfoundland assure I that it be a common habit of kill caribou among the big white wolf with which he be familiar to show that the peculiar habit be not confine to any one section i quote here from the swear statement of three other eyewitness the first be superintendent of the algonquin national park a man who have spend a lifetime in the north wood and who have at present a excellent opportunity for observe wild-animal habit the second be a educate sioux indian the third be a geologist and mining engineer now practice he profession in philadelphium algonquin park ontario August 31 1907 this certify that during the past thirty year spend in we canadian wild i have see several animal kill by we large timber wolf in the winter of 1903 i see two deer thus kill on smoke lake nipiss ontario one deer be bite through the front chest the other just behind the foreleg in each case there be no other wound on the body -lrb- sign -rrb- gw bartlett _ superintendent _ i certify that i live for twenty year in northern nebraska and dakota in a region where timber wolf be abundant i see one horse that have just be kill by a wolf the front of he chest be tear open to the heart there be no other wound on the body i once watch a wolf kill a stray horse on the open prairie he keep nip at the hind leg make the horse turn rapidly till he grow dizzy and fall down then the wolf snap or bit into he chest the horse die in a few moment -lrb- sign -rrb- stephen jone -lrb- hepidan -rrb- i certify that in November 1900 while survey in wyome my party see two wolf chase a two-year-old colt over a cliff some fifteen or sixteen foot high i be on the spot with two other immediately after the incident occur the only injury to the colt aside from a broken leg be deep laceration make by wolf fang in the chest behind the foreshoulder in addition to this personal observation i have frequently hear from hunter herder and cowboy that big wolf frequently kill deer and other animal by snap at the chest -lrb- sign -rrb- f pusey i have more evidence of the same kind from the region which i describe in northern trail but i give these three simply to show that what one man discover as a surprising trait of some individual wolf or deer may be common enough when we open we eye to see the fact that wolf do not always or often kill in this way have nothing to do with the question i know one small region where old wolf generally hunt in pair and so far as i can discover one wolf always trip or throw the game while the other invariably do the killing at the throat in another region include a part of algonquin park in ontario i have the record of several deer kill by wolf in a single winter and in every case the wolf slip up behind he game and cut the femoral artery or the inner side of the hind leg and then draw back quietly allow the deer to bleed to death the point be that because a thing be unusual or interesting it be not necessarily false as my dogmatic critic would have you believe i have study animal not as species but as individual and have record some thing which other and better naturalist have overlook but i have seek for fact first of all as zealously as any biologist and have record only what i have every reason to believe be true that these fact be unusual means simply that we have at last find natural history to be interesting just as the discovery of unusual man and incident give charm and mean to the record of we humanity there may be honest error or mistake in these book -- and no one try half so hard as the author to find and correct they -- but meanwhile the fact remain that though six volume of the wood folk book have already be publish only three slight error have thus far be point out and these be promptly and gratefully acknowledge the simple truth be that these observation of mine though they be all true do not tell more than a small fraction of the interesting thing that wild animal do continually in they native state when they be not frighten by dog and hunter or when we be not blind by we preconceived notion in watch they i have no doubt that romance be rife just now on the part of man who study animal in a library but personally with my note-book full of incident which i have never yet record i find the truth more interesting and i can not understand why a man should deliberately choose romance when he can have the greater joy of go into the wilderness to see with he own eye and to understand with he own heart just how the animal live one thing seem to I to be more and more certain : that we be only just begin to understand wild animal and it be chiefly we own barbarism we lust of kill we stupid stuff specimen and especially we prejudice which stand in the way of greater knowledge meanwhile the critic who assert dogmatically what a wild animal will or will not do under certain condition only prove how carelessly he have watch they and how little he have learn of nature 's infinite variety william j long stamford connecticut contents wayeese the strong one the old wolf 's challenge where the trail begin noel and mooka the way of the wolf the white wolf 's hunting trail that cross in the snow glossary of indian name full-page illustration a quick snap where the heart lay the terrible howl of a great white wolf watch she grow youngster as the mother 's long jaw close over the small of the back the silent appalling death-watch begin wayeese the strong one _ the old wolf 's challenge _ we be beat up the strait to the labrador when a great gale swoop down on we and drive we like a scared wild duck into a cleft in the mountain where the breaker roar and the seal bark on the black rock and the reef bare they tooth on either side like the long jaw of a wolf to snap at we as we pass in we flight we have pick up a fisherman -- snatch he out of he helpless punt as we luff in a smother of spray and drag he aboard like a enormous frog at the end of the jib sheet -- and it be he who now stand at the wheel of we little schooner and take she careen in through the tickle of harbor woe there in a desolate rock-bound refuge on the newfoundland coast the _ wild duck _ swing to she anchor veer nervously in the tide rip tug impatiently and clank she chain as if eager to be out again in the turmoil at sunset the gale blow itself out and presently the moon wheel full and clear over the dark mountain noel my big indian be curl up asleep in a caribou skin by the foremast and the crew be all below asleep every man glad in he heart to be once more safe in a snug harbor all about we stretch the desolate waste of sea and mountain over which silence and darkness brood as over the first great chaos near at hand be the black rock eternally wet and smoking with the fog and gale beyond tower the iceberg pale cold glitter like spire of silver in the moonlight far away like a vague shadow a handful of little gray house cling like barnacle to the base of a great bare hill whose foot be in the sea and whose head waver among the cloud of heaven not a light shone not a sound or a sign of life come from these little house whose shell close daily at twilight over the life within weary with the day 's work only the dog be restless -- those strange creature that shelter in we house and share we bread yet live in another world a dumb silent lonely world shut out from ours by impassable barrier for hour these uncanny dog have puzzle I a score of vicious hungry brute that draw the sledge in winter and that pick up a vagabond living in the idle summer by hunting rabbit and raiding the fisherman 's flake and pig-pen and by catch flounder in the sea as the tide ebb venture among they with fear in you heart and they would fly at you leg and throat like wild beast but twirl a big stick jauntily or better still go quietly on you way without concern and they would skulk aside and watch you hungrily out of the corner of they surly eye whose lid be red and bloodshot as a mastiff 's when the moon rise i notice they flit about like witch on the lonely shore mile away from the hamlet now sit on they tail in a solemn circle now howl all together as if demented and anon listen intently in the vast silence as if they hear or smell or perhaps just feel the presence of some unknown thing that be hide from human sens and when i paddle ashore to watch they one run swiftly past without heed I he nose outstretch he eye green as foxfire in the moonlight while the other vanish like shadow among the black rock each intent on he unknown quest that be why i have come up from my warm bunk at midnight to sit alone on the taffrail listen in the keen air to the howl that make I shiver spite of myself and watch in the vague moonlight to understand if possible what the brute feel amid the primal silence and desolation a long interval of profound stillness have pass and i could just make out the circle of dog sit on they tail on the open shore when suddenly faint and far away a unearthly howl come roll down the mountain _ ooooooo-ow-wow-wow _ a long wail crescendo beginning softly like a sound in a dream and swell into a roar that wake the sleep echo and set they jump like startled goat from crag to crag instantly the husky answer every clog break out into indescribable frenzied wailing as a collie respond in agony to certain chord of music that stir all the old wolf nature sleep within he for five minute the uproar be appalling then it cease abruptly and the husky run wildly here and there among the rock from far away a answer a echo perhaps of they wail or it may be the cry of the dog of st margaret 's come ululate over the deep then silence again vast and unnatural settling over the gloomy land like a winding-sheet as the unknown howl tremble faintly in the air noel who have sleep undisturbed through all the clamor of the dog stir uneasily by the foremast as it deepen and swell into a roar that fill all the night he throw off the caribou skin and come aft to where i be watch alone das wayeeses i know dat hwulf he follow I one time oh long long while ago he whisper and take my marine glass he stand beside I watch intently -lrb- illustration : the terrible howl of the great white wolf -rrb- there be another long period of wait we eye grow weary fill as they be with shadow and uncertainty in the moonlight and we turn we ear to the hill wait with strained silent expectancy for the challenge suddenly noel pointed upward and my eye catch something move swiftly on the crest of the mountain a shadow with the slink trot of a wolf glide along the ridge between we and the moon just in front of we it stop leap upon a big rock turn a pointed nose up to the sky sharp and clear as a fir top in the moonlight and -- _ ooooooo-ow-wow-wow _ the terrible howl of a great white wolf tumble down on the husky dog and set they howl as if possess no doubt now of they queer action which have puzzle I for hour past the wild wolf have call and the tame wolf wake to answer before my dull ear have hear a rumor of it they be crazy with the excitement now every chord in they wild heart be twang its thrilling answer to the leader 's summons and my own heart awake and thrill as it never do before to the call of a wild beast for a hour or more the old wolf sit there challenge he degenerate mate in every silence call the tame to be wild the bind to be free again and listen gravely to the wail answer of the dog which refuse with groaning as if drag themselves away from overmaster temptation then the shadow vanish from the big rock on the mountain the husky flee away wildly from the shore and only the sob of the breaker break the stillness that be my first -lrb- and noel 's last -rrb- shadowy glimpse of wayeese the huge white wolf which i have come a thousand mile over land and sea to study all over the long range of the northern peninsula i follow he guide sometimes by a rumor -- a hunter 's story or a postman 's fright catch far inland in winter and huddle close by he fire with he dog through the long winter night -- and again by a track on the shore of some lonely unnamed pond or the sight of a herd of caribou fly wildly from some unseen danger here be the white wolf 's story learn partly from much watching and follow he track alone but more from noel the indian hunter in endless tramp over the hill and caribou marsh and in long quiet talk in the firelight beside the salmon river _ where the trail begin _ from a cave in the rock on the unnamed mountain that tower over harbor weal on the north and east a huge mother wolf appear stealthily as all wolf come out of they den a pair of green eye glow steadily like coal deep within the dark entrance a massive gray head rest unseen against the lichen of a gray rock then the whole gaunt body glide like a pass cloud shadow into the June sunshine and be lose in a cleft of the rock there in the deep shadow where no eye might notice the movement the old wolf shake off the delicious sleepiness that still linger in all she big muscle first she spread she slender fore paw work the toe till they be all wide-awake and bent she body at the shoulder till she deep chest touch the earth next a hind leg stretch out straight and tense as a bar and be take back again in nervous little jerk at the same time she yawn mightily wrinkle she nose and show she red gum with the black fringe and the long white fang that could reach a deer 's heart in a single snap then she leap upon a great rock and sit up straight with she bushy tail curl close about she fore paw a savage powerful noble-looking beast peer down gravely over the green mountain to the shine sea a moment before the hillside have appear utterly lifeless so still and rugged and desolate that one must notice and welcome the stir of a mouse or ground squirrel in the moss speaking of life that be glad and free and vigorous even in the deepest solitude yet now so quietly do the old wolf appear so perfectly do she rough gray coat blend with the rough gray rock that the hillside seem just as tenantless as before a stray wind seem to move the moss that be all only where the mountain once sleep now they seem wide-awake keen eye see every move thing from the bee in the bluebell to the slow fishing-boat far out at sea sharp ear that be cock like a collie 's hear every chirp and trill and rustle and a nose that understand everything be hold up every vagrant breeze and search it for its message for the cub be come out for the first time to play in the big world and no wild mother ever let that happen without first take infinite precaution that she little one be not molest nor make afraid a faint breeze from the west stray over the mountain and instantly the old wolf turn she sensitive nose to question it there on she right and just across a deep ravine where a torrent go leap down to the sea in hundred-foot jump a great stag caribou be stand still as a stone on a lofty pinnacle look down over the marvelous panorama spread wide beneath he foot every day megaleep come there to look and the old wolf in she daily hunt often cross the deep path which he have wear through the moss from the wide table-land over the ridge to this sightly place where he could look down curiously at the coming and going of man on the sea but at this season when small game be abundant -- and indeed at all season when not hunger-driven -- the wolf be peaceable and the caribou be not molest indeed the big stag know well where the old wolf den every east wind bring she message to he nostril but secure in he own strength and in the general peace which prevail in the summer-time among all large animal of the north he come daily to look down on the harbor and wag he ear at the fishing-boat which he could never understand strange neighbor these the grim savage mother wolf of the mountain hide she young in den of the rock and the wary magnificent wanderer of the broad caribou barren but they understand each other and neither wolf nor caribou have any fear or hostile intent one for the other and this be not strange at all as might be suppose by those who think animal be govern by fear on one hand and savage cruelty on the other but be one of the commonest thing to be find by those who follow faithfully the northern trail wayeese have choose she den well on the edge of the untrodden solitude -- sixty mile as the crow fly -- that stretch northward from harbor weal to harbor woe it be just under the ridge in a sunny hollow among the rock on the southern slope of the great mountain the earliest sunshine find the place and warm it bring forth the bluebell for a carpet while in every dark hollow the snow linger all summer long make dazzling white patch on the mountain and under the high waterfall that look from the harbor like bit of silver ribbon stretch over the green wood the ice cling to the rock in fantastic knob and gargoyle make cold deep pool for the trout to play in so it be both cool and warm there and whatever the weather the gaunt old mother wolf could always find just the right spot to sleep away the afternoon best of all it be perfectly safe for though from the door of she den she could look down on the old indian 's cabin like a pebble on the shore so steep be the billow hill and so impassable the ravine that no human foot ever tread the place not even in autumn when the fisherman leave they boat at anchor in harbor weal and camp inland on the path of the big caribou herd whether or not the father wolf ever know where he cub be hide only he himself could tell he be a enormous brute powerful and cunning beyond measure that haunt the lonely thicket and pond border the great caribou barren over the ridge and that keep a silent watch within howl distance over the den which he never see sometimes the mother wolf meet he on she wanderings and they hunt together often he bring the game he have catch a fox or a young goose and sometimes when she have hunt in vain he meet she as if he have understand she need from a distance and lead she to where he have bury two or three of the rabbit that swarm in the thicket but spite of the attention and the indifferent watch which he keep he never venture near the den which he could have find easily enough by follow the mother 's track the old she-wolf would have fly at he throat like a fury have he show he head over the top of the ridge the reason for this be simple enough to the savage old mother though there be some thing about it that man do not yet understand wolf like cat and fox and indeed like most wild male animal have a atrocious way of kill they own young when they find they unprotected so the mother animal search out a den by herself and rarely allow the male to come near it spite of this beastly habit it must be say honestly of the old he-wolf that he show a marvelous gentleness towards he mate he run at the slightest show of tooth from a mother wolf half he size and will stand meekly a snap of the jaw or a cruel gash of the terrible fang in he flank without defend himself even we hound seem to have inherit something of this primitive wolf trait for there be season when unless urge on by man they will not trouble a mother wolf or fox many time in the early spring when fox be mate and again later when they be heavy with young and incapable of a hard run i have catch my hound trot meekly after a mother fox sniff she trail indifferently and sit down with head turn aside when she stop for a moment to watch and yap at they disdainfully and when you call they they come shamefaced though in winter-time when run the same fox to death they pay no more heed to you call than to the crow clamor over they but we must return to wayeese sit over she den on a great gray rock try every breeze search every movement hark to every chirp and rustle before bring she cub out into the world satisfy at last with she silent investigation she turn she head towards the den there be no sound only one of those silent unknown communication that pass between animal instantly there be a scratch scurry whining and three cub tumble out of the dark hole in the rock with fuzzy yellow fur and bright eye and sharp ear and nose like collie all blinking and wonder and suddenly silent at the big bright world which they have never see before so different from the dark den under the rock indeed it be a marvelous world that the little cub look upon when they come out to blink and wonder in the June sunshine contrast everywhere that make the world seem too big for one little glance to comprehend it all here the sunlight stream and dance and quiver on the warm rock there deep purple cloud shadow rest for hour as if asleep or sweep over the mountain side in a endless game of fox-and-geese with the sunbeam here the bird trill the bee hum in the bluebell the brook roar and sing on its way to the sea while over all the harmony of the world brood a silence too great to be disturb sunlight and shadow snow and ice gloomy ravine and dazzling mountain top mayflower and singing bird and rustling wind fill all the earth with color and movement and melody from under they very foot great mass of rock toss and tumble as by a giant 's play stretch downward to where the green wood begin and roll in vast billow to the harbor which shine and sparkle in the sun yet seem no bigger than they mother 's paw fishing-boat with shine sail hover over it like dragon-fly go and come from the little house that sheltered together under the opposite mountain like a cluster of gray toadstool by a towering pine stump most wonderful most interesting of all be the little gray hut on the shore almost under they foot where little noel and the indian child play with the tide like fiddler crab or push bravely out to meet the fisherman in a bob nutshell for wolf cub be like collie in this that they seem to have a natural interest perhaps a natural kinship with man and next to they own kind nothing arouse they interest like a group of child play so the little cub take they first glimpse of the big world of mountain and sea and sunshine and child play on the shore and the world be altogether too wonderful for little head to comprehend nevertheless one plain impression remain the same that you see in the ear and nose and stumbling foot and wag tail of every puppy-dog you meet on the street that this bright world be a famous place just make a-purpose for little one to play in sit on they tail in a solemn row the wolf cub bent they head and point they nose gravely at the sea there it be all silver and blue and boundless with tiny white sail dance over it wink and flash like entangled bit of sunshine and since the eye of a cub like those of a little child can not judge distance one stretch a paw at the nearest sail mile away to turn it over and make it go the other way they turn up they head sidewise and blink at the sky all blue and calm and infinite with white cloud sail over it like swan on a limpid lake and one stand up on he hind leg and reach up both paw like a kitten to pull down a cloud to play with then the wind stir a feather near they the white feather of a ptarmigan which they have eat yesterday and forget the big world and the sail and the cloud the cub take to play with the feather chasing and worry and tumble over each other while the gaunt old mother wolf look down from she rock and watch and be satisfied _ noel and mooka _ down on the shore that same bright June afternoon little noel and he sister mooka be go on wonderful sledge journey meet wolf and polar bear and caribou and all sort of adventure more wonderful by far than any that ever come to imagination astride of a rocking-horse they have a rare team of dog caesar and wolf and grouch and the rest -- five or six uneasy crab which they have catch and harness to a tiny sledge make from a curved root and a shingle tie together with a bit of sea-kelp and when the crab scurry away over the hard sand wave they claw wildly noel and mooka would caper alongside crack a little whip and cry hi hi caesar hiya wolf hi hiya hiya yeeee -- and then shriek with laughter as the sledge overturn and the crab take to fight and scratch in the tangled harness just like the husky dog in winter mooka be try to untangle they dance about to keep she bare toe and finger away from the nipping claw when she jump up with a yell the biggest crab hang to the end of she finger owee oweeeee caesar bit I she wail then she stop with finger in she mouth while caesar scramble headlong into the tide for noel be stand on the beach point at a brown sail far down in the deep bay where southeast brook come singing from the green wilderness ohé mooka there be father and old tomah come back from salmon fishing let 's go meet um little brother say mooka she black eye dancing and in a wink crab and sledge be forget the old punt be off in a shake the tattered sail up skipper noel lounge in the stern like a old salt with the steer oar while the crew forget she nipped finger tug valiantly at the main-sheet they be scoot away gloriously rise and pound the wave when mooka who do not have to steer and whose restless glance be rove over every bay and hillside jump up she eye round as lynx 's look noel look there be megaleep again watch we and noel follow she finger see far up on the mountain a stag caribou small and fine and clear as a cameo against the blue sky where they have so often notice he with wonder watch they as they come shout home with the tide instantly noel throw himself against the steer oar the punt come up flounder and shake in the wind come on little sister we can go up fox brook tomah show I trail and forget the salmon as they have a moment before forget the crab and sledge these two child of the wild follow every breeze and bird call and blossom bluebell and shine star alike tumble ashore and go hurry up the brook splash through the shallows dart like kingfisher over the point and jump like wild goat from rock to rock in a hour they be far up the mountain lie side by side on a great flat rock look across a deep impassable valley and over two round hilltop where the scrub spruce look like pin on a cushion to the bare rugged hillside where megaleep stand out like a watchman against the blue sky do he see we little brother whisper mooka quiver with excitement and panting from the rapid climb see we sartin little sister but that only make he want peek um some more say the little hunter and raise carelessly on he elbow he be tell mooka how megaleep the caribou trust only he nose and how he watch and play peekaboo with anything which he could not smell and how in a snowstorm -- noel be off now like a brook babble a deal of caribou lore which he have learn from old tomah the hunter when mooka whose restless black eye be always wander seize he arm hush brother and look oh look there on the big rock noel 's eye have already catch the indian trick of see only what they look for and so of separate a animal instantly from he surroundings however well he hide that be why the whole hillside seem suddenly to vanish spruce and harebell snow-field and drift white cloud all group themselves like the unnoticed frame of a picture around a great gray rock with a huge shaggy she-wolf keep watch over it silent alert motionless something stir in the shadow of the old wolf 's watch-tower toss and eddy and grow suddenly quiet as if the wind be play among dead oak leave the keen young eye see it instantly dilate with surprise and excitement the next instant they have clutch each other 's arm ooooo from mooka cub keep still from noel and shrink close to the rock under a friendly dwarf spruce they lay still as two rabbit watch with round eye eager but unafraid the antic of three brown wolf cub that be chase the fly and tumble over some invisible plaything before the door of the den hardly have they make the discovery when the old wolf slip down from the rock and stand for a instant over she little one why the play should stop now while the breeze be still they comrade and the sunshine be brighter than ever or why they should steal away into the dark den more silently than they have come none of the cub could tell they feel the order and they obey instantly -- and that be always the wonder of watch little wild thing at play the old mother wolf vanish among the rock and appear again higher on the ridge turn she head uneasily to try every breeze and rustle and move shadow then she go quest into the spruce wood feel but not understand some subtle excitement in the air that be not there before and only the two indian child be leave keep watch over the great wild hillside for over a hour they lay there expectantly but nothing stir near the den then they too slip away silently as the little wild thing and make they slow way down the brook hand in hand in the deepen shadow scarcely have they go when the bush stir and the old she-wolf that have be range every ridge and valley since she disappear at the unknown alarm glide over the spot where a moment before mooka and noel have be watch swiftly silently she follow they step find the old trail come up and the fresh trail return then sure at last that no danger threaten she own little one she lope away up the hill and over the topmost ridge to the caribou barren and the thicket where young rabbit be already stir about in the twilight that night in the cabin under the cliff old tomah have to rehearse again all the wolf lore learn in sixty year of hunting : how fortunately for the deer these enormous wolf have never be abundant and be now very rare a few have be shoot and more poison in the starving time and the rest have vanish mysteriously as wolf do for some unknown reason bear which be easily trap and shoot and whose skin be worth each a month 's wages to the fisherman still hold they own and even increase on the great island while the wolf once more numerous be slowly vanish though they be never hunt and not even old tomah himself could set a trap cunningly enough to catch one the old hunter tell while mooka and noel hold they breath and draw closer to the light how once when he make he camp alone under a cliff on the lake shore seven huge wolf white as the snow come race swift and silent over the ice straight at the fire which he have barely time to kindle how he shoot two and the other seize the fish he have just catch through the ice for he own supper vanish over the bank and he could not say even now whether they mean he harm or no again as he talk and the grim old face light up at the memory they see he crouch with he sledge-dog by a blaze fire all the long winter night and around he in the darkness blaze point of light the eye of wolf flash back the firelight and gaunt white form flit about like shadow draw nearer and nearer with ever-growing boldness till they seize he largest dog -- though the brute lay so near the fire that he hair singe -- and whisk it away with a appalling outcry and still again when tomah be lose three day in the interior they see he wander with he pack over endless barren and through gloomy spruce wood and near he all the time a young wolf that follow he step quietly with half-friendly interest and come no nearer day or night all these thing and many more the child hear from old tomah and among all he hunting experience and the story and legend which he tell they there be not one to make they afraid for the horrible story of red ride hood be not know among the indian who know well how untrue the tale be to wolf nature and how foolish it be to frighten child with false story of wolf and bear misrepresent they as savage and bloodthirsty brute when in truth they be but shy peace-loving animal whose only motive toward man except when craze by wound or hunger be one of childish curiosity all these ferocious animal story have they origin in other century and in distant land where they may possibly have be true but more probably be just as false to animal nature for they seem to reflect not the shy animal that man glimpse in the wood but rather the boasting of some hunter who always magnify he own praise by increase the ferocity of the game he have kill or else the pure imagination of some ancient nurse who try to increase she scant authority by frightening she child with terrible tale here certainly the indian attitude of kinship gain by long century of living near to the animal and watch they closely come nearer to the truth of thing that be why little mooka and noel could listen for hour to old tomah 's animal story and then go away to bed and happy dream longing for the light so that they might be off again to watch at the wolf 's den one thing only disturb they for a moment even these child have wolf memory and vie with old tomah in eagerness of tell they remember one fearful winter year ago when most of the family of the little fishing village on the east harbor have move far inland to sheltered cabin in the deep wood to escape the cold and the fearful blizzard of the coast one still moonlit night when the snow lay deep and the cold be intense and all the tree be crack like pistol in the frost a mournful howling rise all around they little cabin light footfall sound on the crust there be scratching at the very door and hoarse breathing at every crack while the dog with hackles up straight and stiff on they neck flee howl under bed and table and when mooka and noel go fearfully with they mother to the little window -- for the man be far away on a caribou hunt -- there be gaunt white wolf five or six of they flit restlessly about in the moonlight scratch at the crack and even raise themselves on they hind leg to look in at the little window mooka shiver a bit when she remember the uncanny scene and feel again the strong pressure of she mother 's arm hold she close but old tomah brush away she fear with a smile and a word as he have always do when as little child they have show fear at the thunder or the gale or the cry of a wild beast in the night till they have grow to look upon all nature 's phenomenon as hide a smile as kindly as that of old tomah himself who have a face wrinkled and terribly grim to be sure but who could smile and tell a story so that every child trust he the wolf be hungry starve hungry he say and want only a dog or one of the pig and mooka remember with a bright laugh the two unruly pig that have be take inland as a hostage to famine and that must be carefully guard from the tooth of hungry prowler for they would soon be need to keep the child themselves from starve every night at early sunset when the tree begin to groan and the keen wind from the mountain come whisper through the wood the two pig be take into the snug kitchen where with the dog they sleep so close to the stove that she could always smell pork a-frying not a husky dog there but would have kill and eat one of these little pig if he could have catch he around the corner of the house after nightfall though you would never have suspect it if you have see they so close together keep each other warm after the fire go out and besides the dog and the wolf there be lynx -- big round-headed savage-looking creature -- that come prowl out of the deep wood every night hungry for a taste of the little pig and now and then a enormous polar bear that have land from a iceberg would shuffle swiftly and fearlessly among the handful of little cabin leave he great footprint in every yard and tear to piece as if make of straw the heavy log pen to which some of the fisherman have foolishly confide they pig or sheep he even enter the woodshed and rummage about after a stray fishbone or a old sealskin boot make a great rowdydow in the still night and only the smell of man or the report of a old gun fire at he by some brave woman out of the half-open window keep he from push he enormous weight against the very door of the cabin think of all these thing mooka forget she fear of the white wolf remember with a kind of sympathy how hungry all these shy prowler must be to leave they own haunt whence the rabbit and seal have vanish and venture boldly into the yard of man as for noel he remember with regret that he be too small at the time to use the long bow which he now carry on he rabbit and goose hunt and as he take it from the wall thrum its chord of caribou sinew and finger the sharp edge of a long arrow he be hope for just such another winter longing to try he skill and strength on some of these midnight prowler -- a lynx perhaps not to begin too largely on a polar bear so there be no fear at all but only a eager wonder when they follow up the brook next day to watch at the wolf 's den and even when noel find a track a light oval track larger but more slender than a dog 's in some moist sand close beside they own footprint and evidently follow they they remember only the young wolf that have follow tomah and press on the more eagerly day after day they return to they watch-tower on the flat rock under the dwarf spruce at the head of the brook and lie there side by side they watch the play of the young wolf cub every day they grow more interested as the spirit of play enter into themselves understand the gladness of the wild rough-and-tumble when one of the cub lay in wait for another and leap upon he from ambush understanding also something of the feeling of the gaunt old she-wolf as she look down gravely from she gray rock watch she grow youngster once they bring a old spyglass which they have borrow from a fisherman and through its sea-dimmed lens they make out that one of the cub be larger than the other two with a droop at the tip of he right ear like a pointed leaf that have be crease sharply between the finger mooka claim that wolf instantly for she own as if they be watch the husky puppy and by he broken ear say she should know he again when he grow to be a big wolf if he should ever follow she as he father perhaps have follow old tomah but noel thinking of he bow and he long arrow with the sharp point thought of the winter night long ago and hope that he two wolf would know enough to keep away when the pack come again for he do not see any way to recognize and spare they especially in the moonlight so they lay there make plan and dream dream gentle or savage for the little cub that play with the feather and grasshopper and cloud shadow all unconscious that any eye but they mother 's saw or care for they wild free playing -lrb- illustration : watch she grow youngster -rrb- something bother the old she-wolf in these day of watch the den be still secure for no human foot have cross the deep ravine or venture nearer than the opposite hilltop she nose tell she that unmistakably but still she be uneasy and whenever the cub be play she feel without know why that she be be watch when she trail over all the ridge in the twilight seek to know if enemy have be near she find always the scent of two human being on a flat rock under the dwarf spruce and there be always the two trail come up and go down the brook she follow once close behind the two child see they plainly all the way till they come in sight of the little cabin under the cliff and from the door she enemy man come out to meet they for these two little one whose trail she know the old she-wolf like most mother animal in the presence of child feel no fear nor enmity whatever but they watch she den and she own little one that be sure enough and why should any one watch a den except to enter some time and destroy that be a question which no mother wolf could ever answer for the wild animal unlike dog and blue jay and man mind strictly they own business and pay no attention to other animal they hate also to be watch for the thought of watch always suggest to they mind that which follow -- the hunt the rush the wild break-away and the run for life have she not herself watch a hundred time at the rabbit 's form the fox 's runway the deer path the wild-goose nest what could she expect for she own little one therefore when the man cub being of larger reach and unknown power come daily to watch at she den all this unanswered puzzle must have pass through the old wolf 's head as she trot up the brook away from the indian cabin in the twilight when in doubt trust you fear -- that be wolf wisdom in a nutshell and that mark the difference between a wolf and a caribou for instance which in doubt trust he nose or he curiosity so the old wolf take counsel of she fear for she little one and that night carry they one by one in she mouth as a cat carry she kitten mile away over rock and ravine and spruce thicket to another den where no human eye ever look upon they play shall we see they again little brother say mooka wistfully when they have climb to they watch-tower for the third time and see nothing and noel make confident answer : oh yes we see um again lil sister wayeese get um wander foot go ` way off long way bimeby come back on same trail he jus ' like injun like um old camp best oh yes sartin we see um again but noel 's eye look far away as he speak and in he heart he be think of he bow and he long arrow with the sharp point and of a moonlit night with white shape flit noiselessly over the snow and scratch at the door of the little cabin _ the way of the wolf _ a new experience have come to the little wolf cub in a single night -- the experience of fear for week they have lie hide in the dark den or play fearlessly in the bright sunshine guard and keep at every moment day or night by the gaunt old mother wolf that be they only law they only companion at time they lay for hour hungry and restless longing to go out into the bright world yet obey a stronger will than they own even at a distance for once a wild mother in she own dumb way have bid she little one lie still they rarely stir from the spot refusing even to be drag away from the nest or den know well the punishment in store if she return and find they absent moreover it be useless to dissimulate to go out and play and then to be sleep innocently with the cub when the old wolf 's shadow darken the entrance no concealment be possible from wolf 's nose before she enter the den the mother know perfectly all that have happen since she go away so the day glide by peacefully between sleep and play the cub trust absolutely in the strength and tenderness that watch over they the mother build the cub ' future on the foundation of the two instinct which be strong in every wild creature bear into a world of danger -- the instinct to lie still and let nature 's color hide all defenseless little one and the instinct to obey instantly a stronger will than they own there be no fear as yet only instinctive wariness for fear come largely from other ' example from alarm and excitement and cry of danger which only the grown animal understand the old wolf have be undisturbed no dog or hunter have chase she no trap or pitfall have entangled she swift foot moreover she have choose she den well where no man have ever stand and where only the eye of two child have see she at a distance so the little one grow and play in the sunshine and have yet to learn what fear mean one day at dusk the mother enter swiftly and without give they food as she have always do seize a cub and disappear for the little one which have never before venture beyond sight of the den it be a long journey indeed that follow -- mile and mile beside roar brook and mist-filled ravine through gloomy wood where no light enter and over bare ridge where the big star sparkle just over he ear as he hang limp as a rabbit skin from he mother 's great jaw a owl hoot dismally _ whoo-hooo _ and though he know the sound well in he peaceful night it bring now a certain shiver the wind go sniff suspiciously among the spruce branch a startled bird chirp and whir away out of they path the brook roar among the rock a big salmon jump and tumble back with resounding splash and jump again as if the otter be after he there be a sudden sharp cry the first and last voice of a hare when the weasel rise up in front of he then silence and the fitful rustle of he mother 's pad move steadily swiftly over dry leaf and all these sound of the wilderness night speak to the little cub of some new thing of swift foot that follow and of something unknown and terrible that wait for all unwary wild thing so fear be bear the long journey end at last before a dark hole in the hillside and the smell of he mother the only familiar thing in he first strange pilgrimage greet the cub from the rock on either side as he pass in out of the starlight he be drop without a sound in a larger den on some fresh-gathered leaf and dead grass and lay there all alone very still with the new feeling tremble all over he a long hour pass a second cub be lay beside he and the mother vanish as before another hour and the wolf cub be all together again with the mother feed they nor do any of they know where they be nor why they have come nor the long long way that lead back to where the trail begin next day when they be call out to play they see a different and more gloomy landscape a chaos of granite rock a forest of evergreen the white plunge and roll mist of a mountain torrent but no silver sea with fishing-boat drift over it like cloud in the sea over they head and no gray hut with child run about like ant on the distant shore and as they play they begin for the first time to imitate the old mother keep guard over they sit up often to watch and listen and sift the wind try to understand what fear be and why they have be take away from the sunny hillside where the world be so much bigger and brighter than here but home be where mother be -- that fortunately be also true of the little wood folk who understand it in they own savage way for a season -- and in they wonder at they new surroundings the memory of the old home gradually fade away they never know with what endless care the new den have be choose how the mother in the day when she know she be watch have search it out and watch over it and put she nose to every ridge and ravine and brook-side day after day till she be sure that no foot save that of the wild thing have touch the soil within mile of the place they feel only a greater wildness a deeper solitude and they never forget though they be unmolested the strange feeling that be bear in they on that first terrifying night journey in they mother 's jaw \* \* \* \* \* soon the food that be bring home at dawn -- the rabbit or grouse or the bunch of rat hang by they tail with which the mother supplement they midday drink of milk -- become altogether too scant to satisfy they clamorous appetite and in the bright afternoon and the long summer twilight the mother lead they forth on short journey to hunt for themselves no big caribou or cunning fox cub as one might suppose but rat and mouse and such small deer be the limit of the mother 's ambition for she little one they begin on stupid grub that one could find asleep under stone and root and then on beetle that scramble away briskly at the first alarm and then when the sunshine be brightest on grasshopper -- lively wary fellow that zip and buzz away just when you be sure you have they and that generally land from a astounding jump face in a different direction like a flea so as to be ready for you next move it be astonishing how quickly the cub learn that game be not to be pick up tamely like huckleberry and change they style of hunting -- creep instead of trot openly so that even a porcupine must notice they hide behind rock and bush and tuft of grass till the precise moment come and then leap with the swoop of a goshawk on a ptarmigan a wolf that can not catch a grasshopper have no business hunting rabbit -- this seem to be the unconscious motive that lead the old mother every sunny afternoon to ignore the thicket where game be hide plentifully and take she cub to the dry sunny plain on the edge of the caribou barren there for hour at a time they hunt elusive grasshopper rush helter-skelter over the dry moss leap up to strike at the fly game with they paw like a kitten or snap wildly to catch it in they mouth and come down with a back-breaking wriggle to keep themselves from tumble over on they head then on again with a droll expression and nose sharpen like exclamation point to find another grasshopper small business indeed and often ludicrous this playing at grasshopper hunting so it seem to we so also perhaps to the wise old mother which know all the way of game from cricket to caribou and from ground sparrow to wild goose but play be the first great educator -- that be as true of animal as of man -- and to the cub they rough helter-skelter after hopper be as exciting as a stag hunt to the pack as full of surprise as the wild chase through the soft snow after a litter of lynx kitten and though they know it not they be learn thing every hour of the sunny playful afternoon that they would remember and find useful all the day of they life so the funny little hunt go on the mother watch gravely under a bush where she be inconspicuous and the cub full of zest and inexperience miss the fly tidbit more often than they swallow they until they learn at last to locate all game accurately before chase or alarming it and that be the rule learn from hunting grasshopper which a wolf follow ever afterward even after they know just where the grasshopper be hide watch they after a jump and leap upon he swiftly from a distance he often get away when they lift they paw to eat he for the grasshopper be not dead under the light paw as they suppose but only press into the moss wait for he chance to jump then the cub learn another lesson : to hold they game down with both paw press closely together insert they nose like a wedge and keep every crack of escape shut tight until they have the slippery morsel safe under they back tooth and even then it be deliciously funny to watch they expression as they chew open they jaw wide as if swallow a rabbit snap they shut again as the grasshopper wiggle and always with a doubt in they close-set eye a question twist of head and ear as if they be not quite sure whether or not they be really eat he another suggestive thing come out in these hunt which you must notice whether you watch wolf or coyote or a den of fox cub though no sound come from the watchful old mother the cub seem at every instant under absolute control one would rush away pell-mell after a hopper miss he and tumble away again till he be some distance from the busy group on the edge of the big lonely barren in the midst of he chase the mother would raise she head and watch the cub intently no sound be utter that human ear could hear but the chase end right there on the instant and the cub come trot back like a well-broken setter at the whistle it be marvelous beyond comprehension this absolute authority and this silent command that bring a wolf back instantly from the wildest chase and that keep the cub all together under the watchful eye that follow every movement no wonder wolf be intelligent in avoid every trap and in hunting together to outwit some fleet-footed quarry with unbelievable cunning here on the edge of the vast untrodden barren far from human eye in a ordinary family of wolf cub play wild and free eager headstrong hungry yet always under control and instantly subject to a wiser head and a stronger will than they own be the explanation of it all later in the bitter hungry winter when a big caribou be afoot and the pack hot on he trail the cub would remember the lesson and every free wolf would curb he hunger obey the silent signal to ease the game and follow slowly while the leader race unseen through the wood to head the game and lie in ambush by the distant runway from grasshopper the cub take to hunting the wood-mouse that nested in the dry moss and swarm on the edge of every thicket this be keener hunting for the wood-mouse move like a ray of light and always make at least one false start to mislead any that may be watch for he the cub soon learn that when tookhee appear and dodge back again as if frighten it be not because he have see they but just because he always appear that way so they crouch and hide like a cat and when a gray streak shot over the gray moss and vanish in a tuft of grass they leap for the spot -- and always find it vacant for tookhee always double on he trail or burrow for a distance under the moss and never hide where he disappear it take the cub a long while to find that out and then they would creep and watch and listen till they could locate the game by a stir under the moss and pounce upon it and nose it out from between they paw just as they have do with the grasshopper and when they crunch it at last like a ripe plum under they tooth it be a delicious tidbit worth all the trouble they have take to get it for you wolf unlike the ferocious grandmother-eating creature of the nursery be at heart a peaceable fellow most at home and most happy when mouse hunting there be another kind of this mouse chasing which furnish better sport and more juicy mouthful to the young cub here and there on the newfoundland mountain the snow linger all summer long in every northern hollow of the hill you see from a distance white patch no bigger than you hat sparkling in the sun but when you climb there after bear or caribou you find great snow-fields acre in extent and from ten to a hundred foot deep pack close and hard with the pressure of a thousand winter often when it rain in the valley and raise the salmon river to meet you expectation a thin covering of new snow cover these white field and then if you go there you will find the new page write all over with the foot of bird and beast the mouse especially love these snow-field for some unknown reason all along the edge you find the delicate lacelike tracery which show where little foot have go on busy errand or play together in the moonlight and if you watch there awhile you will surely see tookhee come out of the moss and scamper across a bit of snow and dive back to cover under the moss again as if he enjoy the feeling of the cold snow under he foot in the summer sunshine he have tunnel there too go down to solid ice where he hide thing to keep which would spoil if leave in the heat of he den under the mossy stone and when food be scarce he draw upon these cold-storage room but most of he summer snow journey if one may judge from watch he and from follow he track be take for play or comfort just as the bull caribou come up to lie in the snow with the strong sea wind in he face to escape the fly which swarm in the thicket below owl and hawk fox and weasel and wildcat -- all the prowler of the day and night have long since discover these good hunting-grounds and leave the print of wing and claw over the record of the wood-mouse but still tookhee return lead by he love of the snow-field and thrive and multiply spite of all he enemy one moonlit night the old wolf take she cub to the edge of one of these snow-field where the eager eye soon notice dark streak shoot hither and yon over the bare white surface at first they chase they wildly but one might as well try to catch a moonbeam which have not so many place to hide as a wood-mouse then remember the grasshopper they crouch and creep and so catch a few meanwhile old mother wolf lay still in hide content herself with snap up the game that come to she instead of chase it wildly all over the snow-field the example be not lose for imitation be strong among intelligent animal and most of what they learn be due simply to follow the mother soon the cub be still one lie here under shadow of a bush another there by a gray rock that lift its head out of the snow as a dark streak move nervously by one of these hiding-place there would be a rush a snap the _ pchap pchap _ of jaw crunch a delicious morsel then all quiet again with only gray innocent-looking shadow rest softly on the snow so they move gradually along the edge of the great white field and next morning the track be all there plain as daylight tell they silent story of good hunting to vary they diet the mother now take they down to the shore to hunt among the rock for duck ' egg they be there by the hundred scatter along the lonely bay just above high-water line where the eider have they nest at first old mother wolf show they where to look and when she have find a clutch of egg would divide they fairly keep the hungry cub in order at a little distance and bring each one he share which he eat without interference then when they understand the thing they scatter nimbly to hunt for themselves and the real fun begin now a cub poke he nose industriously into every cranny and under every thick bush would find a great roll of down pluck from the mother bird 's breast and scrape the top off carefully with he paw would find five or six large pale-green egg which he gobble down shell duckling and all before another cub should smell the good find and caper up to share it again he would be startle out of he wit as a large brown bird whir and flutter away from under he very nose sit on he tail he would watch she with comical regret and longing till she tumble into the tide and drift swiftly away out of danger then remember what he come for he would turn and follow she trail back to the nest out of which she have steal at he approach and find the egg all warm for he breakfast and when he have eat all he want he would take a egg in he mouth and run about uneasily here and there like a dog with a bone when he think he be watch till he have make a sad crisscross of he trail and find a spot where none could see he there he would dig a hole and bury he egg and go back for more and on he way would meet another cub run about with a egg in he mouth look for a spot where no one would notice he from mouse and egg the young cub turn to rabbit and hare and these be they staple food ever afterward when other game be scarce and the wood-mouse be hide deep under the winter snow safe at last for a little season from all they enemy here for the first time the father wolf appear come in quietly one late afternoon as if he know as he probably do just when he be need beyond a glance he pay no attention whatever to the cub only take he place opposite the mother as the wolf start abreast in a long line to beat the thicket by night the cub have already catch several rabbit snap they up as they play heedlessly in the moonlight just as they have do with the wood-mouse by day however the hunting be entirely different then the hare and rabbit be rest in they hidden form under the fern or in a hollow between the root of a brown stump like game bird whether on the nest or sit quiet in hide the rabbit give out far less scent at such time than when they be active and the cub steal through the dense cover like shadow in imitation of the old wolf and always hunting upwind would use they keen nose to locate moktaque before alarming he if a cub succeed and snap up a rabbit before the surprised creature have time to gather headway he drop behind with he catch while the rest go slowly carefully on through the cover if he fail as be generally the case at first a curious bit of wolf intelligence and wolf training come out at once as the wolf advance the father and mother would steal gradually ahead at either end of the line rarely hunting themselves but draw the nearest cub 's attention to any game they have discover and then move silently to one side and a little ahead to watch the result when the cub rush and miss and the startled rabbit go fly away whirling to left or right as rabbit always do there would be a lightning change at the end of the line a terrific rush a snap of the long jaw like a steel trap -- then the old wolf would toss back the rabbit with a break back for the cub to finish he not till the cub first and then the mother have satisfy they hunger would the old he-wolf hunt for himself then he would disappear and they would not see he for day at a time until food be scarce and they need he once more one day when the cub be hungry and food scarce because of they persistent hunting near the den the mother bring they to the edge of a dense thicket where rabbit be plentiful enough but where the cover be so thick that they could not follow the frightened game for a instant the old he-wolf have appear at a distance and then vanish and the cub trot along behind the mother know nothing of what be come or what be expect of they they lay in hide on the lee side of the thicket each one crouch under a bush or root with the mother off at one side perfectly hide as usual presently a rabbit appear hop along in a crazy way and run plump into the jaw of a wolf cub which leap up as if out of the ground and pull down he game from the very top of the high jump which moktaque always give when he be suddenly startle another and another rabbit appear mysteriously and double back into the cover before they could be catch the cub be fill with wonder such hunting be never see before for rabbit stir abroad by day and run right into the hungry mouth instead of run away then slink along like a shadow and stop to look back and sniff the wind appear a big red fox that have be sleep away the afternoon on top of a stump in the center of the thicket the old mother 's eye begin to blaze as eleemo draw near there be a rush swift and sudden as the swoop of a eagle a sharp call to follow as the mother 's long jaw close over the small of the back just as the fox turn to leap away then she fling the paralyzed animal back like a flash the young wolf tumble in upon he and before he know what have happen eleemo the sly one be stretch out straight with one cub at he tail and another at he throat tug and worry and grumble deep in they chest as the lust of they first fighting sweep over they then in vague vanish glimpse the old he-wolf appear quarter swiftly silently back and forth through the thicket drive every living thing down-wind to where the cub and the mother be wait to receive it -lrb- illustration : as the mother 's long jaw close over the small of the back -rrb- that one lesson be enough for the cub though year would pass before they could learn all the fine point of this beat the bush : to know almost at a glance where the game whether grouse or hare or fox or lucivee be hide in the cover and then for one wolf to drive it slowly or swiftly as the case might require while the other hide beside the most likely path of escape a family of grouse must be coax along and never see what be drive they else they will flit into a tree and be lose while a cat must be startle out of she wit by a swift rush and send fly away before she can make up she stupid mind what the row be all about a fox almost as cunning as wayeese himself must be make to think that some dog enemy be slowly puzzling out he cold trail while a musquash search for bake-apple or a beaver go inland to cut wood for he winter supplies of bark must not be drive but be follow up swiftly by the path or canal by which he have venture away from the friendly water all these and many more thing must be learn slowly at the expense of many failure especially when the cub take to hunting alone and the old wolf be not there to show they how but they never forget the principle teach in that first rabbit drive -- that two hunter be better than one to outwit any game when they hunt intelligently together that be why you so often find wolf go in pair and when you study they or follow they track you discover that they play continually into each other 's hand they seem to share the spoil as intelligently as they catch it the wolf that lie beside the runway and pull down the game give up a portion gladly to the companion that beat the bush and rarely indeed be there any trace of quarrel between they like the eagle -- which have long since learn the advantage of hunting in pair and of scout for game in single file -- the wolf when hunting deer on the open barren where it be difficult to conceal they advance always travel in file one follow close behind the other so that see from in front where the game be watch two or three wolf will appear like a lone animal trot across the plain that alarm the game far less at first and not until the deer start away do the second wolf appear shoot out from behind the leader the sight of another wolf appear suddenly on he flank throw a young deer into a panic in which he be apt to lose he head and be catch by the cunning hunter curiously enough the plain indian who travel in the same way when hunting or scout for enemy first learn the trick -- so a old chief tell I and it be one of the tradition of he people -- from watch the timber wolf in they stealthy advance over the open place the wolf be steal through the wood all together one late summer afternoon have beat a cover without take anything when the puzzle cub suddenly find themselves alone a moment before they have be trot along with the old wolf nose every cranny and knot hole for mouse and grub and stop often for a roll and frolic as young cub do in the gladness of life now they press close together look listen while a subtle excitement fill all the wood for the old wolf have disappear shooting ahead in great silent bound while the cub wait with ear cock and nose quiver as if a silent command have be understand the silence be intense not a sound not a stir in the quiet wood which seem to be listen with the cub and to be fill with the same thrilling expectation suddenly the silence be break by heavy plunge far ahead _ crash bump bump _ and there break forth such a uproar of yap and howl as the cub have never hear before instantly they break away on the trail join they shrill yelping to the clamor so different from the ordinary stealthy wolf hunt and fill with a nameless excitement which they do not at all understand till the reek of caribou pour into they hungry nostril whereupon they yelp louder than ever but they do not begin to understand the matter till they catch glimpse of gray back bound hither and yon in the underbrush while the two great wolf race easily on either side yap sharply to increase the excitement and guide the startled foolish deer as surely as intelligently as a pair of collie herd a flock of frightened sheep when the cub break out of the dense cover at last they find the two old wolf sit quietly on they tail before a rugged wall of rock that stretch away on either hand at the base of a great bare hill in front of they be a young cow caribou threaten savagely with horn and hoof while behind she cower two half-grown fawn crowd into a crevice of the rock anger rather than fear blaze out in the mother 's mild eye now she turn swiftly to press she excited young one back against the shelter wall now she whirl with a savage grunt and charge headlong at the wolf which merely leap aside and sit down silently again to watch the game till the cub race out and hover uneasily about with a thousand question in every eye and ear and twitch nostril the reason for the hunt be now plain enough up to this time the caribou have be let severely alone though they be very numerous scatter through the dense covert in every valley and on every hillside for wayeese be no wanton killer as he be so often represent to be but stick to small game whenever he can find it and leave the deer unmolested as for he motive in the matter who shall say since no one understand the half of what a wolf do every day perhaps it be a mere matter of taste a preference for the smaller and more juicy tidbit more likely it be a combination of instinct and judgment with a possible outlook for the future unusual with beast of prey the moment the young wolf take to harry the deer -- as they invariably do if the mother wolf be not with they -- the caribou leave the country the herd become moreover so wild and suspicious after a very little wolf hunting that they be exceedingly difficult of approach and there be no living thing on earth not even a white wolf or a trained greyhound that can tire or overtake a startled caribou the swing rack of these big white wanderer look easy enough when you see it but when the fleet staghound be slip as have be more than once test in newfoundland try as hard as they will they can not keep within sight of the deer for a single quarter-mile and no limit have ever yet be find either by dog or wolf to megaleep 's tirelessness so the old wolf rely possibly upon past experience keep the cub and hold themselves strictly to small game as long as it can possibly be find then when the bitter day of late winter come with they scarcity of small game and they unbearable hunger the wolf turn to the caribou as a last resort kill a few here by stealth rather than speed and then when the game grow wild go far off to another range where the deer have not be disturb and so can be approach more easily on this afternoon however the old mother wolf have run plump upon the caribou and she fawn in the midst of a thicket and have leap forward promptly to round they up for she hungry cub it would have be the easiest matter in the world for a old wolf to hamstring one of the slow fawn or the mother caribou herself as she hover in the rear to defend she young but there be other thought in the shaggy gray head that have see so much hunting so the mother wolf drive the deer slowly puzzling they more and more as a collie distract the herd by he yap out into the open where she cub might join in the hunting the wolf now draw back all save the mother which advance hesitatingly to where the caribou stand with lowered head watch every move suddenly the cow charge so swiftly furiously that the old wolf seem almost catch and tumble away with the broad hoof striking savagely at she flank farther and farther the caribou drive she enemy rouse now to frenzy at the wolf 's nearness and apparent cowardice then she whirl in a panic and rush back to she little one only to find that all the other wolf as if frighten by she furious charge have draw farther back from the cranny in the rock again the old she-wolf approach cautiously and again the caribou plunge at she and follow she lame retreat with headlong fury a electric shock seem suddenly to touch the huge he-wolf like a flash he leap in on the fawn one quick snap of the long jaw with the terrible fang then as if the whole thing be a bit of play he lope away easily with the cub circle to join the mother wolf which strangely enough do not return to the attack as the caribou charge back drive the cub and the old he-wolf away like a flock of sheep the coast be now clear not a enemy in the way and the mother caribou with a triumphant bleat to she fawn to follow plunge back into the wood whence she have come one fawn only follow she the other take a step or two sink to he knee and roll over on he side when the wolf draw near quietly without a trace of the ferocity or the howling clamor with which such scene be usually picture the game be quite dead one quick snap of the old wolf 's tooth just behind the fore leg have pierce the heart more surely than a hunter 's bullet and the mother caribou plunge wildly away through the brush with the startle fawn jump at she heel could not know that she mad flight be needless that the terrible enemy which have spare she and let she go free have no need nor desire to follow \* \* \* \* \* the fat autumn have now come with its abundant fare and the caribou be not again molest flock of grouse and ptarmigan come out of the thick covert in which they have be hide all summer and begin to pluck the berry of the open plain where they could easily be waylay and catch by the grow wolf cub plover come in horde sweep over the strait from the labrador and when the wolf surround a flock of the queer bird and hitch nearer and nearer sink they gray body in the yield gray moss till they look like weather-worn log the hunting be full of tense excitement though the juicy mouthful be few and far between fox cub roam abroad away from they mother self-willed and revel in the abundance and it be now easy for two of the young wolf to drive a fox out of he daytime cover and catch he as he steal away after the plover come the duck in myriad fill the pond and flashet of the vast barren with tumultuous quack and the young wolf learn like the fox to decoy the silly bird by rouse they curiosity they would hide in the grass while one play and roll about on the open shore till the duck see he and begin to stretch they neck and gabble they amazement at the strange thing which they have never see before shy and wild as he naturally be a duck like a caribou or a turkey must take a peek at every new thing now silent now gabble all together the flock would veer and scatter and draw together again and finally swing in toward the shore every neck draw straight as a string the better to see what be go on nearer and nearer they would come till a swift rush out of the grass send they off headlong splash and quack with crazy clamor but one or two always stay behind with the wolf to pay the price of curiosity then there be the young goose which gather in immense flock in the shallow bay prepare and drill for the autumn flight late in the afternoon the old mother wolf with she cub would steal down through the wood hide and watch the flock and follow they stealthily as they move along the shore at night the great flock would approach a sandbar well out of the way of rock and brush and everything that might hide a enemy and go to sleep in close little family group on the open shore as the night darken four shadow would lengthen out from the nearest bank of shadow creep onward to the sand-bar with the slow patience of the hour a rush a startled _ honk _ a terrific clamor of wing and throat and smitten water then the four shadow would rise up from the sand and trot back to the wood each with a burden on its shoulder and a sparkle in the close-set eye over the pointed jaw which be close on the neck of a goose hold it tight lest any outcry escape to tell the startled flock what have happen besides this abundant game there be other good thing to eat and the cub rarely dine of the same dish twice in succession salmon and big sea-trout swarm now in every shallow of the clear brook and after spawn these fish be much weakened and could easily be catch by a little cunning every day and night the tide ebb and flow and every tide leave its contribution in windrow of dead herring and caplin with scatter crab and mussel for a relish like plum in a pudding a wolf have only to trot for a mile or two along the tide line of a lonely beach pick up the good thing which the sea have bring he and then go back to sleep or play satisfied and if wayeese want game to try he mettle and cunning there be the big fat seal bark on the black rock and he have only to cut between they and the sea and throw himself upon the largest seal as the herd flounder ponderously back to safety a wolf rarely grip and hold a enemy he snap and let go and snap again at every swift chance but here he must either hold fast or lose he big game and what between holding and let go as the seal whirl with bared tooth and snap viciously in turn as they scramble away to the sea the wolf have a lively time of it often indeed spite of three or four wolf a big seal would tumble into the tide where the shark follow he bloody trail and soon finish he now for the first time the wolf lead by the rich abundance begin to kill more than they need for food and to hide it away like the squirrel in anticipation of the come winter like the blue and the arctic fox a strange instinct to store thing seem to stir dimly at time within they occasionally instead of eating and sleep after a kill the cub lead by the mother wolf would hunt half of the day and night and carry all they catch to the snow-field there each one would search out a cranny in the rock and hide he game cover it over deeply with snow to kill the scent of it from the prowl fox then for day at a time they would forget the come winter and play as heedlessly as if the wood would always be as full of game as now and again the mood would be upon they strongly and they would kill all they could find and hide it in another place but the instinct -- if indeed it be instinct and not the natural result of the mother 's own experience -- be weak at best and the first time the cub be hungry or lazy they would trail off to the hidden store long before the spring with its bitter need be upon they they have eat everything and have return to the empty storehouse at least a dozen time as a dog go again and again to the place where he once hide a bone and nose it all over regretfully to be quite sure that they have overlook nothing more interesting to the wolf in these glad day than the game or the storehouse or the pile of caplin which they cache under the sand on the shore be the wander herd of caribou -- splendid old stag with massive antler and long-legged inquisitive fawn trot after the sleek cow whose head carry small pointed horn more deadly by far than the stag ' cumbersome antler wherever the wolf go they cross the trail of these wanderer swarm out of the thicket sometimes by two and three and again in straggle endless line converge upon the vast open barren where the caribou gather to select they mate for another year where they all come from be a mystery that fill the cub ' head with constant wonder during the summer you see little of they -- here a cow with she fawn hide deep in the cover there a big stag stand out like a watchman on the mountain top but when the early autumn come they be everywhere cross river and lake at regular point and follow deep path which they ancestor have follow for countless generation the cow and fawn seem gentle and harmless enough though they very number fill the young wolf with a certain awe after they first lesson it would have be easy enough for the cub to have kill all they want and to grow fat and lazy as the bear which be now stuff themselves before go off to sleep for the winter but the old mother wolf hold they firmly in check for with plenty of small game everywhere all wolf be mind to go quietly about they own business and let the caribou follow they own way when October come it bring the big stag into the open -- splendid impose beast with swollen neck and fierce red eye and long white mane toss in the wind then the wolf have to stand aside for the stag roam over all the land paw the moss in fury bellow they hoarse challenge and charge like a whirlwind upon every living thing that cross they path when the mother wolf with she cub at heel see one of these big fury at a distance she would circle prudently to avoid he again as the cub hunt rabbit they would hear a crash of brush and a furious challenge as some quarrelsome stag wind they and the mother with she cub gather close about she would watch alertly for he headlong rush as he charge out the wolf would scatter and leap nimbly aside then sit down on they tail in a solemn circle and watch as if study the strange beast again and again he would rush upon they only to find that he be fight the wind mad as a hornet he would single out a cub and follow he headlong through brush and brake till some subtle warning thrill through he madness tell he to heed he flank then as he whirl he would find the savage old mother close at he heel she white fang bare and a dangerous flash in she eye as she see the hamstring so near so easy to reach one spring and a snap and the ramp masterful stag would have be helpless as a rabbit he tendon cut cleanly at the hock another snap and he must come down spite of he great power and be food for the grow cub that sit on they tail watch he unterrified now by he fierce challenge but megaleep 's time have not yet come besides he be too tough so the wolf study he awhile amuse perhaps at the rough play then as if at a silent command they vanish like shadow into the nearest cover leave the big stag in he rage to think himself master of all the world sometimes as the old he-wolf range alone a silent powerful noble-looking brute he would meet the caribou and there would be a fascinating bit of animal play he rarely turn aside know he own power and the cow and fawn after one look would bind aside and rack away at a marvelous pace over the barren in a moment or two find that they be not molest they would turn and watch the wolf curiously till he disappear try perhaps to puzzle it out why the ferocious enemy of the deep snow and the bitter cold should now be harmless as the pass bird again a young bull with he keen polished spike-horn more active and dangerous but less confident than the over-antlered stag would stand in the old wolf 's path dispute with lowered front the right of way here the right of way mean a good deal for in many place on the high plain the scrub spruce grow so thickly that a man can easily walk over the top of they on he snow-shoe and the only possible passage in summer-time be by means of the numerous path wear through the scrub by the passing of animal for untold age so one or the other of the two splendid brute that now approach each other in the narrow way must turn aside or be beat down underfoot quietly steadily the old wolf would come on till almost within spring distance when he would stop and lift he great head wrinkle he chop to show the long white fang and rumble a warning deep in he massive chest then the caribou would lose he nerve he would stamp and fidget and bluster and at last begin to circle nervously crash he way into the scrub as if for a chance to take he enemy in the flank whereupon the old wolf would trot quietly along the path pay no more heed to the interruption while the young bull would stand wonder he body hide in the scrub and he head thrust into the narrow path to look after he strange adversary another time as the old wolf range along the edge of the barren where the caribou herd be gather he would hear the challenge of a huge stag and the warning crack of twig and the thunder of hoof as the brute charge still the wolf trot quietly along watch from the corner of he eye till the stag be upon he when he spring lightly aside and let the rush go harmlessly by sit on he tail he would watch the caribou closely -- and who could tell what be pass behind those cunning eye that glow steadily like coal unruffle as yet by the pass wind but ready at a rough breath to break out in flame of fire again and again the stag would charge grow more furious at every failure and every time the wolf leap aside he leave a terrible gash in he enemy 's neck or side punish he cruelly for he bully attack yet strangely refuse to kill as he might have do or to close on the hamstring with one swift snap that would have put the big brute out of the fight forever at last know perhaps from past experience the uselessness of punish or of dispute with this madman that feel no wound in he rage the wolf would lope away to cover follow by a victorious bugle-cry that ring over the wide barren and echo back from the mountain side then the wolf would circle back stealthily and put he nose down into the stag 's hoof-mark for a long deep sniff and go quietly on he way again a wolf 's nose never forget when he find that trail wander with a score of other over the snow in the bitter day to come when the pack be starve wayeese will know whom he be follow besides the caribou there be other thing to rouse the cub ' curiosity and give they something pleasant to do besides eating and sleep when the hunter 's moon rise full and clear over the wood fill all animal with strange unrest the pack would circle the great harbor trot silently along nose to tail in single file keep on the high ridge of mountain and look like a distant train of husky dog against the moonlight when over the fishing village they would sit down each one on the loftiest rock he could find raise they muzzle to the star and join in the long howl _ ooooooo-wow-ow-ow _ a terrible wail cry that seem to drive every dog within hear stark crazy out of the village lane far below they rush headlong and sit on the beach in a wide circle head all in and tail out they raise they nose to the distant wolf-topped pinnacle and join in the wail answer then the wolf would sit very still listen with cock ear to the cry of they captive kinsman till the dismal howling die away into silence when they would start the clamor into life again by give the wolf 's challenge why they do it what they feel there in the strange unreality of the moonlight and what hush they profound enmity none can tell ordinarily the wolf hate both fox and dog and kill they whenever they cross he path but to-night the fox be yap a answer all around they and sometimes a few adventurous dog would scale the mountain silently to sit on the rock and join in the wild wolf chorus and not a wolf stir to molest they all be more or less lunatic and know not what they be do for hour the uncanny comedy would drag itself on into the tense midnight silence the wail cry grow more demented and heartrending as the spell of ancient day fall again upon the degenerate husky up on the lonely mountain top the moon look down still and cold and saw upon every pinnacle a dog or a wolf each with he head turn up at the sky howl he heart out down in the hamlet scatter for mile along deep arm and the harbor shore sleeper stir uneasily at the clamor the woman clutch they baby close the man cursing the crazy brute and vow all sort of vengeance on the morrow then the wolf would slip away like shadow into the vast upland barren and the dog restless as witch with some unknown excitement would run back to whine and scratch at the door of they master ' cabin soon the big snowflake be whirling in the air busily weave a soft white winding-sheet for the autumn which be pass away and truly it have be a good time for the wolf cub as for most wild animal and they have grow large and strong with they fat feeding and wise with they many experience the duck and goose vanish drive southward ahead of the fierce autumn gale and only the late brood of hardy eider be leave for a little season herr and caplin have long since drift away into unknown depths where the tide flow endlessly over they and bring never a one ashore hare and ptarmigan turn white to hide on the snow so that wolf and fox would pass close by without see they wood-mice push they wind tunnel and make they vault play room deep under the drift where none might molest nor make they afraid and all game grow wary and wild learning from experience as it always do that only the keen can survive the fall hunting so the long winter with its snow and ice and its bitter cold and its grim threat of famine settle heavily over harbor weal and the long range where wayeese must find he live _ the white wolf 's hunting _ threaten as the northern winter be with its stern order to the bird to depart and to the beast to put on they thick fur and to the little folk of the snow to hide themselves in white coat and to all live thing to watch well the way that they take it could bring no terror to wayeese and she powerful young cub the gladness of life be upon they with none of its pain or anxiety or fear as we know they and they roll and tumble about in the first deep snow with the abandon of young fox fill with wonder at the strange blanket that cover the rough place of earth so softly and make they light footstep more noiseless than before for to be noiseless and inconspicuous and so in harmony with he surroundings be the first desire of every creature of the vast solitude meet the wolf now as they roam wild and free over the great range one would hardly have recognize the little brown creature that he see play about the den where the trail begin the cub be already noble-looking brute larger than the largest husky dog and the parent be taller with longer leg and more massive head and powerful jaw than any great timber-wolf a tremendous vitality thrill in they from nose to paw tip they great body as they lay quiet in the snow with head raise and hind leg bent under they be like powerful engine tranquil under enormous pressure and when they rise the movement be like the quick snap of a steel spring indeed half the ordinary movement of wayeese be so quick that the eye can not follow they one instant a wolf would be lie flat on he side he long leg outstretch on the moss he eye close in the sleepy sunshine he body limp as a hound 's after a fox chase the next instant like the click and blink of a camera shutter he would be stand alert on all four foot question the pass breeze or look intently into you eye and you could not imagine much less follow the recoil of twenty big electric muscle that at some subtle warning have snap he automatically from one position to the other they be all snow-white with long thick hair and a heavy mane that add enormously to they impose appearance and they carry they bushy tail almost straight out as they trot along with a slight crook near the body -- the true wolf sign that still reappear in many collie to tell a degenerate race of a noble ancestry after the first deep snow the family separated lead by they grow hunger and by the difficulty of find enough game in one cover to supply all they need the mother and the smallest cub remain together the two larger cub range on the other side of the mountain beat the bush and hunting into each other 's mouth as they have be train to do while the big he-wolf hunt successfully by himself as he have do for year scatter as they be they still keep track of each other faithfully and in a casual way look after one another 's need wherever he be a wolf seem to know by instinct where he fellow be hunting many mile away when in doubt he have only to mount the highest hill and give the rally cry which carry a enormous distance in the still cold air to bring the pack swiftly and silently about he at time when the cub be hungry after a two-day fast they would hear faint and far away the food cry _ yap-yap-yooo yap-yap-yoooooo _ quiver under the star in the tense early-morning air and would dart away to find game freshly kill by one of the old wolf await they again at nightfall a cub 's hunting cry _ ooooo ow-ow ooooo ow-ow _ a deep almost musical hoot with two short bark at the end would come singing down from the upland and the wolf leave instantly the game they be follow would hasten up to find the two cub herd a caribou in a cleft of the rock -- a young caribou that have lose he mother at the hand of the hunter and that do not know how to take care of himself and one of the cub would hold he there sit on he tail in front of the caribou to prevent he escape while the other cub call the wolf away from they own hunting to come and join the feast whether this be a conscious attempt to spare the game or to alarm it as little as need be it be impossible to say certainly the wolf know better apparently than man that persistent hunting destroy its own object and that caribou especially when much alarm by dog or wolf or man will take the alarm quickly and the scatter herd move by a common impulse of danger will trail far away to other range that be why the wolf unlike the less intelligent dog hunt always in a silent stealthy unobtrusive way and why he stop hunting and go away the instant he own hunger be satisfied or another wolf kill enough for all and that be also the probable reason why he let the deer alone as long as he can find any other game this same intelligent provision be show in another curious way when a wolf in he wide range find a good hunting-ground where small game be plentiful he would snap up a rabbit silently in the twilight and then go far away perhaps to join the other cub in a gambol or to follow they to the cliff over a fishing village and set all the dog to howling by day he would lie close in some thick cover mile away from he hunting-ground at twilight he would steal back and hunt quietly just long enough to get he game and then trot away again leave the cover as unharried as if there be not a wolf in the whole neighborhood such a good hunting-ground can not long remain hide from other prowler in the wilderness and wayeese who be keep he discovery to himself would soon cross the trail of a certain old fox return day after day to the same good cover no two fox nor mouse nor man nor any other two animal for that matter ever leave the same scent -- any old hound which will hold steadily to one fox though a dozen other cross or cover he trail will show you that plainly in a day 's hunting -- and the wolf would soon know surely that the same fox be poach every night on he own preserve while he be away to a casual wander hunter he pay no attention but this cunning poacher must be lay by the heel else there would not be a single rabbit leave in the cover so wayeeses instead of hunting himself at twilight when the rabbit be stir would wait till midday when the sun be warm and fox be sleepy and then come back to find the poacher 's trail and follow it to where eleemo be rest for the day in a sunny opening in the scrub there wayeese would steal upon he from behind and put a end to he poach or else if the fox use the same nest daily as be often the case when he be not disturb the wolf would circle the scrub warily to find the path by which eleemo usually come out on he night 's hunting when he find that out wayeese would dart away in the long rolling gallop that carry a wolf swiftly over the roughest country without fatigue in a hour or two he would be back again with another wolf then eleemo doze away in the winter sunshine would hear a unusual racket in the scrub behind he -- some heavy animal brushing about heedlessly and sniff loudly at a cold trail no wolf certainly for a wolf make no noise so eleemo would get down from he warm rock and slip away stop to look back and listen jauntily to the clumsy brute behind he till he run plump into the jaw of the other wolf that be watch alert and silent beside the runway when the snow be deep and soft the wolf take to hunting the lynx -- big savage long-clawed fighter that swarm in the interior of newfoundland and play havoc with the small game for a single lynx the wolf hunt in pair trail the big prowler stealthily and rush upon he from behind with a fierce uproar to startle the wit out of he stupid head and send he off headlong as cat go before he know what be after he away he would go in mighty jump sink shoulder deep often indeed up to he tufted ear at every plunge after he race the wolf run lightly and take advantage of the hole he have make in the soft snow till a swift snap in he flank bring upweeki up with a ferocious snarl to tear in piece he pursuer then begin as savage a bit of fight as the wood ever witness tooth against talon wolf cunning against cat ferocity crouch in the snow spit and snarl he tooth bare and round eye blaze and long claw ache to close in a death grip upweeki wait impatient as a fury for the rush he be a ugly fighter but he must always get close grip he enemy with tooth and fore claw while the hind claw get in they deadly work kick downward in powerful spasmodic blow and rip everything before they a dog would rush in now and be tear to piece but not so the wolf dance lightly about the big lynx they would watch they chance to leap and snap sometimes avoid the blow of the swift paw with its terrible claw and sometimes catch it on they heavy mane but always a long red mark show on the lynx 's silver fur as the wolf ' tooth click with the voice of a steel trap and they leap aside without serious injury as the big cat grow blind in he fury they would seize they chance like a flash and leap together one pair of long jaw would close hard on the spine behind the tufted ear another pair would grip a hind leg while the wolf spring apart and brace to hold then the fight be all over and the moose bird in pair come flit in silently to see if there be not a few unconsidered trifle of the feast for they to dispose of occasionally at nightfall the wolf ' hunting cry would ring out of the wood as one of the cub discover three or four of the lynx growl horribly over some game they have pull down together for upweeki too though generally a solitary fellow often roam with a savage band of freebooter to hunt the larger animal in the bitter winter weather no young wolf would ever run into one of these band alone but when the pack roll in upon they like a tempest the lynx would leap squalling away in a blind rush and the two big wolf cut in from the end of the charge line would turn a lynx kit deftly aside for the cub to hold then another for themselves and the hunt be over -- all but the feast at the end of it when a big and cunning lynx take to a tree at the first alarm the wolf would go aside to leeward where upweeki could not see they but where they nose tell they perfectly all that he be do then begin the long game of patience the wolf wait for the game to come down and the lynx wait for the wolf to go away upweeki be at a disadvantage for he could not see when he have win and he generally come down in a hour or two only to find the wolf hot on he trail before he have take a dozen jump whereupon he take to another tree and the game begin again -lrb- illustration : the silent appalling death-watch begin -rrb- when the night be exceed cold -- and one who have not feel it can hardly imagine the bitter killing intensity of a northern midnight in February -- the wolf instead of go away would wait under the tree in which the lynx have take refuge and the silent appalling death-watch begin a lynx though heavily fur can not long remain expose in the intense cold without move moreover he must grip the branch on which he sit more or less firmly with he claw to keep from fall and the tense muscle which flex the long claw to drive they into the wood soon grow weary and numb in the bitter frost the wolf meanwhile trot about to keep warm while the stupid cat sit in one spot slowly perish and never think of run up and down the tree to keep himself alive the foot grow benumb at last powerless to hold on any longer and the lynx tumble off into the wolf ' jaw or else know the danger he leap for the nearest wolf and die fight spite of the killing cold the problem of keep warm be to the wolf always a simple one move along through the winter night always on a swift silent trot they pick up what game come in they way and scarcely feel the eager cold that nip at they ear or the wind keen as a icicle that strive to penetrate the shaggy white coat that cover they when they hunger be satisfied or when the late day come and find they still hunting hopefully they would push they way into the thick scrub from one of the numerous path and lie down on a nest of leaf which even in midwinter be dry as if no snow or rain have ever fall there where no wind or gale however strong could penetrate and with the snow fill the low branch overhead and pile over they in a soft warm blanket three foot thick they would push they sensitive nose into they own thick fur to keep they warm and sleep comfortably till the early twilight come and call they out again to the hunting at time when not near the scrub they would burrow deep into a great drift of snow and sleep in the warmest kind of a nest -- a trick that the husky dog which be but wolf of yesterday still remember like all wild animal they feel the come of a storm long before the first white flake begin to whirl in the air and when a great storm threaten they would lie down to sleep in a cave or a cranny of the rock and let the drift pile soft and warm over they however long the storm they never stir abroad partly for they own comfort partly because all game lie hide at such time and it be practically impossible even for a wolf to find it when a wolf have feed full he can go a week without eat and suffer no great discomfort so wayeese would lie close and warm while the snow pile deep around he and the gale rage over the sea and mountain but pass unfelt and unheeded over he head then when the storm be over he paw he way up through the drift and come out in a new bright world where the game with appetite sharpen by the long fast be already stir briskly in every covert when march come the bitterest month of all for the wood folk even wayeese be often hard press to find a live small game grow scarce and very wild the caribou have wander far away to other range and the cub would dig for hour after a mouse or stalk a snowbird or wait with endless patience for a red squirrel to stop he chatter and come down to search under the snow for a fir cone that he have hide there in the good autumn day and once when the hunger within be more nipping than the eager cold without one of the cub find a bear sleep in he winter den among the rock with a sharp hunting cry that sing like a bullet over the frozen waste he call the whole pack about he while the rest lay in hide the old he-wolf approach warily and scratch mooween out of he den and then run away to entice the big brute into the open ground where the pack roll in upon he and kill he in a terrible fight before he have fairly shake the sleep out of he eye old tomah the trapper be abroad now take advantage of the spring hunger the wolf often cross he snow-shoe trail or follow it swiftly to see whither it lead for a wolf like a farm dog be never satisfied till he know the way of every living thing that cross he range follow the broad trail wayeese would find here a trap animal struggle desperately with the clog and the cruel gripping tooth there the flay carcass of a lynx or a otter and yonder the leg of a dog or a piece of caribou meat hang by a cord over a runway with the snow disturbed beneath it where the deadly trap be hide one glance or a sniff at a distance be enough for the wolf lynx do not go about the range without they skin and meat do not naturally hang on tree so wayeese know all the way of the wood would ignore these bait absolutely nevertheless he follow the snow-shoe trail until he know where every unnatural thing lay hidden and no matter how hungry he be or how cunningly the old indian hide he device or however deep the new snow cover all trace of man 's work wayeese pass by on the other side and keep he dainty foot out of every snare and pitfall once when the two cub that hunt together be hard pinch with hunger they find old tomah in the twilight and follow he stealthily the old indian be swing along silent as a shadow of the wood he gun on he shoulder and some skin on he back head swiftly for the little hut under the cliff where he burrow for the night as snug as a bear in he den a old wolf would have know instantly the danger for man alone bite at a distance but the lop-eared cub which be larger than he brother and therefore the leader raise he head for the hunting cry the first yap have hardly leave he throat when the thunder roar and something sear the wolf 's side like a hot iron the cub vanish like the smoke from the old gun then the indian come swiftly back on the trail peer about with hawk eye to see the effect of he shot by cosh miss um dat time mu ' be powder no good then as he read the plain record in the snow one -- by cosh two hwulf lil fool hwulf follow my footin ' mu ' be more come soon pretty quick now else he don ' howl dat way guess mebbe ol' injun better stay in house night and he trail warily back to hide himself behind a rock and watch till dark in front of he little _ commoosie _ old tomah 's sleep be sound as usual that night so he could not see the five shadow that steal out of the wood nor hear the light footfall that circle he camp nor feel the breath soft as a eddy of wind in a spruce top that whiff at the crack under he door and drift away again next morning he see the track and understand they and as he trail away through the still wood he be wonder in he silent indian way why a old wolf should always bring malsunsis the cub for a good look and a sniff at anything that he be to avoid ever after when all else fail follow the caribou -- that be the law which govern the wolf in the hungry day but before they cross the mountain and follow the long valley to the far southern range the wolf go back to the hill where the trail begin for a more exciting and dangerous kind of hunting the pack have hold closer together of late for the old wolf must often share even a scant fox or rabbit with the hungry and inexperienced youngster now when famine drive they to the very door of the one enemy to be fear only the wisest and wariest old wolf be fit to lead the foray the little fishing village be bury under drift and almost desert a few man linger to watch the boat and house but the family have all go inland to the winter tilt for wood and shelter by night the wolf would come stealthily to prowl among the desert lane and the fisherman asleep in they clothes under caribou skin or sit close by the stove behind bar door would know nothing of the huge gaunt form that flit noiselessly past the frosted window if a pig be leave in he pen a sudden terrible squealing would break out on the still night and when the fisherman rush out the pen would be empty with nothing whatever to account for piggie 's disappearance for to they untrained eye even the track of the wolf be cover up by those of the numerous big husky if a cat prowl abroad or a uneasy dog scratch to be let out there would be a squall a yelp -- and the cat would not come back and the dog would never scratch at the door to be let in again only when nothing stir in the village when the dog and cat have be spirit away and when not even a rat steal from under the house to gnaw at a fishbone would the fisherman know of they big silent visitor then the wolf would gather on a snow-drift just outside the village and raise a howl a frightful wail of famine and disappointment that make the air shudder from within the house the dog answer with mad clamor a door would open to show first a long seal gun then a fisherman then a fool dog that dart between the fisherman 's leg and caper away ki-yi-ing a challenge to the universe a silence tense as a bowstr a sudden yelp -- _ hui-hui _ as the fisherman whistle to the dog that be be whisk away over the snow with a grip on he throat that prevent any answer then the fisherman would wait and call in vain and shiver and go back to the fire again almost every pleasant day a train of dog would leave the village and go far back on the hill to haul fire-wood or pole for the new fish-flake the wolf watch from they old den would follow at a distance to pick up a careless dog that venture away from the fire to hunt rabbit when he harness be take off occasionally a solitary wood-chopper would start with sudden alarm as a big white form glide into sight and the alarm would be follow by genuine terror as he find himself surround by five huge wolf that sit on they tail watch he curiously grip he ax he would hurry back to call he companion and harness the dog and hurry back to the village before the early darkness should fall upon they as the komatik go career over the snow the dog yelp and strain at the harness the man run alongside shout _ hi-hi _ and crack they whip they could still see over they shoulder the wolf follow lightly close behind but when they rush breathless into they house and grab they gun and run back on the trail there be nothing to be see for the wolf quick as light to feel the presence of danger be already far away trot swiftly up the frozen arm of the harbor follow another sledge trail which come down that morning from the wilderness that same night the wolf appear silently in the little lodge far up the southeast brook where in a sheltered hollow of the hill the fisherman 's family be sleep away the bitter winter here for one long night they watch and wait in vain for every living thing be safe in the tilt behind bar door in the morning little noel 's eye kindle as he see the wolf ' track and when they come back again the tilt be watch as the lop-eared cub dart after a cat that shoot like a ray of moonlight under a cabin a window open noiselessly and _ zing _ a bowstr twang its sharp warning in the tense silence with a yelp the wolf tear the arrow from he shoulder the warm blood follow the barb and he lap it eagerly in he hunger then as the danger sweep over he he give the trail cry and dart away door bang open here and there dog bark to crack they throat seal gun roar out and send they heavy echo crash like thunder among the hill silence fall again over the lodge and there be leave only a few frightened dog whose nose have already tell they everything a few fisherman who watch and listen and one indian boy with a long bow in he hand and a arrow ready on the string who trail away with a little girl at he side try to puzzle out the track of one wolf that leave a drop of blood here and there on the snow in the scant moonlight far up on the hillside in a little opening of the wood the scatter pack come together again at the first uproar so unbearable to a silence-loving animal they have vanish in five different direction yet so subtle so perfect be the instinct which hold a wolf family together that the old mother have scarcely enter the glade alone and sit down to wait and listen when the other wolf join she silently malsunsis the big cub scarcely feel he wound at first for the arrow have but glance through the thick skin and flesh and he have tear it out without difficulty but the old he-wolf limp painfully and hold up one fore leg pierce by a seal shot as he lope away over the snow it be they first rough experience with man and probably the one feeling in every shaggy head be of puzzle wonder as to how and why it have all happen hitherto they have avoid man with a certain awe or watch they curiously at a distance try to understand they superior way and never a hostile feeling for the master of the wood have find place in a wolf 's breast now man have speak at last he voice be a brutal command to be go and curiously enough these powerful big brute any one of which could have pull down a man more easily than a caribou never think of question the order it be certainly time to follow the caribou -- that be probably the one definite purpose that come upon the wolf sit in a silent question circle in the moonlight with only the deep snow and the empty wood around they for a week they have not touch food for thrice that time they have not feed full and a few day more would leave they unable to cope with the big caribou which be always full fed and strong thanks to nature 's abundance of deer moss on the barren so they start as by a single impulse and the mother wolf lead they swiftly southward hour after hour at a tireless pace till the great he-wolf weaken and turn aside to nurse he wounded fore leg the lop-eared cub draw out of the race at the same time he own wound now require the soft massage of he tongue to allay the fever and besides the fear that be bear in he one night long ago and that have sleep ever since be now awake again and for the first time he be afraid to face the famine and the wilderness alone so the pack sweep on as if they foot would never tire and the two wound wolf creep into the scrub and lay down together a strange terrible feeling steal swiftly over the covert which have always hitherto be a place of rest and quiet content the cub be lick he wound softly when he look up in sudden alarm and there be the great he-wolf look at he hungrily with a frightful flare in he green eye the cub move away startle and try to soothe he wound again but the uncanny feeling be strong upon he still and when he turn he head there be the big wolf which have creep forward till he could see the cub behind a twisted spruce root watch he steadily with the same horrible stare in he unblinking eye the hackles rise up on the cub 's neck and a growl rumble in he deep chest for he know now what it all mean the smell of blood be in the air and the old he-wolf that have so often share he kill to save the cub be now go crazy in he awful hunger another moment and there would have be a terrible duel in the scrub but as the wolf spring to they foot and face each other some deep unknown feeling stir within they and they turn aside the old wolf throw himself down heavily face away from the temptation and the cub slip aside to find another den out of sight and smell of the huge leader lest the scent of blood should overcome they again and cause they to fly at each other 's throat in uncontrollable fury next morning a queer thing happen but not uncommon under the circumstance among wolf and husky the cub be lie motionless he head on he paw he eye wide open when something stir near he a red squirrel come scamper through the scrub branch just under the thick coating of snow that fill all they top slowly carefully the young wolf gather he foot under he tense as a bowstring as the squirrel whisk overhead the wolf leap like a flash catch he and crush he with a single grip then with the squirrel in he mouth he make he way back to where the big leader be lie he head on he paw he eye turn aside slowly warily the cub approach with a friendly twist of he ear and head till he lay the squirrel at the big wolf 's very nose then draw back a step and lay with paw extend and tail thump the leaf watch till the tidbit be seize ravenously and crushed and bolt in a single mouthful next instant both wolf spring to they foot and make they way out of the scrub together they take up the trail of the pack where they have leave it and follow it ten hour the cub at a swift trot the old wolf lope along on three leg then a rest and forward again slower and slower night after day in ever-failing strength till on the edge of a great barren they stop as if strike tremble all over as the reek of game pour into they starve nostril too weak now to kill or to follow the fleet caribou they lay down in the snow wait they ear cock they nose question every breeze for its good news leave to themselves the trail must end here for they could go no farther but somewhere ahead in the vast silent barren the cub be trail and somewhere beyond they the old mother wolf be lay she ambush -- hark from a spur of the valley far below on they left ring out the food cry singing its way in the frosty air over wood and plain and hurry back over the trail to tell those who have fall by the way that they be not forget and when they leap up as at a electric shock and race for the cry there be the cub and the mother wolf they hunger already satisfied and there in the snow a young bull caribou to save they so the long hard winter pass away and spring come again with its abundance grouse drum a welcome in the wood the _ honk _ of wild goose fill the air with a joyous clangor and in every open pool the duck be quack no need now to cling like shadow to the herd of caribou and no further need for the pack to hold together the tie that hold they melt like snow in the sunny hollow first the old wolf then the cub one by one drift away whither the game or they new mate be call they when the summer come there be another den on the high hill overlook the harbor where the little brown cub could look down with wonder at the shine sea and the slow fishing-boat and the child play on the shore but the wolf whose trail begin there be far away over the mountain follow they own way wait for the crisp hunting cry that should bring they again together _ trail that cross in the snow _ be we lose little brother say mooka shiver no need of the question startling and terrible as it be from the lip of a child astray in the vast solitude for a great gale have swoop down from the arctic blot out in cloud of whirling snow the world of plain and mountain and forest that a moment before have stretch wide and still before the little hunter ' eye for a hour or more run like startle deer they have try to follow they own snow-shoe trail back over the wide barren into the friendly wood but already the snow have fill it brim full and whatever faint trace be leave of the long raquette be catch up by the gale and whirl away with a howl of exultation before they as they run every trail of wolf and caribou and snow-shoe and every distant landmark have vanish the world be but a chaos of mad rolling snow cloud and behind they -- they stout little heart tremble as they see not a vestige of the trail they have just make with the great world itself they own little track as fast as they make they be sweep and blot out of existence like two sparrow that have drop blind and bewilder on the vast plain out of the snow cloud they huddle together without one friendly sign to tell they whence they have come or whither they be go worst of all the instinct of direction which often guide a indian through the still fog or the darkest night seem benumb by the cold and the tumult and not even old tomah himself could have tell north or south in the blind storm still they run on bravely bend to the fierce blast head the wind as best they could till mooka tripping a second time in a little hollow where a brook run deep under the snow and know now that they be but wander in a endless circle seize noel 's arm and repeat she question : be we lose little brother and noel lose and bewilder but grip he bow in he fur mitten and peer here and there like a old hunter through the whirling flake and roll gust to catch some landmark some lofty crag or low tree-line that hold steady in the mad dance of the world still make confident indian answer : noel not lose noel right here camp lose little sister can we find um little brother oh yes we find um find um bimeby pretty soon quick now after storm but storm last all night and it be soon dark can we rest and not freeze mooka tired and -- and frighten little brother sartin we rest build um _ commoosie _ and sleep jus ' like bear in he den oh yes sartin we rest good say noel cheerfully and the wolf little brother whisper mooka look back timidly into the wild waste out of which they have come never mind hwolve nothing hunt in storm little sister come on we must find um wood now for one brief moment the little hunter stand with upturned face while mooka bow she head silently and the great storm roll unheeded over they still hold he long bow he stretch both hand to the sky in the mute appeal that _ keesuolukh _ the great mystery whom we call god would understand better than all word then turn they back to the gale they drift swiftly away before it like two wind-blown leaf run to keep from freezing and hold each other 's hand tight lest they separate and be lose by the way the second winter have come seal up the gloomy land till it ring like iron at the touch then cover it deep with snow and polish its mute white face with hoar-frost and hail drive onward by the fierce arctic gale a appalling silence rest on plain and mountain not a chirp not a rustle break the intense unnatural stillness one might travel all day long without a sight or sound of life and when the early twilight come and life stir shyly from its covert and snow cave the wood folk steal out into the bare white world on noiseless hesitate foot as if in presence of the dead when the moon of famine come the silence be rudely break before daylight one morning when the air be so tense and still that a whisper set it tinkle like silver bell the rally cry of the wolf roll down from a mountain top and the three cub that have wait long for the signal leave they separate trail far away and hurry to join the old leader when the sun rise that morning one who stand on the high ridge of the top gallant far to the eastward of harbor weal would have see seven trail wind down among the rock and thicket it need only a glance to show that the seven trail each one as clear-cut and delicate as that of a prowl fox be the record of wolf ' cautious foot and that they be no longer beat the thicket for grouse and rabbit but move swiftly all together for the edge of the vast barren where the caribou herd be feed another glance -- but here we must have the cunning eye of old tomah the hunter -- would have tell that two of the trail be those of enormous wolf which lead the pack two other be plainly cub that have not yet lose the cub trick of frolic in the soft snow while three other be just wolf big and powerful brute that move as if on steel spring and that still hold to the old pack because the time have not yet come for they to scatter finally to they separate way and head new pack of they own in the great solitude out from the wood on the other side of the barren come two snow-shoe trail which advance with short step and rest lightly on the snow as if the maker of the trail be little people whose weight on the snow-shoe make hardly more impression than the broad pad of moktaque the rabbit they follow stealthily the wind record of a score of caribou that have wander like a eddy wind all over the barren stop here and there to paw great hole in the snow for the caribou moss that cover all the earth beneath out at the end of the trail two indian child a girl and a boy steal along with noiseless step scan the wide waste for a cloud of mist -- the frozen breath that hover over a herd of caribou -- or peer keenly into the edge of the wood for vague white shape move like shadow among the tree so they move on swiftly silently till the boy stop with a startled exclamation whip out a long arrow with a barb steel point and lay it ready across he bow for at he foot be another light trail the trail of a wolf pack that cross he own move straight and swift across the barren toward the unseen caribou just in front as the boy stop a slight motion break the even white surface that stretch away silent and lifeless on every side -- a motion so faint and natural that noel 's keen eye sweep the plain and the edge of the distant wood never notice it a vagrant wind which have be wander and moan all morning as if lose seem to stir the snow and settle to rest again but now where the plain seem most empty and lifeless seven great white wolf crouch down in the snow in a little hollow they paw extend they hind leg bent like powerful spring beneath they they head raise cautiously so that only they ear and eye show above the rim of the little hollow where they hide so they lay tense alert ready watch with eager inquisitive eye the two child draw steadily nearer the only sign of life in the whole wide desolate landscape \* \* \* \* \* follow the back trail of the snow-shoe now while the wolf be wait and it lead you over the great barren into the gloomy spruce wood beyond that it cross two more barren and stretch of intervene forest then up a great hill and down into a valley where the lodge lay hidden bury deep under newfoundland snow here the fisherman live sleep away the bitter winter in the late autumn they have leave the fishing village at harbor weal drive out like the wild duck by the fierce gale that rage over the whole coast with they abundant family and scant provision they have follow the trail up the southwest brook till it double around the mountain and lead into a great silent wood sheltered on every side by the encircle hill here the tilt be build with double wall fill in between with leaf and moss to help the little stove that struggle bravely with the terrible cold and the roof be cover over with pole and bark or with the brown sail that have once drive the fishing-boat out and in on the wing of the gale the high mountain on the west stand between they and the icy wind that sweep down over the sea from the labrador and the arctic waste wood in abundance be at they door and the trout-stream that sing all day long under its bridge of snow and ice be always ready to brim they kettle out of its abundance so the new life begin pleasantly enough but as the winter wear away and provision grow scarce and game vanish from the covert they all feel the fearful pinch of famine every morning now a confused circle of track in the snow show where the wild prowler of the wood have come and sniff at the very door of the tilt in they ravening hunger noel 's father and old tomah be far away trapping in the interior and to noel with he snare and he bow and arrow fall the pleasant task of supply the family 's need when the stock of dry fish melt away on this march morning he have start with mooka at daylight to cross the mountain to some great barren where he have find track and know that a few herd of caribou be still feed the sun be dim as it rise and the sun-dog give mute warning of the come storm but the cupboard be empty at home and even a little hunter think first of the game he be follow and let the storm take care of itself so they hurry on unheeding -- noel with he bow and arrow mooka with a little bag contain a loaf and a few dry caplin -- peer under every brush pile for the shine eye of a rabbit and pick up one big grouse and a few ptarmigan among the bowlder of a great bare hillside on the edge of the great barren under the top gallant they find the fresh track of feed caribou and be follow eagerly when they run plump into the wolf trail now by every law of the chase the game belong to these earlier hunter and by every power in they gaunt famished body the wolf mean to have it so say the trail every stealthy advance in single file across the open every swift rush over the hollow that might hide they from eye watch back from the distant wood show the wolf ' purpose clear as daylight and have noel be wiser he would have read a warning from the snow and turn aside but he only draw he longest keenest arrow and press on more eagerly than before the two trail have cross each other at last beginning near together one on the mountain the other by the sea they have follow they separate devious way now far apart in the glad bright summer now draw together in the moonlight of the winter 's night at time the maker of the trail have watch each other in secret shyly inquisitively at a distance but always fear or cunning have keep they apart the boy with he keen hunter 's interest baffle and whet by the brute ' wariness and the wolf draw to the superior being by that subtle instinct that once make glad hunting-dog and collie of the wild ranger of the plain and that still lead a wolf to follow and watch the doings of man with intense curiosity now the trail have meet fairly in the snow and a few step more would bring the boy and the wolf face to face \* \* \* \* \* noel be steal along warily he arrow ready on the string mooka beside he be watch a faint cloud of mist the breath of caribou that blur at time the dark tree-line in the distance when one of those mysterious warning that befall the hunter in the far north rest upon they suddenly like a heavy hand i know not what it be -- what lesser pressure of air to which we respond like a barometer or what unknown chord there be within we that sleep for year in the midst of society and that waken and answer like a animal 's to the subtle influence of nature -- but one can never be watch by a unseen wild animal without feel it vaguely and one can never be so keen on the trail that the storm before it break will not whisper a warn to turn back to shelter before it be too late to noel and mooka alone on the barren the sun be no dimmer than before the heavy gray bank of cloud still hold sullenly to its place on the horizon and no eye however keen would have notice the tiny dark spot that center and glow upon they over the rim of the little hollow where the wolf be watch nevertheless a sudden chill fall upon they both they stop abruptly shiver a bit draw closer together and scan the waste keenly to know what it all mean _ mitcheegeesookh _ the storm say noel sharply and without another word they turn and hurry back on they own trail in a short half hour the world would be swallow up in chaos to be catch out on the barren mean to be lose and to be lose here without fire and shelter mean death swift and sure so they run on hope to strike the wood before the blizzard burst upon they they be scarcely half-way to shelter when the white flake begin to whirl around they with startling terrible swiftness the familiar world vanish the guide trail be blot out and nothing but a wolf 's instinct could have hold a straight course in the blinding fury of the storm still they hold on bravely try in vain to keep they direction by the eddy wind till mooka stumble twice at the same hollow over a hidden brook and they know they be run blindly in a circle of death frighten at the discovery they turn as the caribou do keep they back steadily to the wind and drift slowly away down the long barren hour after hour they struggle on hand in hand without a thought of where they be go twice mooka fall and lay still but be drag to she foot and hurry onward again the little hunter 's own strength be almost go when a low moan rise steadily above the howl and hiss of the gale it be the spruce wood bend they top to the blast and groan at the strain with a wild whoop noel plunge forward and the next instant they be safe within the wood all around they the flake sift steadily silently down into the thick covert while the storm pass with a great roar over they head in the lee of a low-branched spruce they stop again as though by a common impulse while noel lift he hand thanks thanks _ keesuolukh _ we can take care of ourselves now the brave little heart be singing under the upstretched arm then they tumble into the snow and lay for a moment utterly relax like two tired animal in that brief delicious rest which follow a terrible struggle with the storm and cold first they eat a little of they bread and fish to keep up they spirit then -- for the storm that be upon they might last for day -- they set about prepare a shelter with a little search whoop to each other lest they stray away they find a big dry stub that some gale have snap off a few foot above the snow while mooka scurry about collect birch bark and armful of dry branch noel take off he snow-shoe and begin with one of they to shovel away the snow in a semicircle around the base of the stub in a short half-hour he have a deep hole there with the snow bank up around it to the height of he head next with he knife he cut a lot of light pole and scrub spruce and stick the butt in he snowbank lay the top like the stick of a wigwam firmly against the big stub a few armful of spruce bough shingle over this roof and a few minute ' work shoveling snow thickly upon they to hold they in place and to make a warm cover then a doorway or rather a narrow tunnel just beyond the stub on the straight side of the semicircle and they _ commoosie _ be all ready let the storm roar and the snow sift down the thicker it fall the warmer would be they shelter they laugh and shout now as they scurry out and in bring bough for a bed and the fire-wood which mooka have gather against the base of the dry stub they build they fire -- a wee sociable little fire such as a indian always build which be far better than a big one for it draw you near and welcome you cheerily instead of drive you away by its smoke and great heat soon the big stub itself begin to burn glowing steadily with a heat that fill the snug little _ commoosie _ while the smoke find its way out of the hole in the roof which noel have leave for that purpose later the stub burn through to its hollow center and then they have a famous chimney which soon grow hot and glowing inside and add its mite to the child 's comfort noel and mooka be drowsy now but before the long night close in upon they they have gather more wood and lay aside some wisp of birch bark to use when they should wake cold and shiver and find they little fire go out and the big stub lose its cheery glow then they lay down to rest and the night and the storm roll on unheeded towards morning they fall into a heavy sleep for the big stub begin to burn more freely as the wind change and they need not stir every half hour to feed they little fire and keep from freezing it be broad daylight the storm have cease and a woodpecker be hammer loudly on a hollow shell over they head when they start up wonder vaguely where they be then while noel break out of the _ commoosie _ which be fairly bury under the snow to find out where he be mooka rebuilt the fire and pluck a ptarmigan and set it to toast with the last of they bread over the coal noel come back soon with a cheery whoop to tell the little cook that they have drift before the storm down the whole length of the great barren and be camp now on the opposite side just under the highest ridge of the top gallant there be not a track on the barren he say not a sign of wolf or caribou which have probably wander deeper into the wood for shelter so they eat they bread to the last crumb and they bird to the last bone and give up all thought of hunting start up the big barren head for the distant lodge where they have long since be give up for lose they have cross the barren and a mile of thick wood beyond when they run into the fresh trail of a dozen caribou follow it swiftly they come to the edge of a much smaller barren that they have cross yesterday and see at a glance that the trail stretch straight across it not a caribou be in sight but they might nevertheless be feed or rest in the wood just beyond and for the little hunter to show themselves now in the open would mean that they would become instantly the target for every keen eye that be watch the back trail so they start warily to circle the barren keep just within the fringe of wood out of sight they have go scarcely a hundred step when noel whip out a long arrow and point silently across the open from the wood on the other side the caribou have break out of a dozen tunnel under the spruce and come trot back in they old trail straight downwind to where the little hunter be hide the deer be act queerly -- now plunge away with the high awkward jump that caribou use when startle now swing off on they swift tireless rack and before they have settle to they stride halt suddenly to look back and wag they ear at the trail for megaleep be full of curiosity as a wild turkey and always stop to get a little entertainment out of every new thing that do not threaten he with instant death then out of the wood behind they trot five white wolf -- not hunting certainly for whenever the caribou stop to look the wolf sit down on they tail and yawn one lay down and roll over and over in the soft snow another chase and caper after he own brush whirling round and round like a little whirlwind and the shrill _ ki-yus _ of a cub wolf playing come faintly across the barren it be a strange scene yet one often witness on the lonely plain of the far north : the caribou halt run away and halt again to look back and watch the queer antic of they big enemy which seem now so playful and harmless the cunning wolf play on the game 's curiosity at every turn know well that if once frighten the deer would break away at a pace which would make pursuit hopeless so they follow rather than drive the foolish deer across the barren hold they with monkey trick and kitten 's caper and restrain with a iron grip they own fearful hunger and the blind impulse to rush in headlong and have it all quickly over kneel behind a big spruce noel be try nervously the spring and temper of he long bow divide in desire between the caribou which they need sadly at home and one of the great wolf whose death would give he a place among the mighty hunter when mooka clutch he arm she eye snap with excitement she finger point silently back on they own trail a vague shadow glide swiftly among the tree a enormous white wolf appear vanish come near they again and crouch down under a low spruce branch wait again the two trail have cross in the snow the big wolf as he appear have thrust he nose into the snow-shoe track and a sniff or two tell he everything -- who have pass and how long ago and what they be do and how far ahead they be now wait but the caribou be come coax along marvelously by the cub and the old mother and the great silent wolf that have leave the pack playing with the game while he circle the barren at top speed now turn to the business in hand with no thought nor fear of harm from the two child whom he have watch but yesterday not so noel the fire blaze out in he eye the long bow swing to the wolf bend like a steel spring and the feathered shaft of a arrow lay close against the boy 's cheek but mooka catch he arm -- look noel he ear _ malsunsis _ my little wolf cub she breathe excitedly and noel with a great wonder in he eye slack he bow while he thought jump far away to the den on the mountain where the trail begin and to three little cub play like kitten with the grasshopper and the cloud shadow for the great wolf that lay so still near they he eye fix in a steady glow upon the come caribou have one ear bent sharply forward like a leaf that have be crease between the finger again mooka break the tense silence in a low whisper how many wolf trail you see yesterday little brother seven say noel whose eye already have the cunning of old tomah 's to understand everything then where tother wolf only six here breathe mooka look timidly all around fear to find the steady glare of green eye fix upon they from the shadow of every thicket noel stir uneasily somewhere close at hand another huge wolf be wait and a wholesome fear fall upon he with a shiver at the thought of how near he have come in he excitement to bring the whole savage pack snarl about he ear a snort of alarm cut short he think there at the edge of the wood not twenty foot away stand a caribou point he ear at the child whom he have almost stumble over as he run think only of the wolf behind the long bow spring back of itself a arrow buzz like a wasp and bury itself deep in the white chest like a flash a second arrow follow as the stag turn away and with a jump or two he sink to he knee as if to rest awhile in the snow but mooka scarcely see these thing she eye be fasten on the great white wolf which she have claim for she own when he be a toddle cub he lay still as a stone under the tip of a bend spruce branch he eye follow every motion of a young bull caribou which three of the wolf have single out of the herd and be now guide surely straight to he hiding-place the snort and plunge of the smitten animal startle this young stag and he turn aside from he course like a shadow the big wolf that mooka be watch change he place so as to head the game while two of the pack on the open barren slip around the caribou and turn he back again to the wood at the edge of the cover the stag stop for a last look point he ear first at noel 's caribou which now lay very still in the snow then at the wolf which with quick instinct have single he out of the herd know in some subtle way he be watch from beyond and which gather about he in a circle sit on they tail and yawn slowly silently mooka 's wolf creep forward push he great body through the snow a terrific rush a quick snap under the stag 's chest just behind the fore leg where the heart lay then the big wolf leap aside and sit down quietly again to watch it be soon finish the stag plunge away settle into he long rack slow down to a sway weakening trot after he at a distance glide the big wolf lap eagerly at the crimson trail but hold himself with tremendous will power from rush in headlong and drive the game which might run for mile if too hard press the stag sink to he knee a sharp yelp ring like a pistol-shot through the still wood then the pack roll in like a whirlwind and it be all over creep near on the trail the little hunter crouch under a low spruce watch as if fascinate the wild feast of the wolf noel 's bow be ready in he hand but luckily the sight of these huge powerful brute overwhelm he and drive all thought of kill out of he head mooka pluck he by the sleeve at last and pointed silently homewards it be surely time to go for the biggest wolf have already stretch himself and be lick he paw while the two cub with full stomach be roll over and over and bite each other playfully in the snow silently they steal away stop only to tie a rag to a pointed stick which they thrust between they own caribou 's rib to make the wolf suspicious and keep they from tear the game and eat the tidbit while the little hunter hurry away to bring the man with they gun and dog sledge they have almost cross the second barren when mooka look back uneasily from the edge of the wood see a single big wolf emerge across the barren and follow swiftly on they trail startle at the sight they turn swiftly to run for that terrible feeling which sweep over a hunter when for the first time he find himself hunt in he turn have clutch they little heart and crush all they confidence a sudden panic seize they they rush away for the wood run side by side till they break into the fringe of evergreen that surround the barren there they drop breathless under a low fir and turn to look it be wrong to run little brother whisper mooka why say noel cause wayeese see it and think we ` fraid but i be ` fraid out there little sister confess noel bravely here we can climb tree good chance shoot um with my arrow like two frightened rabbit they crouch under the fir stare back with wild round eye over the trail fear every instant to see the savage pack break out of the wood and come howl after they but only the single big wolf appear trot quietly along in they footstep within bowshot he stop with head raise look listen intently then as if he have see they in they hiding he turn aside circle widely to the left and enter the wood far below again the two little hunter hurry on through the silent snow-filled wood a strange disquietude settle upon they as they feel they be follow by unseen foot soon the feeling grow too strong to resist noel with he bow ready and a strange chill trickle like cold water along he spine be hide behind a tree watch the back trail when a low exclamation from mooka make he turn there behind they not ten step away a huge white wolf be sit quietly on he tail watch they with absorb silent intentness fear and wonder and swift memory of old tomah and the wolf that have follow he when he be lose sweep over noel in a flood he rise swiftly the long bow bent and again a deadly arrow cuddle softly against he cheek but there be doubt and fear in he eye till mooka catch he arm with a glad little laugh -- my cub little brother see he ear and oh he tail watch um tail little brother for at the first move the
