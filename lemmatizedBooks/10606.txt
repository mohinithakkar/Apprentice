gracious figure to my honor relative alexander stewart maccoll a little _ less _ than kin and _ more _ than kind to whom i owe in especial the true understanding of the great soliloquy i dedicate with love and gratitude this effort to give hamlet and shakspere they due george mac donald bordighera _ christmas _ 1884 summary : the tragedie of hamlet prince of denmark : a study of the text of the folio of 1623 by george macdonald -lrb- motto -rrb- : what would you gracious figure dr greville macdonald look on he father 's commentary as the most important interpretation of the play ever write it be he intuitive understanding rather than learn analysis -- of which there be yet overwhelming evidence -- that make it so splendid reading level : mature youth and adult preface by this edition of hamlet i hope to help the student of shakspere to understand the play -- and first of all hamlet himself whose spiritual and moral nature be the real material of the tragedy to which every other interest of the play be subservient but while mainly attempt from the word and behavior shakspere have give he to explain the man i have cast what light i could upon everything in the play include the perplexity arise from extreme condensation of mean figure and expression as it be more than desirable that the student should know when he be read the most approximate presentation accessible of what shakspere utter and when that which modern editor have with reason good or bad often not without presumption substitute for that which they receive i have give the text letter for letter point for point of the first folio with the variation of the second quarto in the margin and at the foot of the page of hamlet there be but two edition of authority those call the second quarto and the first folio but there be another which require remark in the year 1603 come out the edition know as the first quarto -- clearly without the poet 's permission and doubtless as much to he displeasure : the following year he send out a edition very different and larger in the proportion of one hundred page to sixty-four concern the former my theory be -- though it be not my business to enter into the question here -- that it be print from shakspere 's sketch for the play write with matter crowd upon he too fast for expansion or development and intend only for a continuous memorandum of thing he would take up and work out afterwards it seem almost at time as if he but marked certain bale of think so as to find they again and for the present throw they aside -- know that by the mark he could recall the thought they stand for but not intend thereby to convey they to any reader i can not with evidence before I incredible but through the eye themselves of the illimitable scope of printer ' blunder believe _ all _ the confusion unintelligibility neglect of grammar construction continuity sense attributable to they in part it be more like a series of note print with the interlineation horribly jumble while in other part it look as if it have be take down from the stage by a ear without a brain and then yet more incorrectly print part nevertheless in which it most differ from the authorize edition be yet indubitably from the hand of shakspere i greatly doubt if any ready-writer would have dare publish some of its chaotic passage as take down from the stage nor do i believe the play be ever present in anything like such a unfinished state i rather think some fellow about the theater whether more rogue or fool we will pay he the thankful tribute not to enquire chance upon the crude embryonic mass in the poet 's hand traitorously pounce upon it and betray it to the printer -- therein serve the poet such a evil turn as if a sculptor 's workman take a mould of the clay figure on which he master have be but a few day employ and publish cast of it as the sculptor 's work -lrb- 1 -rrb- to we not the less be the _ corpus delictus _ precious -- and that unspeakably -- for it enable we to see something of the creational development of the drama besides serve occasionally to cast light upon portion of it yield hint of the original intention where the after work have less plainly present it -lrb- footnote 1 : shakspere have in this matter fare even worse than sir thoma browne the first edition of whose _ religio medicus _ nowise intend for the public be print without he knowledge -rrb- the second quarto bear on its title-page compel to a recognition of the former -- ` newly imprint and enlarged to almost as much againe as it be accord to the true and perfect coppie ' and it be in truth a harmonious world of which the former issue be but the chaos it be the drama itself the conclude work of the master 's hand though yet to be once more subject to a little pruning a little touch a little rectify but the author would seem to have be as trusting over the work of the printer as they be careless of he and the result be sometimes pitiable the blunder be appalling both in it and in the folio the marginal note again and again suggest itself : ` here the compositor be drunk the press-reader asleep the devil only aware ' but though the blunder elbow one another in tumultuous fashion not therefore all word and phrase suppose to be such be blunder the old superstition of plenary inspiration may by its reverence for the very word have save many a meaning from the obliteration of a misunderstanding scribe : in all critical work it seem to I well to cling to the _ word _ until one sink not merely baffle but exhaust i come now to the relation between the second quarto and the folio my theory be -- that shakspere work upon he own copy of the second quarto canceling and add and that after he death this copy come along with original manuscript into the hand of he friend the editor of the folio who proceed to print accord to he alteration these friend and editor in they preface profess thus : ` it have bene a thing we confesse worthie to haue bene wish that the author himselfe have liu would to haue set forth and ouerseen he owne writings but since it have bin ordain would otherwise and he by death depart from that right we pray you do not envie he friend the office of they care and paine to haue collect & publish would they as where -lrb- before -rrb- you be abus would with diuerse stolne and surreptitious copy maim and deform by the fraud and stealthe of iniurious impostor that expo would they : euen those be now offer would to you view cur would and perfect of they limbe and all the rest absolute in they number as he conceiue th -lrb- = e -rrb- who as he be a happie imitator of nature be a most gentle expresser of it he mind and hand go together : and what he think he vtter with that easinesse that wee haue scarse receiue from he a blot in he papers but it be not we prouince who onely gather he work and giue they you to praise he it be yours that reade he ' these be hardly the word of man who would take liberty and liberty enormous after idea of they own with the text of a friend thus honor but although they print with intent altogether faithful they do so certainly without any adequate jealousy of the printer -- apparently without a suspicion of how they could blunder of blunder therefore in the folio also there be many some through mere following of blunder print some in fresh corruption of the same some through mistaking of the manuscript correction and some probably from the misprinting of mistake so that the correction themselves be at time anything but correctly record i assume also that the printer be not altogether above the mean passion common to the day-labourer of art from chaucer 's adam scrivener down to the present carver of marble for modify and improve the work of the master the vain incapacity of a self-constituted critic will make he regard he poorest fancy as a emendation seldom have he the insight of touchstone to recognize or he modesty to acknowledge that although he own it be none the less a ill-favoured thing not such however be the spirit of the editor and all the change of importance from the text of the quarto i receive as shakspere 's own with this belief there can be no presumption in say that they seem to I not only to trim the part immediately affect but to render the play more harmonious and consistent it be no presumption to take the poet for superior to he work and capable of think he could better it -- neither so believe to imagine one can see that he have be successful a main argument for the acceptance of the folio edition as the poet 's last presentment of he work lie in the fact that there be passage in it which be not in the quarto and be very plainly from he hand if we accept these what right have we to regard the omission from the folio of passage in the quarto as not proceed from the same hand have there be omission only we might well have doubt but the insertion greatly tend to remove the doubt i can not even imagine the argument which would prevail upon I to accept the latter and refuse the former omission itself show for a master-hand : see the magnificent passage omit and rightly by milton from the opening of he _ comus _ ` but when a man have publish two form of a thing may we not judge between he and himself and take the reading we like better ' assuredly take either the quarto or the folio both be shakspere 's take any reading from either and defend it but do not mix up the two retain what he omit along with what he insert and print they so this be what the editor do -- and the thing be not shakspere 's with homage like this no artist could be other than indignant it be well to show every difference even to one of spelling where it might indicate possibly a different word but there ought to be no mingling of difference if i prefer the reading of the quarto to that of the folio as may sometimes well happen where blunder so abound i say i _ prefer _ -- i do not dare to substitute my student shall owe nothing of he text to any but the editor of the folio john heminge and henrie condell i desire to take he with I i intend a continuous but ever-varying while one-ended lesson we shall follow the play step by step avoid almost nothing that suggest difficulty and note everything that seem to throw light on the character of a person of the drama the point i consider a matter to be deal with as any one please -- for the sake of sense of more sense of better sense as much as if the text be a greek manuscript without any division of word this position i need not argue with anyone who have give but a cursory glance to the original page or know anything of printer ' point i hold hard by the word for that be or may be grain : the point as we have it be merest chaff and more likely to be wrong than right here also however i change nothing in the text only suggest in the note nor do i remark on any of the point where all that be require be the attention of the student doubtless many will consider not a few of the note unnecessary but what may be unnecessary to one may be welcome to another and it be impossible to tell what a student may or may not know at the same time those form a large class who imagine they know a thing when they do not understand it enough to see there be a difficulty in it : to such a attempt at explanation must of course seem foolish a _ number _ in the margin refer to a passage of the play or in the note and be the number of the page where the passage be to be find if the student find for instance against a certain line upon page 8 the number 12 and turn to page 12 he will there find the number 8 against a certain line : the two line or passage be to be compare and will be find in some way parallel or mutually explanatory wherever i refer to the quarto i intend the 2nd quarto -- that be shakspere 's own authorized edition publish in he life-time where occasionally i refer to the surreptitious edition the mere inchoation of the drama i call it as it be the _ 1st quarto _ any word or phrase or stage-direction in the 2nd quarto differ from that in the folio be place on the margin in a line with the other : choice between they i generally leave to my student omission be mainly give as footnote each edition do something to correct the error of the other i beg my companion on this journey to let hamlet reveal himself in the play to observe he as he assume individuality by the concretion of characteristic i warn he that any popular notion concern he which he may bring with he will be only obstructive to a perception of the true idea of the grandest of all shakspere 's presentation it will amuse this and that man to remark how often i speak of hamlet as if he be a real man and not the invention of shakspere -- for indeed the hamlet of the old story be no more that of shakspere than a lump of coal be a diamond but i imagine if he try the thing himself he would find it hardly possible to avoid so speak and at the same time say what he have to say i give hearty thanks to the press-reader a gentleman whose name i do not know not only for keen watchfulness over the printing-difficulty of the book but for save I from several blunder in derivation bordighera : _ December _ 1884 -lrb- transcriber 's note : in the paper original each left-facing page contain the text of the play with sidenote and

between the second and third act be by common consent place here the third act occupy the afternoon evening and night of the same day with the second this soliloquy be hamlet 's first and perhaps we may find it correct to say _ only _ outbreak of self-accusation he charge himself with lack of feeling spirit and courage in that he have not yet take vengeance on he uncle but unless we be prepare to accept and justify to the full he own hardest word against himself and grant he a muddy-mettled pigeon-livered rascal we must examine and understand he so as to account for he conduct better than he could himself if we allow that perhaps he accuse himself too much we may find on reflection that he accuse himself altogether wrongfully if a man be content to think the worst of hamlet i care to hold no argument with that man we must not look for _ express _ logical sequence in a soliloquy which be a vocal mind the mind be seldom conscious of the link or transition of a yet perfectly logical process develop in it this remark however be more necessary in regard to the famous soliloquy to follow in hamlet misery have partly choke even vengeance and although sure in he heart that he uncle be guilty in he brain he be not sure bitterly accuse himself in a access of wretchedness and rage and credence he forget the doubt that have restrain he with all besides which he might so well urge in righteous defense not excuse of he delay but ungenerous criticism have by all but universal consent accept he own verdict against himself so in common life there be thousand on thousand who upon the sad confession of a man immeasurably greater than themselves and show he greatness in the humility whose absence make admission impossible to they immediately pounce upon he with vituperation as if he be one of the vile and they infinitely better such should be indignant with st paul and say -- if he be the chief of sinner what insolence to lecture _ they _ and certainly the more justified publican would never by they have be allow to touch the robe of the less justified pharisee such critic surely take little or no pain to understand the object of they contempt : because hamlet be trouble and blame himself they without hesitation condemn he -- and there where he be most commendable it be the righteous man who be most ready to accuse himself the unrighteous be least ready who be able when in deep trouble rightly to analyze he feeling delay in action be not necessarily abandonment of duty in hamlet 's case it be a due recognition of duty which condemn precipitancy -- and action in the face of doubt so long as it be nowise compel be precipitancy the first thing be _ to be sure _ : hamlet have never be sure he spy at length a chance of make himself sure he seize upon it and while he sudden resolve to make use of the player like the equally sudden resolve to shroud himself in pretended madness manifest he fertile in expedient the carry out of both manifest he right capable and diligent in execution -- _ a man of action in every true sense of the word _ the self-accusation of hamlet have its ground in the lapse of week during which nothing have be do towards punish the king suddenly rouse to a keen sense of the fact he feel as if surely he might have do something the first act end with a burning vow of righteous vengeance the second show he wander about the palace in profoundest melancholy -- such as make it more than easy for he to assume the form of madness the moment he mark any curious eye bent upon he let he who have never love and revere a mother call such melancholy weakness he have indeed do nothing towards the fulfilment of he vow but the way in which he make the vow the term in which he exact from he companion they promise of silence and he scheme for elude suspicion combine to show that from the first he perceive its fulfilment would be hard see the obstacle in he way and know it would require both time and caution that even in the first rush of he wrath he should thus be aware of difficulty indicate moral symmetry but the full weight of what lay in he path could appear to he only upon reflection partly in the light of passage yet to come i will imagine the further course of he thought which the closing couplet of the first act show as have already begin to apale ` the native hue of resolution ' ` but how shall i take vengeance on my uncle shall i publicly accuse he or slay he at once in the one case what answer can i make to he denial in the other what justification can i offer if i say the spirit of my father accuse he what proof can i bring my companion only see the apparition -- hear no word from he and my uncle 's party will assert with absolute likelihood to the mind of those who do not know I -- and who here know I but my mother -- that charge be a mere coinage of jealous disappointment work upon the melancholy i have not care to hide -lrb- 174-6 -rrb- when i act it must be to kill he and to what misconstruction shall i not expose myself -lrb- 272 -rrb- if the thing must so be i must brave all but i could never present myself thereafter as successor to the crown of one whom i have first slay and then vilify on the accusation of a apparition whom no one hear but myself i must find _ proof _ -- such proof as will satisfy other as well as myself my immediate duty be _ evidence _ not vengeance ' we have see besides that when inform of the haunting presence of the ghost he expect the apparition with not a little doubt as to its authenticity -- a doubt which even when he see it do not immediately vanish : be it any wonder that when the apparition be go the doubt should return return it do in accordance with the reaction which wait upon all high-strung experience if he do not believe in the person who perform it would any man long believe in any miracle hamlet soon begin to question whether he can with confidence accept the appearance for that which it appear and assert itself to be he step over to the stand-point of he judge and doubt the only testimony he have to produce far more : -- be he not bind in common humanity not to say _ filialness _ to doubt it to doubt the ghost be to doubt a testimony which to accept be to believe he father in horrible suffer he uncle a murderer he mother at least a adulteress to kill he uncle be to set he seal to the whole and besides to bring he mother into frightful suspicion of complicity in he father 's murder ought not the faintest shadow of a doubt assuage ever so little the glare of the hell-sun of such crime to be welcome to the tortured heart wretched wife and woman as he mother have show herself the ghost would have he think she far worse -- perhaps even accessory to she husband 's murder for action he _ must _ have proof at the same time what every one know of he mother couple now with the mere idea of the ghost 's accusation work in he such misery rouse in he so many torture and unanswerable question so blot the face of the universe and wither the heart of hope that he could not but doubt whether in such a world of rogue and false woman it be worth he while to slay one villain out of the swarm ophelium 's behavior to he in obedience to she father of which she give he no explanation have add ` the pang of disprized love ' and increase he doubt of woman-kind 120 but when he imagination present afresh the awful interview bring he more immediately under the influence of the apparition and its behest he be for the moment deliver both from the stunning effect of its communication and he doubt of its truth forget then the consideration that have work in he he accuse himself of remissness blame himself grievously for he delay soon however he sens resume they influence and he doubt again so go the mill-round of he thought with the revolving of many wheel he whole conscious nature be frightfully shake : he would be the poor creature most of he critic would make of he be it otherwise it be because of he greatness that he suffer so terribly and doubt so much a mother 's crime be far more paralyze than a father 's murder be stimulate and either he have not set himself in thorough earnest to find the proof he need or he have as yet be unable to think of any serviceable means to the end when the half real half simulated emotion of the player yet again rouse in he the sense of remissness lead he to accuse himself of forget obligation and heartlessness and simultaneously suggest a device for put the ghost and he word to the test instantly he seize the chance : when a thing have to be do and can be do hamlet be _ never _ want -- show himself the very promptest of man in the last passage of this act i do not take it that he be express a idea then first occur to he : that the whole thing may be a snare of the devil be a doubt with which during week he have be familiar the delay through which in utter failure to comprehend he character he have be so miserably misjudge fall really between the first and second act although it seem in the regard of most reader to underlie and protract the whole play its duration be measure by the journey of the ambassador to and from the neighbouring kingdom of norway it be notably odd by the way that those who accuse hamlet of inaction be mostly the same who believe he madness a reality in truth however he affected madness be one of the strongest sign of he activity and he delay one of the strongest proof of he sanity this second act the third act and a part always give to the fourth but which really belong to the third occupy in all only one day -lrb- footnote 1 : here follow in _ 1st q _ confest a murder commit long before this spirit that i haue seene may be the diuell and out of my weakenesse and my melancholy as he be

we be terribly trammel and hinder as in the understanding of hamlet throughout so here in the understanding of he meditation by traditional assumption i be rouse to think in the right direction concern it by the honor friend and relative to whom i have feebly acknowledged my obligation by dedicate to he this book i could not at first see it as he see it : ` think about it and you will ' he say i do think and by degree -- not very quickly -- my prejudgment thin fade and almost vanish i trust i see it now as a whole and in its true relation internal and external -- its relation to itself to the play and to the hamlet of shakspere neither in its first verse then nor in it anywhere else do i find even a allusion to suicide what hamlet be refer to in the say first verse it be not possible with certainty to determine for it be but the vanish ripple of a precede ocean of think from which he be just step out upon the shore of the articulate he may have be plunge in some profound depth of the metaphysics of existence or he may have be occupy with the one practical question that of the slaying of he uncle which have now in one form now in another haunt he spirit for week perhaps from the message he have just receive he expect to meet the king and conscience confront temptation have be urge the necessity of proof perhaps a righteous consideration of consequence which sometimes have share in the primary duty have be make he shrink afresh from the shed of blood for every thoughtful mind recoil from the irrevocable and that be a awful form of the irrevocable but whatever think general or special this first verse may be dismiss we come at once thereafter into the light of a definite question : ` which be nobler -- to endure evil fortune or to oppose it _ à outrance _ to bear in passivity or to resist where resistance be hopeless -- resist to the last -- to the death which be its unavoidable end ' then come a pause during which he be think -- we will not say ` too precisely on the event ' but take he account with consequence : the result appear in the utter conviction that the extreme possible consequence death be a good and not a evil throughout observe how here as always he generalize himself be to himself but the type of he race then follow another pause during which he seem prosecute the thought for he have already commence further remark in similar strain when suddenly a new and awful element introduce itself : to die -- to sleep -- -- to _ sleep _ perchance to _ dream _ he have be think of death only as the pass away of the present with its trouble here come the recollection that death have its own trouble -- its own thought its own consciousness : if it be a sleep it have its dream ' _ what dream may come _ ' mean ` the sort of dream that may come ' the emphasis be on the _ what _ not on the _ may _ there be no question whether dream will come but there be question of the character of the dream this consideration be what make calamity so long-lived ` for who would bear the multiform ill of life ' -- he allude to he own wrong but mingle in he generalize way other of those most common to humanity and refer to the special cure for some of he own which be close to he hand -- ` who would bear these thing if he could as i can make he quietus with a bare bodkin ' -- that be by slaying he enemy -- ` who would then bear they but that he fear the future and the divine judgment upon he life and action -- that conscience make a coward of he ' -lrb- 14 -rrb- to run not the risk of death but the risk that attend upon and follow death hamlet must be certain of what he be about he must be sure it be a right thing he do or he will leave it undo compare he speech 250 ` do it not & c ' : -- by the time he speak this speech he have have perfect proof and assert the righteousness of take vengeance in almost a agony of appeal to horatio the more continuous and the more formally logical a soliloquy the less natural it be the logic should be all there but latent the bone of it should not show : they do not show here -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ one _ ` well ' _ only in q _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : he do not want to

alas too excusable phantom of distrust a man wretch as hamlet must be forgive for be rude it be love suppress love that can neither breathe nor burn that make he rude he horrid insinuation be a hungry challenge to indignant rejection he would sting ophelium to defense of herself and she sex but either from she love or from gentleness to he suppose madness as afterwards in the play-scene or from the

judgement be here in shakspere 's thought will be plain to those who take light from the corresponding passage in the _ 1st quarto _ as it make a excellent specimen of that issue in the character i be

attention if it be what i suggest it be clear that shakspere have not at first altogether determine how he would carry the soliloquy -- what line he be go to follow in it : here hope and fear contend for the place of motive to patience the change from it in the text be well worth note : the religion be lessen : the hope disappear : be they too much of pearl to cast before ` barren spectator ' the

own presentment of he reason as exhaustive doubtless to kill he at he prayer whereupon after the notion of the time he would go to heaven would be anything but justice -- the murder man in hell -- the murderer in heaven but it be easy to suppose hamlet finding it impossible to slay a man on he knee -- and that from behind : thus in the unseen presence he be in sanctuary and the avenger might well seek reason or excuse for not _ then _ not _ there _ execute the decree -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : ` wait for I ' -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : he seem now to have make up he mind and to await only fit time and opportunity but he be yet to receive confirmation strong as holy writ this be the first chance hamlet have have -- within the play -- of kill the king and any imputation of faulty irresolution therein be simply silly it show the soundness of hamlet 's reason and the steadiness of he will that he refuse to be carry away by passion or the temptation of opportunity the sight of the man on he knee might well start fresh doubt of he guilt or even wake the thought of spare a repentant sinner he know also that in take vengeance on she husband he could not avoid compromise he mother besides a man like hamlet could not fail to perceive how the killing of he uncle and in such a attitude would look to other it may be judge however that the reason he give to himself for not slaying the king be only a excuse that he soul revolt from the idea of assassination and be calm in a measure by the doubt whether a man could thus pray -- in suppose privacy we must remember -- and be a murderer not even yet have he proof _ positive _ absolute conclusive : the king might well take offence at the play even be he innocent and in any case hamlet would desire _ presentable _ proof : he have positively none to show the people in justification of vengeance as in excitement a man 's mood may be opalescent in they change and as the most contrary feeling may coexist in vary degree all might be in a mind which i have suggest as present in that of hamlet to have be capable of the kind of action most of he critic would demand of a man hamlet must have be the weakling they imagine he when at length after a righteous delay partly will partly inevitable he hold document in the king 's handwriting as proof of he treachery -- _ proof which can be show _ -- give he both right and power over the life of the traitor then and only then be he in cool blood absolutely satisfied as to he duty -- which conviction work with opportunity and that opportunity plainly the last bring the end the

with whose execution he false friend be entrust the poet have at first intended hamlet to go on board the vessel with a design form upon this for the out-witting of he companion and to work out that design afterwards however he alter he plan and represent he escape as more plainly providential : probably he do not see how to manage it by any scheme of hamlet so well as by the attack of a pirate possibly he wish to write the passage -lrb- 246 -rrb- in which hamlet so consistently with he character attribute he return to the divine shaping of the end rough-hewn by himself he have design -- ` dear plot ' -- but they be other than fall out -- a rough-hewing that be shape to a different end the discomfiture of he enemy be not such as he have design : it be bring about by no previous plot but through a discovery at the same time he deliverance be not effect by the finger of the packet but by the attack of the pirate : even the re-writing of the commission do nothing towards he deliverance result only in the punishment of he traitorous companion in revise the quarto the poet see that the passage before we in which be express the strongest suspicion of he companion with a determination to outwit and punish they be inconsistent with the representation hamlet give afterwards of a restlessness and suspicion newly come upon he which he attribute to the divinity neither be it likely he would say so much to he mother while so little sure of she as to warn she on the ground of danger to herself against reveal he sanity to the king as to this however the portion omit might i grant be

-lrb- footnote 10 : _ see _ ` example grosse as earth ' _ below _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : while every word that shakspere write we may well take pain to grasp thoroughly my endeavor to cast light on this passage be make with the distinct understanding in my own mind that the author himself disapprove of and omit it and that good reason be not want why he should have do so at the same time if my student for this book be for those who would have help and will take pain to the true understanding of the play would yet retain the passage i protest against the acceptance of hamlet 's judgment of himself except as reveal the simplicity and humility of he nature and character that as often as a vivid memory of either interview with the ghost come back upon he he should feel rebuke and ashamed and vex with himself be in the morally intellectually and emotionally troubled state of he mind nowise the less natural that he have the best of reason for the delay because of which he _ here _ so unmercifully abuse himself a man of self-satisfied temperament would never in similar circumstance have do so but hamlet be by nature and education far from such self-satisfaction and there be in he besides such a strife and turmoil of oppose passion and feeling and apparent duty as can but rarely rise in a human soul with which he ought to side he conscience be not sure -- side therefore now with one now with another at the same time it be by no mean the long delay the critic imagine of which he be accuse himself -- it be only that the thing _ be not do _ in certain mood the action a man dislike will _ therefore _ look to he the more like a duty and this help to prevent hamlet from know always how great a part conscience bear in the omission because of which he condemn and even contemn himself the conscience do not naturally examine itself -- be not necessarily self-conscious in any soliloquy a man must speak from he present mood : we who be not suffer and who have many of he mood before we ought to understand hamlet better than he understand himself to himself sit in judgment on himself it would hardly appear a decent cause of not to say reason for a moment 's delay in punish he uncle that he be so weigh down with misery because of he mother and ophelium that it seem of no use to kill one villain out of the villainous world it would seem but ` bestial oblivion ' and although he reputation as a prince be deeply concerned _ any _ reflection on the consequence to himself would at time appear but a ` craven scruple ' while at time even the whisper of conscience might seem a ` thinking too precisely on the event ' a conscientious man of changeful mood wilt be very ready in either mood to condemn the other the best and rightest man will sometimes accuse themselves in a manner that seem to those who know they best unfounded unreasonable almost absurd we must not i say take the hero 's judgment of himself as the author 's judgment of he the two judgment that of a man upon himself from within and that of he beholder upon he from without be not congeneric they be different in origin and in kind and can not be adopt either of they into the source of the other without most serious and dangerous mistake so adopted each become another thing altogether it be to I probable that although it involve other unfitness the poet omit the passage chiefly from come to see the danger of its give occasion or at least support to a altogether mistaken and unjust idea of he hamlet -rrb- -lrb- page 194 -rrb- there be tricke i ` th ` world and hem and beat she heart

-rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : ophelium 's word -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : i be in doubt whether this passage from ` what be a man ' down to ` unused ' do not refer to the king and whether hamlet be not persuade himself that it can be no such objectionable thing to kill one hardly above a beast at all event it be far more applicable to the king : it be not one of hamlet 's fault in any case to fail of use he reason but he may just as well accuse himself of that too at the same time the worst neglect of reason lie in not carry out its conclusion and if we can not justify hamlet in he delay the passage be of good application to he ` bestiall oblivion ' do seem to connect himself with the reflection but how thoroughly be the thing intend by such a phrase alien from the character of hamlet -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : -- the mental faculty of run hither and thither : ` we look before and after ' _ shelley : to a skylark _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : -- the forgetfulness of such a beast as he have just mention -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : -- the _ consequence _ the scruple that come of thinking of the event hamlet certainly have : that they be _ craven _ scruple that he thinking be too precise i deny to the face of the noble self-accuser be that a craven scruple which see no good to result from the horrid deed shrink from its irretrievableness and demand at least absolute assurance of guilt or that ' a think too precisely on the event ' to desire as the prince of he people to leave a un wounded name behind he -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : this passage be the strongest there be on the side of the ordinary misconception of the character of hamlet it come from himself and it be as ungenerous as it be common and unfair to use such a weapon against a man do any but st paul himself say he be the chief of sinner consider hamlet 's condition torment on all side within and without and think whether this outbreak against himself be not as unfair as it be natural lest it should be accept against he shakspere do well to leave it out in bitter disappointment both because of what be and what be not both because of what he have do and what he have fail to do have for the time lose all chance with the last vision of the ghost still haunt he eye he last reproachful word yet ring in he ear be we bind to take he judgment of himself because it be against himself be we _ bind _ to take any man 's judgment because it be against himself i answer ` no more than if it be for himself ' a good man 's judgment where he be at all perplexed especially if he motive come within he own question be ready to be against himself as a bad man 's be sure to be for himself or because he be a philosopher do it follow that throughout he understand himself be such a man in cool untroubled condition we might feel compel to take he judgment but surely not here a philosopher in such state as hamlet 's would understand the quality of he spiritual operation with no more certainty than another man in he present mood hamlet forget the cogency of the reason that sway he in the other forget that he uppermost feeling then be doubt as horror indignation and conviction be uppermost now thing be never so clear to hamlet as to we but how can he say he have strength and mean -- in the position in which he now find himself i be glad to be able to believe let my defense of hamlet against himself be right or wrong that shakspere intend the omission of the passage i lay nothing on the great lack of logic throughout the speech for that would not make it unfit for hamlet in such mood while it make its omission from the play of less consequence to my general argument -rrb- -lrb- footnote 13 : _ threaten _ this support my argument as to the great soliloquy -- that it be death as the result of he slaying the king or attempt to do so not death by suicide he be think of : he expect to die himself in the punish of he uncle -rrb- -lrb- footnote 14 : he have have no chance but that when the king be on he knee -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : ' a fancy and illusion ' -rrb- -lrb- footnote 16 : ` which be too small for those engage to find room to fight on it ' -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : `

guildensterne with they own petard -- that be if we must keep the omit passage then the author expose he hero to a more depreciatory judgment than any from which i would justify he and a conception of he character entirely inconsistent with the rest of the play he do not observe the risk at the time he write the passage but discover it afterwards rectify the oversight -- to the dissatisfaction of

to appear before the king its poetry and dignity belong to hamlet 's feeling its extravagance to he assumed insanity it must be remember that death be a small affair to hamlet beside he mother 's life and that the death of ophelium may even be some consolation to he in the _ folio _ a few line back laerte leap into the grave there be no such direction in the _ q _ in neither be hamlet say to leap into the grave only the _ 1st q _ so direct it be a stage-business that must please the _ common _ actor of hamlet but there be nothing in the text any more than in the margin of _ folio _ or _ quarto _ to justify it and it would but for the horror of it be ludicrous the coffin be suppose to be in the grave : must laerte jump down upon it follow by hamlet and the two fight and trample over the body yet i take the ' _ leap in the grave _ ' to be a action intend for laerte by the poet he ` hold off the earth a while ' do not necessarily imply that the body be already in the grave he have before say ` lay she i ` th ' earth ' : then it be not in the grave it be just about to be lower when with that cry of ` hold off the earth a while ' he jump into the grave and take the corpse on a bier at the side of it in he arm call to the spectator to pile a mountain on they -- in the wild speech that bring out hamlet the quiet dignity of hamlet 's speech do not comport with he jump into the grave : laerte come out of the grave and fly at hamlet 's throat so at least i would have the thing act there be however nothing in the text to show that laerte come out of the grave and if the manager insist on the traditional mode i would suggest that the grave be represent much larger in mr jewitt 's book on grave-mound i read of a ` female skeleton in a grave six foot deep ten foot long and eight foot wide ' such a grave would give room for both beside the body and dismiss the hideousness of the common representation -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : -- _ spring out of the grave and fly at hamlet _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : note the temper self-knowledge self-government and self-distrust of hamlet -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : the eyelid last of all become incapable of motion -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : that he love she be the only thing to explain the harshness of he behavior to she have he not love she and not be miserable about she he would have be as polite to she as well breed people would have he

under the cover of he madness it do not belong _ altogether _ to the madness later he express to horatio he regret in regard to this passage between he and laerte and afterwards apologize to laerte 252 262 perhaps this be the speech in all the play of which it be most difficult to get into a sympathetic comprehension the student must call to mind the element at war in hamlet 's soul and generate discord in he behavior : to those come now the shock of ophelium 's death the last tie that bind he to life be go -- the one glimmer of hope leave he for this world the grave upon whose brink he have be bandy word with the sexton be for _ she _ into such a consciousness come the rant of laerte only the form of madness be free to he while no form be too strong in which to repudiate indifference to

make part of the play the action -- except as not a few would have it the very action be delay -- be nowise further by it hamlet merely go and return to answer this question let we find the real ground for hamlet 's reflection ` there be a divinity that shape we end ' observe he be set at liberty without be in the least indebted to the finding of the commission -- by the attack namely of the pirate and this be not the shaping of he end of which he be think when he make the reflection for it have reference to the finding of the commission what then be the ground of the reflection and what justify the whole passage in relation to the poet 's object the character of hamlet this it seem to I : -- although hamlet could not have have much doubt leave with regard to he uncle 's guilt yet a man with a fine delicate -- what most man would think because so much more exacting than theirs -- fastidious conscience might well desire some proof more positive yet before he do a deed so repugnant to he nature and carry in it such a loud condemnation of he mother and more : he might well wish to have something to _ show _ : a man 's conviction be no proof though it may work in other inclination to receive proof hamlet be send to sea just to get such proof as will not only thoroughly satisfy himself but be capable of be show to other he hold now in he hand -- to lay before the people -- the two contradictory commission by he voyage then he have gain both assurance of he duty and provision against the consequence he mainly dread that of leave a wounded name behind he 272 this be the shaping of he end -- so exactly to he need so different from he rough-hewn plan -- which be the work of the divinity the man who desire to know he duty that he may _ do _ it who will not shirk it when he do know it will have time allow he and the thing make plain to he he perplexity will even strengthen and purify he will the weak man be he who certain of what be require of he fail to meet it : so never once fail hamlet note in all that follow that a load seem take off he : after a gracious tardiness to believe up to the point of action he be at length satisfied hesitation belong to the noble nature to hamlet precipitation to the poor nature to laerte the son of polonius compare brutus in _ julius caesar _ -- a hamlet in favourable circumstance with hamlet -- a brutus in the most unfavourable circumstance conceivable -rrb- -lrb- page 250 -rrb- _ ham _ why man they do make loue to this imployment -lrb- 1 -rrb- they be not neere my conscience they debate -lrb- sidenote : they

fate by they underhand dealings ' the _ sh lex _ explain _ insinuation _ as _ meddle _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : with the concern of horatio for the fate of rosincrance and guildensterne hamlet show no sympathy it have be object to he character that there be nothing in the play to show they privy to the contents of they commission to this it would be answer enough that hamlet be satisfy of they worthlessness and that they whole behavior in the play show they merest parasite but at the same time we must note that in change the commission he have no intention could have have no thought of let they go to england without he : that be a pure shaping of they end by the divinity possibly he own ` dear plot ' have in they the notion of get help against he uncle from the king of england in which case he would willingly of course have continue he journey but whatever they may be suppose to have be they be lay in connection with the voyage not found on the chance of its interruption it be easy to imagine a man like he averse to the shed of blood intend interference for they life : as heir apparent he would certainly have be listen to the tone of he reply to horatio be that of one who have be make the unintending cause of a deserve fate : the thing have fall out so the divinity have so shaped they end there be nothing in they character any more than in that of polonius to make he regret they death or the part he have have in it -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : the ` mighty opposite ' here be the king and hamlet -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : perhaps as hamlet talk he have be parenthetically glance at the real commission anyhow conviction be grow stronger in horatio whom for the occasion we may regard as a type of the public -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : ` thinkst thee ' in the fashion of the friend

the past that hamlet dreaded death but in regard to the righteousness of the action which be about to occasion he death note that he expect death at least he have long make up he mind to the great risk of it -- the death refer to in the soliloquy -- which after all be not that which do overtake he there be nothing about suicide here nor be there there -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : ' a man 's life

solely that which be lend he since the nature of a thing that have to be leave be not such that it _ could _ be possess why should a man mind parting with it early ' -- there be far more in this than merely that at the end of the day it will be all the same the thing that ever be really a man 's own god have give and god will not and man can not take away note the unity of religion and philosophy in hamlet : he take the one true position note also he courage : he have a strong presentiment of death but will not turn a step from he way if death be come he will confront he he do not believe in chance he be ready -- that be willing all that be needful be that he should not go as one who can not help it but as one who be for god 's will who choose that will as he own there be so much behind

attain the possibility of do so perform he work _ in righteousness _ the common critical mind would have he leave the fatherless motherless loverless almost friendless king of a justifiably distrust

set right what be wrong and of atone for every ill wittingly or unwittingly do or occasion in this it seem to I most admirable that hamlet be so great be yet outwardly so like other people : the poet never obtrude he greatness and just because he be modest confess weakness and perplexity small people take he for yet smaller than themselves who never confess anything and seldom feel anything amiss with they such will adduce even hamlet 's disparagement of himself to ophelia when overwhelm with a sense of human worthlessness -lrb- 126 -rrb- as proof that he be no hero they call it weakness that he would not foolishly and selfishly make good he succession against the king regardless of the law of election and careless of the weal of the kingdom for which he show himself so anxious even in the
