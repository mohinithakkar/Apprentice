civilisation be the result of the mutual action of europe and asia and that the advanced race of indium be we own kinsfolk the scene of mr banerjea 's tale have be win from the sea by alluvial action its soil enrich by yearly deposit of silt yield abundantly without the aid of manure a hothouse climate and regular rainfall make bengal the predestined breeding-ground of mankind the seat of a ancient and complex civilisation but subsistence be too easily secure in those fertile plain malaria due to the absence of subsoil drainage be ubiquitous and the standard of vitality extremely low

fain to acknowledge they inferiority when a hierocracy have be firmly establish its evolution always follow similar line ritual become increasingly elaborate : metaphysical dogma grow too subtle for a layman 's comprehension commercialism spread from the market to the sanctuary whose guardian exploit the all-pervading fear of the unknown to serve they lust of luxury and rule brahminism have never seek to win proselyte the annals of ancient indium record none of those atrocious persecution which stain mediaeval christianity it compete with rival creed by offer superior advantage : and the

significant fact that káli be the tutelary goddess of extremist politician whose mind be prepare for the acceptance of anarchism by the ever-present ideal of destruction it be bengal 's misfortune that its people receive brahminism in a corrupt and degenerate form accord to legend king adisur who reign there in the ninth century of we era import five priest from kanauj to perform indispensable

they become adept in persian and english be almost they second mother-tongue to-day kayasth figure largely in mr banerjea 's tale : they history prove that the pen be mightier than the sword economic necessity be the cause of the first invasion of indium : the second be inspire by religion the evolution of organise creed be not from simple to complex but vice versa from the bed-rock of magic they rise through nature-worship and man-worship to monotheism the god of a conquer tribe be impose on subdue enemy and become lord of heaven and earth monotheism of this type take root among the hebrew

lineally descend from tamerlane he grandson akbar 's reign -lrb- 1560-1605 -rrb- be indium 's golden age akbar the great be a ruler of the best modern type who give he subject all the essential of civilisation but he know that material prosperity be only the means to a end man say ruskin be a engine whose motive power be the soul and its fuel be love akbar call all the best element in society to he side and link they in the bond of sympathy religion in its highest phase be color by mysticism which seek emblem of the hidden source of harmony in every form of life anthropomorphic conception be lay aside ritual be abandon as savor of magic hierocracy as part of a obsolete caste system metaphysical dogma because the infinite can not be weigh in the balance of human reason the truce to fanaticism call by akbar the great encourage a poet and reformer name tulsus dása -lrb- 1532-1623 -rrb- to point a surer way to salvation he adore krishna the preserve influence incarnate as ráma and rehandled valmikus 's great epic the rámáyana in the faint ray of christian light which penetrate indium during that age of transition buddha have proclaim the brotherhood of man tulsus dása deduce it

on believer for we be all child of the same father tulsus dása 's rámáyana be better know in bihar and the united province than be the bible in rural england the people of hindustan be not sway by relentless fate nor by the goddess of destruction they prayer be address to a god who love he meanest adorer they accept this world 's buffeting with resignation : while ráma reign all be well if the hereditary principle be sound the empire cement together by akbar 's statecraft might have defy aggression he successor be debauchee or fanatic they neglect the army a recrudescence of the nomad instinct send they wander over indium with a locust-like horde of follower hindu be persecute and they temple be destroy so the military caste whose religion be threaten rise in revolt viceroy throw off allegiance and carve out kingdom for themselves within a century of akbar 's death he empire be a prey to anarchy indium have hitherto enjoy long spell of immunity from foreign interference she people defend by the himalayan wall and the ocean be free to develop they own scheme of national life and world-force which pierce the thickest crust of custom reach they in attenuate volume they isolation end when the sea be no longer a barrier and for maritime nation it be but a extension of they territory a third invasion begin in the sixteenth century and have continue till we own day the underlie motive be not economic necessity nor religious enthusiasm but sheer lust of gain in 1498 vasco da gama discover a all-sea route to indium thus open the fabulous riches of asia to hungry europe portuguese dutch french and english adventurer embark in a struggle for indian commerce in which we ancestor be victorious because they obtain the command of the sea and have the whole resource of the mother-country at they back westerner be so imbue with the profit-making instinct that they mentally open a ledger account in order to prove that indium gain more than she lose by dependence on the people of these island it can not be deny that the fabric of english administration be a noble monument of the civil skill and military prowess develop by we race we have give the peninsula railway and canal postal and telegraph system a code of law which be far in advance of we own profound peace brood over the empire famine and pestilence be fight with the weapon of science it would be easy to pile up item on the debit side of we imaginary cash-book free trade have destroy indigenous craft wholesale and quarter the caste who pursue they on a over-taxed soil incalculable be the waste of human life and inherit skill cause by the shift of productive energy from indium to great britain germany and america it can not be say that the oversea commerce which amount in 1907-8 to # 241000000 be a unmixed benefit the empire export food and raw material rob the soil of priceless constituent and buy manufacture goods which ought to be produce at home foreign commerce be stimulate by the home charge which average # 18000000 and it receive a indirect bounty by the closure of the mint in 1893 the textile industry of lancashire be build upon a prohibition of indian muslin : it now export yarn and piece goods to the tune of # 32000000 and this trade be unjustly favor at the expense of local mill under the custom tariff of 1895 but there be force in play for good or evil which can not be appraise in money from a material point of view we government be the best and most honest in existence if it fail to satisfy the psychical craving of indium there be shortcoming on both side and some of they be reveal by mr banerjea 's tale caste -- as a kulin or pedigreed brahmin he be naturally prone to magnify the prestige of he order it have be sap by incident of foreign rule and the spread of mysticism pandit find they stupendous lore of less account than the literary baggage of a university graduate brahmin pride be outrage by the advancement of man belong to inferior caste the priesthood 's dream be to regain the ascendancy usurp by a race of mleccha -lrb- barbarian -rrb- and it keep orthodox hindu in a state of suppress revolt one center of the insidious agitation be the fell goddess káli 's shrine near calcutta another be puna which have for century be a stronghold of the clannish máráthá brahman railway have give a mighty impetus to religion by facilitate access to place of pilgrimage the post office keep disaffected element in touch and english have become a lingua franca while brahminism if it dare could proclaim a religious war it have powerful enemy within the hierarchy a desire for social recognition be universal it be the patrician ' refusal to intermarry with plebeian that cause the great constitutional struggle of ancient rome many of the lowest caste be rebel against brahmin arrogance they have wax rich by grow lucrative staple and a strong minority be highly educate mystical sect have already throw off the priestly yoke but caste be by no means confine to race of indian blood what be the snobbery which degrade we english character but the indo-german sudra 's reverence for he brahmin the european constitute a caste which possess some solidarity against native and they have spontaneously adopt these anti-social distinction at the apex stand covenant civilian whose service be now practically a close preserve for white man it be split into the secretariat who enjoy a superb climate plus indian pay and furlough and the rank and file doom to swelter in the plain esprit de corps which be the life-blood of caste have vanish officer of the educational service recruit from the same social stratum rank as uncovenanted and a sense of humiliation react on they teaching the land -- in 1765 clive secure for the east indium company the right of levy land-tax in bengal it be then collect by zemindar a few of whom be semi-independent noble and the rest mere farmer of revenue who bid against one another at the periodical settlement tenant right apart the conception of private property in the soil be inconceivable to the indian mind every one know that it be borrow by english lawyer from the roman code when commercialism destroy the old feudal nexus lord cornwalli 's permanent settlement of 1793 be a revolution as drastic in its degree as that which prance be undergo zemindar be present with the land for which they have be mere rakers-in of revenue it be parcel out into estate which might be buy and sell like moveable property a tax levy at customary rate become rent arrive at by a process of bargaining between the landlord and ignorant rustic the government demand be fix for ever but no attempt be make to safeguard the ryot 's interest cornwalli and he henchman fondly suppose that they be manufacture magnate of the english type who have make we agriculture a model for the world they be grievously mistake under the cast-iron law of sale most of the original zemindar lose they estate which pass into the hand of parvenu saturate with commercialism bengal be not indebted to its zemindar for any of the new staple which have create so vast a volume of wealth they be content to be annuitant on the land and sub-infeudation have go to incredible length most of they be absentee whose one thought be to secure a maximum of unearned increment from tiller of the soil in 1765 the land revenue amount to # 3400000 of which # 258000 be allot to zemindar a century afterwards they net profit be estimate at # 12000000 and they be now probably half as much again the horrible oppression describe by mr banerjea be impossible in we era of law-courts railway and newspaper but it be always dangerous to bring the sense of brotherhood on which civilisation depend into conflict with crude animal instinct in day of american slavery the planter 's interest prompt he to treat he human cattle with consideration yet simon legree be not unknown it be a fact that certain zemindar be in the habit of remeasure they ryot ' holding periodically and always find more land than be set forth in the lease the police -- a pale copy of sir robert peel 's famous system be introduce in 1861 when host of inspector sub-inspector and head constable be let loose on bengal the new force be highly unpopular and fail to attract the educate class subaltern officer therefore use power for private end while the mass be so inured to oppression that they offer no resistance there have be a marked improvement in the personnel of late year and mr banerjea 's lurid picture of corruption and petty tyranny apply to a past generation of policeman the lieutenant-governor of eastern bengal do justice to a much-abused service in he administrative report for 1907-8 he honor believe the force to be a hard-working body of government servant the difficulty trial and even danger of whose duty it be impossible for the public at large really to appreciate he acknowledge that indium be pass through a period of transition old pre-possession and unscientific method must be cast aside and the value of the confession must be hold at a discount bengal policeman fail as egregiously as they british colleague in cope with professional crime burglary be a positive scourge and the habit of organise gang-robbery have spread to youth of the middle class education -- though mr banerjea have no experience of the inner working of we government office he speak on education with a expert 's authority lord macaulay who go to india in 1834 as legal member of council be responsible for the introduction of english as the vehicle of instruction he have gain admission to the caste of whig whose battle-cry be knowledge for the people and he brilliant rhetoric overpower the argument of champion of oriental learning every one with a smattering of sanskrit arabic or persian regret the fact that those glorious language have not be adequately cultivate in modern indium bengali be a true daughter of the sanskrit it have italian sweetness and german capacity for express abstract idea no degree of proficiency in a alien tongue can compensate for the neglect of the vernacular moreover the curriculum introduce in the thirty be purely academic it come to india directly from english university which have stick fast in the rut of the renaissance undue weight be give to literary training while science and technical skill be despise we college and school do not attempt to build character on a foundation of useful habit and taste that sweeten life to ennoble ideal or inspire self-knowledge self-reliance and self-control technical education be still in its infancy and the aesthetic instinct which lie dormant in every aryan 's brain be unawakened a race which invent the loom now invent nothing but grievance in 1901 bengal possess 69000 school and college attend by 1700000 pupil yet only one adult male in 10 and one female in 144 can read and write the calcutta university be a examine body on the london model it do not attempt to enforce discipline in a city which flaunt every vice know to great seaport and commercial centre unmitigated by the social instinct nor be the training of covenanted civilian more satisfactory in 1909 only 1 out of 50 select candidate present himself for examination in sanskrit or arabic man go out to indium at twenty-four know little of the ethnology language or history of the race they be about to govern agriculture -- seventy-two per cent of the bengali live by cultivate the soil the vast majority be in the clutch of some local shylock who sweep they produce into he garner dole out inadequate supplies of food and seed grain we court of law be use by these harpy as engine of oppression toil as he may the ryot be never free from debt the current rate of interest leave no profit from agriculture or trade twelve to 18 per cent be charge for loan on ample land security and ordinary cultivator be mulct in 40 to 60 a haunting fear of civil discord and purblind conservatism in the commercial caste be responsible for the dearth of capital indium import bullion amounting to # 25000000 a year to the great detriment of european credit and nine-tenth of it be hoard in the shape of ornament or invest in land which be a badge of social rank yet the aryan nature be peculiarly adapt to co-operation if facility for borrow at remunerative rate exist in town agricultural bank on the schulze-delitzsch and raiffeisen system would soon overspread the land credit and co-operative grouping for the purchase of seed fertiliser and implement be the twin pillar of rural industry indian ryot be quite as receptive of new idea as english farmer they buy many thousand of little iron sugar mill place on the market a generation back by some english speculator and will adopt any improvement of practical value if the price be bring within they slender mean the revolution which begin a decade ago in america have not spread to bengal where the average yield of grain per acre be only 10 bushel as compare with 30 in europe yet it have be calculate that another bushel would defray the whole cost of government bengali obey the injunction increase and multiply without regard for consequence they habitat have a population of 552 per square mile and in some district the ratio exceed 900 clearly there be a press need of scientific agriculture to replace or supplement the rule-of-thumb method in which the ryot be a past master the bengali character -- mr banerjea have lift a corner of the veil that guard the indian 's home from prying eye he show that bengali be man of like passion with we the picture be perhaps overcharge with shade sycophant hustler and cheat abound in every community happily for the future of civilisation there be also a leaven of true nobility : the flesh striveth against the spirit nor do it always gain mastery have mix with all class for twenty eventful year and speak the vernacular fluently i be perhaps entitle to hold a opinion on this much-vexed question the most salient feature in the indian nature be its boundless charity there be no poor law and the struggle for life be very severe yet the aged and infirm the widow and the orphan have they allotted share in the earnings of every household it be a symptom of approach famine that beggar be perforce refuse they daily dole cruelty to child be quite unknown parent will deny themselves food in order to defray a son 's schooling-fee or marry a daughter with suitable provision bengali be remarkably clannish : they will toil and plot to advance the interest of anyone remotely connect with they by tie of blood they fault be the outcome of superstition slavery to custom and a unhealthy climate among they be a lack of moral courage a tendency to lean on stronger nature and to flatter a superior by feign to agree with he the standard of truth and honesty be that of all race which have be ground under heel for age : deceit be the weapon of weakling and slave perjury have become a fine art because we legal system foster the chicane which be innate in quick-witted people the same man who lie unblushingly in a english court will tell the truth to a assembly of caste-fellow or to the panohayat -lrb- a committee of five which arbitrate in private dispute -rrb- let british pharisee study the working of they own divorce and county court : they will not find much evidence of superior virtue as for honesty the essence of commercialism be take advantage of other people 's need and no legal code have yet succeed in draw a line between fair and unfair trade in indium and japan merchant be a inferior class and loss of self-respect react unfavourably on the moral sense ingratitude be a vice attribute to bengali by people who have do little or nothing to elicit the corresponding virtue as a matter of fact they memory be extremely retentive of favor they will overlook any shortcoming in a ruler who have the divine gift of sympathy and serve he with devotion macaulay have brand they with cowardice if the charge be true it be surely illogical and unmanly to reproach a community numbering 50000000 for inherit defect difference of environment and social custom will account for the superior virility of european as compare with they distant kinsman whose lot be cast in the swelter tropics but no one who have observe bengali schoolboy stand up bare-legged to fast bowling will question they bravery in fact the instinct of combativeness be universal and among protected community it find vent in litigation englishman who seek to do they duty by indium have potential ally in the educate class who have graft western learning on a civilisation much more ancient than they own bengal have give many illustrious son to the empire among the dead i may mention pandit ishwar chandra vidyasagar and kissarus mohan gangulus whose vast learning be eclipse by they zeal for social service dr sambhu chandra mukharji whose biography i write in 1895 and mr umesh chandra banarjus a lawyer who hold he own with the flower of we english bar a bengali brahmin be still with we who direct one of the greatest contracting firm in the empire how much brighter would india 's outlook be if this highly-gifted race be link in bond of sympathy with we own the woman of the gangetic delta deserve a better fate than be assign to they by hindu and mohammadan custom they be keep in leading-string from the cradle to the grave they intellect be rarely cultivate they affection suffer atrophy from constant repression yet mr banerjea draw more than one picture of wifely devotion and the instinctive good sense which be one of the secret of feminine influence woman seldom fail to rise to the occasion when opportunity be vouchsafe they the late maharani surnomoyus of cossimbazar manage she enormous estate with acumen and she charity be as lavish as lady burdett-coutt 's toru dutt who die in girlhood write french and english verse full of haunt sweetness it be a little premature for extremist to prate of autonomy while they woman be prisoner or drudge superstition -- mode of thought survive from past age of intellectual growth be the chief obstacle in the path of progress mr banerjea 's tale contain many reference to magic -- a pseudo-science which cling to the world 's religion and social polity it be doubtful whether the most civilised of we have quite shake off the notion that mysterious virtue may be transmit without the impetus of will-power latin race be haunt by dread of the evil eye advertisement of palmist astrologer and crystal-gazer fill column of we newspaper rational education alone enable we to trace the sequence of cause and effect which be visible in every form of energy until this truth be generally recognize no community can eradicate the vice of superstition the unrest of which we hear so much find no echo in mr banerjea 's page it be indeed confine to a minute percentage of the population even include the callow schoolboy who have be tempt to waste precious year on politics the mass be too ignorant and too absorb by the struggle for existence to care one jot for reform they may however be stir to blind fury by appeal to they prejudice therein lie a real danger divergence of religious ideal to which i have already allude account for the tranquillity that prevail throughout bihar as compare with the spirit of revolution in bengal proper the microbe of anarchy find a excellent culture-ground in mind which grovel before the goddess káli but the unrest can not be isolate from other manifestation of cosmic energy which flash from mind to mind and keep the world in turmoil every force of nature tend to be periodic the heart 's systole and diastole alternation of day and night of season and tide be reflect in the history of we race progress be secure by the swing of a giant pendulum from east to west the end of each beat usher in drastic change in religion economics and social polity it be probable that one of these cataclysmic epoch open with the victory wrest from russium by japan the democratic upheaval which begin five hundred year ago be assume protean force and amongst they be the malady aptly style constitutionalitis by dr dillon the situation in indium demand prescience and statecraft though world-force can not be withstand they be susceptible of control by enlighten will-power will peace be restore by the gift of constitutional government at a crisis when the August mother of parliament be herself a prey to faction it be worthy of note that the self-same spirit have always be rife in bengal where every village have its dal -- local montague and capulet whose bickering be a fertile source of litigation mr banerjea 's tale be write for he own countryman and need extensive revision in order to render they intelligible to western reader i have preserve the author 's spirit and phraseology and venture to hope that this little book will shed some light on the problem of indian administration franci h skrine chapter i the pride of kadampur kadampur be a country village which be destitute of natural or artificial attraction and quite unknown to fame its census population be barely 1500 four-fifth of whom be low-caste hindu engage in cultivation and river-fishing the rest mohammadan who follow the same avocation but dwell in a párá -lrb- quarter -rrb- of they own the bhadralok or upper crust consist of two brahman and ten kayastha -lrb- writer-caste -rrb- family among the latter group kumodinus kanta basu 's take a unquestioned lead he have amass a modest competence as sub-contractor in the commissariat during the second afghan war and retire to enjoy it in he ancestral village he first care be to rebuild the family residence a congenial task which occupy five year and make a large hole in he savings it slowly grow into a masonry structure divide into two distinct

's office draw r 60 a month -lrb- # 48 a year at par -rrb- which suffice for the support of he wife and a son and daughter respectively name susil and shaibalinus after a vain attempt to make two end meet in expensive calcutta he have settle down at the outskirts of kadampur which have a railway station within half a hour 's run of the metropolis shám babu 's position and character be generally respect by neighbor who flock to he house for calcutta gossip on this particular occasion talk run on kadampur requirement and somebody opine that another tank for bathing and drinking purpose ought to be excavate at once he do not say by whom true observe sham babu but a market be still more necessary we have to trudge four mile for we vegetable and fish which be obtainable in a more or less stale condition only twice a week if one be start here it would be a great boon to ten village at least kumodinus babu assent without further remark and the subject drop it come up again on the follow Sunday when kumodinus babu say to he friend : -- i have be think about you idea of a market in this village and should like if possible to establish one myself how much would it cost I as a old commissariat contractor i be well up in the price of grain fodder and ghus -lrb- clarify butter use in cooking -rrb- but i really know very little about other thing the confession elicit a general laugh and shám babu reply it will be a matter of r 200 two hundred rupee surely that be far too much for a range of hut true enough you own bamboo clump straw-stack and store of cordage would provide raw material and as for labor all you have to do be to order some of you ryot -lrb- tenant -rrb- who be behindhand with they rent to work for you grati that would be contrary to my principle how be these poor people to live while engage in begár -lrb- force labor -rrb- on my behalf they must be pay very well then let we set apart r 20 to meet the cost of market building but for the first few week you will have to buy up the unsold stock of perishable goods bring by faria -lrb- huckster -rrb- you must patronise the shopkeeper who open stall for sell grain cloth confectionery tobacco and trinket once these people find that they be make fair profit they will gladly pay you rent for space allot besides toll on the usual scale at least r 180 must be set apart for these preliminary

fame as a man of energy and public spirit spread over ten village whose people feel that he be one who would give they good counsel in time of difficulty there be some truth in the notion that fortune 's gift seldom come singly kumodini babu 's success in a business venture be immediately follow by one in he domestic affair it fall out in this wise shám babu 's daughter shaibalinus be still unmarried though nearly thirteen and beautiful enough to be the pride of kadampur money be indeed the only qualification she lack and sham babu 's comparative poverty keep eligible suitor at a distance for three year he have seek far and wide for a son-in-law and be begin to fear that he might after all be unable to fulfil the chief duty of a hindu parent one evening he wife unexpectedly enter the parlor where he be rest after a heavy day at office why have the moon rise so early he ask because the moon can not do otherwise she answer with a faint smile but joke apart i want to consult you about saili we neighbor kanto babu 's wife call on I just before you return from calcutta and after beat about the bush suggest kumodinus babu 's younger son nalinus as a suitable match

non-hindu reader i may explain that kayastha be split into clan -- probably a survival of the tribal organization which precede the family almost everywhere accord to tradition a king of bengal name disur import five brahman and as many kayastha servant from kanauj in upper indium from the latter be descend the ghosh basu mitra guha and datta family the first four be generally recognize as kúlin -lrb- angl aristocratic -rrb- kayastha while the datta and seven other family be know as sindhu maulik -- come of a good stock disur and he companion find 700 brahman and the same number of kayastha already establish in bengal these be the suppose ancestor of a large number of kayastha family still term saptasatus the seven hundred the ancient greek reckon they neighbor beyond the hellenic pale as barbarian so brahman and kayastha of central bengal style they congener north of the gange rárh or uncivilised the epithet survive in uttar -lrb- north -rrb- and dakhin -lrb- south -rrb- rárhi but have lose its offensive meaning bárendra be another phrase for the inhabitant of a tract north of the gange which answer to the modern district of rajshahus pabna and bogra kanto babu be evidently perplexed but after reflect for a short time he ask now why should such a trifling matter cause any trouble whatever the time have long since pass away when arbitrary difference of clan be consider a bar to marriage among kayastha you be quite right be kumodini babu 's reply and personally i be above these old-fashioned prejudice my daughter-in-law may be dakhin rárhi banga-ja or bárendri for all i care provide she be comely well-mannered and come of good stock but will shám babu be equally tolerant that i can not say until i have consult he answer kanto babu one thing more i must know what be

be quite oppose to the custom should shám babu agree to this match i will make no stipulation whatever as to a money payment he be in very moderate circumstance and may give whatever he choose please see he at once and let I have he decision kanto babu promise to do so and withdraw inwardly chuckle over he diplomacy shám babu call on he the same evening to learn its issue he be delighted to find that kumodinus babu be not averse to the match but he face fall on hearing of the difference of clan observe he agitation kanto babu observe gently i do not see why a matter which be not even mention in we shástras -lrb- holy book -rrb- should cause one moment 's hesitation pluck up you courage man and all will go well perhaps so murmured shám babu but i do stand in awe of the samáj -lrb- a caste-assembly which pronounce excommunication for breach of custom -rrb- that be all nonsense look at we friend kunjalál babu who have just marry he son to a bárendri girl be he a outcast certainly not it be true that the ultra-orthodox kick a bit at first but they all come round and join in the ceremony with zest i can quote score of similar instance to prove that this prejudice against marry into a different clan be quite out of date shám babu have nothing to urge in opposition to these weighty argument he promise to let kanto babu have a definite reply on the morrow and keep he word have endure a curtain lecture from he wife who prove to he that a alliance with the basu family offer advantage far outweigh the slight risk there be of excommunication he authorise kanto babu to assure

with r 4001 viz ornament 2000 barabharan and phulsajya r 500 each and cash r 1001 on jogesh 's express willingness to provide that amount the purohit -lrb- family priest -rrb- be send for who after

inquiry as to amarendra babu 's position and the health of he son they result be satisfactory enough not so the fiasco relate in my last chapter which reach he with amplification and make he resolve that amarendra babu should not play such trick on he he order no ornament for he daughter because he have little cash or credit but simply borrow r 300 to meet absolutely necessary expense on the afternoon of srában 20th he call in half a dozen city rough armed they with thick stick and ply they with spirit tell they on no account to appear in the public apartment of he house until they receive a signal agree on at seven o'clock amarendra babu with he son and a uncle name rashbeharus arrive at jogesh 's house in a second-class cab no procession attend they partly because the last have cost so much money partly owe to the fear that another hitch might cover they with ridicule after exchange hearty salutation with jogesh they ask he to exhibit the ornament prepare for the bride-elect he take they to a side room and leave they there a while presently introduce a well-dressed man as he family goldsmith the latter unlock a tin box which he be carry and take out a number of glitter gold trinket one by one after examine they carefully amarendra babu ask he to weigh they which he do prove that they weight exceed 120 bháris -lrb- forty-eight ounce -rrb- and they total value at r 20 per bhári no less than r 2400 this be far more than he have bargain for and amarendra babu be highly delighted but he uncle insist on send for he own goldsmith to weigh the ornament jogesh at once fall in with the suggestion and this tradesman on arrival value they at r 2700 rashbeharus babu 's scepticism vanish and he assent to he nephew 's whisper hint that they need not ask jogesh to produce the barabharan he however insist on satisfy they as to its worth and place in they hand a heavy gold watch by mccabe with a albert chain equally ponderous and assure they that he have pay r 800 for the two amarendra 's joy be perhaps excessive and when the lagna -lrb- auspicious time -rrb- come round he permit the marriage to be celebrate every ceremony go off without a hitch

have be play by jogesh amarendra stoutly deny have receive any cash and the tin box be prove to contain only fragment of brick neatly wrap in paper and cover with pink cotton wool the pair of dupe hurry to jogesh 's house for a explanation he sit in the parlor in evident expectation of they arrival and ask with a air of unconcern what be the matter you son of a pig roar amarendra babu shake he clenched fist close to jogesh 's nose tell I where be the ornament -- where be the cash why do you not take away a box full of trinket and you must admit that the r 1001 be hand you in a cotton bag this impudence be too much both uncle and nephew fall upon jogesh and belabour he sorely with they shoe he do not retaliate but console himself with the thought that he have do he duty to god and society by marry he daughter whatever fate might await he after vow to bring a suit against the swindler amarendra babu and he uncle leave the premise and do what they would have do much earlier have they not be in such a desperate hurry to marry the lad they make inquiry as to jogesh 's position and soon discover that he be a man of straw quite unworthy of powder and shot they learn too that he have hire r 3000 worth of trinket for one night from a goldsmith who never let they out of he possession from a wealthy neighbor he have borrow a mccabe 's watch and chain also for one night only he arrangement make with a gang of city rough in order to prevent the marriage be break off also come to light amarendra babu see that he have be deal with a cunning and desperate man and prudently determine to give he a wide berth in future but he daughter be in amarendra babu 's clutch and she be force to expiate the sin of she father the luckless girl be keep on very short common and lock into a dark room when she be not engage in rough household work contrary to custom she be not send to she father 's house three day after the marriage nor be the bau-bhát ceremony perform but jogesh be on the alert he manage to communicate with she by bribe a maid-servant and one morning amarendra babu 's household discover that the half-starved bird have fly a year pass away without news of the truant but one evening amarendra babu be sit in he parlor spell out a spicy leader in the indian mirror when to he unqualified amazement jogesh step in and unbidden take a seat amarendra babu 's first impulse be to shout for help and eject the intruder with every species of ignominy but second thought be proverbially peaceful this jogesh he reflect must be a very smart fellow or he would never have take we all in as he do it be better to be on the side of the sacrificial knife than the goat that await its stroke why should i not hear what he have to say he would not have come here without some excellent reason -- perhaps he want to pay up part of he debt to I or maybe he have some scheme with money in it to unfold he 'll certainly try to overreach I again but then once bite twice shy i 'll be on my guard then with a attempt at irony he ask : -- what bring you of all people to my house have you get another daughter to marry have amarendra babu observe the gleam which shoot from jogesh 's shifty eye he would have kick he out at once but he wait for a reply which come in honeyed accent : -- now babuji please do not rake up old story what be do can not be undo you as a father ought to

way step by step will cost a fortune and even should you win all along the line the lawyer will not leave you enough to keep body and soul together how can a small estate like yours bear the cost of both side so in my humble opinion it would be much better to allow you brother to enjoy he ill-gotten gain make up you mind from this day forward to look carefully after you interest and you may rest assure that you brother will never try any such trick again nagendra listen with open mouth to this discourse and when he wife have do speak he embrace she fondly again and again murmur : -- my

of the best bargain he have ever get after ponder a while he ask what would you advise I to do i be afraid it be hopeless to contend against a receipt in full bipin be not so easily dishearten he reply let we consult we pleader asu babu who be sure to have some plan for uphold the sale he will not ask more than r 100 which be not a tenth of the annual profit for shibprakásh this course commend itself to samarendra who send he headman back to ghorium promising to follow next day with the necessary sinew of war he arrive betime at bipin 's house there and take he to the bar library where asu babu be sure to be find when not engage in court a few minute later the limb of the law come in and ask what business bring samarendra to ghorium after hear the story of shibprakásh and its vicissitude of ownership he ask : -- how much will you pay I if i win you case glance at bipin samarendra answer hesitatingly well i might go as far as fifty rupee nonsense be the rejoinder i will not take a pice less than r 100 after several minute waste on haggle it be agree that asu babu should be pay r 40 on the nail and r 35 more if he win the suit the pleader pocket this first instalment and assure samarendra that he would prove the sale to have be perfectly valid then the trio separated samarendra return to bipin 's house where they pass the day in form plan for further purchase at 1030

would find on examine he book that the appellant be r 1 11 0 in arrears at the date of the sale the collector order he head clerk to produce the ledger account of payment on account of the shibprakásh estate and sure enough they show a short payment of the amount state this be a thunderbolt for the appellant whose pleader vainly try to pick hole in the account but be at last oblige to confess that a mistake have be make the only course open to he be to sue for mercy the collector however be inexorable and indeed he have no power to mitigate the draconian law of sale that of shibprakásh be duly confirm and its new owner adjourn to the bar library to settle matter with he pleader the meeting be joyful indeed after congratulating asu babu on he unexpected success samarendra ask how he have

lowest grade of advocate -rrb- who be hand-in-glove with all the amla -lrb- clerk -rrb- and can twist they round he finger -- for a consideration i give he r 10 out of the advance money and promise as much more if he could persuade the collectorate clerk to cook the appellant 's account so as to show a short payment you see how well he have succeed and now i think the least you can do be to refund the douceur to I samarendra agree and hand asu babu rs 55 prophesy that he would have a brilliant career at the bar he have to stop for a fortnight or so at ghorium in order to get possession of he

request to call at once on a matter of great importance he drive to the great man 's bungalow array in he best but be keep wait for nearly a quarter of a hour in the porch when he be usher into the magistrate 's study he see intuitively that something be wrong he salám be return by a mere inclination of the head and a request to be seat then the magistrate speak in tone of chill politeness : -- rái bahádur i have send for you to say that a subscription of r 10000 be wholly unworthy of you position if you wish i will send it to the secretary of the memorial fund but i warn you plainly that the most you can expect in return be a expression of the lieutenant-governor 's thanks in the gazette i could not possibly recommend you for a title for such a paltry sum poor samarendra 's heart beat

er -- er -- er -- i be quite willing to give -- twice as much so say he await a reply in tremble apprehension it be satisfactory now rái bahádur you be talk sense send I r 10000 more for the fund and i 'll undertake to submit you name to government for a rájáship it will be just in time for the new year 's gazette now you may take leave samarendra bow himself out with precipitation and on return home send for he factotum bipin to whom he relate this momentous interview with a injunction to raise r 10000 more by hook or by crook bipin shake he head ominously and fear that no moneylender would advance any considerable sum on estate already over-burdened however he promise to do he best and negotiate so successfully that r 10000 be procure at 24 per cent in less than a week this additional subscription be gracefully acknowledge by the district magistrate and a fortnight later samarendra 's droop spirit be revive by the appearance of a notification in the gazette thank he warmly for he

the case to a astrologer gobardhan chakravartus be a old brahman neighbor who live by cast nativity give weather and crop forecast and prophesy good or evil thing in proportion to the fee he receive debendra babu pay he a visit next morning and be receive with the servile courtesy due to a wealthy client after beat about the bush for a while he say : my fate just now seem very unpropitious when may i expect better time gobardhan cover a slate with mysterious calculation and after pore over they for ten or fifteen minute he look up with the remark : -- you luck be really atrocious and have be so for more than three month quite true but what i want to know be -- how long be this go to last i be afraid that you may expect one misfortune after another i can not quite see the end of you evil destiny goodness gracious what shall i do be there no means of conjure it away certainly the shástras prescribe certain grahasantus -lrb- propitiation of planet -rrb- process which will enable you to counteract the influence of malign star the cunning bait be swallow by debendra babu who ask : how much would these ceremony cost after think out the maximum amount he could decently demand the astrologer say : about one hundred rupee oh that be far too much be the reply do you want to ruin I can not you do it for less not a pice less i could perform a jog -lrb- sacrifice -rrb- for as little as ten rupee but such maimed rite be quite contrary to the shástras will you guarantee definite result for r 100 ask debendra babu anxiously i promise nothing if you have faith in my ceremony you must pay I my own price if not -- i leave you to fate i have implicit faith in you groan debendra babu who be now terribly alarmed and will pay you r 100 to-morrow but please do not delay the matter be very press gobardhan agree to the proposal but see that he client be loth to go and evidently have something on he mind he remark : -- when a wise man consult a physician he always disclose he symptom

babu reveal he relation with siráji confess that he have bribe abdullah to administer a powerful drug to she and expatiate on the very awkward predicament in which she sudden death have place he gobardhan listen with breathless attention and then remark : you have act rightly in tell I the whole truth i will perform a homa -lrb- burnt sacrifice -rrb- and verily believe that it will have the desire effect let I have r 200 and i will set about it at once debendra babu groan inwardly at the thought of so heavy a expenditure but after all the prospect of escape deadly peril be well worth r 200 so he return home and thence despatch the amount in currency note to gobardhan the astrologer spend about r 5 on ghus -lrb- clarify butter -rrb- rice and plantain for he homa sacrifice and complete it in three day then he call on the police sub-inspector who receive he cordially after the usual compliment have be exchange grobardhan ask how he host be fare thing be not go well with I be

to examine my palm and say when good time be come for I after pore over the proffer hand for fully a minute muttering and shake he head the while gobardhan say : i be delighted to tell you that you good star be in the ascendant very soon you will make something handsome i wish i could think so observe the policeman but it be impossible i have only one likely case on my file and prospects be not brilliant even in that quarter then in answer to lead question from gobardhan he tell the story of siráji 's death -- add that he have decide to send debendra babu and abdullah up for trial but doubt whether he could adduce sufficient evidence to convict they of murder or anything like it gobardhan ask : now why should you lose such a splendid opportunity of make money and see the policeman 's eye twinkle he go on oh you need not appear in this transaction yourself i will do the needful tell I frankly -- how much money would satisfy you i could not run the risk of report the case as false for less than r 100 that be too much be the wily astrologer 's reply mention a reasonable sum and i will see what can be do well i will take r 75 and not a pice less and understand if the money be not pay before this evening i will send debendra babu up for trial very good i will call on he at once and frighten he into pay up but i must have something for myself certainly if you can get r 75 from the defendant you may keep r 15 as commission gobardhan return home take the require amount from the r 200 pay he by debendra babu and hand it privately to the sub-inspector who swear by all the god that he would take no further step against the inculpated man know well that the policeman would keep faith with a brahman gobardhan go straight to debendra babu with the glad news that the homa sacrifice
